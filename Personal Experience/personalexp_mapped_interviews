It was filled up by my grandmother but I couldn’t always be around her. 10 My mother decided to somewhat get her shit together. 8, 10, 11, 16, 19, 20 My dad got into some big shootout in Laughlin, Nevada.  I can’t remember how old I was, but I think it was around ‘88 or ‘89. 7, 13, 15, 16 My mom left my dad and hooked up with this Jewish guy with a hard core work ethic. 6, 7, 8, 17, 19 He would provide for her.  Being a little kid, I just wanted to be a little kid. 14, 15, 20 I didn’t want to pay attention to if my mom was still doing that same stuff that she did that scared me. 6, 7, 14, 17, 18, 20 I remember having a fear that someone was going to put that white powder shit on my lip while I was asleep and I would breathe it in. 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 19 That was a legitimate fear that I had. 19 I don’t think any kid should have that kind of fear. 15 I’m not trying to break your guys’ hearts or anything, but that was the reality of being an eight year old for me. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16 Howard tried.  He really tried to turn things around for me and my mom. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19 AS: Your stepdad? 16 BC: Yeah, my stepdad. 16 He had a really weird, strange way about it. 6, 7, 8 I was bad at this point in time. 7, 10, 16, 19 I couldn’t listen to what people told me to do. 13, 16 It wasn’t because didn’t want to. 14 I don’t know why but I just could never follow rules at this time. 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 I liked to be alone a lot at this time and I developed a passion for reading. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 I was reading big, thick novels about whatever when I was a youngster. 6, 7 At this point in time I’m living in Denver [Colorado]. 6, 7, 10, 16, 19 We moved from Denver to Arkansas and back to Denver, then to Texas, and then to Arizona. 11, 14, 17, 19 He worked for a chain of restaurants, but he worked for the corporation that owned the chain of restaurants. 7, 12, 16 I think they owned Chili’s and all those mall-type restaurants. 7, 16 He moved us out to Arizona. 11, 14 When I got to Arizona I met another kid that was just like me. 12, 15 His dad was a big, mean, abusive alcoholic. 10, 13 We just had this kinship.  We were just good friends. 6, 7, 13, 19 We came to be like brothers. 13, 15, 16, 17 Absolutely.  My mom took him in, as much as she could. 17 His mom took me in. 17 Our addictions started together and flourished together. 6, 8, 11, 15, 16, 20 My mom is the one who turned me onto meth. 10, 12, 17, 18 Right at the beginning of high school, maybe I was even in junior high at this point, I was having trouble with my homework; I just didn’t want to do it. 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 She told me, “This will help you concentrate on your homework.” 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 I don’t blame her.  She still uses to this day. 7, 9, 19 She has never had to face the consequences of her use because of her privileged place in society. 8, 9, 13 She stands behind her rich, white male. 15, 19 He gives her a safe place to do everything in. 8, 11 I’m not sure if he knows that’s what she does, but I don’t understand how he couldn’t. 7, 17 Some days when I would go over and see my mom I’m just like Jesus, it’s bad. 5, 17, 18, 19 I always thought I was bad and that’s how I know I could do more drugs was I wasn’t as bad as my mom, you know. 10, 17 I’m trying to make light of it. 18 It’s just a serious thing in my life. 7, 8, 19 This is the third or fourth time that I’ve told my story. 7, 13, 16, 19, 20 By the end of it I can see people on the edge of their seats sometimes. 5, 7, 12, 16, 19 It kind of makes me feel -- I just hope this is helping. 7, 9, 13, 18 Me and Nick started shooting meth. 6, 10, 12, 15 AS: How old were you? 16 BC: Fifteen.  I skipped the whole pipe thing. 19 I wanted to be high right away. 8, 11, 14, 20 I honestly don’t know how I made it so long. 6, 7, 12, 13, 17 Two years straight of doing that. 16 This is over countless broken relationships. 7, 15 I’m just giving a summary.  Just think of everything that is possibly shitty that could happen and it happened to me. 5, 10, 19 I don’t want to say it happened to me because I did it to myself. 5, 14 The whole time I saw exactly what was happening to me. 5, 6, 7, 16, 19 I just didn’t care because I was so good at manipulation and so good at talking that I would just talk myself out of something. 6, 7, 14, 19, 20 When I was about seventeen -- it took me about two years of not sleeping to want to sleep. 7, 14, 16 Another friend of mine said, “You can do some heroin and go to sleep.” 10, 13, 14 Right away again, at seventeen, I didn’t smoke it; I dove in head first into that addiction along with my meth addiction. 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20 You can imagine what happens from there. 5 ‘97 I started shooting heroin. 6, 10, 15 In ‘98 it was my first offense and I went to prison for four years in Arizona. 8, 16, 17 It’s not the kind of place you want to get locked up in. 8, 14, 20 I probably would have taken any Minnesota prison over an Arizona prison any day. 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20 [laughs] 10 I still wasn’t grown up yet. 7, 15 I still had to grow up; I’m talking like physically. 6, 7, 14, 17 Like knowing that it’s better just to keep your mouth shut; it’s just better to keep your eyes forward. 9, 14, 17 I learned that pretty quickly when I went to prison. 5, 7, 8, 14, 17 There were a lot of really traumatic experiences that happened in there. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 I’m not going to go into detail, but it was pretty bad. 5, 7, 14 I got out and just went right back. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 I couldn’t seem to conform and it was just an easier way. 5 I could inject a chemical in my blood and run around and not care about anything at all; knowing that life is building up and reality is going to come crashing in. 7, 8, 14, 17, 18, 20 At this point in time I learned that you really could just pick a direction and go that way. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 19 I learned to sneak on trains and ride them to the next state. 5, 16, 17, 19 I would hop off and immerse myself into whatever drug culture they had wherever I got off. 7, 10, 13 That’s where I really learned how to not give a shit and hide from myself. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19 You call it traveling but I just call it running. 8, 9, 14, 17 It sounds cool but there’s no word for how lonely I was. 12 And how scary it was that I could just come to and be somewhere that I had never been before and not even realize how I had gotten there. 7, 13, 14, 17 I’m not talking about at some new house in St. Paul [Minnesota]. 6, 9, 11 I’m talking about Bourbon Street in New Orleans and being on the street with people going through my pockets trying to take my stuff. 6, 7, 20 St. Louis [Missouri], man.  I almost want to tell you the story about St. Louis. 13, 14, 15 I really think I’m traumatized. 6, 7, 8 I’ve tried to tell that story a couple of times -- yeah, I’m not going to tell that one. 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 19 I just can’t.  I think it was 2006 when I tried to get clean. 15, 16, 20 I had had enough. 16, 20 I had gotten jumped so many times. 7, 16, 18, 19 I had been beaten up and left for dead because I didn’t care who I ripped off. 7, 8, 14, 19, 20 I didn’t care what they did to me when they found me. 7, 11, 14, 20 I would rip off the Mexican mafia and sleep on a guy’s couch. 6 He would want that free bag of dope he would get if he called the guys I had ripped off and said, “Hey, he’s sleeping here on my couch right now. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 Come on over.  But you’ve got to give me half a gram.” 11 I would get woken up by being pistol whipped by crazy Mexican dudes speaking Spanish really loudly. 6, 7, 8 That was the scariest thing. 14, 19 I thought I was going to die and I really didn’t care. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 20 My eyes were already swollen shut from a fight the day before. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19 Once you get bloody and beaten to a certain point it doesn’t matter anymore. 7, 10, 20 I don’t even remember who but somebody cared enough to stick me into detox and get me clean. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I stayed clean for a little bit and I met this girl. 12, 14, 15, 16, 20 We stayed together for a little bit and I had a boy, his name is Dorian and I had another little boy and his name was Deven. 11, 14, 16, 20 I was still using, but somehow I was providing for them. 7, 10, 17 I wasn’t providing them a safe father to be around. 18 I saw the exact same thing happening to these little boys that had happened to me. 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, 20 I saw it right in front of me but I couldn’t stop. 6, 8, 14 The one part I remember over everything -- you’ve heard this before -- there really isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about this. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 19 During that time I was doing a lot of speed balls, which is coke and heroin. 7, 10, 16, 19, 20 For some reason, I liked how the shower sounded when the rush hit me. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 It was like a tunnel sound.  I was at home with the boys and I just went into the bathroom and shut the door and did my thing. 9, 12, 17, 19 Before I knew it, this had never happened before, my eyes started going like this [shakes hands quickly] and the whole world started going. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I remember laying back on the toilet and waking up. 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 I go to go out of the bathroom and I can’t open the door. 9, 12, 17, 20 I pushed it open a little bit and looked out. 13, 20 Both of my boys had their pillows and blankets and they were sleeping outside the bathroom door waiting for their dad to come out. 7, 9, 12, 17 That is burned into my memory; that will never go away. 13, 20 At that point, like I said, I didn’t care. 7, 10, 13, 14, 20 I didn’t even see that while it was going on. 5 My mom, the insane person that she is, decided that I wasn’t fit to have the boys. 8, 10, 17 She takes them, I don’t know how she does it but she does it. 17, 20 That just gives me an out: 11 my boys are safe and I’m hitting the road again. 17, 19 Just when I was getting my stuff ready to go, I hadn’t quite left yet, Nick, the guy I told you guys about -- we had this ritual. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 At the time I had a ‘63 Lincoln Continental and there was an eight track player in it. 7, 16, 19 The only eight track we had was Al Green. 7 On Fridays our dealer wouldn’t drive into Tempe [Arizona] to give us dope. 11, 14, 18, 19 We would have to drive out to Glendale [Arizona] to get it. 14, 20 There’s this freeway there called the Loop 202 that just goes around the whole valley. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18 That car pretty much drives itself so I would put my arm over there and he would hit me up and then he would shoot himself up. 5, 7, 14, 19 We would just drive in circles listening to Al Green. 7, 14 We played this game where whoever was driving, if the other person nodded off we would whack their heads against the window. 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 It was just this stupid game that we played. 15 He didn’t come to when I did it. 17 I’ve only seen it in movies where people overdose and they have foam coming out of their mouth but that actually happened this time. 5, 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 No other time has that ever happened. 5, 7, 13, 16, 19 I guess his heart exploded because the cocaine was really good and it made his heart explode. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 19 First, it brought him down -- it was just all wrong. 6, 20 I was high too, really high. 6, 7, 8, 11 I missed the exit to the hospital three times trying to get him there. 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 Finally, I got him there and I ran around to his side of the car, but for some reason his door wouldn’t open. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 It had never happened before. 5, 13 So, I ran back to my side, drug him over the seat, and put him in a wheelchair and wheeled him into the emergency room. 9, 10, 11, 17, 19 I ran back outside, grabbed my keys, started the car, and drove around the block. 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 I stashed the dope and everything in the bushes, turned around, and came back. 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 When I came back the cops were there. 11, 13, 17, 19 They put handcuffs on me and told me I was going to jail for, I don’t remember what he called it, but it was accessory to something. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 It still hadn’t dawned on me what had happened. 5, 7 We had both overdosed tons of times, but this time got him. 7, 16, 19 The cops told me, “He’s dead. 13, 16 You’re going to have to call his mom.” 7, 14, 17 I called his mom. 13, 14, 17 It still hadn’t really hit me until I was cleaning out his apartment. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 His mom called and she said, “I can’t do it. 13, 14, 17 I need you to go over there and do it.”  That’s when it really hit me. 6, 7, 8, 19 After that it just seemed like my mom was blaming me for it, my baby’s mom was blaming me for it, his mom was blaming me for it, and I was blaming myself for it. 5, 17, 20 I just left town and I stayed gone. 8, 12, 14, 16, 19 I can’t even tell you all the places I went that time. 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 20 I was just drifting, floating.  My friend Matt, a kid that I grew up with, got a hold of my mom and said, “Have you heard from Brandon?” 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 She said, “No, but when I do can I get him on an airplane and send him to Minneapolis? 13, 14, 20 Or else he’s going to die.” 8 That’s pretty much what happened. 5, 7, 14 AS: Was Matt here?  BC: Matt was here.  He had an uncle or something that lived in Isanti, Minnesota. 11, 16 He came here to get clean. 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 He got cleaner; he wasn’t shoving needles in his arm every day until I showed up in Minnesota to get clean. 9, 15, 16, 19, 20 I think part of his motivation to get me here was because he’s not the kind of guy that can just go out into a city and find dope. 6, 8, 9, 20 I just have that resource, or something. 7 I can just find it wherever that it. 7, 9, 13 I came out here and learned what Rule 25 is. 5, 13, 17 Rule 25 is the first step. 16 I don’t know what about me made people want to help me. 13, 14, 17, 18 I was really more interested in what people had in their pockets that I could get. 6, 7, 8, 20 That’s really what I’m more interested in at this point. 6, 7, 8, 10 I was the worst kind of person. 10, 17 I hated myself.  I couldn’t even pinpoint when I started hating myself. 6, 10, 15 As long as I can remember there was just something that I didn’t like when I looked in the mirror. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 When I was a kid I always lied about myself. 10, 15 I didn’t want people to know who I really was. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 If I saw somebody that I thought was cool I would take some of their story and take that on. 6, 10, 13, 20 I was ashamed of what I had: my mom, my dad. 17 I came here and did a Rule 25. 13, 17 I went to this place called Dellwood [Recovery Center, Cambridge, Minnesota]. 8, 13, 14, 17 They were like, “Well, you can’t get clean on your own. 9, 14, 15, 16, 20 You’re going to have to do Suboxone.” 7, 12 I was like, “Okay, I’ll do whatever it is.” 9, 14 This was when Suboxone was pretty new because I didn’t really know about it. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 Suboxone didn’t work.  What it did was give me a way to make money. 7, 11, 12, 18 At this time you could get twenty to forty dollars for a little pill. 7, 16, 18, 19, 20 I got one hundred and twenty a month.  That became the hustle. 13, 17 I didn’t have to go out and rob and steal.  All I had to do was sell my Suboxone. 12, 19 Then I found dealers that would take the Suboxone and give me anything for it. 10, 11, 12, 14, 20 I still lived out of my backpack. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 I slept by the river, slept in squats, slept wherever I could if I slept. 7, 9, 13 I went to treatment again. 7, 13, 18 I went to the Pride Institute [Minneapolis, Minnesota]. 17 That’s where I met Maddie. 12 We actually stayed clean together for five months. 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 Then head first, right away. 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 We hit the road again and she had a habit of overdosing. 19, 20 She overdosed so much.  Luckily in Minnesota, Valhalla has it, [Valhalla Place, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota] you can get a little bottle of Narcan. 20 You don’t have to hit a vein you can just go for it right in the shoulder if somebody is overdosing and it will bring them right back in five minutes. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 Over and over again this is how it would happen. 5 She wouldn’t overdose for a couple of months and then she would overdose. 7, 11 I overdosed a couple of times between there. 7, 16, 19 I think what really made my decision was I had watched everyone around me die: the kids I grew up with, people I considered my brother, people I knew. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 I didn’t die.  I stayed alive through gutters and shit and everything; I stayed alive. 10, 11, 14, 16, 19 I didn’t want for her to die and me to still be alive. 7, 11, 14 I just knew that was what was going to happen. 5, 6, 12 I love Maddie so much. 17 I was to the point of leaving: 10 “I’m just going to disappear and you’re never going to see me again. 5, 7, 13 I am going to go to treatment and I hope you are going to go to treatment.” 7, 13, 18 I actually went to treatment and wanted to get clean. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 Twenty years of being homeless, not knowing what home feels like. 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 Just the looks I had gotten for twenty years. 7, 16 I’m lucky to even look the way I do after twenty years of this. 16 I don’t have the greatest self esteem in the world but I don’t have shitty self esteem anymore. 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 19 I don’t know what it was. 17 I was lucky to have a spiritual awakening; not everybody does.  I was awake for it.  It happens every day, all day; it’s just whether people choose to see it for what it is. 5, 19 Every day something like that happens for me just to let me know that I’m doing the right thing. 5, 8, 14, 17, 19 If you guys had seen my daughter -- that right there just overwhelms me with that feeling that I never had my whole life. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Now my little boys come here on breaks and stay with me and I have an extra room to provide them a room. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20 I have fucked those little boys out of something that I have given to my daughter. 5, 11, 17, 20 My daughter has never had to know me the way I was. 5, 13, 17 I have been an excellent father to my daughter and she will never know anything different. 5, 7, 13, 17, 18 It rips my guts apart to know that my boys could have had that had I just woken up a little bit sooner. 5, 8, 12, 17, 20 I try not to keep myself in that thought but all I can do now is go from here. 10, 17 I wake up every morning and I don’t stick a needle in my arm, I don’t fuck people over, I don’t lie to people. 9 When I look at a person now I smile at them no matter who it is. 10, 17 All these different things that I always wanted to tell myself that I was I actually am now. 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 I’m actually happy and I actually care about things. 5, 7, 14, 18, 19, 20 I care about myself and I want to help people. 7, 14, 18, 20 I know that it is an uphill battle but all I can do is the next right thing. 8, 14, 16, 17, 19 That’s how I live my life: from one right choice to the next. 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 19 If I lose sight of that in an instant it will strip me right back to where I was. 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I think that’s about the skinny of it.  That’s the best way I can do it. 13 I make amends to people that I have hurt in the past. 8, 14, 18 That’s really hard to do. 6, 7, 8 AS: You’re using the twelve steps? 7, 10, 12, 16 BC: Yeah, I’m using the twelve steps. 10, 12, 16 For me personally I don’t see any other way. 5, 10, 17 If I don’t make my whole life about it in one way or another. 7, 8, 18 My body does this thing where it will try to convince me that I can control it [my addiction]. 8, 10, 15, 19 My body actually tries to fuck me over. 18 My head actually tries to convince me that I’m so uncomfortable that I need to get high. 11, 12, 18, 20 I know it will make me feel better, but you just have to do the harder thing which is to not do it. 6, 13, 17, 18, 19 I just have to not do it one time. 7, 16, 19 I just have to stay clean for today; right now. 5, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I’m not worrying about tomorrow until tomorrow.  That’s the only way that I can do it and I have tried every way possible.  Because I have lived as long as I have -- that’s why I’m clean. 7, 11, 15, 16 Twenty years of misery is enough. 16, 20 AS: And that you survived through all of that.  BC: I survived.  I can still articulate sentences. 5, 7 [laughs] 10 AS: You can still read, you are about to finish your GED [General Education Development], and you have a full-time job. 7, 16, 19 BC: I can still read. 7 I can do all kinds of stuff. 12 I’m actually doing the kinds of stuff that I should have learned to do in life already. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 18 Now I do it and I’m really nervous about it. 6, 7, 8 A lot of the stuff I’m doing today people learn to do when they are eighteen years old. 5, 16, 19 Just now I’m starting to live my life. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 17 I’ve done everything and been everywhere and none of it means anything because I wasn’t really there. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 I was just a husk of a person until I decided to look around and saw that there is life around me and I can participate in it in a positive way. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 18 I try to sit there and think -- I don’t know if this is just the way my mind is -- but there’s no way, looking at my daughter, that there is any way I can do the things I did when I was around my sons around her. 5, 6, 7, 17, 19 The way that I am now it just isn’t possible. 17 I can’t fathom it.  That’s a big shift.  That’s a huge shift.  Never would I have thought that I wasn’t a piece of shit. 10, 13, 19 AS: There is a lot of really judgmental language about how stupid meth heads are. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15 We were talking about how it comes from people in communities that have been particularly ravaged by meth. 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 As a class, we’ve struggled with all the stigma. 6, 12 We think,  Why does everyone write about it this way, perpetuating these myths about addicts? 13, 15 How can we change this whole problem if we still think about people as bad and morally bankrupt? 5, 7 It goes along with all these vivid descriptions of what meth does to your body, that it makes you do crazy things. 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 Do you think that these portrayals are honest? 6, 12 Do you think that they are fair?  Because you just talked about yourself in a lot of derogatory terms. 6, 13 BC: Yeah, and there’s no way to even get the way that I felt across to you guys. 6, 8, 15, 20 AS: Do the stereotypes have a use? 7, 9 It doesn’t deserve to be fluffed.  It doesn’t deserve to be -- AS: What doesn’t?  BC: Meth.  The way some people act.  I think that when people do crazy shit when they’re on meth they have a dual diagnosis. 7, 10, 12, 19 They might have prior mental conditions and then they put meth on top of it. 10, 12, 19 Schizophrenia does two things that I’ve seen happen directly in front of me. 5, 7, 13, 19 Some Schizophrenics, when they get completely high, their voices get completely quiet and they don’t hear anything and they can concentrate. 7, 11, 14, 20 Some Schizophrenics it’s the opposite. 7 The way that this guy described it to me was that his personalities took on different personalities. 6, 7, 10, 17, 18 He had gotten used to his mind the way it was. 6, 7, 9 A lot of it is preconditioned. 7, 12 It depends on the way they are before they start doing it. 6 US1: You talk a little bit about the personal stigma that you’ve faced and how people have looked down on you, or look at you a certain way. 6, 10, 13, 17, 20 Do you feel like people still look at you and behave at you the same way? 7, 13, 18 If so, how do you deal with that based just on the way that you look?  BC: When they do it now, it’s interesting to me now. 7, 9, 17 It’s funny at first I would think, “I know what that guy thinks of me. 6, 8, 16, 17 If he only knew.” 6, 12 That’s my ego kicking in, though: “You’re so much better than that now, and he just needs to know that.” 7, 15, 17 It just depends on the day. 19 Now, I can be sad about it.  At the same time I deserve that. 7, 16, 19 I have twenty years to make up for. 16, 18 I do it in whatever way I can.  There is this lady that cleans the apartments that I paint sometimes and she has a hell of a time getting around to all these places so I get her bus cards and give them to her. 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 Just little things like that that I do to try to make up for the things I’ve done. 5, 9, 14, 18, 19, 20 There’s no way to make up for all the shit that I’ve done to this world; this negative imprint that I’ve left on people’s lives that I don’t even realize. 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19 I just try to be of service as much as I can.  That’s how I deal with the stigma.  I make it a priority to go just a little bit further for a person even if I don’t know them. 10, 17, 18, 20 Especially if I don’t know them because nobody expects a person that looks like me to do it and be smiling the whole time. 7, 10, 16, 17, 19 [laughs] 10 That’s the only way that I can make it okay with myself and think that I am trying to fix the wreckage. 7, 14, 15, 18 There’s stuff that I’ve done that I can’t even fix but it wouldn’t even be healthy to try to fix because it would do way more damage. 15 That’s like the amends.  We try to make amends to people wherever possible except when that would do harm to them or others. 7, 9, 13, 18 I really try to think about things more now. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 19 I’m more quiet; my voice isn’t as loud as it was.  My head doesn’t get held up as high. 11, 12 US2: Earlier you said Minnesota was probably the best place to get treatment. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 Why is Minnesota different than other states? 7, 17, 18 How do other states do it? 17 BC: It’s their resources. 7 AS: Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota], Willmar [Minnesota].  It was the beginning of the recovery scene. 7, 8 BC: I’ve been on the streets in a lot of the states. 7, 17, 20 I’ve hit a bottom in every state and tried to reach for help there. 7, 17, 18, 19 Never have I found it except for in Minnesota. 11, 13 Minnesota really picked my ass up and dusted me off. 5, 6, 7, 8 It is still helping me. 7, 18 I’m help-able I guess; I try. 18, 19 I hope I enlightened you guys. 6, 8, 13, 15 Next time will be easier than this time. 7, 16, 19 [laughs] 10 There are some days when I think the cravings are going to get me. 18, 19, 20 The meth cravings -- heroin not so much -- but the meth cravings are out of this world. 10, 12 They have my hands sweating sometimes. 7, 12, 13, 16, 19 Maybe even a song will trigger it. 17 Any time I go into a public bathroom I get them because of being on the streets. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 19, 20 That’s where you have to use when you’re on the streets. 7, 9, 20 I’m just a survivor I guess; I’m just one of those people that can survive. 19"
"2","Beck_Thilo","Robin Evanson Narrator Sara Ludewig Sam Aamot Interviewers May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Robin Evanson-RE Sara Ludewig-SL Sam Aamot-SA SA: 17 We'll begin by having you state your name and having you say you give us permission to record this. 7, 11, 14, 17 RE: Okay, my name is Roberta Evanson, I go by Robin, and you have permission to record this. 7, 11, 17 SA: Thanks.  SL: It's May 18th, and we're in Duluth.  SA: Do you want to start about telling us a little about your childhood, family, and growing up? 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 19, 20 RE: Okay, well I was born in 1956. 5, 8 I'm sixty-one today. 5, 19 I was born as the last child--I have five siblings--my father was married before my mother and had one daughter, and then met my mother and had four of us. 5, 9, 10, 12, 16 Then when I was fourteen my mother took in a foster child who I consider a sister. 9, 10, 16 We lived in southern California. 11, 16 My mother was from Superior, Wisconsin and my father's from Ottumwa, Iowa. 10 My mom was born in 1919 and my dad was born in 1911, so I was kind of a late child, bit of a late child, compared to my brother's and sisters. 5, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 Being the youngest my next oldest sister was eight years older than I am. 6, 15, 16, 19 I had a niece who was seven years younger. 6, 16 My half-sister was twenty-two years older than me and she passed a few years ago. 9, 15, 16, 17 None of them have addiction issues. 7, 8, 12, 15 Compulsive overeating, but not any kind of substance abuse issues. 7, 9 My father was what I think of as a periodic drunk. 8, 11 Whether he's an alcoholic or not would have been his decision to make, but he was very unpredictable. 7, 10, 13, 18 He had long periods of not drinking followed by short periods of heavy drinking. 7, 15, 19 When he drank he was really violent. 6, 7, 8, 18 Was very physical with my mother in front of us kids--on purpose in front of us kids. 10, 15 He'd get us up in the morning and the middle of the night and drag us into the living room and call her names and berate her. 6, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 Made sure we knew what he thought of her and that kind of thing. 6, 7, 10, 12, 19 When I was five my mom had saved enough money to move out. 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20 My oldest sister Barbara had come to live with us for a while and then had gone back to live with my dad's sister, her aunt, in Virginia. 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 And then she had moved on and gotten married. 7, 11, 12, 14, 16 In fact she was married the year I was born. 5, 12, 16 Then my next sister Marlene had already moved out. 6, 7, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19 She had gotten married. 7, 12, 16 My brother Tom was still at home. 7, 16, 17, 19 He was in his senior year of high school, and my sister Kathy was still of course at home. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 I was in kindergarten.  I think I had just--had I left? 8, 19 No, I was just getting ready to start kindergarten and my brother decided to stay with my dad, which was really hard on my mom. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 It was because he wanted to graduate high school from the school he was in. 11, 14 He was on the football team and so forth. 5 As soon as graduation he enlisted and moved out right away. 5, 8, 11, 14, 20 It wasn't much longer. 7, 20 My mom and I and my sister Kathy moved to Redondo Beach. 11, 14, 16, 17 My mom worked two jobs, so my sister had to take care of me. 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 My sister kind of picked up where my dad left off. 5, 8, 16, 19 She resolved all her emotional issues through violence. 7 Again, it was a periodic kind of thing. 19 It wasn't an everyday kind of thing, but when it occurred it was pretty severe. 5, 7, 13, 14, 19 It didn't really stop until one time she really, really went a little too far and I had climbed out my bedroom window and was hiding in the garden of my neighbor. 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20 She found me--the mother--and she had me call my mom. 10, 11, 14, 17 Of course, back then, you know, you didn't call your mom at work because she could lose her job. 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I had to call mom at work and she had to come home. 14, 17, 19 I have no idea what she said to my sister because that was behind closed doors, but what she told me was she needed me not to make my sister so angry. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 She had to work and if she was going to support us she couldn't lose her job and she had to depend on Kathy to keep an eye on me. 9, 13, 17 She needed to depend on me not to make my sister angry. 9, 16, 18 So, I learned at a really young age how to be responsible because I was going to make sure my mom could depend on me. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 17, 18 I really loved my mom. 6, 7, 8, 17 Kathy and I kind of found our way. 11 I think the difficulty for me with Kathy was that she was one person behind closed doors and another person out in public. 6, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 It was kind of like that Beatles song, Eleanor Rigby: Keep a face in a jar by the door. 17 That's pretty much how it was. 5, 7, 14 But I had a very loving relationship with my mom and with my sister, it just was mixed with this unpredictable kind of thing. 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 I think I learned also at a really young age not to trust what you saw. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 You know, you just didn't know--especially with my father--you never knew what you were going to get. 6, 8, 12, 13, 17, 20 I never knew if I was going to get this loving, caring father or if I was going to get this violent, alcoholic stranger that I had to be afraid of? 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 20 My trust issues ran pretty deep pretty young. 5, 6, 7, 14 Being from that era--being born in '56 and starting to be raised in the sixties--not a lot of kids had divorced parents. 5, 6, 7, 12, 15 That kind of made me odd man out a bit. 13, 20 And their mothers--most of them were at home. 10, 17, 19 Not only was I from a divorced family, but my mom was working all the time. 7, 16, 17, 19 I wanted to be where I was comfortable, so I sought other kids who were like me. 14, 15, 18 Although I was raised very strictly--I mean it was like call the cops, just don't tell my mom--you know, kind of a thing. 5, 13, 14, 17, 19 Not all these other kids were--they were a little bit more...the parents weren't paying that much attention to their kids. 6, 7, 12, 15, 18, 20 Those were the kids that I gravitated towards. 15 They were the ones I felt the most comfortable with. 6, 12, 18 I did a lot of the standard stuff.  I was in Camp Fire Girls, and I played violin all the way through high school, and I was a good student. 6, 7, 11, 19 I spent my years in high school just waiting to get out. 7, 11, 16, 20 I had no real ability to plan or see into tomorrow. 5, 7 It wasn't--I think a lot of teens are like that, but I just didn't know, ""Oh I'm going to go to college,"" or, ""I'm going to do this."" 17 Nobody in my family had gone to college. 7, 19 None of my brothers and sisters had gone to college. 12, 15, 16 So it really wasn't something that was very--it just wasn't talked about much. 6, 7, 8, 13 It ws assumed that I would go because that's the next thing you're supposed to do. 14, 16, 19 I had been working since I was fourteen. 16 I babysat the kids next door. 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 Their parents were hippies, and they came home after an evening with a group of friends. 7, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 I was going to leave and they said, ""Oh, no, you can stay."" 13, 14 They were smoking black tar opium in a big water pipe and offered me to partake. 7, 8, 10, 20 I thought, well, heck yeah. 8, 10 I want to be a part of this. 8, 14 It had nothing to do--it's not like I got high and said, ""Oh, this is it! 11, 13, 14 It's the answer to all my problems!"" 7 But it made me feel a part of. 8, 13, 18 Right?  Especially when you're fourteen and you want to be thought of as older and, you know, accepted and all of that. 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 And it was okay. 14 It was just fine. 14 It wasn't like the ridiculous movies they were showing us at school about reefer maddness. 7, 9, 11, 14 I think, too, it also made me not believe what I was told about drugs and them being dangerous in any way. 9, 10, 13, 16 I was pretty clueless about that. 5, 7, 14 I didn't know any addicts. 13, 15, 17 That wasn't a term we used back then. 9, 11, 17, 19 We certainly never talked about Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. 6, 13, 14 It just wasn't a thing. 19 I think they were more focused on kids not getting pregnant. 7, 9, 15, 20 That was probably the deal. 12, 13 I wasn't really premiscuous--a little too self conscious for that and a little less trusting than maybe others. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 20 That was growing up.  SA: So that was about eighth grade? 19 Seventh grade was a great year. 7, 8, 16, 19 We drank a little bit if somebody got a beer or something, but it wasn't something--we were doing baseball and hide and go seek and running around the neighborhood. 5, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20 Had to be home when the street lights were out. 7, 17, 19, 20 Stuff like that.  I lived in a pretty lower to middle class--but back then even though we were at the beach it still wasn't--people with money lived up on the hill. 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 They didn't live in our neighborhood. 11, 12 It was about--I went to school with about thirty to forty percent Mexican American population, too. 11 It was a pretty diverse neighborhood. 5, 7, 12, 14 SL: Can you tell us a little bit about your high school years? 11, 13, 16, 20 RE: High school. 11 Well, again, it was a real tough thing for me because I was bright. 7, 8, 9, 14, 19 In eighth grade I had taken classes up at high school already. 6, 7, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20 I was a very good student. 6, 11, 19 I had no problem with learning. 5, 7 My mother read to me as a kid and, you know, you went to bed at eight o'clock and read for half an hour and then it was lights out. 7, 10, 15, 17 I learned to explore through literature. 5, 7 Book learning came easy for me. 5, 11, 13, 17 I did really well in my studies, but I wasn't this straight-laced kid who had the 2.3 kids at home and dad working and mom--that group of kids that tended to be in the honors classes and those kinds of things tended to be the ones whose parents were paying attention to them. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19 My mom paid attention to me, but it was a different environment so I felt odd man out there. 6, 7, 8, 17, 18 Then I wasn't a sports person by any stretch of imagination--basketball, but that was about it--and so I didn't fit in there. 7, 10, 17 I didn't feel real girly, so I never felt like I knew how to accessorize or whatever. 6, 7, 12, 13, 18 Probably because my sister was really good at it! 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 [laughs] 10 It was just easier to not make that important because I didn't feel good at it. 6, 13, 18, 19 I probably felt the most at ease in my orchestra class because that was kind of a mix of kids, but didn't socialize outside of class. 6, 12, 13, 15, 18 By the time I was a freshman I started making friends outside of school. 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19 Older kids. 15 SA: Were these people you worked with? 12 Yes, by the time I was a junior in high school--yes. 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 When you use drugs everybody uses drugs. 9, 10 That's what you think.  That's my whole social connection was through smoking weed. 10, 18 My best friends Maria and Shelly from eighth grade on--and Shelly and I were friends from second grade. 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 Her parents divorced, her dad was quite the hippie. 7, 12 He was an accomplished artist and grew his own weed. 7, 10, 19 I would buy like a quarter pound of weed from him and then sell three [lits] and then get mine for free--needless to say I became an accountant. 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 [laughs] 10 That worked really well for me. 6, 7, 8, 12 That was something I did on a daily basis.  Pot was a lot different than it is today. 5, 7, 18, 19 It wasn't as potent. 10 It was just--nobody knew I was high. 6, 11, 12 My mother never thought something was going on. 10, 13 And then I started finding--benzodrine. 6, 9, 15 We used to get little white crosses. 9, 15, 19, 20 Loved those.  Didn't care too much for downers like reds [Seconal] and that kind of thing because I felt a little out of control. 6, 7, 10, 14, 19, 20 I didn't like alcohol for the same reason. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17 I didn't like that feeling of behaving in a way that I couldn't stop myself from behaving. 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 It didn't remove inhibitions. 7, 14, 20 It removed everything who I am. 7, 11, 14 Pot didn't feel like that, and neither did uppers. 13, 18 I did some LSD and some mushrooms and stuff like that, but again it wasn't my thing. 9, 19 SA: How would you say the opium made you feel? 13, 14, 18 RE: I did not start using heroin, opioids, until I was twenty-five. 5, 6, 10 SA: I was just referring to the time when you were babysitting. 7, 16, 18, 19, 20 RE: Oh, that was kind of a one time thing. 7, 16, 19 I mean who could afford black tar opium?  That was not a repeat thing. 7, 19 And it wasn't readily available. 7, 10, 18 At least at our age. 15 SA: So, you started experimenting with marijuana. 6, 15, 16 How did that lead you through high school and past high school? 8, 11 RE: Well, again, everybody I knew was smoking weed, and at that day and age we used to smoke it in the open. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 19, 20 We'd go to concerts and people were passing joints around. 17, 18 It was just a different kind of thing. 7, 18, 19 It's kind of odd to me how it went from being so casual to being so restricted to know everybody wants it to be legal! 6, 7, 14, 17 I can't quite figure out what the whole moral dilemma is. 7, 19 At that point in time it was just a really casual drug. 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 19 I can remember at some point in my early adult--my oldest sister Marlene coming to me and asking me if I could get her and her boyfriend some weed. 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20 She was the one who wouldn't let me swear in front of her, you know? 12, 17 It was a different time. 7, 16, 18, 19 I was still working, I was still going to school, I was still getting good grades. 6, 7, 11, 15, 19, 20 It wasn't interfering with my life. 7, 8 SA: Did you sell for a long time? 7, 16, 19 RE: All through high school. 11 But not--I wasn't a dealer, I just scored for people. 7, 14 SA: And that kind of got you friends? 7, 13 Or not as much?  RE: They were already my friends. 6, 7, 13, 18 It was something that I was not ignorant about people going to jail for. 13 It wasn't something I was interested in--I didn't need the money. 7, 12 It's not like I was trying to be a drug dealer. 9, 10, 14 That wasn't the idea. 5 And I didn't really know 'drug dealers' or what I thought of as dealers--I would eventually know dealers, yes. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17 I had a connection at school because--that kind of thing. 11, 18, 19 I wasn't known as somebody you'd go get something from. 12, 17, 20 I had a very tight inner circle of friends that that portion of it was for. 7, 13 SA: What happened after you graduated high school? 5, 11 RE: By then, my senior year in high school like I said I had gotten in with a group of a bit older--maybe four years older than I was--and they left Hermosa Beach and went to Florida. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 A couple of them were going to go to school there. 7, 11 I went on to the junior high and I was there for about a month and I couldn't stand it. 11, 16 It just did not work for me.  Junior high in California is fifteen thousand students. 11 It was a big school. 11 I just didn't know what I was doing there and I wasn't comfortable there. 17, 18 I was having trouble with my mom at home because my mom had become very successful. 17, 18, 19 She became an entrepreneur and very successful. 7, 13, 17 She worked all the time. 7, 12, 16, 19 When I was a senior--she was able to hire people and do all that, and so she was home and around a lot. 7, 11, 17, 18, 19 My oldest sister--my sister that had lived with me--had moved out when I was ten. 11, 14, 16 From ten until I was eighteen I was making my own decisions pretty much. 5, 7, 14 I had restrictions and all of that, but it wasn't like I had someone saying, ""Well this is what you should wear. 7, 9, 14 This is what you should pack for lunch. 13 It's time to take a bath. 7, 16, 19, 20 Time to wash your hair.""  I mean it wasn't like that.  Suddenly at eighteen my mom is in the picture and she wants to play that role. 6, 7, 14, 17 I'm looking at her like, ""Who are you? 6, 9, 14 I don't think so.""  It began this strife between us.  There was always a little bit of that because I was pretty independent at fourteen, and I could get pretty mouthy, but everybody in my family is mouthy. 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 19, 20 It's just kind of how we are.  Again, I love my mom and we got along. 7, 15, 17 We would do things together, and I was her plus one in a lot of cases. 5, 11, 12, 16, 19, 20 She was a member of the Business and Professional Women's clubs and would bring me in and I would sing and play guitar and do their entertainment for them, and I got to know all these women. 10, 12, 17 I learned to really love women and the friendships they showed one another. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17 It was a Women Helping Women orgainzation, so that was very strong in my upbringing.  So, as a senior in high school and then after graduating I was not prepared to have my mom telling me what I could and could not do on a decision--like I was home sick one day. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 I had a cold. 16 It was a Saturday. 19 I just kind of layed around in my pajamas and watched TV. 15, 18 I thought, ""I've got to get out of here."" 10, 20 I called Kenny and Eileen and I said, ""What are you guys doing?"" 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17 I mean we didn't--we weren't out getting in trouble. 15, 20 It was, oh, we're playing spades and Kenny played flute and I played guitar and we would all get together and jam and smoke weed. 10, 11, 16, 20 That's just kind of the way it was.  My mom said, ""You're not going anywhere."" 7, 13, 14, 17 I'm like, ""Excuse me?"" 9, 14 ""You've been sick all day, you're not leaving."" 19 I said, ""I'm just going over to Kenny and Eileen's. 13, 14 I'm just going to be inside their house. 9, 11 What's the problem?"" 7 It turned into this enormous battle of will. 18 I finally gave in because it came to the point where were about to be violent with each other and it scared me that I could go there. 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 On Monday morning Mom went to work and I went to her bedroom and got out the pass book that had my college funds in it. 9, 17, 19 It was a joint account, and it had at that time $11,200 in it. 7, 16, 19 I remember like it was yesterday. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I went to the bank and I took out $1,200, which I thought was a nice round nubmer and I left her ten grand. 8, 10, 14, 19 I called my friends in Florida and I said, ""I'm coming out there."" 7, 13, 14, 17 I bought a ticket and had my friend Maria bring me to the airport. 13 I left a note on the kitchen table that said: Have gone to Florida. 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 Will call. 14, 17 That was my big 'f' you to my mom. 17 We'll see whose in charge of my life. 5, 7, 8 That's how I left high school. 8, 11, 19 SA: What was life like in Florida? 7, 8 RE: It was pretty cool. 5, 7, 14 I roomed with four people. 9 I rode a bus to get around. 18, 20 They had really good public transportation unlike southern California. 6, 7, 8, 11, 19 I got a job at the court house in the tax assessor's office, which was only a few blocks from where I lived. 9, 11, 16, 18 I went to the clubs at night because you had to be eighteen to drink there. 10, 19 I dind't drink much but I went dancing a lot. 19 I met a boy. 12 He was five years older than me, John, and I thought I was in love. 10, 15, 16, 17 I'm sure for who I was at the time I was about as in love as a person could be, I suppose. 7, 10, 16, 17, 19 I had this unfinished responsibility at home and it didn't feel right. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 After about--not long--maybe five or six months I went back. 7, 11, 17, 19 Made things right with my mom. 5, 8, 14, 17, 19 I did a tecnical school for medical office stuff, or whatever. 11, 18 I don't even remember. 7, 13, 15 John courted me long-distance and he wanted me to come back. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 I told mom, I said, ""I think I want to go back."" 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I was waiting for her to scream, and she just said, ""What is it I can help you do to pack?"" 7, 13, 14, 18 So, I went to Florida.  Lived down in the Keys.  Poor as poor could be because you can't make much money there back in those days anyway. 7, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19 We smoked a lot of weed. 10 That's about all we did was smoke a lot of week. 16 I worked as a waitress and he worked as a heavy equipment operator at the dump. 7, 12 After a year we decided to get married. 8, 12, 16, 20 We got married. 12, 16 Then moved around different places in Florida, and then I just needed to come home. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 I needed to come back to be with my family. 7, 9, 11, 17, 19 I drug this poor Florida country boy back to Los Angeles, and he did not do well there. 8, 10, 11, 17, 19 I got a job at a company--my sister helped me get a job--and I ended up just [makes blowing wind noise] up the scale because the business was growing by leaps and bounds in the telecommunication industry. 9, 12, 16, 18, 20 I was really good at business processes. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19 I set up stuff and I did really well. 6, 7, 8 And then I found cocaine. 11 My girlfriend introduced it to me, my friend Maria. 12, 13 She was single and I was still with John. 7 Pretty soon I didn't want to be with John anymore. 5, 7, 14 I had lost a lot--the quick cocaine weight loss program, you know, so I was looking pretty good and was getting a lot of male attention. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 I was a different person by the time I was twenty-four than I was when I met him at eighteen. 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 And he was already twenty-five so now he's going on thirty and he's pretty much the same guy he's always been. 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18 God, he was such a nice guy. 6, 14 Could have sold him to anybody; I mean it. 16 Get him up on the auction block and--anybody, they'd fight over him. 13 He was just a really great guy. 6, 7, 8 But I didn't understand any of that at the time and I just wanted to move on. 7, 14, 16, 19 I believe, I guess, in serial monogomy. 9, 19 I'm not a player, but I couldn't move on and do something behind his back. 11, 14, 17, 19 That didn't match my morals.  So, we split.  He went to live with my mother, which was another bone of contention because she just knew I was 'going through a phase' and it would all be okay, and he was a hell of a nice guy, like I said. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 But I started doing a lot of cocaine. 6, 10, 15 I had a lot of money, and there was a lot of cocaine, and so was everybody else doing a lot of cocaine. 7, 8, 10, 12 It was a very popular, popular drug at the time. 7, 10, 16, 19 SL: This was in the late seventies? 5 RE: Let's see--when was that? 5 I graduated in '74, so we're talking '79, '80? 6, 11 Almost the eighties. 15 Drinking margaritas, smoking weed, and doing coke. 10, 20 It was the perfect world. 12 It really was. 6, 7, 8 I was doing really well at work and feeling like everything that defined me was work oriented. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18 I wasn't playing my guitar anymore. 7 I wasn't playing piano.  I hadn't touched my violin since I left high school. 8, 11, 19 The other interests--I got this real big ego, you know? 7, 17 I was young, and the administrative manager of a major telecommunications corporation. 6, 15 I was traveling all over the United States, opening offices, hiring and training people--at twenty-five. 8, 18, 20 It was a big deal.  So, I didn't have a problem. 7 I was still working. 7 In fact, this was golden. 16 RE: Then I met Tim. 12 I didn't do alone very well. 8, 12 I met Tim, and he was very different from John. 7, 12, 18 He was much more cynical.  He was very well-read. 7, 8 John was borderline illiterate.  Not intellectually, but his skills were not there. 13 Tim read the LA Times cover to cover everyday. 7, 19 He was interesting. 7, 9 He became a longshoreman. 7, 13, 17 He was making some good money. 6, 7, 12, 19 We moved in together and were living together for a year, and I wasn't telling him about the cocaine. 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20 That was my business. 9, 12 He started coming home and he would pass out on the couch. 6, 7, 15, 17, 19 I thought, you know, this is not my beautiful life. 7, 8, 10, 17 He needs to stop drinking so much. 15, 19 He did, he drank a lot. 18 An Irish guy, definitely the stereotype. 6, 7, 14 I thought, you know, the problem is that we're not doing the same drug. 7, 10, 17 [laughs] 10 If he would just do coke with me then everything would be okay. 14, 20 So, one day he came home. 13, 17, 19 We were together five years--we lived together for a yera and I think we were married for three. 11, 12, 16, 20 It was proabably in our second year. 16 I kind of lose track. 13 [laughs] 10 I don't know the timeline well, but the storyline was that I decided to say, ""Hey, guess what I brought home?"" 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 I brought out a little bindle, little gram of coke, and I said, ""Do you want to snort some coke?"" 13, 14, 20 I've been doing this for a long time. 7, 16, 19 He said, ""Hell no. 13, 14 I don't want to snort that shit."" 10, 14, 19 That's exactly what he said. 13, 14 I thought, ""My secret's out."" 7, 10 It was my secret. 7 I knew at that time that I was probably spending more money and energy in using this drug than was probably socially acceptable. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 Again, nobody talked about addiction back then. 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 They didn't tell you they could cure you on TV like they do today. 5, 7, 13, 19 I looked at him and I remember being just devastated. 7, 13, 15, 17 I thought, ""I'm going to lose this relationship."" 7, 10, 13, 15 He said, ""But I'll fix it."" 13, 14 I said, ""What's that?"" 13, 14 at that point in time I don't think I could have gotten high anymore much because I had been using so long through snorting that this was not working so much anymore. 7, 10, 11, 16, 19 He says, ""Hang on a minute."" 14, 17 He had a rig, he had a tookit.  Well, it wasn't the drinking that was making him pass out. 15, 17, 19 He was using heroin. 10 He was chipping heroin. 10 SA: And you didn't know. 17 I had no idea. 5 Right.  We were very functional.  There wasn't that stereotypical idea that you gain from poorly done newsreels and shows on addiction--or not addiction, because they didn't do shows on addiction--but the heroin addict or the alcoholic was always somone on skid row. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15 It was never the bank president. 7, 9, 13 I was like, man, this is a new way I can get high. 6, 9, 11, 14, 20 I started getting high again. 6, 11, 15, 20 It had just gotten to the point that I was using because I had to use. 7, 9, 10 I wasn't getting high. 11, 15, 20 Well, that--for about a year that worked for me. 12, 16 Then I was just crazy.  I had to have more drugs, I had to have more, I had to have more. 10 He's like, ""You need to chill out. 9, 14 Try some of this.  So, what ended up happening was I would use coke to get high and heroin to come down. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 17, 20 Then go to work and function and do all of that.  It became this back and forth thing. 5, 11, 13, 17, 19 I started embezzeling from work. 6, 15 Not paying my taxes. 6, 18 We were renting a house from my mother and wasn't paying her any rent, we weren't paying our bills, we weren't doing--and then Tim wasn't going to work. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18 It was becoming quite a problem. 7 Then it got to be that I was using coke to get high and heroin to get well because I was strung out on heroin and I would get sick if I didn't use more. 8, 9, 10, 11, 20 And I got pregnant. 7 I'm like, ""He needs to do something about his problem."" 7, 9, 14, 15 Again, I was in such denial of my own--I mean, I go to work everyday. 19 He's not going to work!  This is not okay. 14 How I judged how well I was was I'm about my job. 8 I was almost four months pregnant before I even realized because I was so out of tune with my body. 7, 10, 11, 15 I did go to see a gynecologist. 5 I did tell him that I was using because that scared me. 7, 10, 13, 14, 20 He said, ""I can never repeat this, but I'm going to tell you--"" he had me come back. 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 He did some research and then I came back, and he says, ""Look, I've been in touch with the people from Haight-Ashbury area in San Fransisco, and we don't want you to go on methadone because that's really hard on the fetus. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 We don't want you to kick because we don't want the baby to go through withdrawal. 14, 20 What we want you to do is start to cut yourself down."" 6, 14 I turned my addiction over to the care of my husband. 7, 8, 14, 15, 18, 20 He started weening me off. 6, 15 He got on methadone maintenance, but by the time--again I'm not sure the storyline. 7, 13, 16, 19 He did go into treatment. 7, 13, 18 I did try--I sabotaged that as soon as he got out. 5, 15 I was like, ""No, no, no, no."" 9, 14 You like hugging people I don't even know? 9, 14, 17 This is not okay. 14 This was my first exposure to treatment. 7, 13, 16, 18 My mom was going to the family group stuff. 7, 17, 18, 19 She kept going while we didn't.  My daughter was born hooked. 5 SA: How much had you weened off by this point? 10 RE: I was almost not using. 10, 15 I mean I was using, but there wasn't much there. 10 They put her on phenobarbital as a detox for about three, four days. 12, 18, 19, 20 She was pretty--her health was good. 5, 6, 7, 14, 19 She was small, but she was okay. 12, 14 Well, we knew what was going to happen when we got into the hospital because they screen parents. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 It's considered child abuse. 7, 9 They put a hold on the baby--Tim's mom took her temporarily for custody and then at thirty days we had a hearing. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 We met before the court in east L.A., which was really quite a joke because we were probably the only white couple in the courtroom with a white judge, and all these cases were being called and parents not showing up, parents not showing up, parents not showing up. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 Kids in foster care and stuff. 7, 14, 20 And then we're there, right, in our business suits and grandma and great grandma and everybody's all prim and proper. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 The social worker said we do not recommend you give custody, and the judge was like, ""Are you kidding me?"" 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 These are white people. 15, 19 They can't have a problem. 7 So, they let us have her back full-time with monitoring. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 Well, monitoring in L.A. is kind of a joke because they are so overloaded with cases, so I think we saw her once in a year's time. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 I stayed clean for four months. 11, 14, 15, 16 Went to a program, an outpatient program. 8 Tim stayed clean and then one day he came home and his eyes were pinned and I looked at him and said, ""You better have brought me some."" 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 And we were off to the races again.  I lost my job.  Well, I went in and quit my job before they could find out I was embezzling money from them. 7, 9, 12, 19 I didn't exactly lose my job, I gave my job away. 13, 18, 20 That was really bad. 6, 7, 8 That was really bad. 6, 7, 8 My mother was dying. 10 She had cancer.  She was at my sister's house, and I would go into her house and take things and hawk them. 5, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 I mean it got really ugly really fast. 6, 7, 8 It was probably worse getting clean and then going back than it was before I got clean. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 I think the demoralization was really overpowering. 6, 7, 8 My mother-in-law was really a life saver. 6, 7, 8, 10, 16 She helped my daughter. 5, 18 Was watching my daughter more than I was certainly. 5, 14, 15 Tim took better care of her than I did. 7, 14, 17, 20 I guess she was fifteen months old, and I just couldn't do it anymore. 7, 11, 16, 19 I called my brother and told my brother I needed help. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 My sister tells me that I called her off and on all night long and my brother off and on all night long, and they were just ignoring me. 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 My brother says finally after twenty-four hours of calling me off and on he goes, ""I figured you might be serious."" 7, 14, 16, 17, 19 I packed up Kaitlyn's stuff and handed her to Tim. 13 I said, ""You go stay at your mom's. 13, 14, 17 My brother's going to be here. 16 He will kill you if he sees you."" 5 Because my problem was because of Tim. 7 Everything was because of Tim.  And that was convenient for me.  That was fine with me. 14 They could think that.  I went into inpatient treatment. 7, 13, 18 On my fourth day my mom died. 17, 19 So that was pretty rough. 5, 7, 14 I was lucky that I was in treatment because I probably wouldn't have even known. 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 They were able to come and get me and I was able to see her. 5, 17, 18, 20 I asked her if she could ever forgive me and she says, ""I have nothing to forgive you for, Robin. 11, 13, 14, 17 But you're really sick so you need to stay. 6, 7, 8, 14 Finish.""  I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 16, 20 I was like, ""Take me back!"" 9, 11, 14, 17, 19 So they kept me a little extra long, and then they had--they started--that program was really intense. 6, 7, 8, 15, 20 They had--it was the Raider Program out of St. Peter Peninsula Hospital.  You started in inpatient, and you started outpatient at the same time. 6, 7, 15, 16, 19 Their outpatient program was Monday, Wednesday, Friday. 8, 19 Mondays and Wednesdays it was three hours, and Friday it was two hours. 18, 19 You spent the first hour in--the family members were in their group, and the family went through this whole thing at the same time for as much as you did. 7, 16, 18, 19 The families were in their family groups and the addicts were in their groups, addicts and alcoholics, and then they'd have an hour where you'd come together and they'd do an education kind of thing. 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 A presentation, lecture, movie, whatever. 7 Of course the counselors were all talking about you and your respective family members. 6, 7, 19, 20 Then you would come together in mixed groups. 11, 16, 17, 18, 20 It was pretty--there was a number of people. 5, 7, 14 There were probably fifteen of us in treatment and then all the people who were still going to the aftercare and stuff. 7, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 My family came. 7, 13, 17, 19 Of course Tim was not--he was still using, so there was no way he was coming. 7, 10 It was okay because we did inpatient all day long, then you went to aftercare for three hours--and I mean there was no phone. 7, 12, 14, 19, 20 No magazines.  We smoked and drank coffee and went for walks under armed guard just about. 18 I tried to leave once.  That didn't work out too well. 8 SL: Was it a thirty-day program? 8, 19 RE: It was a thirty-day program. 8, 19 They kept me a little longer. 7, 20 Because Tim was a union guy they gave a five thousand dollar--it cost five grand. 6, 18 Pretty cheap back then, but it was probably a ten or twelve thousand dollar program at the time, which would be probably thirty thousand today. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 There were so many treatment people coming in through the welfare office at the union that they gave them a volume discount I guess! 7, 9, 13, 18, 19 [laughs] 10 I don't know. 17 It was a really good program. 6, 7, 8, 19 That was November, 1986 and I've been clean ever since. 13, 15, 16 SA: Your family knew about your addiction but they didn't help you get into treatment? 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20 But your brother helped you get into treatment. 7, 13, 16, 18, 20 RE: My brother came with my father actually to come pick me up. 5, 13, 16, 17, 18 I was furious, furious, that he brought my dad. 20 My brother--today 5, 16, 19 I have a completely different relationship with my brother. 7, 14, 15, 16, 18 He's become a different human being in his own right. 7, 8, 14, 17, 18 At the time he was very prejudiced, very angry, had no tolerance, patience, or understanding whatsoever in anything I was doing. 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 I was despicable, and he treated me that way from the time he picked me up until the time he left the hospital. 5, 7, 8, 16, 18, 19 I tried to leave, you know, and I turned around and my dad, actually, fronted that five grand. 17, 18 He was retired by then. 7 I turned around to bolt. 18 When it started out it was a good idea. 5, 6, 15, 19 By the time I'm starting to kick and they're having trouble getting me in and it took four hours and I'm getting sick, I--this is not such a good idea. 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 19, 20 I turned around to leave and I ran smack into him. 18 He--I'm fighting him and he's holding me and he was not going to let me go. 13, 16 He whispers in my ear, and he says, ""Robin, it's not that you're a bad person. 10, 14, 17 You're not a bad person, but you really need help."" 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 18 That's probably the only time my father ever said anything to me--and he ended up saving my life because I'd have left. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 SA: How did you maintain sobriety after that?  RE: Well, I am a social person. 10, 17, 18 I do like people and like being with people. 9, 14 The fellowship was very appealing to me. 8 I had been a member of that business women's club that my mother helped charter, and I learned a lot of leadership skills there, which fed into my success in business and so forth. 5, 9, 10, 12, 18 I liked doing that. 9, 14 I liked going to conferences and being with the gals and all of that. 7, 9, 14 The fellowship provided that for me. 8 That had been missing in my life. 7, 8 It was--I was a part of the cool crowd in recovery, you know? 7, 8, 17 That kind of thing. 19 At the time, in '86, at that point in time people were very serious about their recovery. 7, 8, 10, 16, 19 I mean, yeah, you showed up on a nudge from the judge, or your parents were going to kick you out, or your family was going to disown you so you show up, but they stayed for different reasons. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 SA: Have you seen that change? 5, 13 Sometimes a meeting can feel like when you were in high school and they sent you to detention. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 That's the attitude.  That happens everywhere, not just here. 5, 7, 13 But we're smaller fellowship here in Duluth. 8, 12 Now, when I got clean it still was a small fellowship. 7, 8, 12, 15, 16 Plus, there weren't hardly any females. 6 One of the principles we have is called attraction rather than promotion. 13, 14, 17 That worked for me because I was very attracted to being with the men, and not having to deal with women on an equal basis. 12 That was really attractive to me. 6, 7, 8 But, still, I can remember the Anderson meeting was at the Anderson men's halfway house. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 Oh, and I went to a halfway house for four months when I got out. 9, 11, 16, 20 SA: In Duluth?  No, when I was still in California. 7 I used to come back here for summers when I was a little kid and visit my cousins and stay for six weeks and be down in Wayzata. 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 But California.  So, I'm at the Anderson's house meeting and we had it in the living room. 6, 9, 11, 17 There were fifteen, twenty people.  That Anderson meeting is like two hundred people come now. 6, 17 It's in a big hall and you have to go talk on the microphone. 6, 12, 14 It's a whole different ball of wax than it once was. 7, 18 I was a little stunned to go back. 11, 17, 19, 20 I was asked to go back and tell my story and I shared my story at a meeting there. 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 And people were getting up and they were walking around. 6, 15, 18, 20 It was just this kind of disrespect that I think is just a microcosm of our society. 7 You find that everywhere today that you wouldn't have found in the eighties. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19 In the seventies, you called people's parents by their 'mister' and 'misses' Johanson, I mean you didn't call them by their first names. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 It was just a different kind of respect that was expected as a social norm. 7, 18 Yes, I don't--you have to really... 6, 7, 8 Then I came here. 13, 17 So I was clean four years. 15, 16 I got another job very similar to the one I had. 12 I was gone from six in the morning to six in the evening. 9 My daughter was in preschool all the time and I thought, ""She's being raised like I was raised."" 5, 7, 10, 11, 16, 19 You know? 17 I don't want it to be like this. 14 My mother had left me quite a bit of money when she passed, and I made a decision to use that money to go to school. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20 I had never gone to college. 13 I figured then I could be home with Kaitlyn while I'm going to school for four years. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 Then I'll come back--and then I decided to come back here to do it in Superior because A) I have a support system. 8, 9, 11, 17, 19 I couldn't afford to do it in Duluth without working too.  And it was a gentler, kinder society to raise my daughter. 5 My intent was to leave--you know, come back then and be the CFO. 11, 17, 19 I had no intention of staying here. 5, 14 My sponsor at the time said, ""Don't you fall in love because you'll never come back."" 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 And she was right. 8, 14 [laughs] 10 So, when I came here though the fellowship was so immature. 7, 8, 13, 17 Very cliqued, almost incestuous. 15 People were all dating each other.  SA: Exclusive?  RE: It was exclusive.  I don't think they understood that they were.  I don't think that they were intentionally that way.  But just because they had all--it was really tough. 6, 7, 8, 9 I hid out in AA for a while, and I put my toe back into NA every now and again. 11, 13, 17, 19 When I was in L.A., see, you got raised by people who said, ""Work the steps or die."" 5, 12, 13, 14, 16 You know? 17 If you were outside of the meeting filrting with some guy some female that you don't even know would come up and grab you by the shirtsleeve and say, ""Recovery happens inside the meetings."" 5, 6, 12, 14, 17 And would drag you into the meeting and sit you down next to her. 6, 7, 16, 19 And then she'd put her arm around you and say, ""Hi, my name's so-and-so, here's my phone number."" 11, 12, 14, 19 And would adopt you.  It's like, ""I don't know you. 9, 14, 17 But she'd adopt you.  I can remember my sponsor getting a sponsor and her saying, ""We're all going to coffee. 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 Come with us.""  And I said, ""Okay, I'll meet you there."" 13, 14 She said, ""No. 13, 14 No, come with us."" 17 I said, ""I have a car. 13, 14 I'll meet you there.""  She said, ""If you get in your car by yourself you will not come."" 13, 14, 17, 20 She said, ""We'll bring you back to your car. 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 It will be okay."" 14 It was different. 7, 18 It was different in the sense that people adopted you. 7, 9, 18 You just became--and then you were expected to adopt others. 13, 17 You called each other out on your bullship so to speak. 13, 14, 17 Our basic text says we are each other's eyes and ears. 9, 14, 17 If we're not going to be that why do we need a fellowship? 8 But here--I move out here and you're all so 'Minnesota nice.' 14 It's like what do you mean you're not going to say anything? 14 You mean you're going to Minnesota nice these people into their grave. 14 I'd hear people relapse and somebody would say, ""Oh, I saw it coming."" 6, 7, 14 It's like, ""Really? 9, 14 What did you say? 14 How did you address that?"" 7, 9 That did not exist in the fellowship here when I got here. 8 Very minimally.  I kept coming, kept coming back. 7, 11, 17, 19 Finally, I was sponsoring a gal in AA who was--she was a professional, and she worked in an oral surgeon's office and was sneaking drugs from the oral surgeon's office and replacing it with saline. 7, 10, 12, 13, 18 Poor people they were issuing it to.  She couldn't stay clean. 14, 15, 16 She couldn't stay clean. 14, 15, 16 I said, ""You're never going to stay clean talking about alcohol. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 You have to go and be where you can relate with other people. 5, 7 As pretty as you are and as sophisticated as you are, you're a hope to die dope fiend. 5, 7, 13, 14 You are in denial of that.""  I brought her to a meeting. 6, 20 It was a brand new meeting and had been started by some young folks, I mean seventeen or eighteen year olds. 6, 15, 16, 17 They were so excited that we were there, so welcoming and all of that. 7 I thought, you know, this is what I remember NA being like. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 So, I started coming back more regularly. 6, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 Just decided to be the change, you know. 5, 8, 17 I would go to AA to get fed, and I would go to NA to give what I had. 11, 20 Until NA here became strong enough that I could do both in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous. 9, 13, 16, 17, 20 It has become that. 17, 18 I had a really lovely compliment. 6, 7, 8, 17 I have a number of sponsees and I said, ""Okay, I have too many of you to do all this. 5, 13, 14, 18 We have to do a group."" 18 We started a group to work through all the steps. 6, 12, 15, 16, 18 This was about a year and a half ago and we are just finishing step twelve. 16 We are in this little group and there's just--it started out about nine of us and there's just about six or seven of us still. 6, 7, 15, 18, 20 I said something about something and the comment back to me was, ""But you've left a legacy here."" 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 And I said, ""A legacy?"" 13, 14 You've taught us and we've taught our sponsees."" 5 She said, ""I mean I know that it isn't just you alone that created this legacy here, but you're a big part of it of a very small handful of people."" 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 And that is the sad story that at thirty years clean where are my peers? 13, 15, 16 They've gotten well? 7, 8 I don't know. 17 They've died? 17 I've buried a lot of people.  Clean and miserable? 18 I still go to meetings. 6, 7, 12 I still can still service. 7 I sponsor. 13 I have a sponsor who has a sponsor who has a sponsor. 13 I believe in this. 9 I believe that--you know our message is hope and our promise is freedom. 7, 9, 13, 15, 17 Freedom from active addiction. 7, 8, 15 That is my story. 13 NA gave me hope when I thought there was no hope. 10, 13, 18 They loved me when I didn't know what it was to be loved. 17 I certainly didn't know how to give love. 11, 14, 17 I've learned that it's not about what kind of a friend I am. 5, 13 Expectations.  Why do I have expectations?  Why can't I just accept things to be the way they are? 5, 19 Well, that's a character defect that I have, so if I want that to stay in it's minimal status I have to go to meetings to remind me that that's who I am, and that my thinking gets skewed. 6, 7, 12, 14, 20 So I'm not so disappointed. 10 That relationship with my brother at, I don't know how long ago it was, must have been fifteen years ago, maybe longer. 7, 15, 16, 17, 20 He called me and said, ""I need your help."" 13, 14, 17, 18 He says Matthew, his son. 14, 17 Wanted by the police. 17 ""If I don't get him out of here he's going to go to jail. 13, 20 He's got an addiction problem."" 7, 8, 15 He sent his son to be with me for a while. 17 Matthew has some mental health issues and he's not so much an addict as he is mentally not sound, and he's been able to accept that and seek the treatment he needs for that. 5, 7, 13, 15, 18 It's really broken my brothers' heart. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16 My brother called me, and his son went through some treatment and my brother went to family group and called me, and he says, ""Is this Robin?"" 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 Again, he didn't call! 14, 17 And I said, ""Yeah?"" 13, 14 He says, ""Look, I need to tell you something."" 13, 14, 17 I said, ""What's that?"" 13, 14 He says, ""I need to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when you went through treatment. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18 I didn't understand.  I said, ""Okay."" 13, 14 He says, ""Alright."" 8, 14, 17 ""That's why I called."" 13, 14, 17 ""Okay.  Bye.""  ""Bye."" [laughs] 10 And he hung up!  I balled like a baby. 20 My husband came running up the stairs. 8, 9, 13, 17 He thought somebody had died. 10, 17 I said, ""You don't understand. 13, 14 My brother gets it. 16, 20 He gets it that I'm not a bad person."" 10, 17, 20 That was really phenomenal. 6, 7, 8 My expectations of my brother was that I would call him and expect him to be an asshole. 14, 16, 17 True to form he'd always be an asshole. 10 My [unclear] said to me one time, ""Have you ever thought about just calling your brother and saying he's probably going to be an asshole. 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I wonder what kind he's going to be this time."" 7, 16, 19 And just make it kind of a game. 15, 18 What started happening was I stopped reacting when he would be an asshole because I'd go, oh, yeah, there he goes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 Instead of, ""He doesn't love me! 17 What's wrong with me that he's doing this!"" 6 It was just like oh, there he goes. 9, 14 What happened from that was that he didn't have to change. 5 I changed. 5, 6 I changed how I saw him. 5, 6 He had to defend us.  He had to knock my dad out at fourteen years old to keep him from beating my mother. 10, 16, 17 What's funny is that he has changed in regard to how he relates with me now. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17 He didn't want to be an asshole. 14 He couldn't understand why whenever we'd get off the phone I'd be crying. 12, 13, 14, 20 So who wants to talk to me when all I'm going to do is cry and he didn't understand how he was hurting my feelings or any of that. 6, 13, 14, 17, 18 When that stopped he was able to not put his foot in his mouth so much. 15, 18, 19 So those things changed. 5, 6, 19 Those are lessons I would have never gotten if I hadn't opened my mind to it's all about me. 6, 7, 13, 17, 20 It may not be much, but I'm all I think about, you know, kind of a deal. 17 SA: That goes along with sponsoring people, too. 7, 13, 15 I'm a do-it-yourself sponsor. 13 I will not put more into your recovery than you're willing to. 7, 8, 19 I learned that one the hard way. 5, 6 I've had sponsees, new people come to me, say, ""I want you to sponsor me. 5, 6, 13, 14, 17 I need somebody who's really tough like you."" 6, 7, 8, 9 If I sit next to one of my sponsees they'll laugh. 5, 7, 16, 19 Like,  ""She is so not tough. 9 She's not tough. 9 She's not going to kick your ass.  She's just going to be there for you when you need her.  I can't get it to you. 20 That whole you can't lead a horse to water.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink kind of thing. 18, 19 I'm not even going to lead it to water.  You're all grown up.  You want what I have to offer you've got to be willing to do what I did to get it. 14, 20 Otherwise you'll never have it because I'm not doing anything different than my predecessors. 7, 13, 18 I met my husband here. 12 He's in recovery. 7, 8 He's got two years more than I do. 16 He had left and been down in Minneapolis and moved back at the same time I moved here. 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 He got a--was volunteering, was running an aftercare at Miller-Dwan when they still had their program. 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 He was in school for his master's in social work and was an in-take counselor--or a, not an in-take counselor. 11, 18, 20 What do they call it? 14, 17 Anyway, he was a trauma counselor for veterans with PTSD. 20 He is a veteran with PTSD.  Combat vet.  We met because I volunteered there to do the same thing. 7, 12, 19 New each other for a year. 16 Dated for a year. 16 Lived together for a year, and we've been married since 1993. 11, 12, 16, 20 My daughter came to me when she was seven and she said, ""What am I going to call Rob?"" 5, 13, 14, 17 I said, ""What do you mean?"" 13, 14 She says, ""Well, you're getting married."" 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 Because he proposed to her and me.  She said, ""You're getting married so he won't just be Rob anymore. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 What am I going to call him?"" 14, 17 I said, ""Kaitlyn, you've got to figure that out for yourself."" 7, 13, 14 She came back in a little while and she goes, ""I can't call him dad because that would really hurt my dad's feelings. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 I'm going to call him 'pa'."" 14, 17 She still calls him pa. 7, 14, 17 Her friends call him pa. 7, 13, 14, 17 When I went to move to leave California I had fifty-fifty legal and fiscal custody so I really wasn't supposed to take her out of state. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 20 I couldn't find Tim. 9 He was out there using. 10 My mother-in-law had died. 10, 16, 17 It sent him over the edge.  When she was three--he got full fiscal custody because I was in treatment and he had no legal record that he was an addict. 7, 11, 13, 15, 18 Then, I had visitation when she was fifteen months old. 7, 11, 16 Then when he was three he decided to go into treatment so I got her full-time and he had visitation. 7, 8, 13, 16, 18, 19 He had relapsed, and then his mother died. 7, 10, 17 He felt so guilty that he just went off the deep-end. 6 I didn't even know where he was. 17 About a week, maybe ten days or so before I was--I mean I was packed. 13, 16, 18, 19 I was ready to go. 7, 18 I got a knock on my door and it was him. 17 He says, ""I need help."" 14, 17, 18 He was septic.  He had blood poisoning all through his system. 17 His arms were like Popeye arms.  They were all swollen.  I kept him well. 8 Gave him money and kept him well until we could get him in some place. 7, 8, 12, 20 He got in.  He came to my going away party. 8, 13, 17, 19, 20 Signed the papers to let me take her. 20 I forced him to sign the papers.  [laughs] 10 And he's been clean ever since. 13, 15, 16 I think I have four years on him, and I always let him remember that. 7, 10, 13, 15, 16 [laughs] 10 We're very good friends. 6, 7, 13, 19 We made a decision at that point in time that we were both from broken homes, we're both from being made the rope in a tug-of-war between parents and we refused to do that. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 He has come to stay with us every Christmas. 14, 17 My husband and I and Kaitlyn would go out to visit him and so forth. 5, 7 Two years ago he decided--he was fully retired--he decided to move back here, so he moved to Duluth. 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 He can't stand it.  He's leaving, but at least he got a couple years with his daughter and be her dad. 5, 7, 16 That's been really good. 6, 7, 8, 19 She's had three parents. 7, 12 She says she's had three parents to raise her. 7, 12, 14, 17 We've done well, and again I think that's because we all come from the same process. 8, 17 We process our feelings through the same steps. 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 When he's irritated with me he can go and deal--it's his problem. 7 It's really not my problem. 6, 7, 8 When I'm irritated with him it's my problem, not his problem. 7 I get to go and process that and then bring it back and try to talk about what we can do different or whatever. 6, 7, 11, 17, 18, 19, 20 It's made it work. 13 And now my daughter is in recovery because our stories weren't enough. 5, 7, 8, 16, 17, 20 She had to have her own damn story. 13 She never saw any of us loaded. 6, 13 Never saw us use. 6, 9, 13 All of my friends are in recovery. 7, 8, 13 She knew clearly about addiction, and she got hooked on meth at a young age. 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 She is thirty-one now I think and has four years. 16, 17 She's our area chair. 7 She sponsors people. 13 She does all the steps. 12, 16 I guess the family that uses together can recover together too, right? 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20 We didn't use together! 9, 11, 16, 20 I wouldn't say that, but you know what I mean. 14, 17 SL: Any last thoughts? 10 RE: We can recover. 7 There is hope. 13 It doesn't matter why you come. 10, 17 If you don't come you won't hear our message. 14, 15, 17 If you don't hear the messge you don't know that there's hope. 13, 14, 17 I think that drug court has done society a great service because they allow convicts to find a way out that they didn't have when I was younger. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16 That stigma once an addict always an addict runs deep. 8, 10, 15 It's nice to know that women are coming out of their shame. 7, 12, 14, 17 For some reason society accepts males as addicts easier than they do females. 7, 10, 13, 15, 17 ""Good mothers have their children. 7, 9, 10 What's wrong you that you would use?"" 6, 9 Those kinds of things. 5, 12, 19 A lot of shame attached.  It's not about that it's legal or illegal.  It's completely irrelevant. 7, 14 Completely and totally irrelevant. 7 Maybe if they put as much into anti-drug wars or the fighting the legality of it as they put into education and creating fellowships before people have addictions. 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19 That might be a cool thing. 19 It's not happening at church. 5, 7 And that we come from all walks. 17 And that our anonymity isn't about protecting our last name. 11 It's about it doesn't matter if I get here in a Cadillac or on the city bus. 10, 20 It doesn't matter. 10 We're all the same when we walk through the doors. 17, 19 That's why our anonymity is important.  It doens't matter who we are out there. 10 It matters who we are in here. 10 I'm just another addict. 15 Good luck with your project.  SA: Thank you so much.  SL: Thank you so much. "
"3","Berry-Brede_Linda","Chuck Hilger Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 19, 2017 New Brighton, Minnesota Chuck Hilger-CH Amy Sullivan-AS AS: I’m trying to get a whole picture of the people I’m interviewing. 7, 8, 14, 20 Their life story, how they got into the work or situation they are in, and a past, present, and future. 7, 8, 13 The other thing I will say is that I realized on the drive over here, I’ve known this for quite a while, you are the person who got me thinking about doing this, so thank you. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19 It piqued my interest as an oral historian. 7 You told me one time, we were having lunch a few years ago, I don’t even think my daughter was in recovery, and you said, If people don’t get on the bandwagon, if people don’t get on the ride with the changes in MAT [medically assisted treatment] and opioids, evidence based treatment, they are just going to be lost in the dust. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 As a historian that really intrigued me. 6, 7, 8 It was really great this past semester to read all the stuff that I was able to finally read; many of the things you and I had already talked about. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19 So, anyways, I just wanted to thank you. 9, 14 Also, I wanted to thank you for the Minnesota Alternatives [Spring Lake Park, Minnesota] connection. 9, 14, 18 They’re awesome. 7 It feels good to me to have such a good organization being the fiscal agent. 6, 13, 15, 18, 19 CH: Thank you.  AS: We are at Meridian Hills Treatment Center in New Brighton, Minnesota. 7, 8, 14 Can you state your name and tell me you give me permission for this interview? 11, 13, 17 CH: My name is Chuck Hilger and I give you permission to record this. 7, 11 AS: I know some of your stories, and sometimes I might ask you things that I already know, but we are just trying to get it on tape. 5, 6, 7, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Can you tell your story a little bit? 13, 20 Where you grew up? 7, 19 What your childhood was like? 9, 14, 19 Your family life, any experiences with substances, any struggles? 7, 8, 9, 15, 19 Then we will move into your career and life. 7, 8, 14, 20 CH: My youth was pretty uneventful. 5, 7, 14 I grew up in a middle class neighborhood with an intact home and family. 6, 7, 12, 14, 17, 19 CH: St. Paul, Minnesota in an area called Frogtown, or as I like to say, in the shadow of the capitol. 7, 9, 13, 14, 17 It is a few blocks from the capitol.  Frogtown is a really diverse area; it’s got a long history of being diverse. 6, 7, 8, 13 We are on the very east end of that, almost to Rice Street. 7, 15 If you head down Rice Street to the north you will get solely Italian, Germanic, Irish; all Caucasian neighborhood. 7, 12, 20 I grew up at the intersection of those two places. 7, 8, 19, 20 I was raised Roman Catholic. 5 I went to an inner city, private Catholic school. 5, 11 I mean the four hundred dollars a year private school just so we are clear on that. 5, 11, 16, 18 [laughs] 10 I almost didn’t say private because it usually connotes something else. 5, 8, 14, 15 My eighth grade graduating class there was eight of us in the grade. 6, 12, 19 Well, there were thirteen: eight boys and five girls. 12, 17 We were together for most of those seven years. 11, 16, 20 Being in the inner city you wouldn’t think it would be such a small school. 11, 12 It wasn’t because it was exclusive either.  Stereotypical blue-collar neighborhood. 7, 12 Nothing too remarkable growing up. 7, 18 There is a piece of it in the culture and the time of it all that everything revolved around sports. 7, 16, 19 I was never gifted in those areas. 7, 13 I have a lazy eye so my depth perception is off so I couldn’t play sports.  AS: What year were you born? 5, 16 I’m fifty-two years old. 16 I really stayed in the neighborhood until eighth grade. 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 19 After eighth grade I met some people outside of the neighborhood and really expanded my horizons. 6, 7, 8, 12, 19 It is really bizarre in a place where your worldview of yourself is based on your community. 6, 7, 8, 12, 19 Then I went to a place where I was hanging out with the coolest guy in the school: my sister’s boyfriend. 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16 It was kind of culture shock. 7 High school was relatively boring. 7, 11 I started working when I was fourteen or fifteen doing furniture refinishing for a guy across the street. 6, 7, 15, 20 AS: Did you go to Catholic high school? 11 I went to St. Bernard’s high school from ‘79 to ‘83. 11 I graduated in ‘83. 11 I didn’t put a whole lot of effort into school. 11, 19 It was Catholic school, but I wasn’t really academically focused. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17 I had other external interests. 7, 10 I did get into a lot of trouble. 20 I have narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder. 5 Falling asleep is really easy for me. 6, 7, 8, 11 I didn’t know this until I was in my early twenties. 6, 17 I used to get things on my report cards like ‘diligent’ and ‘conscientious’ student ‘when awake.’ 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 19, 20 [laughs] 10 I had problems in high school because people thought I didn’t care. 7, 10, 11, 14, 20 It was more that I just couldn’t stay awake. 14 Narcolepsy is like in any situation where it is easy for a person to fall asleep it is just ten times easier for me. 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19 Excessive daytime sleeping -- so, classrooms; especially if it’s not a topic you’re interested in at that stage in your life. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 I had a lot of problems staying awake. 5, 7, 14 That really colors a person’s world because of the way people think about you. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 AS: Did we know much about narcolepsy at that time? 7, 16, 17, 19 We studied it in psychology. 17 You know those clips they have of the dogs that run around and then fall over? 8, 11, 17, 18 But I slept through that chapter.  [laughs] 10 We did study it in high school. 5, 11 AS: But you didn’t know you had it? 17 CH: Yeah, it just never occurred to me. 7, 13 I was always pretty outgoing, ambitious; I was a risk taker, but nothing extreme. 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 I decided I wanted to go into law enforcement. 8, 14, 16 When I was in high school it seemed like a logical thing to do. 5, 11, 19 Not being one of the ‘in’ kids in the original neighborhood. 12, 15 I took a lot of -- I hesitate to call it abuse, but there was a lot of bullying. 7, 9, 12, 14, 17 That stays with a person. 10, 14, 17 I think that was probably a big driver between choosing that profession. 9, 12, 13, 14 I went into the military police corps army. 17 I joined my senior year. 11, 16 A couple of weeks after I graduated I went off to basic training. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17 AS: In the Army?  CH: Yes.  In the Army National Guard.  I went straight to the National Guard because I thought I’d go straight back to school. 10, 11, 17, 19 I had two years of schooling and then went into the law enforcement. 11, 16 There are some things that happened along the way. 5, 19 First, when I was a senior in high school my high school sweetheart got pregnant. 6, 7, 11, 14 She went home to Washington state to live. 11, 17, 19 That was always weighing heavy on my mind. 6, 10 My daughter was born February 1, 1983 so that was before I graduated. 5, 11 I went off to basic training. 8, 17 With regard to alcohol or drug use by the time I was a junior I was smoking cigarettes frequently. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 The neighborhood bar we could go into and shoot pool, so probably by sixteen -- rarely, never a problem with my parents, never a problem with my school, but around sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. 7, 11, 12, 13 Nineteen was the drinking age in the state at the time. 7, 15, 16, 17, 19 The bartenders knew we were underage but as long as you were behaving yourself and at least someone’s parents were in the bar you’re okay. 6, 7, 12, 14, 15 I still would hang around with that really cool kid, he’s now my brother-in-law. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: He’s now your brother-in-law? 16, 17 CH: Yeah, right. 8, 14 My sister’s only boyfriend. 13, 16 They have been together for like fifty years now or something I think. 11, 16, 17, 20 [laughs] 10 There was really no alcohol or drug abuse. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 There was the occasional binge -- mom and dad were out of town or something. 17 I experimented with marijuana. 16 I was never a fan; I never liked the way it made me feel. 9, 13, 14, 18 It didn’t work for me, so to speak.  I definitely did like alcohol. 9, 10, 14 I went out to basic training, was at basic training for two years, came back home, and moved to Washington state for a couple of weeks to meet my daughter and see if perhaps I was going to be a resident of Washington state, but that didn’t work out so well. 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I came back home. 11, 13, 17, 19 I never thought I was smart enough to go to college. 10, 13, 16, 20 When you grow up in that blue-collar environment where your parents didn’t go to college. 7, 12 I’m one of thirty-five cousins, and I’m one of the younger ones, there are five that are younger than me, but they are all union drivers, union machinists; they are all blue-collar jobs. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 Everyone in my family was, and they all live in the metro [metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul]. 7, 11, 12, 19 My extended family isn’t spread out. 7, 19 Our family vacations meant going up to a resort with our aunts and uncles for a week or two in the summer, which was magical. 7, 8, 16, 17, 19 Believe it or not, it was.  It was a great experience. 7, 8, 15 Ironically these are still the resorts that we have a travel trailer at. 7, 8, 14, 17 They didn’t have travel trailers back then. 11, 17, 19 We have a summer place up there so that is where we spend our weekends during the summer. 8, 16, 17 When I talk to my boys, who at this point are twenty-eight and twenty-nine, my son and my step-son, those are their best memories of growing up. 6, 10, 13, 16, 17 Up with the trailer at the lake and playing board games. 15 We never loved Nintendo or any of that stuff. 13, 17 No electronics.  Just family time. 7, 16, 19 AS: How many siblings do you have? 18 CH: I have one sister. 16 AS: What did your parents do? 7, 12 My father worked for the post office and was a mail handler. 12, 13, 18 He did that for thirty-five years. 16 He did insurance for a year or two, but that wasn’t really his thing. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 He is really one of those -- going to work is really a function for earning an income for stability. 6, 7, 8, 17 He always paid the bills on time, he never extended into debt. 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 19 He squeaks when he walks is all I’ll say. 14 To this day! 19 [laughs] 10 True story: we talked him into buying a new travel trailer two years ago and he said, I’m only going to do this if I can use my bonds. 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 His savings bonds.  Because he had been collecting them from 1975.  They had fully matured fifteen years ago, they weren’t even gaining anything, but he’s still got them. 7, 16 Heaven forbid he ever cashed something in. 13 Then I said that he could have bought some pretty nice travel trailers with that. 5, 7, 13, 14 I’ve been helping him through some of that process. 7, 18 Mom did factory jobs and then for the last fifteen years she works in the kitchen at Hamline [University, St. Paul, Minnesota]. 7, 8, 15, 16 My mom grew up on the west end of St. Paul over on Seventh Street. 7, 17, 19 Her family had a fair amount of substance abuse; alcohol issues. 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 Solid, Irish family: Madigans. 7, 19 Second cousins to the mayor Chris Coleman in the city of St. Paul. 13 My father, the reason for his need or desire for stability was that he moved a lot. 7, 10, 11, 14, 17 Every year it was a different school, that sort of thing. 7, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19 My mom was from a family from five or six and my dad was from a family of five. 7, 17, 19 AS: So they created some real stability that they didn’t have. 7 CH: Absolutely.  Don’t get me wrong they went out and had their fun. 6, 20 They bowled a lot.  I know this probably comes as a surprise that they are bowlers. 12, 13, 17 [laughs] 10 Not until three years ago were they bowlers. 16 Age has finally taken its toll. 20 You could write a sitcom and it would be really boring. 6, 7, 8 Very standard.  Not punitive, just very structured. 7 Monday night was Swanson chicken, Tuesday night was whatever. 17, 19 Dad worked second shifts so I didn’t really develop a relationship with him, but my grandparents were in the duplex downstairs. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16 My grandfather and my grandmother and I were pretty close on my dad’s side. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 My dad bought the house with the grandparents living downstairs in order to provide stability for them. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 My grandfather was a truck driver and a cab driver and whatever driver and whatever he needed to do. 9, 14 AS: You went back -- CH: 11, 17, 19 I went into the guard, and I came back and started school for law enforcement and started having trouble with the narcolepsy working in a security job position. 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 That’s what guys trained in the military tactics police do. 6, 8, 15, 17 It is easy to get jobs. 11, 15, 20 My narcolepsy started flaring up when I was nineteen or twenty. 6, 15 I got my first DWI [driving while intoxicated]. 16, 18 I fell asleep while driving a vehicle. 11, 18 It was on Highway 12 up by Highway 100; there’s a really steep drop off. 6, 7, 8 Now there’s a big wall.  Actually, they dug it all out.  Anyway, I got in a car accident. 14 I had literally fallen asleep behind the wheel. 11 I did blow a point one three -- point zero eight is the legal limit. 10 So, knowing what I know now, point one three is not really anything, but I seemed to be fairly sensitive to alcohol. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 17 I told them I had fallen asleep behind the wheel and that is actually what got me to go in and do a test for the narcolepsy. 11, 13, 16, 18 I was going to use it as a defense. 9 [laughs] 10 It doesn’t change the fact that you are a point one three, but when you’re nineteen you do what you do. 5, 7, 10 That’s how I found out I had the narcolepsy. 11 They started treating it then with a stimulant, which was not an issue for me except I like to drink and I couldn’t mix them. 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 19 I quit taking the stimulants and just dealt with it. 19 It was much easier just to deal with it then than it is now just because of my age and vitality, I think. 15, 17 I have always been a driven individual. 10, 14 I’m always looking for things that are new and interesting. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 19 In high school I did the McDonald’s and Burger King thing. 11, 19 I refinished furniture and continued to refinish furniture for years. 7, 16, 19 I did the security thing, got the DWI and lost my license and that doesn’t go too well. 8, 18, 19 I thought I would try my hand at sales. 10, 13 I became a vacuum salesman. 13, 17 That was my first sales job. 16 My second sales job was raising funds for what is called United Arts Council, which is now the Ramsey County Arts Fund, I believe. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17 This is back when they were trying to buy the land for the Ordway theatre -- don’t look back at when that was built! 7, 11, 17, 19, 20 I had a knack on the phone for doing that. 12, 14 I didn’t even know it at the time. 7, 16, 17, 19 I thought I was just doing the same as everyone else. 8, 10 It wasn’t something that was really satisfying, if you will. 6, 7, 8 But, I was successful at it and I stayed at it for like a year. 14, 16 I got involved with some guys that were running a multi-level marketing business with a carpet cleaning business on the side. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 It was called Music Biz. 13, 14, 17 We grew that into a two thousand person international down line -- when you buy a record and your friend buys a record and you get the idea of the whole multilevel thing. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20 It got so popular that we were on KDWB [Minnesota radio station] back in the day. 11, 17, 19 The state attorney general came in and investigated us because we had so much publicity and so much going on. 11, 13, 17 AS: What was that called again? 13, 14, 17 CH: The name of the thing was Music Biz -- that’s what we called it. 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 We had a jingle written and everything.  I would sing it, but I sing really poorly. 6, 7, 8 I don’t know why it is still in my head! 7, 12, 17 For them I did a lot of the maintaining of the databases, which was quite arduous back then. 11, 17, 19 I think we are talking ‘84, ‘85. 6 The other thing was to maintain the mailing list and send out all the fliers, reminders, and checks to the people that were earning all their downloading income. 6, 7, 17, 19 That went really well until we decided that the two thousand person download was so successful that we should just move to another product and just pick up the pyramid and move it to another product as is, then we would be fine. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 17 That bit of diversification was like trying to move a sandcastle. 14, 20 It just doesn’t work.  It collapsed and we had gotten so big that I had hired a mailing company to do the mailing lists for us. 7 I started doing that. 6, 15 Before that I did do a year or two of factory work. 16 I knew working in the factory I would find myself being very angry for no reason at all. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 It just wasn’t suited for me, which is really hard for a person who comes from a family where that’s what everybody does. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 19 What is your problem? 7 Why would you screw up this job? 7 I worked at an envelope manufacturer. 7, 12 I worked in shipping and receiving and did that for a year and a half. 7, 12, 16 I branched off of that job into this entrepreneurial piece. 7 My drinking, once I hit the drinking age of nineteen, definitely escalated. 5, 14, 15, 19 A lot of it was culturally informed.  I enjoyed going out to the clubs and dancing and all that fun stuff, but I definitely consumed more on a regular basis than would be healthy. 7, 10, 14 Binge drinking, of course, is if it is any more than five as it is defined now. 14, 15, 17, 19 I managed to pick up a second DWI about that same time. 5, 7, 15, 16, 19 I got pulled over for going from a friend’s house to a bar. 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 I got pulled over and was point one zero and they gave me a DWI for that. 10, 18 I was even where I was going.  I was like, Look, there are my friends in the window! 7, 9, 13, 14, 20 They were like, Wave goodbye because you’re going the other direction. 6, 7, 9, 14, 19 Part of that had to do with the fact that I had a lot of driving after suspensions. 18 When you have narcolepsy it is considered a seizure disorder. 5, 7, 9 You have to go see a neurologist, I think at that point it was once a year. 5, 10, 16 He would have to sign off saying I hadn’t had any episodes and that it was okay for me to drive. 14 I wasn’t taking my medication so I wasn’t being prescribed; I wasn’t going to the doctor and all of that. 7, 16, 20 They wouldn’t get the letter, they’d suspend my license, I’d get pulled over, I’d get a ticket, I’d get a warning, I would have a fine to pay, I wouldn’t pay the fine, it would get revoked, so forth and so on. 5, 7, 14, 18, 20 I think that background, too, led to the fact that they would say, This guy has got multiple violations, previous DWI two years ago. 6, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 We should probably do something about this. 12, 13 I want to be fair to those making that judgment call. 14, 17 Of course at this point I was like, I was so innocent! 9, 10, 14 [laughs] 10 They pulled me over because I rolled a stop sign at faster than pedestrian walking speed -- that’s what it says on the ticket. 6, 10, 14, 17, 18 California stop is what they call it. 14, 17 It was on a side street. 7, 9, 20 Alcohol for me can be a real -- I tend to think big picture and over the top anyway, so when you add alcohol the first thing to go is judgment. 7, 10, 16, 19 That’s one step closer to making bad decisions. 6, 7, 13, 16 Alcohol consumption for me is something that has to be closely monitored. 6, 7, 13 At this point I wasn’t really concerned or thinking about it. 6, 7, 8, 10 I met my first wife when I was working at the factory. 12, 16 I did a lot of dating and a lot of going out.  I was the guy that had the constant nine-month relationship. 6, 7, 15 Sometimes I hadn’t even ended the first one before I started the second one. 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 19 That wasn’t a rule depending on how things went. 5, 13, 19 During that whole time I really didn’t have any idea that I might be smart. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 All I have sorting the world externally, what I did, I had an external viewpoint at this point. 8, 10, 12 I did okay in the military, although I had trouble staying awake in those classes too. 5, 6, 12, 14 I graduated high school with a two point something. 10, 11 I wasn’t the guy that the guidance counselor was like, We’ve got to get you to take the SATs [scholastic assessment test] because you’ve got a big future. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 20 I had a low self-esteem. 5 I think I wanted to prove something. 14 I was always looking outside of myself. 6, 10 People that appear to be happy and have it together, who have an external orientation, this is what they do and how they have it. 10, 11, 16, 20 We don’t get to understand the complexity of their world view, but this is how they have it. 12, 20 At twenty-one -- and this is coming up on the yuppie time, the eighties. 7, 12, 15, 16, 19 That’s really an important factor because I thought I had something to prove and was always doing work. 6, 7, 8, 10 AS: But, you didn’t feel like you were smart? 13, 18, 20 That’s why I didn’t go to college.  I figured I would figure something out one way or another. 7, 19 AS: But, you knew you could figure it out. 6, 7, 12 CH: I was a creative problem solver. 7 That was always a skill, but not a recognized skill necessarily. 7, 10 You can’t really put that on an application. 6, 7, 8, 19 It’s great, because you always seem to stay out of trouble just at the last minute, escape harm’s way at the last minute. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 You are just one step ahead of the next situation. 7, 12, 16, 19 Always drawn to the exciting fast lane.  I was in my early twenties. 6 I was generally really stable. 6, 7, 8, 18 My parents owned the duplex and my grandparents had moved out. 7, 11, 12, 14 When I was a sophomore and junior in high school working at McDonald’s I met a guy a couple of years older than me who had moved here from Flint, Michigan to live with his older brother and have better options here in Minnesota. 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 We became friends and we are still close today. 5, 6, 7, 13, 17, 19 We lived downstairs in my parents’ duplex. 7, 11, 12, 16 This is the kind of guy that you live with for five years and you never have a fight. 6, 11, 13, 16 It’s just like that.  Maybe over who ate the last piece of pizza, but that’s about it.  Reasonably stable. 17, 18 I did the factory job, met my future wife, doing these entrepreneurial jobs which doesn’t do much for the cash flow. 7, 12, 15 Keeping things going whichever way I could. 5, 19 In ‘85, ‘86 the small business I was involved with closed down. 6, 9, 12, 13 The guy that had been doing our mailings offered me a job selling mailing services. 6, 7, 9, 19 Labeling mailing services and stuff like that.  I thought, Okay, why not. 10 It was a straight commissioned job, of course, and I took that and grew that over the next four years pretty successfully into specialty services. 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 19 We had a niche there.  This was before inkjet printers, so we would do what looked like a typed envelope, but we had a machine process for getting it done. 13, 15, 20 It was a very expensive thing to have done, but we would have like two million piece mailings from American Express. 7, 19 I got in with some other companies like I.C. Systems, which also does mail.  I went out to San Francisco and landed a big American Express account. 7 I’m like twenty-four and this is the only time I’ve been on a plane is to go to basic training and back. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 19 This is a guy who thinks he’s not very smart; I knew I was street savvy and can get by and figure things out. 5, 6, 7, 12, 19, 20 I did that until that person doing that business wasn’t paying taxes. 6, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18 I got a letter in the mail at the office that he owed payroll taxes. 18 I took that product line I had developed and I moved it to a large agency in downtown Minneapolis. 11, 14, 15 I sold them on the idea of it and sold it to a couple of employees and went and did that. 5, 7, 16 They washed me out pretty quick. 5, 7, 14 I learned the difference between a small family owned business that was just getting off the ground to working in the corporate environment where you actually have to produce and so forth and so on. 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20 Some of the accounts and the markets were just at that next level where you were working with those ad agencies and big players. 9, 15, 16, 19 While I had done well working in the direct marketing group in the Twin Cities -- I had a lot of connections and knew a lot of people -- it wasn’t amounting to enough work so after nine months they let me go. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20 At that point, it was ‘89 and my future wife and I had a child in ‘88, my son Steven. 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 He was a year and a half old. 16 My wife still worked in the envelope factory. 7, 12 I got this really good job and they gave me a really big signing bonus and nine months later it was all gone. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19 We went out and had bought a house. 9, 11 There was a lot of stress at that point. 7, 10 I had also got a job at the post office at the bulk mail center and I was doing ten-key and I’m not a ten-key person. 10, 17, 18 I only did that for a short time but I knew that wasn’t going to work. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 A lot of mild chaos.  Occasional drug use. 9, 10 I had tried cocaine at that point a couple of times. 7, 10, 16, 19 Nothing that had amounted to anything. 12 I didn’t even get it, so to speak. 20 Alcohol was still an issue from time to time. 7, 16, 19 Binge drinking again, not black out drinking or anything. 15, 19 Still struggling with the driving issues because I am supposed to be going to the doctor’s and I’m not. 7, 14, 18, 20 AS: This is almost ten years later! 5, 15, 16 When I lost the job at the downtown Minneapolis firm I opened up my own practice because I thought that would be a good idea. 5, 6, 10, 19, 20 I opened up this small, broker advertising letter shop. 12, 20 I didn’t actually do the work, but I brokered all the services. 7, 18 I had brokered so many services for so many years and putting all these packages together that I knew most of the printers in town, I knew all the mail shops, I had all the connections. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 It was just a matter of landing the accounts. 10 Quite frankly it went really well for the first year. 6, 7, 8, 16 I made one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand dollars worth of business. 9, 12, 13, 18 Thirty percent of that was what I got to take home and that was more than enough. 16, 17, 19, 20 Ultimately, I kept growing the accounts I was making over about a year and a half to two year period. 16, 19 We are now at 1989, 1991. 17 The Gulf War has broken out, the economy is taking a dump, and things aren’t necessarily going to great. 5, 7, 8, 19 I land a big account out of Mason City, Iowa to do Who’s Who mailings. 17 If you send fifty bucks you can be in the book.  Those mailings typically go out typically in one hundred thousand pieces and they want a high end product, which is what I specialized in. 11, 14, 17 The nice thing about doing a high end product is that you always have a market. 10, 11, 14, 19 I did that mailing and got it out.  Ultimately, they didn’t pay. 18, 19 My normal vendors who had done the job were like, We can’t keep doing your bread and butter jobs. 7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18 Now we’ve got this big one hanging out there and it’s all this money. 5, 7, 12 They put their attorney’s on the company. 19 We all worked it out, but ultimately it was the end of that business. 9, 12, 19 That was hard. 6 There were a lot of technology changes; email is coming along, the Internet was just hitting the market. 5, 7, 15, 19 There were a lot of changes there. 5 As my business declined my drinking really took off. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19 As did spending money on things like pull tabs or gambling. 5, 7, 12, 19 That impulsive kind of stuff took over.  I had bought a townhome with my wife as the business had taken off. 9, 12, 17, 19, 20 I was always doing things slightly on the sly. 5, 10, 19 I was contracting -- it was assumable. 18 I think I made one payment for the year and a half that I was in the house. 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 It took them like a year to get you out. 16, 20 I think 1991 I still had a job with the post office and started carrying mail for the post office as a letter carrier. 6, 7, 14, 15, 18 I was backing out the garage and I slid into a parked car. 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 I actually had my license for a few years at that point. 10, 16, 18 It was an icy slope and I hit a car so I lost my job. 14, 19 I had some friends who were hanging cable up in Brainerd so I went to Brainerd and was installing cable systems. 5, 7, 13, 18 Apparently I was a cable specialist now. 7, 17, 18 Climbing up ladders.  I was up in Brainerd on February fourteenth, my ex-wife has a flair for the -- that was when she moved out of the house with the kids. 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 We had a son together and she had had two boys. 11, 16, 17, 20 For the last six years we had been together so I had been raising them. 11, 16, 20 One was six months old when we got together. 11, 16, 20 The other one was three. 12 They were eight, six, and our son was in preschool. 7, 11, 17 That gives you an idea. 5, 11 That was a huge turning point for me because that was such a loss. 10 That external focus, you know, if you have a nice house, two-car garage, then you are doing okay because that’s how it would appear. 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17 I really struggled to have all that stuff and it all collapsed. 6, 7, 8 The drinking took off. 15, 19 AS: Had you been struggling in your marriage? 15 Did that come to a surprise for you? 17 CH: I really think it was that this is the pattern that people follow. 6, 7, 8 Not that I did any of it in the right order. 8, 14 You don’t have a baby, then graduate high school, then go into the service, then have another baby, then buy the house, then get married. 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 All this time the relationship with my daughter is they come out or I go out once a year, send birthday cards, and that was about it. 5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 She had a great stepdad that she called dad; I was more of the stepdad. 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 We kept the connection but it wasn’t really deep. 6, 7, 8, 18 Her stepdad was great. 7, 8, 16 I lost the two boys I had been raising, I lost the house, and still we didn’t get divorced. 7, 9, 11, 17, 20 We struggled.  She was very conservative about how she went about things. 5, 19 I was much more like, We will figure it out, it will work out. 7, 9, 14 Her belief was that as I excelled or did well or did less well in business -- she was still working at the factory -- she was being left behind. 7, 8, 9, 12, 19 Marketing and advertising is all this stuff, even back then: five hundred dollar suits, thousand dollar briefcases. 11, 12, 17, 19 That was just a big issue for us. 7 She had met a guy at work that was the picture of stability. 6, 7, 12 He was a single guy, farmer family, Somerset, Wisconsin. 6, 7, 9, 19 Just the epitome of stability and whatever.  For her it was the right move at that time. 7, 8, 14, 16, 19 After that, I think it took me two weeks to get my third DWI. 16, 20 I’m trying to think of what year it was. 16 It was three DWIs in ten years. 16 I blew a point one three again. 10 I got pulled over because I was doing fifty-five and I passed a state trooper at one thirty in the morning. 9, 17, 18 He said, You should know that if you are ever on the freeway at one thirty in the morning you should never pass a state trooper. 7, 9, 13, 14, 17 I said, I was doing fifty-five. 13, 14 He said, I know, I was doing fifty and you passed me. 9, 13, 14, 17 Did you hear me? 14 You should never pass a state trooper at one thirty. 13, 17 [laughs] 10 I didn’t do anything wrong, I just got pulled over. 6, 18 The post office called back and said, You’re right. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 We made a mistake. 13, 20 Here’s a bunch of back pay for the year. 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 I had gone to the union and said it was an accident because it was on the ice. 13, 14 It was their truck, in their driveway, in their parking lot. 14 Anyway, now I don’t have a license. 17, 18 You can’t be a mail carrier without a license. 14, 18 Anyway, somebody had introduced me to cocaine in the crack form, which I had never tried before. 10, 13 I was off to the races.  That put me in all kinds of circles. 12, 19 From the time I was twenty-eight until I was thirty-one it was just one big go. 7, 16, 19 Having grown up and living where I grew up at the crosshairs of Rice Street and Frogtown I had plenty of gang affiliated members that I could be around by going to certain places. 6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 Then I had all my friends on Rice Street who didn’t have access to crack at that point, which was largely an African American gang thing. 7, 10, 13, 19 For the next year and a half it was pretty interesting. 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 19 Parents of the kids who were in the gangs -- the gangs who were burning down those houses and killing families; I never really thought twice about it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 I didn’t get excited about being caught up in the mix because for some reason it doesn’t really faze me much. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 20 I had an acquaintance in the escort service so I drove escorts around. 18 I would drive them to their appointment and wait in the car. 10, 14 A whole nefarious group of people. 9, 18 AS: Are you saying these are things that you wouldn’t normally do, but since you were using you were doing? 5, 10, 14, 18, 19 CH: I would do those things to be able to continue to use. 5, 9, 18, 19 I didn’t have any regular income. 7, 17 I was refinishing furniture again. 7 I would work for three days, make three or four hundred dollars, then go and light crack. 18, 19 Then use and sell, use and sell, use and sell for three or four days. 9, 18, 19 Then go work for three days. 18, 19 I probably kept that pattern up for quite some time. 7, 12, 13, 16, 19 AS: Did your parents ever know? 7, 12, 13, 17 My parents never knew. 6, 7, 12, 13 My best friend, he was the best man at my wedding, never knew. 6, 12, 13 I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this. 13, 16 AS: Would you disappear for a few days? 18, 19 CH: There was no disappearing because it was just me.  My children are with my ex-wife; I would have my son every other weekend. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 I never used when I had my son because he was there. 9, 13, 17 That was the arrangement her and I worked out -- that standard every other weekend. 12, 16 I wasn’t paying child support at that time. 6, 7, 9, 16, 18, 19 I would use several days in a row and it didn’t matter the day of the week. 9, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19 It was a lot of gang activity.  You start selling to support your habit and you find yourself in a lot of interesting groups and around a lot of interesting people. 6, 7, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20 I tend to be fairly loud and outgoing, which culturally fits better with more of an aggressive African American male stance, so I never had a problem finding a comfortable spot in that group. 7, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18 I did look a little bit like a cop, so people would sometimes challenge me to smoke their drugs to prove I wasn’t a cop -- which I was completely fine with. 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 Are you convinced yet, because if not I can do some more of it! 15 There was a point when I was losing my advertising business and I was starting to get into cocaine and my wife had gone. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 20 I could get off the plane at five o’clock in my suit, drive home, throw on a pair of jeans and a hoodie, and be down on the block in a completely different lifestyle. 7, 8, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 I was just really a chameleon. 6, 7, 8 No real sense of identity or way of things that had to be any particular way. 5, 7, 8, 9, 19 AS: What were you going to tell me that you said you have never told? 13, 14, 16 CH: It was my wife who told me that I was smoking crack. 10, 12, 13, 16 AS: What do you mean?  CH: Well, the first time I used was with these friends of mine. 7, 9, 13, 16, 19 They said, Try this! 13, 14 I knew it was cocaine and I knew we were smoking cocaine, but I didn’t know it was crack. 6, 10, 12, 17 It just really hadn’t hit where crack was -- AS: It was the media. 6, 7, 8, 19 CH: The media to a degree. 7, 19 It was like, What do you mean painkillers are just like heroin? 9, 10, 14 You know what I mean? 17 It was like, That is cocaine. 9, 10, 14 What’s fascinating is that she is this person that never did any drugs. 10, 13, 17 She liked to drink but she never did any drugs or anything. 9, 10, 13, 14, 19 She is the person that schedules what times the kids get up and what time they put their shoes on and what time they are standing at the door. 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 She’s very organized and structured. 7 The opposite of me, I guess. 7, 19 She was like, You realize that’s crack? 7, 9, 14 I had heard about crack but I didn’t know what it was. 7, 14, 17 I know that sounds silly. 17 For somebody who’s fairly street smart, who is used to being in the mix -- I’ve got friends who are Hells Outcast on Rice Street. 7, 9, 13, 20 They’ve been long time gang members. 7, 16, 19 Many notorious names and people that I know and still run into from time to time in different places. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Then the whole gang thing. 19 I think in the first couple of weeks I told her. 7, 13, 16 She said, What did you spend your money on? 7, 12, 13, 14 Well, somebody gave me this drug. 10, 18 You realize that’s crack? 7 I didn’t, but it’s funny that she enlightened me. 8 I don’t think I’ve ever shared that with anybody. 7, 13 The kind of thing you wouldn’t want to admit. 14, 19 She was from Blaine.  [laughs] 10 AS: Are we in the eighties or nineties? 15 CH: The business went down in ‘92 so this is starting in late ‘91. 5, 6, 9, 12 AS: So kind of early in what came to be the so-called crack epidemic? 6, 13, 14, 17 CH: Yeah, yeah. 8 For Minnesota it certainly was. 14 It was never here like it was -- like we think of the crack epidemic you think of it more in the phase that it was in in Los Angeles. 13 It just never hit that level of height over here. 9, 13, 19 There were a couple of close calls I had with houses where we were moving dope. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 One of the big gangs in St. Paul, part of the Disciples, had a major connection. 8, 18 Because the kids were in the gangs and this was the stepdad of one of the kids in the gang, we could essentially get access to as much as we wanted. 14, 15, 16, 20 He had the connection so I did more of the driving and the facilitating, so forth and so on. 5, 18 It wasn’t anything that I ever got compensated well for. 8, 13 They were moving a fair amount of weight and that drew some attention. 6, 7, 12 There were a couple of federal cases. 7, 12 There was actually a book written about it. 18 A house fire on Lawson [Avenue] in St. Paul where five kids died. 7, 9, 11, 15, 17 One was Andre Coppage and his brother Lester. 7, 15, 16 Anyway, there is a whole book written about that group. 18 They waited five or six years to prosecute on that. 14, 16 They gathered them from around the country. 7, 10 There were big articles from around the country about how they brought all these people back from Florida. 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 I think this book is called ‘The Red Light’ [Code of Silence: The Andre Coppage Story by Ann Lee] or something. 7, 13, 14, 15, 17 It has been a while since I read it. 7 Some really fascinating stuff. 6, 7, 8 That is the level. 9 You have a lot of low-level gang stuff, but this was where people were killing people and fire bombing houses. 7, 9, 11 The person’s whose car they used was a friend of mine. 9, 10, 13, 14, 17 They traded his car for the night for some crack cocaine. 10, 14, 19 He had lost his car behind that. 14 I was right on the edge of being really deep in. 6, 7, 8, 14 I was at the house on a regular basis. 7, 9, 11 I was never caught up in it like that. 13 I got caught coming out of a house one night after a party. 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 Of course, no driver’s license because we are back to that again. 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 AS: But you are still driving around? 7, 18 CH: Of course.  At what point do you need to stick your driver’s license into the car to make anything run? 8, 9, 10, 14, 18 [laughs] 10 When they solve that problem, then it’s golden. 7, 16 Until then, I’ve got my keys.  I came out of a house one night, it was a prostitution house, and we had been partying and the police were in the alley where my car was parked. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I didn’t have anything on me but they put me in the back of the squad. 11, 17, 19 There are now people standing on the back of this porch because I’m out in the alley in the squad. 11, 17, 19 There was a female officer and a male officer. 11, 18 They asked me all these questions like, Who is inside? 9, 14, 15 You know that is a known prostitution and drug house. 9, 10, 11, 12, 17 No, I met this girl named Tammy at the bar and she said this is where she wanted to go so this is where I brought her. 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 They knew that was my car back there and they said, You’re going to get in your car and go home, right? 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 I said, Yeah, absolutely. 13, 14 They let me out of the car and the woman cop gets out -- she was in the passenger seat -- and lets me out. 14, 17, 20 I wasn’t cuffed.  She goes, God, Chuck.  Good to see you again! 5 Thanks for all the information.  [laughs] 10 Just to mess with me.  She must have really bought that I wasn’t from the area. 6, 7, 8 AS: To throw you under the bus in front of everybody.  CH: It didn’t get me in any trouble because the people over there knew me. 6, 12, 20 This is just a really interesting time with interesting people. 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 19 A lot of pain and a lot of suffering.  I have seen a lot of really ugly things. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 19 I never got really caught up in the criminality of it, thank God. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 Excuse me, other than selling drugs. 9, 10, 19 That continued for some time. 7, 16, 19 I was still going to the bar and drinking regularly. 7, 12, 15, 19 I had a steady girlfriend and we were out one night and we were pulled over because we were waiting for someone to run in and pick up some drugs. 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19 A squad had seen me and run my plates and pulled up on me. 5, 8, 13, 18 I’m driving after license cancellation -- three DWIs -- inimical to public safety [DAC-IPS]. 11, 18 A cancelled IPS is what they refer to that as. 7, 20 There is no way out of this.  I’m going to the ADC -- adult detention center.  At that point in my life I wasn’t good at being alone or standing still for any amount of time -- let alone in a six by six foot room having no control. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19 I called a buddy of mine who agreed to bail me out. 7, 13, 14, 17 He was the one I had been working on the furniture with since I was fourteen and now I’m thirty-one years old. 7, 12, 16, 17 He came and bailed me out. 13, 17 It was six thousand dollars. 18 The bond was six hundred bucks so he paid that. 8 This is a guy who still goes to Latin mass. 6, 7 [laughs] 10 Do you know what I mean? 17 He won’t wear shorts because if some woman were to have sexual thoughts about him he would be responsible. 7, 10 This is my world. 12 This is old school. 11, 16 CH: This is old school. 11, 16 Anyways, he was the guy you could never do wrong by. 6, 13 There was one other time when they had brought me in on a driving after cancellation -- they got me one other time -- I was down in Ramsey County ADC and they said, All the guys going to Hennepin County stand on the left side of the room, which was where I was supposed to go. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 For the guys they were going to let go stand on the right side of the room. 6, 8, 9, 14, 15 I stood on the right hand side, they handed me my shoelaces on the way out the door and I was gone. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17 They weren’t going to let me go this second time -- they were onto me. 7, 16, 19 I couldn’t have my friend give me the six grand. 11, 13 I just could never do that. 13 I went to court.  I had three DWIs in ten years, I’ve got all kinds of driving violations, and I have no license. 12, 16, 18 The judge told me I was going to do thirty days. 13, 16, 18, 19 He said, If you ever want your license back you need to go to treatment. 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 If you don’t complete treatment you can’t get your license back. 7, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 I won’t go into detail but there are a number of other business things that I had done. 5, 9, 12, 14, 19 I was trying to work my way back into sales. 11, 17, 19 I took a job selling satellite dishes for a year and a half down in Winona. 9, 13, 16, 19 Driving back and forth. 5, 11, 17, 19 I had done a number of things. 5, 14, 19 I did asbestos removal for a year because that paid pretty well. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16 AS: When you say you have always worked you have always worked. 10, 12, 14 CH: I have always worked. 10, 12 I have never collected a day of unemployment in my life. 7, 8, 13, 19 I have always had at least one job and sometimes two. 7, 10, 12, 16, 19 There were just a variety of other experiences thrown in there while I was trying to get out of that drug lifestyle. 7, 8, 10, 15, 20 I knew it wasn’t going anywhere. 6, 7, 12 I knew I wasn’t going to make a living out of furniture refinishing. 6, 7, 12, 18 It was the base.  Then I would try to do this and that.  The judge told me I needed to go to treatment if I wanted to get my license back ever. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 That is what got me in.  December 1994.  One of the most devastating things I remember was Christmas of 1994 5, 7, 13, 15, 19 I had spent all of the money that I saved up for Christmas presents on drugs. 7, 10, 12 I managed to gather up some more to buy Christmas presents again, but just that hopeless feeling. 7, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20 December of ‘94 I was about done. 12 My court date was in January of ‘95, so I went into court and the judge said do this alcohol drug assessment. 10, 13, 14 My previous 7 DWIs they had told me I had to go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meetings. 6, 12, 13, 16 I had to do two days in Lino Lakes doing their education program. 8, 18, 19 It’s not like I hadn’t had plenty of consequences. 9, 14 I went in this side room with this young lady that was the assessor and she asked me -- I swear to God it wasn’t more than six questions. 6, 9, 15 She came back and said that I had alcohol abuse whatever. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 Of course I didn’t say anything about the cocaine because why would I? 10, 14 The judge said, Yeah, you have to go to treatment. 7, 13, 14, 18 I said, I can’t pay for treatment. 7, 13, 14, 18 He said that there was something called Rule Twenty-five. 13, 14, 17 I said, I’ll do that and he gave me thirty days. 13, 14, 18, 19 I went and did my thirty days. 18, 19 I really like playing darts. 6, 7, 8 I had thirty days but I got out on work release because I told them I was still refinishing furniture. 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 I would hang out at the shop even if there wasn’t work. 5 On dart nights I would still go to the bar and play darts, ankle bracelet and all. 7, 12, 19 But I wasn’t drinking! 15, 19 In case they came because they could come and test you at any time. 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 I wanted to do my assessment and then go from the end of my thirty days right into treatment. 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 I knew the only way to get into treatment was to get them to know it was bad enough to get a Rule Twenty-five. 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20 I went in there and I spilled my guts.  I may have even enhanced a little bit to make sure I would get in. 7, 18, 20 If I came out of the Rule Twenty-five and they said I didn’t need treatment, then what the hell am I going to do? 7, 13, 14, 17, 18 Because I couldn’t get my license back. 11, 17, 18, 19, 20 I went in there and did a Rule Twenty-five.  They gave me fourteen days inpatient treatment and ADEP. 7, 13, 18, 19 AS: What is ADEP?  CH: Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program.  It is with the Regions Hospital program. 8 I went to treatment and I just went to my fourteen days so I could get my license. 7, 13, 18, 19, 20 Thank God this is getting behind me. 15, 20 Still, being an external sorter, the worst thing you can do is put a person like that in group. 8, 10, 17, 18, 19 Do you think anybody can keep a secret like that in group? 7, 17, 18 Right?  CH: An external sorter. 8, 10 CH: People have internal and external locuses of control. 9, 10 This is something that has been really useful in counseling over the years and working with people. 6, 7, 8, 9, 16 How people view the world is often, especially with people who are involved with addiction, you can have a strong internal focus. 8, 12, 15, 18 You know these people because they already have all the answers. 6, 7, 17, 18 They don’t need you to tell them anything. 13 CH: People who have an internal sense of self. 5, 9 They analyze, look at, and make decisions about their life based on their own information and data and process the decision that they have made. 7, 8, 13, 18 External people are like chameleons:  they can become whatever they need to become in their environment, they become really good at reading things, thinking they fit in. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19 I’m not saying they don’t stand out. 14 They are driven by the environment as opposed to individual preferences. 7, 14, 20 Ideally, you want some of both. 14 There are points where you need to be taking in data from the outside and times from yourself. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 I just always had a very -- at that point -- external point of reference. 7, 10, 20 I just looked around seeing how other people did it and emulated that. 5, 6, 13, 18 AS: To put you in group, you just mimicked what other people were saying? 14, 18, 19 CH: No, I just shared. 7 When you have an external orientation you don’t have the need to protect or -- you know what I mean? 10, 17 When you are in those settings you just share. 7 That happened to you? 5 This happened to me, and this happened to me. 5 They are like, See, you’re an alcoholic. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 You realize that the normal people don’t have to try to quit drinking. 7, 15, 18, 19 I drank the Kool-Aid. 18 Fourteen days after getting out of outpatient treatment I knew I was an alcoholic and an addict. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20 I had shared all that stuff about the cocaine and the stuff I had been through. 7, 10 All the crazy stuff.  It was fourteen days after I had finished my detox and they called me into the director’s office and he was like, Alright, you are going to be here for fourteen days and this is how it works. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 You will need to take a look at the books on the shelves; there are four up there for different halfway houses. 7, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20 I said, Sorry, halfway houses? 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20 He said, Yeah, the recommendation here from the Rule Twenty-five person is that you do fourteen days inpatient followed by ninety days at a halfway house. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 At which point I said, John, I can tell you have been doing this a while and I can tell you are good, but if you look around you can tell I have some of the same problems that the people we have in this treatment center are dealing with. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 I think after I am here for about a week you will see that I don’t have to finish the fourteen days let alone go to the halfway house. 5, 9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20 At which point he metaphorically pushed my nose into the ground. 10, 12, 14, 17 He said, It says here if you don’t complete treatment and the halfway house then you don’t get your license back. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I did my fourteen days and then I was three days in. 18, 19 I got into the program and I wasn’t faking it. 8 I was like, Wow, I really have this issue. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14 It is kind of like when you read the diagnostic and mental health manual for the first time and you have half of the stuff in there. 7, 16, 19 They give me a choice of these halfway houses. 9, 11, 16, 20 Three of them are in Frogtown and Dayton neighborhood. 12 I was like, I am not going to those! 9, 14 There were two other choices.  It was Cochran and Hastings, River Falls [Wisconsin], which is on the River Falls campus.  They give you a day to go out there and check it out. 11, 19 They interviewed me and he said, Why do you want to come here? 13, 14, 17 I said, I see you are on a college campus. 5, 13, 14 I’ve never been to college before. 13 I thought maybe while I was here I would take a class. 6, 10, 12, 16, 20 I’m still moving a million miles a minute. 7, 14 Despite that interview they decided to take me. 8, 20 I finished up my fourteen days and I was excited to go to River Falls. 18, 19 It is a really nice place, but it is a forty-minute drive from ADAP to River Falls, which is apparently how long it takes to undo fourteen days of treatment. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 I don’t think it was two hours after I got into the halfway house that I was sitting down with my primary counselor saying, Bob, if you review my records you will understand that I have been pretty successful in my life and I have got some really good things going for me. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 I have a house in St. Paul that I can go back to and live. 9, 11, 17, 19 Of course, the telephone is shut off and I haven’t paid my gas in two months. 8, 11, 12, 14 You’ll see. 5 How long do I really need to be here? 6, 7, 8 He said, Well, Chuck, it says here if you don’t complete ninety days you don’t get your license back! 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 So, yeah, that’s a long ride from one place to another. 7, 8, 17 AS: How did you get the ride? 17, 20 CH: They would take you. 20 They transported you.  I was their van, which was probably a good thing. 6, 12, 13, 19 Left to my own devices I would have gone for it.  I did the ninety days. 18, 19 They have you do manual labor stuff.  There was nothing wrong with it, but that’s the stuff that really makes me angry and annoyed. 6, 7, 8, 9, 18 Now I am loading trucks again all day long and I have to pay for a ride to work to make like six dollars an hour. 7, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 All these dichotomies.  AS: That is kind of a sort of humiliation. 8 A lot of grounding.  AS: I’m calling it humiliation and you are calling it a grounding. 14, 17 CH: I don’t think it should be humiliating because there is nothing humiliating about it.  For me it wasn’t so humiliating as it was like back to the roots. 11, 17, 19 Here is what my family does, throwing sacks. 7, 19 Again, nothing wrong with it, but I always thought there should be more. 6, 10 I was just frustrated.  AS: Okay.  So you didn’t think it was beneath you, necessarily.  I have always been in good physical shape. 6, 10, 19 Well, I was.  I finished my ninety days. 18, 19 One of the most important things that happened to me while I was there was that I started doing more reading about addiction because I wanted to understand it. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 19 The differences between my time in sales and my training in counseling -- the skills are really very similar. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 There isn’t much difference. 7 I had done all the Anthony Robbins and the Dale Carnegie; I had done all the training for sales. 8 When you are sitting in group and listening to what people are saying as opposed to applying your own meaning for them I was actually functioning very supportively in group. 7, 9, 12, 14, 18 I finally read 7 The Road Less Traveled by Scott Peck, which talks about a number of things, but most important for me was a mapping of the world, what this means, what this isn’t. 5, 6, 12, 14, 19 For me, it was a lot of things I had believed to be true, but it didn’t go with the world view I grew up with. 5, 7, 9, 12, 19 It really was a remapping for me. 6, 7, 8 That book launched me into a whole course of action and research and interests. 7, 12 I finished my ninety days and I returned home. 7, 17, 18, 19 I took a job scraping forums.  Like what they pour cement with.  They bring them back and they are all dirty you have to scrape it out. 11, 17, 19 In the yard scraping forums all days. 18, 19 I had to walk right past my old bar that I used to hang out at because I couldn’t drive. 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16 Now I am on the honesty program. 6, 8, 12 I am involved in the twelve steps. 12, 16 I am trying to live a life of rigorous honesty. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 I don’t have my license; I’m not driving my car. 14, 18 I am halfway out of this program so the promises are going to come true if I just do what I need to do. 8, 16, 17, 20 I am going to meetings and got a job and I’m just getting started again. 6, 12, 15 I started drinking again. 6, 15, 19 I never went back to the crack cocaine because that was a whole lifestyle. 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 It was too far to go. 9 My parents and in-laws were invited to the halfway house and I did tell them that I was using cocaine and they were pretty surprised. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 They really don’t know what that means. 6, 7, 8, 17 To them that means, My son was using drugs but he quit. 10, 17, 19 They don’t understand the depth of it and it is hard for me to explain because it is so complex and convoluted. 6 All the craziness, games, and desperation. 15 I had a gun in my mouth one time. 7, 10, 16, 19 I wasn’t holding the gun. 10, 16 I started to drink September 27, 1995. 6, 15, 19 I went back to drinking for two months. 11, 15, 17, 19 I was in the bar and I looked up and they showed a picture of one of my best friends. 7, 9, 12, 13 When I first got into advertising at the company that was doing the envelopes and stuff I had met a guy who had done more than three years in Stillwater prison on three different occasions for stuff. 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18 In many ways we were cut from the same cloth but he just got caught and his connections went a little deeper than mine. 14, 18, 20 I am more the guy that brings things together and connects things. 5, 6, 11, 16, 19, 20 He was the fighter. 13 For many years when we were running together he would keep me out of trouble and I would keep up moving forward. 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20 That was my connection. 18 He did furniture refinishing with me when he needed money. 7, 9, 12 Very close from 1985 until ‘95. 6, 13 I looked up and I saw that he was on the TV and he was being charged with vehicular homicide. 6, 13 He had borrowed my friend’s motorcycle that owned the refinishing company and at two o’clock in the morning someone had stepped off the curb in front of him and he hit him doing thirty. 7, 9, 13, 16, 19 My friend blew a point one three which is waking up for him. 10, 13 His drinking was way worse than mine. 15, 19 That was the day I decided. 8, 19 To some degree the trouble that he got in I got in, but to a lesser degree. 7, 19 I thought, This is where this is going. 10 On that day I decided to stop drinking. 8, 15, 19 I have never gone back to cocaine. 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 The one thing that I was supposed to do with the halfway house that I didn’t do was go see a therapist. 5, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20 The next day I set up the appointment and I said, I was supposed to call after I left River Falls and I didn’t. 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I got set up to see him. 5 I had my job so I just stopped the drinking thing, upped my meetings. 6, 12, 15, 19 At that point I was still going off and on. 7, 10 I went and saw this therapist in part because of what happened in treatment and the halfway house and my own reading, I went and saw this person and I said, This is my scenario and this is where I’m at. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 He is an exceptional therapist and his approach was very effective.  He asked me, Chuck, how smart are you? 20 I said, I’m street smart. 7, 13, 14, 20 I can always figure out a way to get around, I can do what I need to do, I’m good at solving problems, I can do this and that. 6, 7, 10, 18, 19, 20 He said, Let me get this right. 8, 13, 14, 20 You were in the service and you did that successfully. 7 I got out in ‘89.  He said, You were in the service for six years, you were in sales, you were with a small business that you partially owned at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two, then you were building a company, twenty-six, twenty-seven you had your own company, you’ve been through drug treatment, you’ve basically lived on the street, you’ve nearly been homeless, you’ve survived just fine, we are sitting here having this conversation and you’re saying you’re not smart? 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 [laughs] 10 I said, 13, 14 Well, that’s street smarts and that’s how you get by. 7, 20 He made me take an IQ test and it wasn’t off the charts or anything, it wasn’t near genius, but he asked me, Well, how smart are you? 13, 20 I said, How do you want me to define it? 13, 14 He said, IQ? 13, 14 I said, I have no idea. 5, 13, 14 What is average? 15 He said, One hundred. 13, 14 I said, I’m one hundred. 13, 14 I came back after I had taken the IQ test and he said, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 What was your score? 7 I shared it with him and he said, What does that mean? 7, 13, 14 Being an external sorter primarily at that point I said, Basically, it means short of doing rocket science or anything like that I could probably do anything I wanted to. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17 He was like, Yeah, you’re right. 7, 8, 9, 14 His method of therapy was very effective for me. 10, 12, 18 I went once a week for several months before backing off to twice a month and then tapering off. 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 Years later my mom, with all of her family issues growing up, I sent her to him because she has a lot of depression issues and he saw her for like three sessions and he said, She’s good, we don’t need to see her anymore. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 It was really disappointing for me. 6, 7, 8, 10 [laughs] 10 AS: Those are some pretty good coping skills, apparently! 5, 6, 7, 14, 19 CH: That was years after I had been to therapy but, yeah, that’s great. 7, 8, 16, 18 He said, We’re not going to talk about the twelve steps, that’s not what we’re here for. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16 He was just very effective at throwing the proverbial bone and then I would go out and look for it for the week and I would come back with the bone and he would take that out of my mouth and throw it again. 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 A lot of what I wanted to believe in my heart of hearts was true, I just had to come to those things myself. 5, 6, 9, 14, 17, 19 I became a much better internal sorter, I became a much better ‘identity.’ 8, 13, 17 AS: Did you go to college then?  I was in the halfway house and one of my friends was supposed to help one of these guys move. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 I was on my way to church and this guy pulls over and asks if so-and-so is around and I say, No, he took off for the weekend, and he said, I need someone to move the couch. 6, 13, 14, 16, 18 I said, I’m going to church. 13, 14 He said, Help me move this couch and I’ll drive you to church afterwards and I thought, 10, 13, 14 This sounds scary! 14 This from the guy who used to drive prostitutes! 6, 9, 14 [laughs] 10 I go help him move this couch. 14, 18 He says to me that he had worked with guys from Kinnic Falls before, he had been DVR, Department of Vocational Rehab in Wisconsin and he told me if I wanted to go to school in Minnesota all I needed to do was go down to the Department of Rehabilitative Services and because I was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, besides the fact that I have narcolepsy, they would pay for my schooling if I wanted to go to school for something. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: How strange that this guy just shows up and starts telling you all of this. 6, 9, 13 CH: I went and did my fifth step at this small church that I go to. 12, 16 The fifth step in the twelve steps is where you go and you share your shortcomings and character flaws with another person. 7, 10, 12, 16, 17 You’ve done a searching a fearless moral inventory and now you have to share it. 7, 17 I went to my old church and I was going to ask the priest afterwards if he would do it at some point with me. 10, 16 I thought, I am not doing this. 10 In the church where I was an altar boy for six years. 16 He said in the sermon stuff about Mary Magdalene and the stoning and it is about forgiveness and he was not guilty. 11, 13, 14 I am really fortunate because next door we have the convent that we sold several years ago for people who are alcohol and drug addicted. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 Part of my job -- I want to get back to the community as I do the fifth steps -- I had not been in that church for five years or more and I don’t think I have been back since. 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 Maybe once or twice. 16 I went and talked to him and I did the fifth step with him. 6, 13, 16 I was done and he goes, Alright Chuck, you’re human, thanks for sharing, have a nice day. 7, 8, 9, 14, 19 Which is the definition of how you get rid of shame. 20 I spent the time with the therapist and it was just really bizarre when you talk about things happening. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 I also went to DVR and said, Hey, I want to do this. 13, 14 I did an orientation and he said, What do you want to do? 13, 14 I have no idea. 5 He said, What have you done? 13, 14 I said, How long do you have? 7, 13, 14 [laughs] 10 Security, asbestos removal, cables, sales, advertising, marketing, drug dealing, taxi service. 5, 7, 10, 13, 18 [laughs] 10 They have a series of tests and they do a personality test, an interest inventory, a manual dexterity test, an IQ test, puzzle things. 5, 7, 10, 13, 17, 19 I rocked the puzzle things. 5, 19 The guy was like, That’s one of the fastest I’ve ever seen anyone do that. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14 They send it off, compile the score, and tell you everything. 7, 13 I said, I’ve been making good decisions up until this point -- the twelve steps at this point. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 I’m letting go; letting God, let’s just see what the plan is. 5 I come in, Jeff Parkin was my counselor, he comes in and I go in and sit down. 7, 17, 20 He says, Let’s look at your test results. 7, 13, 14, 17 He pulled out the file and said, Well, according to your skills your number one career that you’re best suited for is actor. 7, 13, 14, 18, 20 We won’t pay for that. 18 Tends not to have such a good success rate. 6, 19 [laughs] 10 That was the first category. 16 That was the number one. 14 The next category was beauty salon operator, floral designer. 16, 19 I had no idea I was gay! 5 [laughs] 10 Stereotyping; don’t take that personally! 7, 10, 17, 20 I don’t feel that way, but what I thought at the time was, Great! 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19 I’m not a drug addict. 10, 15 I’ve got kids, how am I going to provide for them. 15 In that same grouping was psychologist, counselor. 18, 20 AS: Right.  Someone that works with people. 8 CH: Someone that works with people. 8 I thought, I’m already in on this whole drug addict thing. 6, 7, 10, 15, 18, 19 It was believed that most counselors at that point -- historically we know differently -- were people in recovery and that you needed to be in recovery to be effective. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 The whole idea that one addict helping another addict, which is very effective. 5, 7, 15, 18 I said, I’ll do the chemical dependence counseling thing. 13, 14, 19 At that point it was a two-year program at Inver Hills [Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota]. 8, 10, 16 I went and got signed up at Inver Hills, I took the tests, and I only scored a couple that were over the one hundred -- I had to take a few remedial math class, but other than that everything was over one hundred, which wasn’t bad considering eighteen to thirty-one I hadn’t had an education. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 20 They said to take classes that you like so you can have some time to get used to college. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 Take a class that you like and that you think you’ll do well at. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14 I took creative problem solving for one and I took a writing one because I have always had a flare and a knack for writing, and then I took a math class that was like introduction to algebra or something. 6, 7, 10, 12 For some reason I don’t have a mind that things algebraically. 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 17, 19 I’m not a linear sequential person. 10, 17 I think very geometrically and am more spatial. 12, 14, 17 Those things just make sense to me. 5, 9, 18, 19 Algebra just doesn’t work.  My first day of my first class -- I am thirty-one years old -- this is January 3, 1996. 6, 12, 16, 19 I am all of ninety days sober at that point. 10, 18, 19 You think a guy would be comfortable for all the things he has been through. 5, 6, 18, 19 I was totally insecure. 7 I’m going to be the old guy in the community college school with the kids who couldn’t get into the good colleges go! 6, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 That’s not true, but that’s what I’m thinking.  I walk into class and there were only a couple of people in there. 6, 7, 12 There were two that looked like they were nineteen or twenty, and there was a woman who looked to be about my age so I went and sat by her. 13, 15 I did and that was my introduction to college.  The college went really well. 6, 7, 8 The woman that I sat next to is now my wife. 12, 16, 17, 19 AS: Honestly? 6, 12 Oh my gosh.  I had a feeling you were going to say that. 13, 14, 17, 18 CH: It was the creative problem solving class and it worked really well for me. 6, 7, 8, 12 I took it because it was fun, it would be interesting, and I had a knack for it. 7, 9 My now wife took it because it fulfilled criteria in two core areas and therefore it would mean she would have to take one less class. 6, 7, 12, 17, 20 That is about all you need to know about her and I to understand the nature of our relationship. 7, 15, 17 She was actually going into marketing and advertising. 18 I obviously had just come out of that among other things. 5, 17, 19 She liked the books from the classes I was taking. 6, 9, 12, 14 She never considered social work. 7, 9, 13, 18 I was going to school and decided I was going to -- because I have to have a plan -- I was going to get a two year degree, become a chemical dependency counselor while I finish my four year degree with a bachelors in social work. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Did my master’s in social work so I could be an LICSW [licensed individual clinical social worker]. 18 I had this eight-year plan lined up. 16 She liked my classes so much and had never considered being a social worker that she flipped her classes. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 She was going to school because she had been laid off and had a package from her employer to go to school. 11, 13, 15 She is an LICSW now, which I never got because I ended up in administration. 13, 17 She jokes because she says, You knew you would always have LICSW after your name, you just didn’t know it would say, Mrs. 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17 Charles Hilger, LICSW.  [laughs] 10 AS: Did you finish your alcohol and drug -- CH: I did. 10 I finished my two years and I did have a knack for it. 16 It was daunting because the professor would be like, Oh you’re the -- it was unfair. 7, 9, 14 I remember I was telling my therapist about it and she’s like, Oh, you’re the superstar? 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 I don’t know what that means, but it stuck with me. 17 I was taking these classes and getting As in these classes. 6, 12, 15, 20 I was thinking, These teachers are dumb because I can’t be this smart. 20 AS: Right.  You are still in that mindset. 6, 7 CH: Over time it bears out and I graduated after two years. 7, 11, 16, 19 I had taken a job as a tech in a halfway house overnight so I could study. 5, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 I always give my wife a hard time because I say, I was thirty-one years old, three months sober, no driver’s license, no vehicle, living downstairs in my parents’ duplex with my dad driving me back and forth to school, with a job -- don’t take this the wrong way -- I was monitoring security alarms overnight and usually when we met, if your alarm goes off at your house I’m the one that calls the police. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 It was like for seven or eight bucks an hour.  Is that like a good social experiment, or what? 6, 18, 19 I have no idea. 5 Oh, this will be fun!  Let’s see where this goes. 5 I mean, what was she thinking.  [laughs] 10 I finish my two years. 16 She had taken a job at detox as a tech, I had taken a job at Cochlear Programs and they happen to be next to each other. 5, 16, 19, 20 I worked for a year as a tech while I was going to school. 11, 12, 16 They hired me the day I graduated to start detox as a counselor. 6, 7, 11, 19, 20 I worked at detox for six years, which was a great experience. 7, 8, 12, 15, 16 I saw about a thousand patients a year. 6, 15, 16 That’s a lot of patients over six years to assessments with. 15, 16 I continued and did my bachelor’s degree in social work. 7, 18, 19 We moved in together in ‘97 and got married in 2002. 11, 12, 14, 16, 20 We blended our families. 15 She has a son that is the same age as mine. 15, 17 Our sons are just six months apart. 8, 11, 17 They were fast friends at the age of seven when they met and they are still fast friends. 7, 12, 13, 15 I was finishing up my bachelor’s at University of Wisconsin River Falls where Kinnic Falls campus is located. 7 No irony left on me there. 8, 19 I still go back there every semester and talk to their class. 6, 7, 11, 12, 17, 19 AS: Talk to which class? 6, 12 CH: Use, abuse, and addiction. 8, 9, 15 About harm reduction services. 7, 9 I went into working with opiate addiction. 8, 15 My wife and I worked side by side as counselors for about two of the years of detox after I became a counselor and she became a counselor. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 She did that for like two years and then we finished our BSW and she wanted to do something else. 8, 9, 14, 16 She went off and did a couple other things and ended up working in a methadone clinic at some point and said to me, This is great because you have patients for two years. 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 If we are going to LICSWs this most looks like the therapeutic model where you have these patients engaged in mental health care and counseling for a long time. 7, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 It’s a great training ground because you have the same fifty patients. 7, 8, 15 I applied to that company as well and I went to a different location than where she was at. 7, 8, 18 I started working in 2003. 6, 15 I was a counselor for a year. 16, 20 The company was a national one and they didn’t have a lot of leadership or strength here. 7, 12 The treatment director resigned and I applied for the position. 7, 13, 18 It was three counselors in the clinic -- it was a small clinic. 12, 20 I think there were 150 patients in the clinic at that time. 7, 15, 16, 19 I took over as the treatment director. 7, 13, 18 CH: Dakota Metro.  AS: In the Twin Cities?  CH: Yeah, down in Burnsville.  AS: It is a methadone clinic? 10, 12 CH: It is a methadone clinic owned by a management group. 15, 18 I don’t want to be disparaging towards them. 14 AS: What year is this? 16 In 2004 I was a counselor. 20 In 2004 I took over as the treatment director. 7, 13, 18 I made a few changes and the clinic took off. 5, 13 I had to double the size of the clinic.  We just did really well. 6, 7, 8 I was fortunate enough to find a few really solid staff members, enough people that knew enough about the treatment modality that I didn’t know yet like the pharmacy and the nursing piece. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 I used the medical model because I worked in detox before. 9, 11, 12 I do have my license back by this point. 10, 11, 17, 18, 19 [laughs] 10 In the spring of ‘96 Brownie, my wife, gave me the money to pay to take my test and get my license back. 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 She was tired of driving me around. 7, 18 My dad gave up the job he was like, You got it now! 9, 14, 17, 18 The clinic took off and we did really well. 6, 7, 8 I got a call from a friend of mine I knew from the state. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17 I knew him from working at detox next door. 6, 12, 16, 17, 19 He was like, Hey, just so you know another national company is sniffing around Minnesota looking to open clinics. 6, 9, 14, 17, 20 I notified my boss and he notified the CEO and he called me and said, The only way to stop this is to open up more clinics and I want you to do a footprint, get you boots on the ground -- you know Minnesota better than anybody -- and tell me where to put three clinics. 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 Give me three locations.  I worked that out and figured it out with my process and about a year after I became treatment director and I had put this proposal together and my regional director resigned. 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 He was a man I have tremendous amount of respect for and is an amazing individual, great boss, one of the best people I have ever worked with. 7, 8, 12, 13 I was sorry to see him go. 5 It was between me and another guy for the regional director because two of us applied for that position. 6, 7 I had kind of done that groundwork for the clinic.  The CEO knew what I could do but the other guy applied and he had been there longer. 6, 7, 12, 20 In fact, he was the guy that hired me, and I got the job. 6, 7 He hired me as a counselor, then we were peers, and then I got hired. 7, 20 I found out he didn’t know how to run a clinic and I had to terminate him. 8, 11, 17 Terminating the guy that hires you is not fun. 6, 7 I opened up two methadone clinics for them here in the state. 17, 20 We never did open the third one. 12, 13, 20 AS: Was that Valhalla?  CH: No that would be St.  Cloud Metro and Rochester Metro.  For five years 16 I had seven clinics in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Indiana.  In that time, because it is a national company I got to work with Dr. Thomas Payte since the late sixties, you look at the tip forty-three, which has all the ‘this is how you do methadone.’ 5, 7, 10, 12, 16, 19 He is one of the authors.  He is one of the top ten in the field. 20 When they point to the elders he is one of them. 10 He knew the people that pioneered methadone. 6, 7, 12 Doctors Dole and Niswane.  Just an amazing physician.  He has a heart for patients and a realistic approach and view of methadone. 6, 7, 14, 15 I got to work under him for five years. 16 The company I was working for didn’t allow for things like additional care like mental health. 5, 7, 14, 19, 20 I was working on my master’s degree for mental health so I really had a penchant for that. 6, 7, 8, 19 They thought it was a good idea but it wasn’t baked into their model. 5, 6, 10, 19 If you add in mental health you end up reducing your profit. 7 They didn’t want to do that. 14 It was their model.  AS: Because it was just maintenance?  CH: They had all the licensed drug and alcohol counselors, right. 8, 10, 14, 18, 20 When you try to start bringing in higher cost therapists AS: ...let’s treat that problem that you keep talking about. 6, 7, 11, 17 I see. 5 CH: The man I worked for was very difficult to work for. 10, 12 People are surprised that I worked for the five years that I did. 12, 16 Eventually we agreed to disagree on the topic of patient care and I elected to leave. 7, 14, 20 I figured I was finishing my MSW and I needed my hours so I would go work at House of Charity in downtown Minneapolis for a person who used to be a treatment director. 7, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19 I work for her now. 17 We always got along great. 7, 8, 10, 15 I was never one to be caught up on [1. 38.59]. 13 Let’s just get the job done and do it right. 8, 14, 20 I started working at House of Charity, which is a group-housing unit with service for mental health, CD [chemical dependency] services, the whole nine yards. 6, 9, 10, 15, 18 We were doing groups. 11, 18 Can’t do mental health yet, at that point, but I’m doing groups. 10, 11, 15, 18 I have all the methadone patients on the side because that’s what I do on the side. 9, 15 I am taking on consulting jobs so I’m doing some consulting for Valhalla, which is a relatively new MAT [medically assisted treatment] program at that point. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 My friend at House of Charity quit and they offered me the treatment director job. 7, 9, 13, 18, 19 If I take the treatment director job I’m never going to get my hours for my LICSW. 7, 13, 18, 20 I was just finishing my master’s at that point. 10 I got to the point at St. Thomas [St. Paul, Minnesota] where I was finishing my master’s degree, it has a clinical focus, but I did the two-year program. 7, 8, 10, 16, 19 I was in year five of the two year program when my advisor who I had never talked to before called me in and said, You will not be the first person to take my two year program and turn it into a six year program -- this was in March -- You have until the end of the semester to finish or we are going to wash you out and you cannot return. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20 I had all the research, I had all the data, and it was just a matter of getting it written. 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. 20 I finished it.  I was consulting with Valhalla and when they found out I had this treatment director job they were like, We could use you here if you are interested in leaving that job. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18 They were getting ready for their first accreditation. 7, 15, 16, 18, 20 I told them I would work for them although I had a five-year noncompete with my other employer so I had to be a counselor, I couldn’t do anything else. 8, 13, 16, 20 I was a counselor that was writing policy procedures manual. 7, 20 And I had a [unclear].  At that point I was the eighth employee hired. 7, 10, 19 My wife had left that other methadone treatment program and opened a locked CD treatment program for people that were committed down in Hastings and the Cochran Programs. 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 She moved to Valhalla as a counselor. 11, 14, 20 This was the third company we had worked for together, which works for us. 8, 11, 12, 16, 20 Valhalla was owned by a person that was on a methadone treatment program. 7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18 The company that I used to work for -- I didn’t know him -- but he wasn’t happy with the way he was treated so he established Valhalla in a way that was a place that I would want to go to and I would want to be treated in terms of how counseling is handled, how insurance is handled, how medical services are handled. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 His idea was a much broader approach. 5 My only piece when I went to Valhalla was,  It is fine but we have to do mental health care. 7, 14, 20 I won’t do this unless we do mental health, thinking at some point I might get my hours in. 10, 20 [laughs] 10 They agreed to that. 7 I was the eighth employee. 19 We had one hundred and fifty patients and that was October of 2009. 15 Through a whole series of things like the increase in the opiate epidemic, someone who knew how to do marketing, the expansion of services into mental health. 5, 6, 7, 12, 19 We took that clinic from one hundred and fifty to one thousand active patients in just three years, which means we are hiring a counselor every six weeks. 15, 16, 20 It is crazy to think what we went through.  We opened a second location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and transferred like one hundred and fifty patients because they were actually closer to that location, and the company was sold last June when we had about 2,300 patients in 2016. 6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20 We integrated mental health services so that patients coming in would get a mental health diagnostic assessment in addition to the regular counseling services. 7, 15, 20 We had full time nurse practitioners and physician's assistants and doctors that are on site most of the day and most of the days. 7, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20 Just a whole different level of care. 7, 9, 14, 18, 20 We had expanded Valhalla Place to add a medical clinic that you couldn’t do certain things from the treatment program to provide better and consistent medical care to patients with persisting issues besides do the physicals and the annual physicals. 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 That was really huge. 6, 7, 8 It has been amazing.  I never did go and get my hours. 13, 20 I actually never sat for the licensed social worker test that you sit after you’ve finished your master’s. 7, 13, 18 In a short time in Valhalla I moved from counselor to treatment director to executive director. 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 They tried to come after me for the noncompete, but it’s pretty difficult when that’s what a person does for a living; for their career. 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 17, 20 It would have been an uphill battle for them.  It is a different model and I’m not using what I learned there. 5, 7, 10, 18 I’m using what I knew what I wanted to do and it fit with what the owners wanted. 6, 10, 12, 14 AS: The pursuit of your interest in counseling led you to change the model in a methadone clinic setting that actually has improved patient outcomes? 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 18 Was that a new model for Minnesota to have the mental health aspect integrated? 6 CH: There are other people that have done integrated mental health models.  It really depends on the philosophy and the approach. 6, 7, 8 Many of them are in larger mental health centers and medical centers. 11 They are driven by a medical model. 11, 14 Instead of being patient centered it is really about, This is our program and this is what our physicians do. 6, 7, 8 It is not guided by the patient and if the patient is or isn’t progressing through treatment. 7, 13, 18 Is their quality of life stable? 7, 8, 18 Are they looking for something better? 6, 17 Can we help them improve that if they want to? 14, 18 Is this as good as it gets and we need to be okay with that? 6, 14, 19, 20 A lot of the patients we have at Valhalla and a lot of the initial growth were patients that have been on a clinic tour for years because they would spend three years at a clinic, they wouldn’t get the results that the clinic expected, they would kick them out, they would go to the next clinic. 7, 15, 16, 19, 20 Wanting to grow, people are always taking patients even though they know -- they think it’s going to be different or whatever. 7, 10, 15, 17, 18 With the mental health patient in tact we can take the more challenging patient and we can work with them. 20 We don’t say that this is going to get that much better. 14, 17, 20 You’ve been in four methadone programs in the last two years and it hasn’t gotten any better. 7, 8, 16, 17 You’ve been through eight inpatient treatments, three outpatient treatments, four group residential housing. 7, 9, 10, 13, 18 Why do you think if we provide you with methadone it is going to be any different? 7, 18 We fight for stabilization. 13 Let’s not expect more than what it is going to be.  There is a percentage of the population that just kept doing a clinic shuffle. 15 Mental health issues kept getting in the way and they do fine for a while and then they have a manic episode and they go off and do something silly. 7, 14, 15, 20 They would sell their doses or whatever and then no one wants to deal with them. 6, 12, 14, 19 Just developing that and being able to do the medical care. 7, 11, 14, 18, 20 Now the patient is more invested in the program that they know they can go to where they say methadone and they know the provider is not going to roll their eyes or say, I’m not going to prescribe you any pain medications. 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17 AS: It is destigmatized.  It is completely destigmatized. 14 People don’t tend to move away as much from our programs. 8, 14, 20 When you look at our numbers ninety percent of patients that have been on the program for a year are free of any illicit opiate use. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16 AS: For one year? 16 CH: Not for one year. 16 At one year. 16 When you do the measurement, ninety percent are testing negative for any illicit substances. 7, 9, 13 Seventy percent test free of any elicit substances. 7, 9, 13 Between the seventy and the ninety mark is predominantly people who continue to use THC [tetrahydrocannabinol]. 7, 9, 19 I’m not going to put someone out, but is this something that is interfering with your quality of life? 7, 8, 19 Do you want to change it because it is illegal? 5, 14 You might get drug tested at your job? 10, 13, 20 If those things aren’t an issue -- AS: 5, 7, 19 You don’t kick them out of the program. 8 CH: No, I’m not going to kick them out of the program. 8 Anyway, it is still ultimately their choice to make. 7, 18, 19 The funder at some point may say, If you continue to stay positive you’re going to do -- we offer high intensity outpatient treatment, which is a twelve week program for five days a week, three hours at a time for twelve weeks for people that have more challenges making the changes they have to make. 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 There is no reason to add the outpatient element. 7, 10, 17 Some of them just want to go to in order to get the stability. 14, 20 The outpatient piece has been critical.  The counselors get more training than they ever did, but they still don’t have the depth of knowledge that licensed mental health professionals have. 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 20 They are teaming up to work with this patient and figure out what needs to happen. 5, 7, 15 It has been a fascinating journey.  The pieces that made the biggest difference were the things that weren’t supposed to -- certainly there is serendipity that has come into play with the church thing and a couple of other things, but the right place at the right time, everything happens for a reason, whatever you make peace with or you look at it. 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 I was the person that was cornered in for treatment, which we all know never works. 7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18 I thought that was kind of funny. 8, 10 AS: It didn’t work right away. 8, 14, 20 CH: The Road Less Travelled was a book that I picked out for a guy that had been my roommate at the treatment center. 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 18 We went down to the library and I picked it out for him and I said, 5, 13, 14 You’ve got to read this because I think this is what you’re looking for. 6, 7 [laughs] 10 He elected to leave the halfway house, so he left it on my desk. 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 He said, Would you mind returning this? 6, 7, 13, 14 It is the only reason I read it. 7, 10, 17 There are a number of those very crystallized moments where I’m like, That was weird. 9, 14, 15, 17 Getting into school, therapy was huge, the mental health piece, the treatment piece was huge. 7, 11, 13, 18 My twelve-step piece was critical as well. 8, 16 I did CA groups as well, cocaine anonymous groups, for two years at ADAP. 8, 10, 11, 16, 18 I would still go back frequently probably for three years. 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 Eventually I stopped going and haven’t been going for years. 15, 16 Doing harm reduction strategies, we do syringe exchange, we distribution of Narcan and training for Narcan across the state. 5, 7, 8, 9, 17 The numbers that were coming back for 2016 it looks like more than twenty-five percent of the kits that we distribute are being used to reverse overdoses. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 Huge numbers. 14 We distributed over two thousand last year. 16 Five hundred reversals out of those two thousand kits. 7, 13 Watching people go through recovery over the years, people that I still see today that we on my original fifty case load in 2003 -- I always joke that you never forget your first fifty. 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, 19, 20 I’ve certainly lost patients over the years. 14, 15, 16 My belief in the dogmatic approach to recovery, you know the ‘once an addict always an addict’ just doesn’t apply. 7, 8, 10, 15, 17 There are people that it is never safe for them to go back to using. 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 Using anything, using something. 10 People have different physiologies, they respond differently with chemicals. 7, 18 I had a bad accident in 2000 and they sent me home after five days in the hospital. 8, 17, 18, 19 I had a broken collarbone, five broken ribs, and a punctured lung. 7, 12 They sent me home with Dilaudid, and all this stuff I had been listening to people saying were great drugs. 7, 8, 10, 14, 17, 19 I took them with a little bit of, I need to get rid of this pain, and a little bit of anticipation. 20 I don’t get it. 20 I am a go fast guy. 6 Thank God they don’t treat those things with cocaine because it would have been a different story. 5, 7, 10, 13, 18, 19 [laughs] 10 It would not have worked out too well. 8, 12 I believe that our mindset that because someone has problems at some point in their life with alcohol or drugs does not mean that they cannot ever use again. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 I would be irresponsible if I ran around saying that everybody should find out if it was just a phase. 7, 9, 14, 18 I would never do that. 13 Several years ago I made the conscious decision that drinking at this point in my life would be okay for me. 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Two and a half years into it I consumed it socially, and I have never gotten any problems because of drinking. 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 AS: You still have your license. 7, 18 CH: I still have my license. 7, 18 [laughs] 10 My methadone piece when I do the eight hour MAT 101 and I kind of roll this out slowly in the presentation but I still have narcolepsy and at age thirty-five it started to get bad to the point where I was counseling in my first year at MAT and I was starting to have problems staying awake with patients, which doesn’t convey any positive regard. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20 They were like, Chuck, come on. 9, 14, 17 The good part is coming. 6, 7, 8, 19 Is your dose okay? 14 Are you nodding?  Do my pupils look small? 12 I went to the doctor because they told me it wouldn’t get any worse. 13, 16, 20 He told me I was just getting older so the effects are more pronounced. 13, 15, 16, 20 Thanks.  That’s getting worse. 15, 20 I don’t care how you sort it, that’s getting worse. 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 Despite the fact that based on the twelve-step philosophy that taking any stimulants -- because stimulants are my drug of choice -- is a slippery slope, then ultimately is going to lead back to regular use and or abuse or addiction, ultimately addiction and jails or those types of institutions, if not death, I elected that I did not want to sit at home and be on Social Security because I cannot drive my car because I cannot stay awake behind the wheel, which is what ultimately could have happened. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I elected to take the risk and take stimulants. 19, 20 I am fifty-two and I have been on stimulants for -- I joke and say the only time I ever abused them was the morning I had four ibuprofen in one hand and four of my ten milligram Ritalins for the day. 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 Instead of taking the four Ibuprofen I took the four Ritilin.  That morning went by really fast. 6, 7, 8, 9 Other than that I have never abused it. 9, 13 I have never taken it in excess and it allows me to function. 13, 20 Here I am now, here I am a person taking a kissing cousin to my drug of choice. 10, 17 People abuse Ritilin; it is a stimulant. 9, 19 Stimulants are my drug of choice but I take them to maintain functioning so that I can do what I need to do. 10, 19, 20 Without it I wouldn’t be able to do that and it would definitely have a negative impact on my quality of life. 7, 8, 14, 18 Yet, my patients that take methadone, and nobody ever questions whether I’m sober or not. 10, 12, 13, 15, 20 When I started drinking and I did tell a few of the guys that have been in long-term sobriety with me -- and I still consider myself in recovery and long term sobriety and recovery -- that I had made the decision, because I didn’t want to keep any secrets, we were talking about, Oh you’ve got so much time and I said, Well, I’m not counting alcohol anymore. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 They were like, What do you mean you aren’t counting alcohol? 9, 10, 14 I was like, Well, six months ago I decided it wasn’t an issue for me. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16 I’m not sober from alcohol anymore. 7, 10 They threw me out of the damn club because now I wasn’t really an addict. 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 17 Now I’m not really a person in recovery because nobody can do that. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17 Nobody could ever go through a phase in their life where they used alcohol or another drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism, and then at some point later in their life go back to use at a regular level. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 They would say, You were never an alcoholic anyway. 10, 13, 14 To go back to the methadone thing my patients taking the kissing cousin to their drug of choice in order to function on a daily basis -- it can be abused -- some of our patients do abuse that, they mix it with other medications, they do it in order to get an effect. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 The vast majority, eighty percent of the patients don’t do that and it works just fine. 8, 14, 15 Fifteen years ago even to say that out loud it could put your whole career into jeopardy. 7, 14, 16, 19, 20 I actually work it into the eight-hour medication assisted treatment -- AS: To say what out loud? 7, 13, 14, 16, 18 CH: To say that people could return to normal, social consumption drug of choice, perhaps without the same outcome or the same consequences. 7, 10, 14, 17, 18 AS: Even something like an opioid? 5 CH: Even something like an opioid. 5 An opioid is just another drug. 5, 10 It affects a different area of the brain and it is a very primary area that is part of our reward circuitry for sure. 5, 7, 8, 18, 20 It is part of our survival function; it ties into all those pieces. 8 But, to say that a person, and certainly we have evidence of this, I don’t know if people that are going to go back and try to start using -- I’m not going to go back and start using cocaine recreationally. 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19 Alcohol fits more into the social strata. 18 AS: I’m thinking heroin. 10 Some people are using it socially, at first, but then they get hooked. 10, 16, 18 CH: More people recover on their own from anything than they ever do by going to treatment. 7, 13, 18 AS: We just don’t know who those people are. 17 CH: At best, the studies that we have show a twenty percent success rate. 9, 13 AS: For treatment? 7, 13, 18 CH: For treatment. 7, 13, 18 When you try and say it is only successful twenty percent of the time people say, Is that their first or second time through? 7, 14, 16, 19 People really get it their second time through. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 There are people that should never use again. 9, 13 I have seen people that have one beer and they change. 5, 13, 20 For whatever reason -- chemically it is a bad idea. 5, 7, 10, 14, 17 I certainly have heard stories of people who have two beers and go to lockup. 7, 14, 20 You shouldn’t drink ever. 13, 19 I think we need more people out there that say people who go through midlife crises -- they lose their jobs, grief and loss issues, and they may choose to use alcohol or some other drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 Ultimately more often than not they move away from it on their own without having to go to treatment. 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 Second of all, if they ever use again it doesn’t mean you are going to be dead in six months. 9, 11, 13 With opiates compared to drinking you are dealing with a whole other level of unknowns. 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19 You’ve got carfentanyl, you’ve got fentanyl, you just don’t know. 14, 17 There’re so many variables. 7, 18 People die from alcohol related disorders every year; more people than are dying from opioids. 5, 7, 10, 16 It’s just quicker with opiates. 17 Right, you die much faster.  CH: That’s an important piece to get out there. 20 I don’t think we are doing anyone any favor with the war on drugs. 10 AS: That’s a whole other issue. 7 CH: I will point to Portugal and leave it at that. 10 Their numbers are there. 14 You can’t say it would be the same across cultures, but I think it would be pretty darn close. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 Statistically it would be in the ballpark. 14, 17 AS: Thank you,  Chuck.  CH: You didn’t ask any questions. 15 That’s what’s good. 6, 19 CH: It’s hard! 6 This is going to be a twenty-hour story if I did all the twists and turns. 13 AS: We might need a part two that is just an hour. 8 I might want to come back and talk about harm reduction and where you think this is going. 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19 CH: That’s right! 8, 14 That’s how we started out and I completely disregarded that. 6, 7, 14, 15 AS: I think it is really important because it helps me filter and think about how I am going to write. 6, 7, 8, 18 When I wrote the chapter about mothers I didn’t know what was really going to come up. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17 There was this piece about them being embattled.  CH: I hope you wrote something about the crack babies. 13 I’m still waiting to see something about the crack babies. 5, 7 CH: What do you mean they aren’t there?  Sorry.  [laughs] 10 AS: Someone else already wrote that: Susan Campbell. 6, 7, 8, 18 This idea of mothers being embattled and embattled motherhood and also being addicted to mothering in some way. 5, 10, 15 So, themes come up. 17 That’s why I enjoy hearing the whole story. 13, 14 Thank you so much.  CH: There are so many pieces. 18"

I kind of grew up playing these sports. 7, 19 My brother was an athlete in school as well. 8, 11, 16 That was just something that we loved to do, play sports. 17 We had a basketball hoop outside and we would shoot hoops outside after dinner. 9 AS: How old is your brother? 16 MK: He's 24 I think.  AS: You're a year apart. 8, 16 He'll be 25 in April.  We're like a year and a half apart. 8, 16 We got along like siblings get along that close in age. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 We're two polar opposite people. 7 He's very book smart, very into school. 11, 20 He's just very intelligent. 13 I on the other hand was more of the social butterfly in school. 11, 13, 18 I always wanted to go to parties on weekends or have friends over or go to friends’ houses. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 I met a lot of people through sports. 12 When I was 16 years old I met a guy who I started dating and he was a marijuana dealer. 6, 12, 14, 15, 16 AS: How old was he? 16 MK: He was a year younger than I, so 15 at the time. 6, 7, 16, 19 It was my first boyfriend. 13, 16 My first really any sort of relationship. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16 We were together for six and a half years. 11, 16, 20 It was a whirlwind of a relationship. 7, 15 It started off unhealthy and it ended unhealthy. 6, 15 I got into a lot of trouble with him.  I started partying a lot. 6, 8, 15, 19 I started skipping class, not going to practices for my sports. 6, 12, 15 I just ended up quitting everything. 19 Your junior year? 16 MK: Yes, it was my junior year. 16 Exactly.  I would still play summer softball for the city. 7, 17 I grew up with a lot of girls around here; they were playing softball as well. 7, 8, 12, 18, 19 We would do that in the summer. 17 School wise, no sports anymore. 7 AS: What do you attribute that to?  MK: Really my attention was on my boyfriend. 6, 13, 16 Those few hours after school that I would be at practice or a game or something like that I could be with him. 6, 11, 15 I didn't want to take that time away from him and be doing something that I loved. 7, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 I look back on it now and it's baffling to me that I would do that to myself. 11, 17, 19 Now I watch games on the TV and I go, ""Oh my gosh. 15 I think I could have gone to college for volleyball.  That's what everybody said. 13, 14 AS: Can we back up a minute? 11, 14, 17, 19 What did you mean by that it was unhealthy?  Did you know it was? 17 Is that in hindsight or did you know at the beginning that it was unhealthy? 17 MK: I knew at the beginning. 6, 12 When we first got together he was cheating on his girlfriend with me. 11, 12, 13, 16, 20 They broke up and then we got together. 11, 16, 20 For six and a half years it was him being unfaithful. 16 I liked the lifestyle that he was living and I hadn't started drinking yet. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 19 I hadn't started smoking cigarettes yet or doing any sort of drugs or any substances. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 When I turned 17 that's when I got into the party thing with him and started drinking a lot. 6, 8, 15, 18, 19 He would have friends that did cocaine and smoked weed and all this stuff. 7, 10, 13 Every single thing, every single substance that I've done, I've always done with him first. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 I've never done it by myself. 13 It was always with him or his friends. 7, 10, 13 With that, a couple years into our relationship my parents didn't like him from the start. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 A couple years into our relationship I started getting into a lot of trouble with him. 6, 7, 15, 16, 20 I would stay out past the curfew that I was given. 11, 14 Under 18 you have an 11 o'clock curfew or whatever.  I would always be late for that. 5, 10 I ended up getting pulled over and got a curfew ticket. 15, 18, 20 Which I think is funny now. 8, 17 I was out past 11. 8 I would lie to them about where I was going and who I was going to be with.  I was just getting into trouble with him. 15, 20 We went to a party one night and the next morning my dad was checking my spare tire in the trunk of my car and he found a loaded stolen pistol in there. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 It was one of my ex's friends who had brought it to that party. 7, 8, 13, 19, 20 I didn't know because I was cleaning out my trunk that night, throwing things in the back seat. 5, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19 They must have just have tossed it in there when I wasn't looking. 6 That morning, it was like a Sunday morning, we were going to church. 9, 19 I woke up to six squad cars in my driveway. 14 AS: How did that happen? 5 MK: My dad found it and he found a bottle of vodka back there too. 11, 17, 19 I was drinking. 15, 19 AS: Did he call the police on you then? 14, 17 MK: Yes.  Well he called my uncle who was a cop at the time. 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 He was like, ""I don't know what to do. 9, 14, 17 My uncle just told him, ""Don't touch it. 13, 16 Don't put any of your DNA, your fingerprints on it. 19 Keep it there, call the police. 14, 17 I'm sorry to tell you this but Marisa probably will go to jail at 17 years old."" 12, 13, 16 So the cops came and they put me in handcuffs and I was bawling. 13, 17, 19 I had just woken up.  I didn't know it was there. 17 I was trying to tell my dad that. 13 Of course they're not going to believe me I was out until 2 o'clock in the morning. 9 AS: You already had a history of lying? 6, 7, 12, 13, 18 MK: Yes.  AS: Had they caught you in lies at this point? 10 MK: Oh yes. 9, 14 I think I'm slick but I'm not.  [Laughs].  I try to be slick.  I just begged my dad.  I said, ""Dad please, don't let them take me. 13, 14, 20 I promise you I'll do whatever you want me to. 14 I'll obey any rules that you have."" 13 Then my dad talked to the officer. 6, 11, 13, 18 They didn't take me but I didn't have a phone, I got my car taken away. 12, 14, 20 I couldn't go out anywhere except to school. 7, 11 I had to be home by, school got out at 3:15, and I had to be home by 3:45. 11, 17, 19 That's when a lot of things started to happen. 5, 6, 15, 19 Of course I didn't obey those rules for very long. 7, 13 AS: How long do you think? 7 MK: Probably a week. 16 AS: You went from having a car, and a phone, and a very extensive social life... 7, 8, 12, 14, 18 I'm a very good manipulator. 6, 19 I got my dad to give me my car back. 11, 14, 17, 19 Then it was my car and then my cell phone, whatever else I could do to get myself out of this trouble I was in. 8, 12, 14, 20 I sweet talked him and I got everything back. 6, 11, 13, 17, 19 It was the exact same the next week. 16, 19 It was parties and my boyfriend and people that I shouldn't be hanging out with I was hanging out with. 5, 8, 13, 16 Subconsciously  I knew I shouldn't be hanging out with these people because of how I was raised and how they were raised. 5, 6, 12 Meaning that I grew up in a really good home, I have a very put together family. 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 They come from broken homes and they haven't had the best upbringing, childhood. 9, 13, 17, 19 Then I just started doing a bunch of cocaine and smoking a lot of weed every day, doing every drug under the sun that you could ever imagine at 17, 18 years old. 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 AS: How did you manage to graduate high school? 11, 15 MK: I don't know. 17 [Laughs].  I don't know. 17 I honestly couldn't tell you. 6, 12, 13 I know I had a 1.67 GPA. 17 I got low Cs. I guess in high school that's passing. 11, 17, 19 I didn't know that. 17 I thought you had to have high Cs. I remember my graduation day. 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 19 I had a bottle of vodka in the trunk of my car. 8, 14 It's June, it's hot out.  Right after I walked across the stage I went out to my car and took a shot of vodka. 14, 15, 20 My friends and I would always joke, ""We're such alcoholics, we're such alcoholics."" 7, 10, 13 I didn't know what that meant at the time. 7, 16, 17, 19 I didn't know what addiction or alcoholism was because I don't have any in my family. 7, 8, 10, 15, 17, 19 I don't have any alcoholics or addicts in my family. 7, 10, 13, 15, 19 All of the sudden here I am drinking right after I walk across the stage at graduation. 8, 14, 15, 17, 19 I tried to go to college.  AS: Why does that stand out to you?  MK: Just because I was raised in such a good home and such a good family. 5, 6, 7, 17, 19 I had discipline but it wasn't abuse which I always thought it was because I'm a teenager. 9, 10, 15 I got what I wanted and needed and then some. 9, 14 I thought that people that were alcoholics and addicts were the ones that came from broken families, the ones that are homeless, and the ones that don't have any money. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 My parents work hard for what they have. 6, 7, 12 They've worked hard their whole lives for what they have. 6, 11, 12 I've always known that but I was like, ""I can't be an alcoholic or an addict because my parents have money, because I've never been homeless or because I've never struggled with them.” 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 AS: That moment of going to the trunk of your car and drinking hot vodka. 8, 14, 15, 17, 19 Why does that stand out to you?  Is that a moment when you saw that you might have a problem? 6, 7, 15, 17 MK: Yes.  That's when I thought I had somewhat of a problem. 7, 10 I didn't have a problem. 7 I had somewhat of a problem. 7 AS: What a good way to put it. 6, 19 That's how a lot of kids think about it. 15 MK: Right.  I was 18 years old at the time. 7, 16, 19 I'm 18; alcoholics aren't until they're like 60. 10, 13 You know what I mean? 17 I remember that and then I tried to go to college at South Central Community College in Mankato. 7, 13, 15 I got an apartment out there and a job out there and I was working full time. 7, 8, 16, 19 I never went to class. 6, 12, 13 Ever.  If I was at work I would go home and sleep and then go to a party that night. 8, 17, 19 I would just not go to class. 6, 12 I would wake up on time but I wouldn't go to class. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 I remember homecoming I was running down this hill with a bottle of vodka. 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19 I trip over my own feet and I tumble down this steep hill on the street. 7, 20 I woke up the next morning after homecoming weekend and I was just like, ""Oh my God. 7, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 I never want to do that again. 13, 14 I never want to drink like that ever again."" 13, 14, 19 I was telling my parents, ""I'm not going to class. 6, 7, 12, 13 I don't enjoy going to class. 6, 12 I don't have any friends out here really. 6, 7, 8, 13 I have a couple but they're actually going to school and doing the right thing."" 7, 8, 11, 14, 18, 19 [Laughs].  They're actually enrolled in college and going and they're going to graduate unlike me. 18 I went to class maybe one day, the first day of school. 6, 11, 12, 16, 19 I hated it.  I moved back to my parents. 7, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 AS: Was that one semester?  MK: Yes.  I was still with the boyfriend. 7, 13, 16 That's really when I turned 19, no I turned 20 I think. 6, 7, 8, 18 Then I moved back here and I started partying again, doing a lot of drugs. 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 Whenever I was at home with my family or whenever we would have a family get together I would always just leave. 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I wouldn't stay. 14 I wouldn't be paying attention to anybody. 6, 18 I wouldn't be caring about anybody or anything like that. 14 I think about it now and I feel very guilty about that. 13, 17, 18 I started doing heroin in February of 2014. 6, 10, 15 AS: How did that come about? 17 MK: My boyfriend had been doing it for a few years before that. 13, 16 I had never been exposed to it or anything. 13 I caught him actually in my bathroom by my bedroom doing it. 9, 12, 18 I remember... 7, 13, 15 AS: Were your parents home? 7, 12, 17, 19 I would never bring him over when they were home. 13, 17, 19 When I knew that they left for the cabin or out of town that's when he would come over. 6, 8, 12, 17, 19 I was really close with his family and I was welcome there at any time. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 19 I caught him in my bathroom doing it. 9, 12 I was mad and I was hurt because he had been lying to me. 12, 14 Then one day we were at his friends house and I was like, ""Let me try it. 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 You're doing it and I don't see you do it and not me. 5 We've done everything together."" 11, 16, 20 AS: He didn't want you to try it? 14 MK: Nope.  I think he low-key did but he didn't put it out like that. 19 His friends were telling me, 7, 13 I did it and I remember that night I was driving home. 7, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 I didn't really feel it. 6, 7, 8, 13, 18 I didn't feel any different. 7, 13, 18 I was driving home and I was like a block down the road and I thought, ""Marisa just make it home, make it home."" 10, 17, 18, 19 My stomach was turning and I was going to get sick. 20 Right as I'm pulling in the driveway I threw up all over myself in my car, all over the steering wheel, all over my clothes. 7, 14 I'm trying to take off my clothes in the garage before I come inside. 9, 15, 17, 20 It's like 3 o'clock in the morning. 9 My mom was standing there, 17 AS: So at this point you didn't have a curfew? 10 We had a conversation when I went to college.  I told them, ""Mom, Dad I'm kind of sick of having this curfew. 13, 16 I'm 18 years old now. 16, 17 I'm an adult.""  They're like, ""Alright you can make your own decisions as you want to. 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 You get in trouble you're going to have to deal with the consequences."" 20 I was like, ""Ok, no problem."" 7, 9, 14 I didn’t think I would be getting in trouble. 15, 20 I thought I was slick. 10 [Laughs].  I threw up all over myself. 7 I walked in the house buck naked. 9, 11, 20 I told my mom, ""I spilt a Coke on myself."" 13, 16, 17 I remember going to bed and I don't remember how I got up to my room or anything like that. 7, 9, 13, 15 I woke up the next morning and I was like, ""Oh my God. 9, 14, 16, 19 Why do I feel like I need to do that again? 13, 18 I've never felt that."" 6, 13 AS: That quickly. 5 MK: I was smoking weed, doing coke; I never woke up the next morning and wanted to do it again. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 It would just be on weekends. 16 AS: Can I ask you a question? 15 Did you ever take pain pills for recreation use? 7, 9, 13, 20 MK: Nope.  AS: You went straight to injecting?  MK: I didn't inject.  I smoked.  I was doing uppers like cocaine. 10 I would smoke weed which kind of just puts you to sleep, other than that no pain pills. 19 AS: That wasn't your route into using heroin. 10 It was just...  MK: I was exposed to cocaine and then I was exposed to heroin which is uncommon. 10 Usually it is pain pills or like my parents had surgery or something or my grandma had surgery and I'm going to take their pain pills. 7, 12, 20 None of that. 12 I never was a pill popper or anything like that. 13 I never found that enjoyable. 11, 13, 18 When I started smoking heroin the next morning, it was barely even 12 hours after that. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19 I was like, ""Oh my God I need to do this every day."" 9, 14, 19 I was working in Chaska and my boyfriend lived across the street. 7, 11, 13, 16, 20 I remember I would just call him every day at work, ""You need to come to the parking lot. 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 Let's go for a cruise.""  Meaning that we're going to get high. 11, 20 ""I have a half hour lunch break. 7, 10, 16 We can just drive down the road."" 14 AS: You'd get high and come back to work? 11, 17, 19, 20 MK: I'd get high in the morning before I'd go to work. 9, 11, 20 I'd go to work for a few hours, have a lunch break and then get high in the parking lot of work. 7, 10, 11, 20 AS: And then after work probably? 12, 13 MK: Then after work of course.  What was your job?  MK: I was working at a call center, sitting there talking on the phone all day. 6, 7, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 MK: It was called Heartland America in Chaska. 13, 14, 17 It was a magazine company.  AS: Did it require much... MK: Nothing. 7 Thought.  MK: No, no thought. 10 You need to know how to type numbers and work a computer basically which I'm very good at. 6, 14, 17, 19 Nobody knew, none of my friends knew, none of my coworkers knew, none of my family knew. 6, 7, 12, 13, 19 I kept it very under wraps.  I was using for a few months. 10, 11 April is my brother’s birthday and we went out to dinner for his birthday with my family. 7, 16, 19 I decided to leave early because I just thought, ""Why do I need to be here?"" 6, 8, 10 I don't like my family at this point. 7, 9, 10, 14, 19 I don't have anything in common with them.  I was playing the victim. 19 AS: The outsider. 9 MK: Yes.  I left and I went to my friend's house who's also a user. 8, 9, 11, 13, 19 I ended up that night getting into a fight with a girl and I guess hurt her severely. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 We were doing a drug deal. 10 It was a drug deal gone bad basically. 10, 14, 17 I fought her and she ended up going to the hospital with a broken face basically. 8, 14, 17 I was arrested that night and I remember calling my mom from the Scott County Jail at 4:30 in the morning. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 I called her and said, ""Mom."" 13, 14, 17 She's like, ""Where are you?"" 9, 14 ""I'm in Scott County Jail.""  ""I'm at Scott County Jail.  My car's getting impounded. 14, 15, 20 I don't know what to tell you."" 13, 17 ""What do we need to do?""  ""You need to get a lawyer and come get me out of here."" 16, 17, 20 I ended up sitting in there for a few days. 7, 18, 19 I was released without a bail hearing or anything. 7, 14 I really don't know what happened. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17 I don't think that it was because of any human power.  I think it's because of God that I wasn't charged with anything.  To this day I do not have any charges on my record. 7, 11, 19 AS: The girl didn't press charges? 7, 12 MK: She was going to press charges but she didn't know who I was. 7, 17 She didn't have a name, she didn't have an address, and she didn't have anything. 7, 9, 11 With her injuries the state picked it up and the state didn't have any proof. 5, 17 They just had no evidence.  I wasn't charged with anything, thank God. 9 That could have been some serious jail time. 7, 13, 16, 19 My charges were aggravated robbery and assault even though I didn't use any weapons. 9 AS: You were never... 13 MK: I was never charged. 13 AS: What was the robbery?  MK: I stole $80 from her and I broke her phone. 12, 14 AS: Do you remember doing this? 7, 13, 15 I remember leaving but I don't remember why I decided to hit her. 7, 8, 13, 15, 19 [Laughs].  Then that's when my parents really are like, ""What are you doing?"" 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 I got released from jail, I came home. 7, 13, 17, 19 Before my dad picked me up I walked down the street to my friend's house to get high and then I walked back to the jail so I looked like I just got out of jail. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20 I was out for a couple hours. 7 I know. 17 AS: Did you get dope sick in there? 20 MK: I was kicking in there and I was dope sick.  To me jail for an addict is the worst place to be. 8, 13, 15 Especially if it's an addict that doesn't want to get clean. 14, 15, 16, 20 I met a lot of people in there that are users that gave me numbers to all these people where I could get drugs for really cheap. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 It was really good. 6, 7, 8, 19 Of course I take with me out of jail and I use those resources. 7, 9, 13, 20 That's when my parents really found out. 6, 7, 8, 11 I told them I had been using heroin with my ex, with my boyfriend. 10, 13, 16 AS: That was in April?

I think that the twelve steps aren't just to be applied to people who are getting sober. 12, 15, 16, 20 I think that if everybody in this world were to work the twelve steps of whatever kind you want to, the world would be such a better place. 8, 12, 14, 16, 17 Just because it's taught me how to live again and it's taught me how to be a good person. 6, 10, 11, 17, 19 It's taught me how to get down on my knees every day and pray and not just for the things that I want. 5, 14, 19, 20 Thanking my higher power for what I have and where I'm at in life. 7, 8, 11 Apologizing to people when I need to and accepting people as who they are for whatever they did and not playing the victim. 19 Just looking at myself instead of other people and judging myself instead of other people. 6, 18 Everybody has a story to tell. 13 You never know what somebody else is going through. 8, 13, 17 If everybody in this world were to work a twelve step program and actually work it and do the things they say they're going to do I really think that the hatred in this world would go away. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 It's gone away in my heart. 6, 14, 20 I can actually sit down and have a conversation with my mom now. 7, 17, 18 I can sit down and have a conversation with my dad. 7 My grandma just turned 90 on December 27 and her siblings were there that are close to her age and smell like old people [Laughs] and I was able to sit down and have a conversation with them and ask them how they're doing and how their lives are. 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18 I got to ask my grandma, ""What was your favorite memory of your life?"" 7, 8 And actually listening to what she had to say instead of going, ""Oh ok. 14, 18 I didn't really mean to ask that question."" 6, 7, 8, 15 AS: Or even that you would sit down. 7 MK: That I would even actually seem like I cared but I actually do genuinely care for people now these days. 5, 7, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 It's easier for me now to take time out of my day just to talk to you rather than really not having anything else to do but just leaving the house and doing nothing. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: Just to leave.  MK: Right, just to say I'm doing something but I'm really not doing anything. 6, 7, 8, 14 I have genuine friends in my life now. 7, 8, 13, 17 My best friend who I live with in California she has a two and a half year old son and I'm trusted with him alone at the house. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 I'm trusted driving with him and picking him up from school and dropping him off at school. 5, 6, 11, 18 He loves me as much as I love him. 17 I've never felt so much love for my best friend and her son in my whole entire life. 6, 7, 8, 13, 17 AS: That is so neat.  Did you meet her in treatment? 7, 13, 18 MK: No, funny story. 8, 13 She went to my high school out here in Minnesota. 11 She moved to Kentucky. 11, 14 She was friends with my ex-boyfriend but I had never met her before. 7, 12, 13, 16 She added me on Facebook and we kind of started chatting. 6, 15 She's been with me my whole journey of sobriety and even before that.  She knew me when...we would Facetime when I was getting high. 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 At that time we had never met face to face. 7, 12, 13, 16, 19 When I moved out to Long Beach when I got into sober living she had moved out to California as well to her dad's house. 6, 8, 9, 11, 14 I come to find out her dad lived right around the corner from my sober living. 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17 We got to meet in person after three and a half years of being friends on technology, Facebook, Facetime, Instagram. 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 We've been inseparable. 18 We live together now. 11, 16, 17, 20 We've lived together since last May. 11, 16, 20 We go to school together. 11, 16, 20 We're going to school to be nurses now. 11, 17 AS: So you're in school. 11 When did that start? 6 MK: In November.

MK: I didn't believe in myself enough. 9, 16, 20 I didn't believe I could take the time out of my day to sit and study for 8 hours. 5, 7, 9, 16, 19, 20 That's a huge blessing.  I live in a beautiful house on the golf course in Yukipa, California. 9, 11 I drive a nice car. 14 By next year 16, 19 I'll have my license as a nurse. 18 It's crazy to see where I was sleeping under bridges and outside. 5, 7, 9 Being able to take a shower every day and put makeup on and brush my teeth every day. 9, 18, 19, 20 When I went to Hazelden the first time I took my hair out of a bun after not showering for a month and a half and it was dreaded. 7, 9, 16, 19 I honest to God thought I would have to shave my head. 6, 10, 12 Now it's like I have my family in my life. 7, 8, 19 My mom's my best friend. 13, 17 She trusts me to drive her car when I'm home. 6, 14, 17, 19 AS: You don't take that for granted. 20 It's still special. 7 MK: They're letting me go out for New Year’s tomorrow night with some friends. 7, 13, 19 They're not questioning about where I'm going. 15 They asked me one time where I'm going and who I'm going to be with. 7, 16, 19 It's not, ""What time are you going to be home? 7, 16, 17, 19 What's their phone number? 12, 14 What's their address?"" 7, 9 I feel like I have my space as much as I'm giving them their space. 13, 18 We're still able to come together as a family and enjoy time together. 7, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 AS: Do you ever worry about relapse? 7, 13 MK: All the time, all the time. 7, 16, 19 I got asked the other days if I have cravings. 18, 19 Not really. 6, 7, 8 But just because I don't have cravings doesn't mean I couldn't go out and pick up something. 5 It doesn't mean I don't want it. 14 That was part of my life, it was a short amount of time I was using heroin, but it was a part of my life for that long. 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19 Really the thing that I don't... 19 I could lose my car, I could lose my house, I could lose going to school, I could lose the clothes that I have, but I never want to lose my family again. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 AS: What advice would you give to a parent who finds out that their child is using heroin, let's just keep it to heroin? 7, 9, 10, 11, 17 What advice would you give to a parent now? 7, 11, 17 MK: To a parent? 7 AS: Someone comes to you and tells you, ""I've just found out my daughter's using heroin."" 5, 10, 11, 13, 17 MK: Honestly I would tell them...what a lot of parents are being told these days is it's not your fault, you didn't do this to them. 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 I would give them my phone number if their child would ever want to call me and talk. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 Tell them to keep their boundaries strong and do what they have to do or do what they think is right. 8, 14, 17 I hate to say this but most of the time parents are right. 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 19 Parents have a very good intuition and what their gut tells them is probably what is right. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 I don't have kids of my own but I am starting to feel that with my best friend's son. 5, 6, 13, 15, 17, 18 He asks me to do something if I feel like he shouldn't do it I'm like, ""No. 9, 13, 14, 18 Let them know that there's other parents out there too. 7, 12, 17 I'd give them my mom's phone number. 11, 12, 14, 17 My mom doesn't care. 7, 14, 17, 20 I'm very open with my mom; she's very open with me. 17, 20 She asks me for my permission to give someone my phone number after the fact that she's given them my phone number. 11, 12, 14 As long as I can help somebody and as long as I'm helping my family help other people I'm good with that. 6, 7, 18, 19 AS: Do you have a sponsor and are you a sponsor? 13 MK: I do have a sponsor and I don't have any sponsees right now but I have in the past. 5, 8, 13, 14, 17 It's hard right now with school. 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 AS: It's a commitment.  MK: Not that if someone were to ask me I'd say no. 14 That's important and I honestly think that helping someone else with their sobriety and helping them get their life back is more important than me going to school at this very second. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Do I think it's important for me to go to school? 11 Yes, but when somebody's life is involved that's really become important to me. 6, 7, 8, 17, 18 AS: Have you had the same sponsor? 13 MK: I switched sponsors when I had five months clean. 11, 13, 15, 16 I've had the same sponsor ever since then. 13 I love her. 17 My life is good. 6, 7, 8, 19 AS: That's great. 7, 8 MK: It's very good. 6, 19 AS: Anything else that you've got? 8 MK: No. AS: I think that's good. 6, 19 I'm really happy for you and I'm happy to see you so happy. 5, 6, 7, 8 MK: Thank you.

It is January thirtieth and we are at my house in Minneapolis for this interview. 9, 11 You were holding a thought, so why don’t you just start with that. 6, 10, 16 WL: Well, I don’t know if I lost that thought. 10, 17 We were talking about opiates and— AS: And pain and trauma. 6, 17 I was stealing opiates at the height of the opiate epidemic. 17 AS: Where were you stealing them from?  WL: From customers.  AS: In your carpet cleaning business? 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 Let’s hold that one. 12, 16 [laughs] 10 WL: We will come back to it when it is chronologically appropriate. 11, 14, 17, 19 AS: That’s where the big jar came from you were talking about? 6, 13, 17 AS: When were you born? 5 Where did you grow up?  What was your family life like? 7, 8, 9, 14, 19 WL: I was born in 1972, Marshall, Minnesota. 5 I born to one Patricia Hanson. 5, 17 My birth name was Wade Hanson. 11, 17 I was raised by my grandmother and grandfather until I was four years old. 5, 10, 16 My grandpa, who up until that point I thought was my dad, had a massive heart attack and died. 6, 10, 14, 17 There is a blank in my life up until probably either five or six years old. 7, 8, 12, 13, 16 There is a year there where I really don’t remember anything after he died. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17 It is really cloudy. 6, 7, 8 I should probably get some therapy around that. 12, 13, 18, 20 The next memory that I have is my current stepdad coming into my life and moving into a little town called Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 I didn’t know any of this information as far as my birth name being Wade Hanson until I was fourteen years old. 9, 11, 16, 17 I didn’t know I was adopted until I was fourteen. 16, 17 It was kept a secret. 7 AS: How old was your mom when she had you? 16, 17 WL: Eighteen.  AS: She never married? 12, 13, 16 I have no idea who my dad is. 5 I have a picture of him. 7 He looks like Cheech from Cheech and Chong sitting on a comforter made of several different colored—like a quilt, or something like that. 7, 13, 18 AS: The height of the seventies?  Pants that were sewn together and a long mustache that showed his ethnicity. 7, 9, 11, 16, 20 He was very Hispanic.  That’s about all I know. 17 I never met him. 12, 13 I looked for him when I was eighteen or nineteen for a little while. 13, 20 AS: Do you know his name? 11, 17 WL: My mom told my now wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, his name was John Rost, but it just doesn’t even sound right compared to what he looked like. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I grew up in a community where ethnicity was not celebrated. 7, 19 AS: That’s a nice way to put it. 14, 19 WL: I took a multicultural class. 6, 12 I know what I am supposed to say here. 14, 17 [laughs] 10 There was a lot of shame, I’m sure. 7 I was the darkest thing in my neighborhood probably until 1981 or 1982 when the migratory employees started to come to town. 6, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 That was the first four or five years. 16 Because this is so closely tied to my opiate use and my drug use in general the first recollection I have at age five or six was being sexually molested by a female babysitter on a weekly basis. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20 Every Friday and Saturday night because my step dad played in a three piece country band, and they would leave at four or five o’clock in the afternoon and return at two or three in the morning. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 They left me and my baby sister that was probably a year or a year and a half at that time. 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 Then she would go down and the act would take place every time. 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 That was pretty impactful. 5, 7, 14 AS: You remember that? 7, 13, 15 WL: Here’s the thing. 19 I had repressed that memory until I was probably nine or ten years old. 7, 12, 13, 16 We had a little clubhouse that we built, me and the buddies back in the day, and we found a crumpled up old Playboy in a garbage somewhere. 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 We went Dumpster diving on our bicycles to find treasure. 7, 9 We found this magazine and we took it back to the clubhouse to look at it. 9, 10, 11, 17, 19 When I looked at the female anatomy everything rushed back. 11, 13, 17, 19 All the feelings. 13, 17, 18 The overwhelming loss of time, loss of location, I didn’t know where I was. 7, 16, 17, 19 I remember telling my best buddy at the time, “Carl,” I said, “There was this babysitter and she did this and this and this.” 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 Carl just was like, “What?” 9, 14 And I was like, “Yeah.” 9, 14 You know? 17 You can’t tell your mom! 13, 17 I had never told anybody. 13, 16 Not for many, many years. 16, 18 AS: So you didn’t tell your mom? 13, 17 WL: No, I didn’t tell my mother until I was thirty-three years old. 10, 13, 16 Probably almost to eight years old when that occured until my babysister got old enough to really get in the way and know what was going on. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 20 It was the full gambit of sexual molestation. 7, 20 It was not good and it warped my sense of sexuality and perceived position and appropriateness. 6, 7, 9, 19 As a young six, seven, eight year old I would grab grown women in wrong spots because I thought it was okay. 6, 10, 12, 14, 16 I didn’t know any different. 7, 17, 18 I was punished for things but I didn’t know what was going on. 5, 17, 19 My stepfather uses a belt and a stick and his hand to try to correct everything. 7, 9, 13, 16 I am really confused. 6, 7, 8, 9 I have a double bind situation going on where I have this thing going on and I can’t tell because it is a secret and if I tell I am going to get in trouble, but I’m getting punished because of the behavior and the behavior is because of the thing that I can’t tell about. 7, 13, 15, 19, 20 I started to eat. 6, 15 Eating was my first addiction. 8, 15, 16 I would eat everything and anything.  Crackers, cups of sugar, anything I could find in the house to the degree that my mother had to put a lock on the refrigerator door. 7, 9, 10, 11, 17, 19 An actual combination lock on that and on the pantry doors because I would get up in the middle of the night and eat, or I would get up earlier than they because they were out doing this band thing until four in the morning. 9, 14, 17, 19, 20 They were exhausted and drunk and they would sleep until noon. 8, 11 She would lock us in our rooms. 9 They put locks on the outside of our doors so we would just have to stay in our rooms until noon. 9, 14, 17, 19 I remember as a kid I would piss in the closet because I couldn’t get out to pee or anything. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 I would just pee in the corner of the closet. 6, 13 I had a boot that I would pee in every once in awhile and then pour it out the window. 20 I would hide food in there the night before because I knew I was going to be hungry. 6, 12, 19 I remember packs of white almond bark I would put in my underwear drawer and stack it in there because I knew the following morning I could sit and eat white almond bark. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 AS: Were you in the same room as your sister? 9, 16 WL: At first, yes. 9, 14, 16 We stayed in the same room. 9, 14, 16 There was a time where we had to separate because I think I was being inappropriate with her. 7, 16, 19 They separated us in two different rooms. 7, 9, 18 We would talk to each other through the doors. 6, 17, 19 I would say, “Go holler for mom.” 14, 17 When she would holler she would come. 17 When I would holler for mom she wouldn’t. 17 I would entice her, “Go holler for mom.” 17 This is all normal. 18 This is just a stage. 15 [laugh]  You laugh because otherwise you cry, obviously.  I ate and ate and ate and at nine or ten years old I was pretty obese. 5, 7, 14, 16 I was getting teased I remember. 7, 13, 15, 20 Uncles used to grab my fat rolls and squeeze and shake them. 9 They would pinch so hard that it would leave black and blue marks. 6 It was as if they were going to try to rip it off me.  Again, I’m this dark skinned, young—the word they would use was bastard. 6, 9 They would call me a little bastard child. 9, 14, 17, 20 I didn’t even know what that was. 17 I ended up using it one time when my stepdad was around. 7, 10, 16, 18, 19 I was mad or something and I said bastard and he came at me with a wrench in his hand and ended up cutting my brow. 7, 13, 14, 17 He said, “We don’t use that language.” 9, 13, 14, 15 And I didn’t even know it was language. 15, 17 That’s what my uncles called me. 13, 14, 17 I didn’t even know that was a swear word. 17 I was learning. 5 I was getting it down one cut at a time. 7, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 I ate to soothe.  By age twelve was my first drink. 15, 16, 19 I remember distinctly this young kid came over to the house and he had a can of Tab in his hand. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 I said, “Give me a drink of that” and he said, “No, you don’t want any of that.” 13, 14, 19 I said, “Yeah. 13, 14 Give me a drink.” 19 He said, “You don’t want none of this.” 12, 13, 14 I said, “What is it?” 13, 14 He said, “It’s whiskey.” 13, 14 I was like, “I want some!” 9, 14 You can’t handle it.” 13 I grabbed that can away from him and guzzled half of it. 16, 20 I remember him getting mad because I was drinking all his whiskey. 7, 13, 15, 19 It was Tab and Sloe gin.  I’ll never forget that warmth in my belly and how fuzzy my mind felt. 6, 13, 20 That overwhelming warmth.  It was almost as if I was seeing the world through new eyes. 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 15 Everything was brighter. 8, 14 I could run faster, jump higher, ride my bike faster. 8, 11, 17 I loved it. 17 I just recalled that my stepdad had some of this and it was in the basement. 7, 13, 14, 16, 17 They had a whole liquor cabinet .  A bar. 12 I was like, “We can get more now!” 9, 14, 17, 20 He said, “Okay!” 13, 14 So, the first time I drank I got intoxicated to puking because I didn’t know how much was enough. 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Now, with my addiction you can see that I had this propensity to escape into whatever I could find. 5, 7, 8, 9, 15, 20 Having that I was like, “Okay, I am going to drink this.” 9, 14, 19 Twelve, thirteen, and fourteen— 16 AS: Did you get caught at that point? 10 Actually, I didn’t.  My parents were very removed from parenting. 7, 11, 12, 14 They were actually just like people that lived in the same house. 9, 11, 16, 18 We took care of ourselves. 7, 14, 20 We parented ourselves. 7 They would throw down a couple of bags of Doritos and a frozen pizza and they’d leave. 7 Probably at about twelve I started babysitting my nine year old sister, my six year old half brother, and my next half brother was three. 6, 7, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 I was taking care of them at age twelve and stealing from the old man’s liquor cabinet the second they walk out the door. 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 That works. 8 Did you get a baby sitting badge? 7, 18, 20 [laughs] 10 WL: I went to babysitting training, but omitted that I used alcohol. 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 20 I didn’t want to lose my badge. 13, 14 [laughs] 10 From eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve it was all food until I found liquor. 11, 12 It was quicker, so there was no reason to continue to eat. 7, 10, 17, 19 I still had a hard time with food and portion distortion and governing my amounts and kinds. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 There was always this lack of food in our house. 9, 10, 11, 12 We were poor, we didn’t have much money. 7, 12 We had government cheese, powdered milk, WIC [Women, Infants, and Children] came out about that time. 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 Food was a commodity that was scarce. 14 When it did come around— AS: When it was there you ate as much as you could. 17, 18 WL: All of it to the point where my mother would not store food in open areas. 7, 10, 12, 20 My other siblings used food as their comfort as well. 8, 9, 12 She became obese very quickly because of it. 5, 13, 17 It was a great way to escape into Doritos or a frozen pizza instead of thinking of how shitty life is. 7, 8, 10, 18, 19 How we don’t get encouraged and loved. 15, 17, 20 There was no parenting at all. 7 Again, we lived with them. 11, 16 The drinking continued on an every other day or every day basis to the degree that I started stealing beer from garages around the community. 6, 7, 15, 19, 20 In Minnesota there is this thing where you have the house refrigerator and then you have the garage refrigerator. 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 The garage refrigerator is full of beer and liquor and wine coolers. 7, 15, 20 And sometimes old cake from graduation or something. 7, 12, 16, 19 You break into a garage and you steal a case of Stross thirty pack and a cake because you are going to get hammered and then maybe eat some cake after. 7, 10, 13, 15, 16 So, that was always a treat. 7, 10 We would steal beer for quite a long time there. 7, 16, 19, 20 The alcoholism really got to a point where I would drink at school. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19 I remember taking paneling off the wall in my bedroom—a whole four by eight sheet of paneling—and I pulled the nails out, pulled the paneling away, and then on the cross member two by fours I stacked [unclear beer name] beers inside the wall when I would steal from these garages. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20 I had several cases of these beers stored in the walls. 7, 12, 13, 20 That way when I was quarantined to my room and locked in there I was okay. 9, 14 I could survive because I had several cases of beer in the wall. 12, 13, 20 My parents have since sold that house and I really thought I want to go back and pull that paneling—I wonder if they ever remodeled because to pull that off there there were empty cans of beer in that wall. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 Lots.  There was another spot I put empties. 10, 19 Another piece of paneling that I took off where I left a four foot portion and then I crumpled them and put them in the wall in the insulation. 8, 19 Probably not much of an ‘r’ value there with the aluminum.  [laughs] 10 I wonder if some of the cans were tin?  No, I don’t think I was that old. 16 The drinking got really sickening for me to the point where I would buy booze—I would get other adults in the community to buy me booze. 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 19, 20 I started working for a dairy farmer out of town and there was this man named Chizzy and he was one of the hired hands and he was an alcoholic. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 19 I think that out of all things I have this real intuitiveness. 5, 7, 19 As soon as I saw this guy I knew he was an alcoholic. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13 I knew he was a drinker. 6, 12, 19 I went up to Chizzy and I said, “Listen, if you get me a six pack of beer tonight I’ll buy you a six pack.” 13, 14, 19, 20 He said, “I better not do that.” 13, 14, 17 I said, “Come on.” 13, 14 “Alright.” 8, 14 So, that became our arrangement. 13, 17 He got a six pack then I got a six pack. 13 Pretty soon I would get a thirty pack of Strauss and he would still get a six pack because Chizzy started to rely on my income for his alcohol. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, 20 That’s how I kept him.  I just made sure that he always knew that I was going to hook him up almost every day. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 19 I became the guy to get alcohol from in ninth or tenth grade. 6, 10, 13, 17, 19, 20 If you needed beer you came to Wade, but I’m charging a premium. 7, 9, 13, 17, 20 If they want a case of beer it’s going to cost them double. 14, 20 One for you and I get one. 20 I would store it in my room. 7, 9 I would, at times, literally have hundreds of beers. 7, 16, 19, 20 Warm, in my room, stored. 7, 9 I drank warm beer and I didn’t care. 7, 14, 18, 20 I would slam them by the threes and fours and get the buzz on. 7, 20 It wasn’t for the flavor.  I graduated to alcohol and liquor and whiskey and I just got tired of beer. 7, 10, 11, 20 I went to everclear and it was the next level. 9, 13, 16, 19 Until I started blacking out and wandering around town and didn’t know where I was or how I got there. 6, 15, 17 Where’s my bicycle.  Pretty soon it was, 5, 7 Where did I leave my truck?  When I was sixteen I ended up getting and 1971 K-Ten Blazer. 15, 20 That probably was a bad mistake. 12, 13, 20 I never did get a DUI; I was smart enough to know that if I was going to drink I was going to walk. 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I just knew I couldn’t drive. 6, 12, 14 I was not that good. 6, 19 I was a sloppy drunk. 8, 11 I didn’t want to drive. 14 It was too nervewracking for me.  I like to find a spot in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of people, or towards the end with just myself, and just drink. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 That’s how it went until I was seventeen years old when I was introduced to marijuana. 16 I took a job at Kentucky Fried Chicken and one of the employees who was an adult said to me, “Hey, I’m going to consult the dugout on break. 7, 10, 13, 14 Like you, I did the same thing. 19 Eyebrows down and I was like, What the hell does that mean? 9, 14 I didn’t want him to think I wasn’t cool, so I looked at him and said, “Sure.” 7, 13, 14 Breaktime comes around and we stand outside. 7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 He pulls out this little wooden box and puts this little steel bat in there and he goes, “Here.” 19, 20 I said, “Go ahead. 12, 13, 14 You go first” because I didn’t know how to do it! 16, 17 [laughs] 10 I had no idea how to do it. 5 AS: You had a good sense of how to get somebody else to show you. 6, 8, 9, 19, 20 WL: “You go ahead, go ahead.” 12 I’ll watch. 15 I’ll learn. 5 He hits this oneie [a smoking device], smokes his weed, and hands it to me and I did it. 10, 12, 13, 19 I think I took two, maybe three puffs, and then we went back in at the end of the break and I thought, This did nothing. 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19 I hate weed!  It’s stupid.  Ten minutes later I’m giggling. 5, 14, 16 I just can’t stop laughing.  We are throwing chicken across the kitchen, into the friers, I mean, I’m just doing stuff and it is the funnest, most funniest day in my entire life. 7, 8, 19 I can still remember today how we played with flour, throwing food, giggling at patrons as they are coming in. 5, 7, 12, 13, 15, 19 I was so in love with marijuana I thought, Where were you when I needed you most? 9, 10, 16, 17 Where were you when I was eight and nine years old? 16 I could have used you then, but welcome to my wonderful world. 9, 12, 17 We are going to have such a wonderful love affair. 17 I think I probably stopped drinking almost immediately. 12, 13, 15, 19 I asked him if I could get a little bit of that to go. 20 I asked him how I could get it. 20 He would sell me joints for a while until I said, “I can’t afford however many dollars for each joint. 13, 14, 18, 19 How much for a bag of that?”  Within a couple of weeks I’m walking around with a bag of pot in my pocket everyday. 6, 7, 10, 16, 18, 19 That became my new love affair. 6, 13, 17 In the tenth grade I met this gal who I really was head over heels for. 6, 7, 8, 12, 19 She was in college and I was in tenth grade and I thought that was great. 7, 8, 10, 19 I had scored. 7 I definitely scored. 7, 14 She was cute, but she didn’t like weed at all. 9, 14 I had to hide it.  That was hard to do because it’s stinky. 6 There was a lot of fighting back and forth. 5, 11, 13, 17, 19 “You can’t do that, but it is okay to drink.” 14, 19 That was the social expectation in my community: drinking was fine, but don’t smoke weed. 14, 15, 18, 19 Don’t be a druggie. 10 That’s what they would call them. 14, 17 It’s okay if you are bombed off your ass with alcohol, but not marijuana. 10, 14, 16 When I met her I tried really hard to moderate. 6, 7, 8, 12 I tried to not use, and it wasn’t easy. 9, 11 When I tried to stop using marijuana I’d go back to alcohol. 10, 11, 16, 17, 19 It was like, I can’t do this. 9, 14 She wound up getting pregnant when I was in the tenth grade. 7, 15, 19, 20 Now, I’m going to be a dad.  Now I need to get my poop in a group. 18, 20 This is not a good idea to do this and try to be a dad. 5, 6, 19 School is not good. 6, 19 I am starting to experience this—looking back on it I can see it plainly today—there’s this emotion disregulation that has happened because of all the prior stuff. 5, 6, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 I go from zero to one hundred with anger.  So quickly. 5 AS: At this age, you mean? 15 Throwing things, breaking car windows, slashing tires. 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, 20 I don’t know if this is incriminating, but we’ll say I think the limits are out, but my principal at one point told me, “You’re nothing but a piece of shit. 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 You’re going to end up in prison before you even graduate.” 7, 8, 17 He called me a bunch of names and I walked out of his office. 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 That night I went back to school and I cut every wire in his brand new Chevy S-10 that I could to teach him a lesson. 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 That you don’t fuck with me.  I was that kind of person. 10, 17 Very malicious.  If you wronged me I will burn you’re house down. 6, 7, 9, 11 I will cut you’re car up. 7, 14 I will do something to hurt you. 14 I will do something to retaliate. 7 I can plainly see today that that was supressed anger and emotion from all the PTSD that I was dealing with at the time. 5, 7, 16, 19 I didn’t know how to deal with it. 17 If I wasn’t self medicating it was coming out other ways. 5, 7 In the eleventh grade I joined the military. 19 AS: What happened with the pregnancy? 5, 7 Zach was born on the sixth of November in my eleventh grade year. 5, 16, 19 I went on about being a teenager and a dad. 15 I went to basic training through my eleventh and twelfth year. 8, 16, 17 It was called spit training at that time. 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I went to basic and then came home for my senior year. 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 I was excused from ninth grade English all together. 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 I never took English. 13 Don’t tell my master’s program that. 8, 13 [laughs] 10 “Do you have all your credits?” 7 “Everything but ninth grade English.” 19 My senior year the principal and I had an understanding that I only needed to come to school twice a week. 9, 11, 16, 17 As long as I showed up and did the tests I didn’t have to do anything else. 7, 8, 9, 13 I worked two or three jobs at the time. 7, 12, 15, 16, 19 I worked at Perkins at night where I bused tables. 9, 12, 18, 19 I worked at Godfather’s Pizza during the rushes to deliver pizza’s, and another restaurant job someplace, but I can’t remember. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 But I had three jobs. 15 I finally fought back at that point with my stepdad. 10, 11, 16, 17, 19 I omitted most of this, but he used to hit me with everything. 9, 19 He used to have a two by four that he carved his hand into. 9, 13, 14 It said Board of Education on it. 13, 14 It literally was a fucking two by four.  When he would hit me I would put my hands behind my back to try to guard my ass and he’d break a finger periodically. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 That pinky finger right there has been broken so many times. 7, 8, 14, 16, 18, 19 It is just part of the deal, but I would never cry and I prided myself on the fact that I would never cry. 8, 13, 17 I remember him asking the question: 7, 13, 15 “Have you had enough?” 16, 20 My response: No. 7 He would bring it again.  Whack, whack, whack.  He would keep hitting until he was tired. 7, 17, 19 Guess who won?  You can beat the shit out of me, but you will not break my will. 7, 10, 19 It will not happen. 5 That has carried over into adulthood, of course. 14 AS: It also shows a very strong core person. 7, 9, 10, 17 WL: Tenacity.  Unending tenacity.  AS: Whatever we want to call it it is a survival— WL: 14, 17 He called it stubborn. 5, 13, 14, 17 I like to shift it into tenacity! 9, 14 AS: It is also a survival mechanism.  WL: I would just go to the other place. 8 When I’m getting hit I would just go to the other place where it didn’t hurt. 8, 14, 15, 19, 20 I didn’t feel anything. 13, 18 I can hear it. 14 I can see it. 5 I can’t feel it. 13, 18 It never did work. 13 I think he threw me up on the cupboard one morning. 7, 9 It was bright and early. 6, 8, 14 I had come home and I was drinking and he punched me in the face, and once in the gut and then threw me up on the counter. 7, 15, 17, 19 He was hitting me over and over and my mother got involved. 10, 19 She was crying and grabbing onto him.  He hit her with his elbow as he is coming back to hit me again. 7, 11, 17, 19 That’s when it ended.  I came back at him. 11, 13, 17, 19 It wasn’t with a knife.  I just came back at him with all I had and it wasn’t enough. 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 After all of that I had had enough. 16, 20 I didn’t come back. 11, 17, 19 I moved out. 11, 14 Went and stayed with friends for a while. 7, 13, 14, 16 I ended up buying a 1974 Schult mobile home. 17, 19, 20 They rented to me out at the skyrise mobile village. 7, 15 AS: Were you seventeen?  Yes, seventeen years old. 16 AS: This is all still in Sleepy Eye, New Ulm area. 7 Even within that, at fourteen years old I had found out that I was adopted by him and it was this huge shellshock of, You have to be fucking kidding me. 11, 14, 15, 16 You beat me from the time I was able to remember until I was fourteen and you’re not even my fucking dad? 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 You don’t get to do that. 20 It was at fourteen, fifteen when I started fighting back. 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 I’ll get to this later, but there has been a shift today where it’s not like that anymore. 5, 7, 16, 19, 20 He’s very remorseful, timid, and apologetic in his way. 7, 19, 20 We don’t talk about it, of course, we do the Minnesota thing. 6, 19 [laughs] 10 Even as a psychotherapist I know not to touch that. 17 What good is it going to do? 6, 19 Shame him?  Make him feel terrible that he was unable to parent in an effective manner? 7, 13, 18 He was born and raised by an alcoholic, my grandfather, anyways. 5, 10, 13 You just do what you learn and that’s what he did. 5 Going back to progression. 7, 11, 17, 19 From my senior I had to go back to AIT, which is advanced infantry training. 8, 11, 17, 19 I went to Newark, New Jersey.  It was during that time that my then fiance was coming into being twenty-one years old, visiting bars. 7, 12, 16, 19 I had learned while I was active duty that she cheated on me. 5 I wasn’t there to break shit and hurt her and retaliate, so I just shut off. 7, 10, 14, 19 I shut down all my emotions.  I shut down everything and was like, You’re done. 7, 9, 14 You’re dead to me. 7 That was pretty much how it went. 5, 7, 14 I went back home after AIT. 11, 17, 19 There was this brief time where we tried to make it work, but I couldn’t let go of the fact that she had been with someone else. 7, 8, 16, 18, 19 I took a job in Iowa just to get away. 20 I remember driving away that day with all my shit in that same K10 Blazer driving to Iowa with her holding Zach and running down the road begging me not to leave. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 I never turned around. 13, 18 I took this job at another restaurant down there and lived in a little house by myself. 7, 9, 11, 16, 20 I would assistant manage this restaurant during the day and hold on all day until I could get Stauss at night and drink. 7, 15, 16, 19, 20 It gets rid of all of the pain. 20 I would fill up these to-go cups of beer—like six of them every night out of the keg—and it wouldn’t cost me anything. 9, 14, 19, 20 AS: From the restaurant? 7, 16 I would go home and drink these six large drinks of beer nightly until I’m puking. 17, 19, 20 One day I got promoted to manager and they moved me to Indianola, Iowa and I’m still doing the same behavior, but moderating a little bit. 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20 Not by much.  I had been introduced to a lot more by then.  I was introduced to cocaine and methamphetamine. 10, 12 This was in 1993 and 1994 when crank was big in Iowa.  That was when I met my now current wife. 7, 12, 17 She was going to Simpson College at the time and she walked in after a football game on October third. 7, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. 9, 14, 20 She comes up, puts her order in, and I’m being Joe-Cool and I say, “It’s on me.” 14, 17, 19 Didn’t card her, didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 I was just giving her the stare the whole time she was in the restaurant. 7, 16, 19 Just straight up cute. 14 She comes up and asks for another beer and of course it’s on me and we would chit chat for a little bit and then she goes and sits down. 7, 17, 19, 20 The one thing about me is I don’t think I have ever asked a woman out ever in my life. 7, 8, 13, 19 It goes back to being sexually molested by a woman, you know, I’m intimidated by women in most cases. 11, 12, 17, 19 Of course, being a psychoanalyst I’m going to analyze my own behavior.  If it wasn’t for my wife, who was the girl that I gave beer to, she called me that night at home. 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 One of my employees called and said, “Hey, the girl that you gave that beer to? 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 She called in and wants your number.” 6, 13, 14, 17 I’m like, “Yeah, idiot, give it to her! 9, 11, 14 You have to call me to ask that? 14, 17 Dumb!  Give her the number.” 14 She calls. 7, 14, 17 AS: It is appropriate for him to call and ask. 14, 17 [laughs] 10 WL: Yeah, but I think I was nineteen or twenty years old at the time. 7, 16, 19 I didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 She could be an axe murderer. 7 It’s a female!  Have her call! 14, 17 Because I don’t have the gumption to say, “Hey, you’re hot. 7, 14 Do you want to go out?” 14 That wouldn’t have happened. 5 That has never happened for me. 5, 13 She calls me at home and said, “Hey, I just wanted to call and say thanks for the beer.” 7, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 Cool.  Great.” 7 “I’m going to this frat party. 8, 19 Do you want to go?” 14 That was not okay, because I was not frat party material. 8, 14, 19 Even the word frat party doesn’t fit. 8, 19 I am lower than blue collar.  I don’t go to school. 11 I had asked to go to college when I was in the eighth or ninth grade and my mother laughed at me. 10, 19 I don’t go to college.  I said, “Yeah. 13, 14 Tell you what why don’t you come over to my duplex first and I’ll get changed and we can go from here.” 5, 6, 16, 17 “Okay.”  She comes over. 17 We never leave the house. 9, 11, 13 I got her drunk or high that first night and we had sex on the living room floor. 6, 8, 9, 11, 16, 19 I didn’t feel comfortable going to that frat party. 8, 13, 18, 19 Plus, she’s hot as heck and didn’t— AS: Didn’t want to watch other guys looking at her. 6, 8, 14, 15 She left that night. 8, 19 The following day she called me again and we have this real quick she wants to talk to me everyday and I’m enthralled by it. 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 19 She is just cute as a button and I had just got done talking to my old fiance about three days prior to meeting her. 6, 14, 16, 18, 19 I had talked her into moving down to Iowa and it was because I was lonely. 6, 12, 13 I wanted to uphold my responsibility in being a father to my son who was now two. 7, 14, 16, 17 I convinced her and she rented a U-Haul and she put everything in the U-Haul and she was coming the following Friday. 7, 19 That same Friday. 19 The weekend happened with this new girl and she keeps calling me and my old fiance moves in and puts all of her things in my duplex. 5, 6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 This new girl is telling me, “I don’t care if you smoke weed. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20 That’s fine with me. 14 You can drink. 19 I don’t care if you do that.” 7, 14, 20 I’m thinking,  My finance is not okay with that. 14 I didn’t know what to do. 17 Fiance is there about two days and we get into our first fight. 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 Immediately I’m thinking, You’re gone. 7, 12 My fiance leaves for the weekend and she’s coming back the following Monday with her mom with more stuff. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 Colleen comes to the house, this new girlfriend, she stays, the following morning she is in the shower and I go to work. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 My fiance comes home, raps on the door several times with a ‘who the fuck is in there’ type screaming directive, and this new girlfriend comes walking out in this skimpy green robe and waits until my fiance collects up all of her belongings out of the bathroom and walks out. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 She grabs as much as she can and leaves and calls me—the girlfriend calls me—at work: “Did your fiance have blondish-brown hair?” 7, 12, 13, 14, 17 “I think she was just here.”  “Oh shoot.  Okay.  “Yeah, she screamed at me and I thought she was going to hit me, but she didn’t. 7, 10, 19 She left. 8, 19 I think her mother was here.” 10 I’m like, Oh great her mother was here, too. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 I’ve got this history with this woman, I can’t stand to be alone, so I have her move down and then my girlfriend is in the bathroom. 9, 12, 13, 14 I had to make a decision immediately. 7, 12, 18 The desicion was already made, but I can say this with all authority that when I made that decision I didn’t love the new girl at all, but that was the choice I made. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 AS: Would you say it was because of her tolerance for you’re using? 7, 10, 14 WL: Definitely.  She was okay with it. 14 It was the first time I had ever heard that from any girl. 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 It was always, I don’t want you to do that. 10, 14 There was always this control factor. 10 So, that drew me to her. 7 That was the deciding factor.  You allow me to do drugs, so you’re in and she’s out. 7, 10 That started quite a long love affair with drugs not her. 6, 7, 10, 15, 17 She ends up moving in with me.  We cohabitate for quite awhile. 19, 20 Her parents are really—I don’t want to say strict and Christian—but they have a moral value system. 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 You don’t live together before marriage. 11, 15, 16, 20 You do this the way it is supposed to be done. 14 My wife—that girl—is telling her parents that she is living on campus, but she’s really living with me so they are paying for a dorm, and she’s living with me and we are engaging in all kinds of drug use. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18 We start using meth and cocaine. 6, 10, 12 Mostly meth at the time because cocaine was cheap and hard to come by. 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19 We get involved with some people that are cooking so they are making it in their bathtub. 20 We get it cheap and I start selling it on the side. 6, 9, 19, 20 I’m selling it here and there. 9, 19 There’re several years there when I just went from job to job because I could never keep a job because of the drug use. 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17 Colleen and I got married in ‘93. 12, 16 Six months after meeting her I asked her to marry me. 6, 11 I lost my job at the restaurant because of drug use. 7, 9, 10, 16 I was manipulating money to meet a bonus structure for labor. 7, 12 I ended up getting caught, so I got fired. 7, 15, 20 Fired meant that I wasn’t just going to find another job, I was going to go home. 7, 9, 17, 19 I don’t have any money. 7, 12 I went back to Sleepy Eye, Minnesota and lived in my parents’ basement. 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 I got this girl from Iowa who is calling me, is okay with me smoking dope, and my brain went, How do I get out of Sleepy Eye? 5, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20 I’ll ask her to marry me.  I drove down to Iowa.  I went to her dorm room and got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. 9 She said yes. 9, 13, 14 I did that so I could get out of Sleepy Eye. 20 I didn’t do it because I loved her. 17 I did it because I wanted out and I wanted to go back to drug use again. 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19 I couldn’t use weed and alcohol and methamphetamine in my parents’ basement and get away with it. 7, 9, 10, 12, 20 Her parents helped us get an apartment in Clive, which is a suburb of Des Moines. 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 20 They said, “If you are going to get married we are cutting her off from nursing school. 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 “Okay, fine.” 14 Well, I ended up slinging dope and working in a restaurant to pay for her college. 7, 16, 18 I don’t know how much weed, but by the quarter pound we would buy it and flip it, buy it and flip it. 10, 17, 20 AS: So she could go to nursing school? 11 WL: So she could go to nursing school! 11 I put her through nursing school. 11, 19 She is a great nurse. 7, 8 She is the director of nurses now. 7, 17 The whole foundation on which she stands is based in drug sales. 10, 11 That’s how I financed that.  Much more lucrative than trying to work an hourly wage. 15 She graduates, gets a job as a nurse, and I am constantly trying to tell her to bring some fentanyl home. 13, 17, 19, 20 Some kind of an opiate of some sort. 8 Tell them that it fell on the ground and you threw it out. 7 Big deal.  Bless her heart her upbringing prevented her from ever doing it. 6, 7, 13, 14 She would never do it. 13 I stopped asking. 15 It was not going to happen. 5 I ended up learning that I wanted to be a white collar person. 5, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19 I was up late one night at two or three in the morning and I was watching Carleton Sheets. 5, 9, 15, 19 You can buy property no money down. 7, 12, 20 I know this sounds funny, but when you’re an uneducated kid from Sleepy Eye, Minnesota you don’t know how to become anything other than a factory worker. 7, 8, 15, 17, 18 Make calendars.  You don’t know anything. 17 I am watching this TV program and I’m half soused and I thought, I’m just going to do that. 8, 9, 10, 15, 16 I’m going to be a white collar worker. 15, 19 I am going to get some suits and I’m going to buy and sell real estate. 7, 17, 19, 20 I am going to flip houses. 9, 11 No money down! 7, 12 The longer I am sitting there I am thinking if they make a lot of money I bet realtors make a lot of money. 7, 12, 18, 20 I looked at my wife at the time and I said, “How do you become a realtor?” 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 She said, “I don’t know.” 13, 14, 17 I called a realtor the following morning. 7, 9, 13, 14, 17 I said, “Hey, I was watching this program last night and I was thinking about how to become a realtor.” 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 He said, “Well, who am I talking to?” 6, 13, 14 I told him my name and he said, “My name is Mark Grossman. 11, 13, 14, 16 I’m with Iowa realty.” 7 We talked for a little bit and I said, “Yeah. 6, 13, 14, 20 I really want to do this.” 6, 7, 8, 14 He said, “You sound like you’ve got the gift of gab. 13, 14 Why don’t you come down to the office?” 17, 18 I went down and there and he told me I was hired. 7, 13, 16 He said, “I’ll put you through real estate school, you’ll get your license, and you can work for us. 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 You will get this commission rate. 20 Every time you sell a house for one hundred thousand dollars you get three percent of any home you sell.” 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I was like, “Three percent. 9, 14 Are you kidding me? 15 Done! 12 I studied hard and I really applied myself. 6, 7, 8, 17 This was the first time that I moderated my alcohol, I moderated my marijuana use to very low amounts. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 A little weed here or there, but nothing to where I am losing continuity. 20 I am still plugged in. 7 I am learning. 5 I studied hard. 6, 17 I don’t know how many weeks this course was, but I had to take my boards and I got a ninety-eight. 16, 17, 18, 20 I got a ninety-eight.  I knew this stuff by the back of my hand. 6, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 I was going to become a millionaire. 7, 17, 18 I started working for Iowa Realty and I slowly realized that it was not what I thought it was going to be. 6, 7, 10, 15 You sit in these open houses for a long time and you don’t have anyone that calls you and you have to make cold calls. 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I met some people that were selling conventionally listed properties on contract. 9, 12, 19 Basically you take this conventionally listed property and you create a contract, sell it to a third party investor, give cash to the seller, enough to pay off the brokerage fees, and a contract to the buyer enough so that I get paid, the broker gets paid, the seller gets their money, but the people who buy get an inflated price with an inflated interest rate. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I put adds in the paper saying: Bad credit? 7, 14, 19 No problem. 7 I can get you a house. 9, 11, 20 Call Wade.  The phone rang and rang and rang. 12, 14 In the first year I think I did forty-three thousand dollars in income because I was closing deal after deal. 16, 17, 18 It was very shoddy because I was putting people into a fifty thousand dollar house, and they were signing notes for a seventy-five thousand dollar contract with a fourteen to eighteen percent interest rate. 7, 9, 11, 16, 19 They were not getting anything that was going to end up being theirs for seven years and then going back to the owner. 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 Or, in this case, back to the contract holder, which was the third party investor out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: This is what happened with the housing market. 5, 10 WL: Yeah, it’s illegal now. 17 [laughs] 10 I am to thank for that. 9 AS: You were just part of it. 8 WL: The other part is that during the open house period I found that using open houses as meeting places to do dope deals was the most protective thing I could ever do. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20 I had a key code for every listed property in the whole entire city of Des Moines. 7 I ended up getting in contact with some people that were a part of certain organizations that I really don’t want to get into. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 We would move larger quantities through these residential homes because they were empty. 7, 9, 14, 17, 19 I would let them know: don’t show up with shitty cars and thumping music. 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 Show up in a suit and tie.  Show up in your grandmother’s Ford Tempo, and you walk in as though you are interested in buying my house. 7, 9, 10, 11, 20 AS: Were these houses that were empty as in completely empty? 9, 11, 14 No one was living in them? 6, 12 WL: Correct. 7 They were prospective homes. 17, 19 AS: Oh, okay for builders. 14 WL: Some vacant properties because they have been gone for awhile and they are looking to sell them. 6, 19 I would pick the ones that I knew nobody was coming around to. 5, 6, 7, 12, 18 We wouldn’t stay long, but it was an easy spot to do a switch of money and dope and not have problems. 7, 10, 11, 12, 14 I was the go-to person. 10, 17 I was the one to facilitate the transaction more than anything else, but I took my part, which was money and dope at the time. 7, 8, 12, 16, 19 AS: What was it at that time that you were using? 7, 10, 16, 19 WL: Crank.  It was all crank back then. 11, 17, 19 It was pure and clean. 7, 15, 16 It was biker crank.  AS: It was cocaine? 10 Very much methamphetamine. 10, 12 Not coke. 20 All of a sudden we have this situation where there is an investigation. 7, 17 The investigation was getting bigger and bigger and the name RICO came out. 11, 13, 15, 17, 20 I said we are leaving. 13, 14 We are done, we are out, and we are moving.  At the time I had a friend moving to Kentucky with his wife who was a postmaster. 7, 12, 13, 16, 19 We asked if we could go with and said we were sick of Des Moines. 13, 14 Maybe we can crash with you guys for a couple of weeks so we can find a place? 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16 They said yes. 9, 13, 14 AS: What is RICO?  WL: RICO: Investigation Racketeering [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations].  AS: Oh, with the business? 9, 12 WL: It wasn’t the realty business. 7, 9, 12 It was the dope deal and everyone that was involved with what we were moving.  To be implicated in something like that meant I could do some real time and I don’t do time. 7, 16, 19 That’s just not me.  I did one day in jail my whole entire life and that was enough for me. 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 20 AS: You were deciding to clean up your act at this point? 10, 15, 16 WL: Well, no.  [laughs] 10 We are just out, we are just leaving.  We sold as much as we could and left what we couldn’t sell and we went. 8, 16, 19 We started over. 6, 15 I took a job as a bartender and my wife took a job as the steady-Eddy she is as a nurse. 12 She got a transfer with the company that she was with in Iowa, so that worked to our advantage. 12, 15 We just tried to settle into our new lives living in this foreign land called Kentucky. 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 17 I took a job with a country club. 10 It was the oldest most prestigious: Harmony Landing Country Club. 7, 16 It was just old money. 7, 12, 16 A lot of old money. 7, 12, 16 I learned how to serve and how to be a good servant. 5, 6, 19 I put the fork and the knife in the right spot, how to pour mint juleps, how to accept hundred dollar bills as tips. 8, 10, 14, 19 How to drink vodka and Diet Coke so that I don’t gain weight and they don’t smell it. 19 A year after that, of course, I got fired for being drunk on the job. 7, 8, 11, 16 Whoops.  I knew I shouldn’t have drank that gin that night. 6, 12, 18, 19 So, I stole alcohol from them for quite awhile. 10, 19 There is this underculture of drugs. 7, 10 Just to ask somebody in a mixed grouping if they partake is just code enough. 8, 16, 18, 20 “So, do you partake?” 8, 20 You don’t even have to say the word. 14 It doesn’t even have to be what you do.  It is “Do you partake.” 8, 20 AS: If you say partake to someone who doesn’t they will know. 8, 14, 17, 20 And you go, “Oh, nevermind. 6, 13 I thought you were somebody else.” 8, 10 [laughs] 10 There is this underculture where you kind of take care of each other. 7, 14, 20 When you are out you ask somebody else and they will cover you and back and forth and that is how it all works. 5, 8, 11, 17, 19 I soon became a part of that culture again in Kentucky. 5, 7, 8, 13, 17 I battled it.  The crank followed us down there.  I ended up having my first psychotic break and it was after a nine-day stint where I was awake for nine days and I had been playing around with the shotgun for however many days. 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 I tried to commit suicide by sticking the shotgun in my mouth that night. 10, 19, 20 Obviously I didn’t pull the trigger, but the following day I woke up and I was broken. 19 I just needed to get this fixed. 9, 20 Again, I don’t know what to do. 17 I go and asked my wife and I said, “Hey, when someone is this fucked up what do they do?” 12, 13, 14 She said, “I don’t know either. 13, 14, 17 I will talk to my medical director and find out.” 6, 7, 9, 11 I said, “Don’t use my name!” she said, “Of course I’m not going to use your name.” 9, 11, 13, 14 She finds out there is a place you can go for treatment and you get treatment and there it is. 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 20 I’m like, “Okay, that’s what we’ll do. 9, 14 I’ll get treatment and I’ll be good.” 6, 7, 13, 18, 19, 20 I went to a center and I’m sitting around in this group of people who are all probably almost twice my age at least. 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 AS: How old were you at this point? 10, 16 First time I went into treatment I was probably twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two. 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 I was probably twenty-three. 12, 13 AS: This is the late nineties? 5 Colleen is so much better with dates. 17 I was probably twenty-three years old and everyone was twice my age. 12, 13, 15, 16 The counselor is wearing a plaid shirt and has a pen protector and I’m thinking, 20 What the fuck am I doing here?  He comes around to me and says, “Wade, how about you? 14, 17, 18 “I’m fine.” 14 “Really?”  I’m fine. 14 I’ve been listening to all you old people sitting here talking about how fucked up your lives are. 6, 7, 11, 16, 18 You should all do what I did: quit!” 19 I had just quit like three days before. 18, 19 “Quit!  You could hear the snickers. 14 Everybody is breaking. 7, 10 I was like, “What?” 9, 14 I didn’t even know. 17 I got through their program. 8 I went every time. 7, 16, 19 AS: Was it outpatient?  It was so many weeks. 16, 18 I was working construction at the time framing houses. 7, 9, 11, 16, 19 I came home one night and I told Colleen, “I know I can’t have meth. 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 I know that. 17 But, a beer is not going to kill me.” 20 I went and got a six pack of beer and we both had beer. 13, 20 I drank the rest of it that night. 7, 18, 19 The following day I got some meth. 10, 12, 19 The very following day. 19 But now she doesn’t know I’m doing it because I’m not sharing. 17 I had to fake sleep.  AS: Was she using? 10 WL: Nope, she was not.  AS: In the beginning she did a little bit? 20 WL: She did it in the beginning.  Just a little bit, and it scared the hell out of her. 7, 14, 20 Demons and these shadow people and all these drug induced paranoid schizophrenic delusions that you have. 7, 10 I will leave the neurobiology out of it because it doesn’t pertain to the story, but that’s what happens. 5, 13 I’m back on meth again and I can’t not do it because it is so alluring, but I have to pretend like I’m sleeping. 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19 At ten o’clock I go lay down with her until I hear her fall asleep. 11, 14 I sneak out of bed and commence to smoking meth all night long until my alarm goes off at about ten to five and I slip back into bed and close my eyes. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 When her alarm goes off I open my eyes as if I slept all night long. 7, 9, 14, 19, 20 “Morning.  I’m going to go take a shower.” 9, 20 That was day three, day four, day five. 19 I would do four or five days in a row like that until it all fell apart, obviously. 8, 18, 19 I think it was in ‘97 that I fell off the cable end of a roof nineteen feet. 18 This was October.  There was dew on the roof.  I was up there to take off some pump jacks and my tennis shoes started to slip and I turned over crab-style and I jumped off the roof because I tried to correct the trajectory of my fall. 6, 7, 11, 15, 18, 20 I thought if I jumped maybe I would just break both of my legs, but I’d still be alive. 7, 10, 11, 16 The trajectory took me forward.  One arm went underneath me and I peppered my left wrist, punctured my lung, concussion. 7, 8, 19 I’m whispering my dying wishes to a buddy named Gary in this indentation of dirt where I landed. 11 The next thing I heard was choppers in the background. 7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 They called the ambulance and they had to lifeflight me because we were about five miles out of town. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17 That was the last I remember until I woke up in the emergency room. 7, 9, 13, 15 Colleen tells me there was a chaplain that met her at Mercy Hospital and said, “There’s a good chance that he may not be okay.” 6, 12, 13, 14, 19 That was the next stopping point, which was usually some physiological, some accident, something that brings me to this point where I’m like, I can’t do this anymore. 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 19 I thought at that point that I needed a safe job. 9, 10 I needed something that doesn’t have a risk of falling fifty feet to my death. 9, 11 I saw this add for carpet cleaner and I thought that it was a technical job, I would get paid fifteen bucks an hour. 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16 I’ll take that. 20 I go interview and the guy looks at me from across the table and says, “You’ve got the gift of gab.” 6, 14, 17, 18 I thought, “Shit, I’ve heard this before.” 7, 10, 14, 19 He said, “I’ll tell you what. 13, 14 This is a commission job, but we send you out with a certain amount of money. 7, 12 It is about fifty bucks on the ticket.  All you’ve got to do is sell more rooms.” 9, 19 “All I have to do is sell more rooms? 9, 19 Really?  For cleaning?” 15, 16 “Yeah, all you have to do is sell more rooms. 9, 19 Add them on.  If you get it up to one hundred bucks you will get thirty.” 20 That couldn’t be that hard. 6 I would do four of those in a day, that’s one hundred and twenty dollars a day. 18, 19 I could live on that. 11 “Done. 12 You’ve got a deal.”  I come to find out that I’m really good at that. 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 19 I would take tickets from forty-five dollars to one hundred dollars really fast. 6, 7, 8, 18, 20 I wasn’t a bad looking young man. 6 Plus, I had this gift of gab.  I did really good work. 6, 7, 8, 19 When I’m working I work hard. 6 I would clean the carpets and I would show the lady in the house the carpets. 9, 11, 14, 15, 16 I would say, “I’ve got a quote for you in the other room.” 9, 14 AS: She’s got one clean room and four dirty rooms! 9, 15, 16 Because it was only forty-four dollars. 18 That’s right. 8, 14 By the time I’m leaving I’m collecting a check for three hundred and fifty buck and I’m making one hundred and something per house. 7, 9, 11, 16, 19 I’m making three to four hundred dollars per house. 9, 11, 18 I was thinking, I’m really good at this and I really like this, too. 6, 7, 8, 19 One day Jimmy comes up to me, the guy I was working with, and he says, “Here, take a couple of these.” 6, 7, 14, 17, 19, 20 He hands me a couple Vicodin. 7, 13 I said, “What the hell do I want them for?” 13, 14 He said, “Fine.” 13, 14 I was like, God, this reminds me of something. 6, 7, 9, 14 Then I was like, “Yeah, I want those. 9, 14 Let me try those.”  “Give me two!  I could probably do three. 12, 13 Give me two.”  I fell in love. 17 Vicodin was it for me.  AS: Every time you get a new drug you’re like, Oh, that’s the one. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 I went to Jimmy and asked if I could get five or six more of those for the weekend. 16, 20 He said, “I don’t have anymore.” 7, 13, 14 I asked him where he got them and if he could hook me up. “ I can’t tell you where I got them.” 13 I was like, “Come on dude. 9, 14 All of a sudden now you’re Mr. Secret.” 7, 17 “If I tell you you can’t tell anyone.” 13 “Of course.”  “You get them from the bathrooms.” 9, 12, 20 “What are you talking about?” 6 “When you go to your customer’s house you ask them if you can use the restroom. 7, 9, 11 “In every house?” 9, 11 “Not in every house, but most of them.” 9, 11 “Really?”  I couldn’t wait until that following Monday. 19 I had my eight a.m. appointment. 10 The first thing I do after I get going was to ask if I could use the restroom. 7, 9, 16, 19, 20 I opened up the medicine cabinet and it was almost like hearing angel’s sing. 8, 14, 15, 20 There were like three bottles of Vicodin in there.  They were Vicodin tens—blues.  I was like you have to be shitting me. 10, 19 This is awesome.  I just took them all.  AS: You took them all?  WL: I took them all.  I had no couth.  I didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 My addiction overrode any common sense that might come into play. 8, 9, 15, 17 I looked at the dates and they had expired. 7, 13 I didn’t think they were going to be digging around in there. 18 They were expired. 7 AS: They were so old that nobody was using them. 10, 16 WL: Well, they were like a year old. 16 They weren’t nineteen years old and rancid. 16 [laughs] 10 AS: Well, we know they couldn’t have gotten them that long ago. 7, 16, 17 WL: They were expired and I knew she wasn’t using them currently. 6, 7, 10, 12 It seemed like every house I went to had them. 5, 9, 11 If it wasn’t Vicodin it was Percocet.  Big, orange, Percocet tens.  AS: If this ‘98, ‘99?  WL: Oh yeah. 8 AS: We are right in the deluge. 8, 14 WL: I was there when Oxycontin hit the street. 7, 19, 20 I remember finding the big yellow oxy eighties. 7, 9, 13, 15 I found a whole pack of them in this guy’s safe. 6, 11, 13 It wasn’t locked.  I am digging around everywhere to find dope I don’t care. 7, 9, 13, 14, 18, 20 If the lady is downstairs I will go through her underwear drawer, through her jewelry drawer, I will go through everything to get these oxys. 20 AS: With the machine on so it sounds like you are working.  WL: I can run the machine with one hand and dig around with the other hand to find them. 8, 9, 13, 18 Exactly.  I started collecting them in a Ball jar. 6, 15 We would exchange those and it became a currency in our company. 5, 7, 13, 17 “I’ll give you ten fives for two tens” because it had less acetaminophen in it. 11 My wife being a nurse was teaching me that I could only take so many of these in a day before my liver would give out. 11, 12, 18, 19, 20 I bought a PDR—a physician desk reference. 7, 20 I could cross reference medications to their size and type to know what they were just in case I found a bottle that was unmarked. 7, 11, 16, 17, 20 AS: Pretty resourceful. 7 [laughs] 10 WL: Thank you!  Thank you!  [laughs] 10 I knew you’d see the value in that. 5, 6, 12 Every once in a while that would catch me though.  There were times when I ended up taking a barbituate that I didn’t know was a barbituate. 7, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 Luckily by this time I’m doing so well in my carpet cleaning that I have an assistant or two. 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 19 Within the first year and a half the first franchise owner sold the franchise to me and one other employee. 16 The other employee was the telemarketing side that would call and set up the jobs and I was the field side. 9, 14, 15, 17, 20 I did all the carpet cleaning and took care of all the guys. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 20 All the guys used. 6, 8, 9, 15 I would use that as pay and bonus at times. 7, 9, 16, 18, 19 If they would run a job at five o’clock that needed to be ran and no one else would run I would say, “Listen, you run this and I’ll throw five oxys in for you.” 8, 9, 12, 14 I used it as currency and it was very effective. 7, 9 They would do things for oxys that they wouldn’t do for cash. 5, 19 I would tell them I would give them two hundred dollars to run the job and they wouldn’t do it. 8, 11, 13, 18 Then I would say I would give them three oxys and it was done. 11, 12, 14 That whole time we were stealing pills. 7, 16, 19 There were times where we could find someone who really liked Darvocet—I don’t know why—but they would like Darvocet. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 I would collect up all the Darvocet and I would sell it for one chunk of money or exchange it for what I liked. 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19 We had guys that really liked benzodiazepines. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 I would take them not because I like benzos, but because I could exchange them. 5, 9, 14, 20 It was a currency. 7 It has a value system.  One orange football Xanax is worth a specific dollar amount. 12 Very little, but very specific. 20 This continued until I lost my franchise in 2002. 19 I went to treatment a couple more times in between there. 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 Always for someone else, never for me. 8, 13 Colleen caught on that I was using again when things had gotten desperate and I went again when I was twenty six. 5, 7, 10, 19 One more time again when I was twenty-eight or twenty-nine. 7, 16, 19 It was always these outpatients that weren’t very effective. 10, 15 AS: Did you have kids by this point? 10, 15 WL: The twins were born in 2000. 5 This was 2002 so they were two at this point. 10 At the point they were born I was sober for a very short period of time. 5, 7, 10, 16, 19 The one thing that I’m not proud of, and I will share this, is that when the twins were born my wife almost died on the table because she was preaclapsic. 5, 7, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19 She had Josie and then she fell asleep and was bleeding internally. 11 Jake was still in there. 7 AS: She had a natural birth?  WL: The medication infiltrated. 16 The spinal tap didn’t work, it came out. 13, 17 It created this huge pustule in her back of medication that never got to her. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 I convinced her that it was working because the doctor didn’t tell her it was working. 13, 20 They only told me and I said, “Don’t tell her.” 13, 14, 16 I looked at her and I grabbed her by the collar as she is in excruciating pain and dying because of blood loss. 13 She said, “It hurts so bad.” 13, 14 And I said, “Can you imagine how bad it would hurt if you didn’t have the pain medication? 13, 14, 16 Now push!”  She pushed and Jake was born. 5 He was born not breathing so they had to intubate him and he began to breath immediately. 5, 7, 12, 19 Now she was the problem. 7 She was dying.  I am sober through this whole time. 7, 16, 19 I am seeing all the things 5, 6, 19 I have done and I’m like, Holy shit, I’m going to be here with the twins and she is going to die and I’m not going to know what to do. 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 I can’t hold it together. 11, 16, 20 The first thing I thought of was, There is no way I am going to be able to stay sober and take care of these babies. 7, 10, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 That is not going to happen. 5 That all went through my mind immediately. 6, 12 They stabilize her.  They get her breathing and she is fine. 7, 14, 19, 20 They take her to the room and a few hours after, maybe five or six, some people come and visit and it is towards the evening. 7, 9, 16, 17, 20 There was a movie store—this is back when there were movie stores—and she said, “Why don’t you go grab a movie and we can watch a movie and you can lay by me here in bed.” 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 I went and used. 9 I came back and she was crashing again. 11, 13, 17, 19 She was dying.  Now I smell like weed and beer and even today I’m just mortified by it because it is so reminiscent of what the addict does. 5, 7, 10, 15, 19, 20 You use no matter what. 9, 10 Her oxygen drops into the seventies.  They are about ready to intubate but she bounces back one more time. 7, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 I get this look from this nurse. 20 I will never forget this look. 13, 20 She was like you piece of shit because she knew. 6, 10, 12, 19 I had no rebuttal I was just thinking I know I am. 7, 17 As the twins got a little bigger and were moving around and Colleen was doing better life on the outside seemed really good. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20 My addiction was starting to really flare again. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 The opiates were the reason. 7, 10, 17 I can’t not take them because then I get sick. 20 I take them even at night. 19, 20 If I wake up in the middle of the night I will take them. 14, 19, 20 I was taking Xanax at night so I could sleep because I was taking all these opiates during the day which would just crank me up. 17, 19 The opiates gave me the talkies—I couldn’t stop talking. 6, 17, 18 Great for sales! 7 On my thirtieth birthday I had decided I was going to stop. 8, 19 I wasn’t going to do this anymore. 7 I think that Josie was three at the time. 7, 16, 19 She was so young. 6 I swore to myself that night before my thirtieth birthday that I was not going to use. 7, 9, 19 At ten thirty in the morning I realized that I was already high on my birthday. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19 I had forgotten about staying sober. 5, 7, 14 AS: You mean in the middle of the night? 14, 19 WL: The night before I made the affirmation by the time the morning came I had already used. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 I had forgotten I had made the affirmation. 7, 13 I literally did not remember that I had used, but at ten thirty when I did remember I was so mortified with myself. 7, 9, 13, 15 I was self-loathing. 5, 19 I hated me.  I was like, You know you’re going to die you fucking junkie. 7, 9, 14, 17 You are just going to die you piece of shit. 10, 19 So I used a lot. 9 I have no idea how much I used that day. 5, 9, 19 I ended up going to the pool hall.  I maybe went down to the office for a little bit. 16, 18, 20 I don’t think I did any work.  I just used. 9 I took a Xanax in the evening.  When I came it was eight o’clock at night and there balloons throughout the house. 9, 11, 13, 17, 19 My wife made chicken primavera for me—my favorite. 12, 13 The twins were there for the birthday party. 8, 19 I came in and yelled and screamed at all of them and was like, “Fuck you.” 7, 9, 13, 14, 17 I walked down the hallway, I fell on the bed, I overdosed and I died. 17, 20 Josie came into the bedroom, my wife is in the kitchen crying. 9, 12, 13, 17 Josie went out and got my wife and said, “Call 911. 12, 13, 14 Daddy is dead.”  At two years old. 16 Colleen came into the bedroom and I am gray. 9, 13, 17 I am not breathing. 7, 19 She gives me a few short rescue breaths and I start to shallow breath. 6, 7, 11 She gets out the stethoscope and starts to monitor my heart. 6, 14, 20 It isn’t normal it is very weak. 18 She breaths for me and she doesn’t call nine one one because there is dope in the house. 7, 9, 11, 14, 17 There is cocaine in the house, there are stolen pills in the house, there are scales in the house, marijuana, baggies. 9, 10, 11, 16 There is a whole shop set up downstairs.  To call the ambulance means that DHS comes in and takes the kids. 14, 15, 17, 20 They take me to jail, they take the children away, they take everything. 7, 9, 13, 20 She is literally the person that saved my life that night. 7, 8, 10, 17, 19 AS: She was able to stabilize you? 18 WL: She was able to stabilize me. 18 She gave me mouth to mouth. 18 She breathed for me and kept me alive. 7, 11 I fell asleep after I got to a point where I was stable and my breathing was normal. 7, 10, 11, 18, 19 She let me sleep.  I woke up at one thirty in the morning and I said, “Where the fuck is my chicken?” 9, 13, 14 I have really very little emotional response because I don’t remember any of that. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20 AS: But she told you. 13, 16 WL: Yeah, several times in detail. 7, 13, 16, 19 [laughs] 10 After that you think a person would stay sober and stay clean, but I kept thinking, I’ve got this. 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 But I couldn’t because every time I would stop I would get sick. 7, 16, 19, 20 I would have to chew the pills in the morning to get them in my system faster. 9, 20 I would drink some kind of liquor with it because it would immediately hit my system and I would get in the hot shower all at the some time. 7, 9, 12, 16, 19, 20 I was in the shower, hanging my head, chewing Vicodin, with a shot of whiskey in me getting ready to start my day. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20 I would brush my teeth and go clean the carpet again. 14, 15, 16 At that time I was making probably two thousand to three thousand dollars a week and we needed the money. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 In some ways she kept me going that direction because she knew we were making good money. 6, 7, 12, 19 I kept promising her it would slow down and when it would slow down we would be okay. 14 I told her I was not going to do it like I did before and I would stay away from the Xanax because that was the problem. 7, 13, 14, 16, 20 Not long after that my business partner set me up. 7, 8, 9, 12 I had been stealing money from the business. 7, 9, 12 The opiates were the problem. 7, 17 I tapered myself off of opiates, but I started doing cocaine really heavily. 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 17 I started doing cocaine in late 2003. 5, 6, 10, 15 2003 and 2004 was all cocaine and I started stealing from my business to support it. 6, 9, 12, 15 It was delivered at that time. 7, 11, 16, 19 Under thirty minutes or it was free. 7, 14 AS: Under thirty minutes? 14 WL: It was like a pizza.  Under thirty minutes or it was free. 7, 14 It was nothing to go through three hundred to four hundred and fifty dollars of cocaine in a night. 10, 18, 19 Between me and her because now I’ve got her back on it. 11, 17, 19 I’m good at keeping people sick around me. 6, 17, 19 I was good at that. 6, 19 My business partner had a hunch that I was stealing. 8, 9, 12 A good hunch. 6, 19 They set me up so they had someone call and say, “I’ve got this huge house and it is empty. 9, 11, 14, 17 I just want you to go over the carpets because they need to be done. 14 I don’t care if they are dirty or not I want you to charge me for every room because the last person who was there is going to pay the bill so it’s not that big of a deal. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 Whatever you come up with is fine with me just don’t make me have to remortgage the house.” 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 I was like, “Okay, great.” 7, 8, 9, 14 “Listen, I’m just going to pay you. 18 If you could keep it a little cheaper than going through the company that would be great.” 7, 8, 17, 20 At that time I had no reason to think that was unusual. 7, 10, 16, 17, 19 I had been doing enough side work up until that point where the word had gotten around that if you needed something done and you wanted it a little cheaper and you want great work you call Wade and he will do it for cash. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 She called me and we set it up for me to do this job. 13, 14, 17 I would say a month later I got served papers. 5, 14, 16 They were suing me for breach. 7 AS: Your business partner? 8, 9, 12 WL: That’s right. 8, 14 Because I am an addict, because I am full of self, because I have no real connection to anything that is reality I represented myself. 5, 7, 15, 18 I thought I didn’t need a lawyer. 10, 16 He took me to court and I ended up losing everything.  Over 1.3 million dollars worth of assets and cash. 18 Everything reverted back to the franchise owner. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 My identity was crushed because I had gone from being this nothing to being a local mogul.  We would go to downtown Louisville and I would take all my employees and it would be nothing to pay two thousand dollars for a night’s worth of booze and food and walk away thinking I’m Johnny Big Shot. 12, 18, 19, 20 Get on my boat and ride the river all the way back to my dock in prospect. 9, 11, 17, 19 People thought I was cool. 10 Here I am getting served and I was losing everything that I thought was me. 10 Or so I thought at that time. 7, 10, 16, 19 I remembered one day I had stolen some needles from this old lady that was a diabetic. 7, 13, 15, 16, 19 She had a brand new packet of BD thirty cc thirty one gauge needles. 6, 13 I thought, I’ll just throw these in my van. 10 I was sitting in my house depressed and alone because I had lost everything. 7, 9, 11, 12, 18 I remebered those needles and I thought I’m going to try that. 7, 10 I am going to see what that is like. 5, 9, 14 I went out and got them.  I mixed up some cocaine in the spoon and I didn’t even use a filter. 9, 10 I drew it all back into the chamber. 7, 11, 17, 19 Colleen’s a nurse.  She has practiced putting in IVs with me over and over. 6, 19 I gave plasma when I was broke as a joke. 18 I’ve got the perfect know how. 17 I go ahead and I shoot up for the first time. 7, 12, 16, 19 I remember thinking to myself I will never come back from this. 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 This will be the end of me.  I loved it. 17 I loved it more than life itself. 7, 8, 17 The allure and the enamore—I can’t—it just is. 7 That went on for two years. 16 AS: How were you affording it?  WL: I stole some equipment and a list of patron customers and I started my own sideline gig even though it was forbidden. 6, 9, 15 I had stopped cleaning myself. 15, 16 I hired my buddy Joe to come clean with me. 7, 15, 16, 17 Joe would go do the work and I would pay him half. 16, 18 WL: I didn’t have to work anymore. 7 My dope dealer would front me and I would steal the money from Colleen when she would put money in the bank. 7, 12, 14, 19 It didn’t matter. 10 I would sell stuff, sell other people’s stuff. 19 It didn’t matter. 10 Whatever I had to do in order to get it. 20 Towards the end there all I did was shoot dope, drink Miller High Life, and eat Donettes. 12, 19 That was the only thing I could keep down. 17, 19 WL: Those little white powdered donuts in a bag. 7, 15, 19, 20 [laughs] 10 I would wake up in the morning and eat a half a bag of those and then I would throw up, shoot dope, and drink beer the rest of the day. 7, 9, 19, 20 AS: You must have lost a lot of weight.  WL: I was skin and bones. 6, 12 The reason my wife called my stepdad and my grandpa was because she knew I was going to die. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 It wouldn’t be long. 7 I had a gangrenous sore on the inside of my left thigh because of all the dope I was doing and the dirty water. 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 AS: You were shooting into yours legs at this point? 10 WL: Well, I was, but not solely.  It was mostly my arms. 5 I had abscesses on both my arms up and down.  Sometimes I would use my calves at times to find spots. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 My neck at times. 7, 16, 19 The abscess is from dope not being able to metabolize in my body. 12, 18 In animal studies we call it intraperitoneal. 12, 14, 17 It is the blank cavity in the body, so the only place it would go was to settle in the groin area. 7, 8 You could literally brush a powder off of my leg like dried cocaine. 10 I was losing that leg, I could tell. 13 My toes were getting dark blue. 15, 20 My leg was getting black. 15, 20 I didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 I thought if I lose this leg I can get on disability. 10, 13, 20 If I get disability I will be able to do dope for the rest of my life until I am dead. 7, 8, 18, 20 A lot of paranoid schizophrenia stuff with the cocaine. 7, 10 I would hunker down in the basement.  I almost shot my wife one night as she was walking downstairs. 6, 12, 15, 19, 20 AS: You almost shot her? 15, 20 WL: I had a shotgun pointed at her head. 10, 12, 20 I used to rig stuff up at the top of the stairs. 9 I would put a beer bottle on the door knob so that if someone would come in it would fall down the steps and I would hear it. 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 I always had a loaded shot gun next to me because if the cops came I was not going to jail. 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: You were going to shoot yourself?  WL: Yes.  Like I said, I don’t do time. 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 I won’t do time. 7, 16, 19 I was locked inside my mind for a long time as a kid. 6, 7, 15, 16, 19 AS: You were locked in your room. 9 WL: I never thought of that. 10, 13 That’s got some emotion there.  AS: It is fresh in my head so it is easy for me to make those connections when I’m listening. 7, 11, 12, 18 WL: Goddamn, you’re right. 7, 8, 14 AS: When somebody says, “I don’t do that,” well, what if someone told you you had to? 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 WL: I would kill myself.  AS: Right.  I couldn’t have asked you that thirty minutes ago. 14, 16 I ended up going to treatment. 7, 13, 18 They called my stepdad and my grandpa, who was really cool about it. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 They kind of rigged it all.  Colleen left for work and all of a sudden my buddy Joe comes up the driveway like he normally does to get the carpet cleaning equipment. 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 The door slams and I say, “I’m in here.” 14, 17 I’m sitting in the chair with the guitar in my hand and sunglasses on in my house. 7, 9, 11, 13, 18 I don’t want Joe to see my eyes and now how sick I am. 5, 9, 14, 17 Joe knows I’m sick. 17 Joe talks about me in the third person already at this point. 6, 7, 10, 17, 18, 20 I will hear him and my wife talking in the kitchen about me: “I don’t know how far away he is from dying” and that would just infuriate me. 6, 9, 12, 14, 17, 20 Don’t talk to me like I’m not here. 6 AS: Even though you weren’t.  WL: That’s right. 8, 14 I thought I had it together. 10, 11, 16, 20 He comes up, door slams, I say I am in here, and all of a sudden there is my stepdad and grandpa. 14, 16, 17 He puts his hand on my shoulder and he has this look on his face. 13, 19 AS: Joe does?  WL: My dad.  He wasn’t okay. 14 You could tell by the look in his eyes he was not okay with what he was seeing. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14 I am one hundred and forty-five pounds.  I have long sleeves on because if you see my arms they are abscessed and not okay. 5, 7, 14 He said, “We are going to take you back to Minnesota to get some help. 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 Why don’t you come with us.” 17 I said, “I can’t do that. 13, 14 Then my grandpa walks around the corner.  I’m like, “What did you bring him for?” 9, 14 He’s cool.  He is thirty-four years sober out of AA. 16 He was the town drunk. 8, 11 He has been doing twelve step calls his whole life and he has seen people way worse. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 He looks at me and he says, “Well, you’ve got yourself into a real fix here, didn’t you? 7, 14, 17 I’ll tell you what. 13 You’re probably feeling pretty shitty right about now. 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 Why don’t you go ahead and get your stuff together and we will go up and get you some help. 11, 12, 16, 18, 20 It is going to suck, but you’ll be alright.” 8, 14 I said, “Okay.” 13, 14 AS: Is this your stepdad’s dad? 16 I said, “Okay.” 13, 14 He said, “Really? 13, 14 Okay.”  I took a teener of cocaine into my bathroom and my dad said, “Just keep the door open.” 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 I said, “No, I’m taking a shower. 9, 13, 14 I’m not keeping the door open. 17, 20 I’ve got nothing in here.  We’re good.” 6, 7, 19 I put the teener in the spoon, drew it back as much as I could, and I shot the whole thing into my arm hoping I would overdose. 7, 11, 17, 19, 20 I got really, really sick to the point where I fell into the shower. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 They helped me up, got me dressed. 7, 18 On the way out the door I even asked if I could drink a few beers. 17, 19, 20 My grandpa said, “Go ahead. 12, 13, 14 It will be your last.”  I must have hammered four or five beers and then got back in that truck and headed to Minnesota. 7, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 On the way there my family tried to call and get a bed and there wasn’t a bed at [unclear], there wasn’t a bed at teen challenge. 7, 14, 17, 19, 20 They finally said they had one over in South Dakota. 13, 14 Do you want to go to South Dakota? 14 By this time I’m eating Trazadone because it is all I have left. 7, 8, 16, 19 I was like, “I don’t give a shit where we go. 9, 10, 11, 14, 19 Let’s just go before I get sick again.” 20 After two and a half days in the car—we slept in the vehicle, we kept in the vehicle. 14, 16, 18, 19 They would stop periodically to get me a little more booze here and there just to keep me level. 9, 14, 17, 20 We got to Canton and at Canton I had just come around and they introduced me to a nurse. 17, 18 I stuck my hand out and gave them the best smile I could do. 13, 18 They gave me a room and they said, “We understand that you have been doing some pretty heavy amounts. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 We would like to make you as comfortable as possible. 9, 14, 18 Are you allergic to Xanax at all?”  I said, “Why, no. 13, 14 “Okay, take this. 20 This will really help you to be calm.” 6, 7, 8, 18 “I will, thank you.” 9 AS: This is what treatment looks like. 7, 9, 13, 14, 18 WL: I am allergic to Xanax because every time I take it the left side of my body goes numb; totally dead. 7, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20 I went back to my room and lay down. 9, 11, 17, 19 I woke up at about eight or nine at night and I left the treament center. 7, 8, 19 I went to the bar and I had a few drinks. 12, 19 I tried to steal a car, and I couldn’t. 14 There wasn’t anything pre-1985 that I could ‘Dukes of Hazzard’ this thing and leave. 19 I stole a bicycle and I drove that back to the treatment center after falling on the lawn a few different times because I must have drank a fifth of whiskey sitting at that bar plus a Xanax. 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 I found my way back there because I was going to bicycle all the way home but I asked someone where I was and they said, “You don’t know where you’re at?” 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I said, “Just tell me what town I’m in.” 13, 14 “Canton.”  “Canton, Kentucky?”  “No, Canton, South Dakota.”  “How far is that from Kentucky?” 9 I literally thought I was going to go home. 10, 17, 19 I didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 I was going to get home. 17, 19, 20 I got to the edge of town and got tired. 7 I figured I better go back to the treatment center and figure it out tomorrow. 7, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 I went back to the treatment center and threw the bike down on the lawn like I was a nine year old kid. 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 I walked into the treatment center and went under my bed. 7, 13, 18, 20 The nurse came in and tried to get me out of there and I guess I tried to hurt her. 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 I used to hide underneath my bed when my stepdad used to hurt me. 9, 14, 16 I don’t know what happened. 5, 17 I must have reverted to something. 7, 13 The following day it happened again. 5, 19 They gave me Xanax again and I ended up going to the bar again. 12, 18 This time they sent one of the counselors named Bill. 7, 11, 16, 19, 20 I think he is still there. 7 He is a marine.  I was at the gas station this time drinking a Deuce and he finds me sitting up next to the gas station drinking this beer. 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 He takes the beer and says, “You’re not going to need this to get in the back of my truck.” 7, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 I got in the back of the truck. 11, 17, 19 I’m already drunk because I went to the bar first and then went to get more beer. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20 Went back to the treatment center and they called this pastor Al Pratt. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 He is a six foot five two hundred and eighty pound biker who is a pastor but did a lot of time but now had turned his life over. 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19 He settled me down, but they had to shoot me full of thorazine to get me to stay. 7, 14, 20 For the next three days I did the thorazine shuffle all around that treatment center. 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 I woke up three days later on the men’s wing. 5, 16, 18, 19 AS: The men’s wing of what?  WL: Of the treatment center. 7, 13, 18 Three days later I wake up bald and I’ve got no facial hair. 5, 16, 18, 19 I look in the mirror and go, “What the fuck.”  Everybody is laughing and I don’t know why they are laughing. 17 I thought it was really disturbing and not okay. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14 I don’t care how drunk they get. 7, 8, 11, 14, 20 You don’t shave their head. 12 I went to the director of the place and pitch a fit. 7, 8 I’m like, “Who shaved my head?” 9, 12, 14 She was like, “Wade, Wade, Wade. 9, 14 You were standing in the men’s bathroom stark naked, shaving your entire head. 7, 9, 12, 17 We weren’t going to stop you!  We figure the worst that could happen is that it would grow back.” 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 Okay.  Shaved every ounce off.  That began my forty-five day stay at that treatment center. 7, 13, 14, 18, 19 My daughter still reminds me of the time she saw me with no hair or beard. 5, 6, 7, 16, 19 It scarred her. 7, 14 We found a picture of it not long ago and she can’t look at it. 7, 11, 16 She does not like it. 9, 14 It’s not the daddy she left in Kentucky. 8, 19 They had to go stay with parents because I went to treatment. 7, 12, 13, 14, 18 My twins went to stay with my mother in Minnesota. 10, 14 Our one year old went to stay with my wife’s mom and dad in Iowa. 12, 14, 16, 17 My wife is still in Kentucky, and I’m in South Dakota. 7, 12 Split apart and I didn’t think we were ever getting back together again. 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: So pastor Al Pratt shows up. 8, 9 I want to hear about how you got into college, how you got here, and what you’re doing now. 7, 14, 17 WL: I met pastor Al Pratt and was enamored by his coolness. 7, 12 He’s got tattoos up and down his arms, wearing a biker jacket, says ‘pastor’ on it. 8, 14, 17 He’s got this story of drinking bleach to clean his system out prior to UA to such a degree that he has to have a steel lining in his gut because that is the degree that his addiction took him to. 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 19 I’m thinking if that happened to you I am so much better than you. 5, 17 You make me feel really good about how it turned out for me. 6, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19 After going through that treatment and going home I got into an aftercare program. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 They had a counselor come to my house every week for a good eightteen months. 6, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: Were you back in Kentucky at this point? 10, 11, 17, 19 WL: Sleepy Eye, Minnesota where I grew up. 7, 19 AS: So the whole family moved? 7, 11, 14, 19 My wonderful mom found a three bedroom branch home that was for sale and manipulated the sellers to rent it to us. 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 19 My mom is a very dynamic person. 10, 17 She’s got us living in this 1974 home that is decorated in 1974. 6, 17, 19 I went from living in Louisville, Kentucky in a very prestigious neighborhood—even though I was dying from addiction I was used to finer things—to a house with shag carpets, linoleum, smoke colored walls, dark chocolate cabinetry, orange countertops. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19 I’m just flabbergasted at where I’m at in now in my life, but at the same time it’s like I know I need to redeem myself. 7, 8, 16, 17, 19 We dig in the best we can. 13 My wife gets a job as a nurse in a geriatrics facility in a little town. 12, 20 My kids get enrolled in kindergarten. 15 We’ve got baby Jane and she’s doing well. 8, 20 I started going to meetings. 6, 12, 15 I went every day for a year. 16, 19 Sometimes I would go twice a day: an afternoon meeting and then a night meeting on top of that. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 I got to the point where all I would do eat, live, breath, and shit recovery. 7, 8, 10, 11, 19 I’m chairing meetings now, I’m going to speak at treatment centers, and I go back to Canton every month to share my story about how I ran away from the treatment center and I ran down to the bar and got hammered. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 I had become this celebrity in recovery where people were recognizing me. 7, 8, 17, 18 They would say, “Hey, Wade. 14 We have this date and can you come talk?” 6, 17 They would put stuff up with my name on it. 11, 19 It got to the degree where I was like, Is this what it is supposed to be like? 7, 9, 14, 19 But I was loving it.  I was having a great time. 7, 8, 16, 19 My spiritual life started to increase and I started really wanting to know god more and what he had in store for me if anything at all. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17 There was always the ‘why me’ every time I had that ontological argument of is there or isn’t there. 7, 10, 16, 19 If so he’s off his game because he could have saved me here and here and here and he never did. 13, 15 So why now? 17 I reached out to pastor 7, 8 Al and went back to Sioux Falls. 11, 17, 19 I went to his church a few times—it’s a biker church. 7, 16, 19 There are tattoos and bikes and Jesus.  I liked it. 9, 14 I liked being vulnerable. 9, 14, 18 I liked saying I needed something more than me in my life. 7, 8, 9, 14 I need a higher power in my life. 7, 8, 11 Pastor  Al said the thing that I keep hearing: you’ve really got the gift of gab. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 19 I told him one thing that happened to me—I had mentioned to you at the restaurant that I had this fight with god. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 AS: Do you want to talk about that? 6, 14 WL: Sure. 7 At about day forty-four I was going to commit suicide. 19 I was told by my wife that we weren’t going to be together right away and it may not happen for awhile because we didn’t have a house and this and that. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 She got on me about if I hadn’t done this it wouldn’t be my fault.  She threw some blame at me, which is totally justifiable. 7, 18 Definitely.  Tell that to a self centered, narcissistic, egotistical addict that’s got a wounded spirit. 5, 7, 15 That doesn’t work really well and that’s not what I needed to hear at the time. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 19 I put a bag around my head and a belt around my neck and I went into my room and locked the door. 9, 12, 17, 19 I was bound and determined that asphyxiation was going to be the easiest way out because I would just simply pass out and die. 17 As soon as I did start to black out a hole is torn in the bag and it is a nurse. 5, 6 She says, “Wade, what are you doing?” 14, 17 A nurse never came back to that room ever that whole time I was there, and now all of a sudden there is a nurse outside of this locked door and happens to have a key in her hand? 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 And opens it up at that exact same time? 7, 16, 19, 20 That makes no sense to me. 9, 18 After that episode I went to the backyard where they have this dirt track and I just started to walk around the dirt track over and over. 6, 11, 15, 17, 19 I got into this big fight with god of, “You did this and I hate you.” 9, 13 I was trying to induce the wrath of god. 9 If you are real, zap me dead right here. 7, 8, 14 Finally I screamed at him to either do something with me or kill me. 7 I fell to the ground.  I just collapsed.  I don’t know if it was emotion or what it was. 17 I just went down and cried.  I remember just laying there crying for the longest time. 7, 13, 15, 16, 19 That deep visceral kind of thing. 19 You can’t catch your breath. 7 After that I went and sat in this lecture hall and listened to this speaker talk about getting beaten. 6, 7, 15, 20 When the old man sends you to the closet to the get the belt that he is going to beat you with do you get the wide belt or the thin belt. 6, 13, 16, 20 I said, “The wide belt.” 13, 14 AS: You said that out loud? 13, 14 The speaker says to me, “There is a man that has been beaten.” 14, 17 It pierced me.  It felt as if god was talking to me through this person. 6, 9, 10, 17 How did they know? 17 Is that really reminiscent of a beaten person that they would go get the wide belt? 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 20 Of course it is because it has greater surface tension and it’s not going to hurt as bad. 7, 8, 14 I know that because it has happened. 5, 17 I am not going to give you the thin belt. 11 It was all of those things in combination that made me go back to visit Al Pratt. 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 He was the speaker who said that. 13, 14 I went back to him and shared with him that something had happened on that dirt track. 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 There was a revelation that happened. 5, 7 I didn’t want to seem too weird, but god told me I was going to be a pastor. 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16 That was something that was almost a knowingness. 15, 17 I called my wife before I went into that lecture hall that night. 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 I told her about that day and what happened. 5, 13, 16, 19 I told her I had this overwhelming knowingness that I’m supposed to be a pastor or something. 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 She was at a hotel with my parents at the time, and she goes, “That’s great.” 7, 8, 12, 16, 19 I could hear the patronizing tone. 12, 14 I said, “You don’t understand. 13, 14 This is real. 7 I really feel like there was a spiritual entity there and I had there experience. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18 I can’t even explain it.”  “Honey. 12 That’s great. 7, 8 We are behind you no matter what.” 10 I just surrendered. 7 She was not going to believe me. 9 Not now; I’ve got to walk it out. 17 As I am home doing outpatient I just have this feeling that I need to go back and see him. 5, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 He puts it on my heart to read the Bible, and I did. 6, 7, 14, 19 I sat down at my kitchen table with a pot of coffee and a pack of cigarettes and my recovery bible. 7, 8, 10, 13, 18 “In the beginning.”  My mother in law called to check up and see how we were. 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17 I never liked her because she was a godly woman and I never was a godly man at all. 9, 13, 14 This time I had a real hankering to ask her about god and what it means to her. 7, 9, 16, 19 I just talked to her for awhile. 6, 13 I said, “Mary Jane, I’m reading the Bible and I was interested in what your experience is.” 7, 13, 14, 15 She said, “What are you reading?” 7, 13, 14 I said, “Genesis, you know, in the beginning.” 13, 14, 17 She said, “You don’t want to start there!” 6, 13, 14 I was like, “What are you talking about?” 6, 9, 14 AS: So you had no religious upbringing? 7 WL: I was the CEO of the church—Christmas and Easter Only.  [laughs] 10 My parents would drop us off and we would go to Sunday School and they would pick us up. 5, 7, 12, 19 AS: So, you have some— WL: Not about the books.  I know the characters of the Bible, but not the order that I am supposed to know to get confirmed. 14, 17, 20 That never happened. 5, 13 I faked it.  She says, “You need to start in the gospels. 6, 14, 17 Start with John.  From there,” she said, “Once you get to Revelation stop. 13, 14, 20 Then go and read Genesis and read through that.” 7 I did it and I read through it. 7 I sat there day after day for hours and hours and read the Bible word for word. 7, 19 I did not miss one word.  I figured at the very end there was going to be some kind of an epiphany or knowingness. 7, 17, 19 A spell or a potion. 10 I don’t know. 17 I had this strong urge that I had to read every word. 7 Even in books where all they did was recite the family lineage. 7, 15, 19 I read every word to the best of my ability figuring there would something. 7, 13 “You faithful son! 17 Here is your reward. 7 There was a reward. 7 My faith grew so that today I do believe there was a man that walked this planet and was God incarnate who had every attribute of the living God and took upon himself every single sin past, present, future, and died an innocent man. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19, 20 When I talk about it it does get me. 6, 20 I’m appreciative of that. 7 I can’t think about how I could do that.  If I was asked to do that—no.  Of course not.  I don’t even stop to give people on the side of the road money let alone die for them. 7, 9, 11, 12 It gave me a perspective. 18 It opened my eyes and really got me to understand what it means to care for somebody other than myself. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 That was new for me up to that point. 6, 10 I was so busy trying to survive that I didn’t give a shit about anybody but me. 10, 11, 19 Reading the scriptures made me go, “Here is this man who is God and could stop time altogether, but he didn’t. 7, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20 He took it all and never once complained. 13 Here I am this little human complaining and whining: “Early recovery is hard.” 6, 7, 8, 20 I don’t know, it really helped. 6, 7, 8, 17, 18 It made me want to share it and go give it to someone else. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 I contacted this pastor in Sleepy Eye and I said, “Would you mind if we gathered at your church on Saturday nights? 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 19 It would be me, my wife, a couple of other people who are in recovery. 7, 8, 12 We will bring our guitars down and we are just going to do some music, hang out, and talk about recovery and how God is a part of that. 5, 6, 7, 8 Is that okay?” 14 “Yeah, sure.” 7 We started with just that and it grew to one hundred and fifty people in just six months. 6, 7, 11, 15, 19 Pastor  Al recognized what was going on and took me under his wing. 7 The Southern Baptist Convention through the Dakota Baptist Convention recognized me and sent their guy out to underwrite our ministry. 6, 7 They funded it.  They gave us money every month to help us buy equipment and travel and train me. 7, 12, 18, 20 Within a short period of time, in 2007 7, 16, 19 I became ordained. 13, 17 AS: In the Baptist Church?  By this time we have our own church and congregation of about one hundred and nine people. 7, 16, 19 We are doing youth group every week, clothing drives, food drives, and we are speaking on the behalf of people in recovery in the church community to let them know, as I learn more about what drugs and alcohol can do to a human being, how to be mindful. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 How to navigate this whole thing. 19 We told them, “Throw your old medications away, take them down to the police station because I will come to your house and steal them. 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 20 I will eat them all and I will die.”  I would show up in the church with my vest and my tattoos and they would immediately be dumbfounded by the level of intelligence and then what I looked like. 9, 11, 12, 13 That’s the demon of meth. 10, 12 AS: You had the church for how long? 7 WL: Almost three years. 16 It grew into this really cool thing. 6, 7, 8, 19 Towards the last eight to ten months we had ‘normies’ come in—people that were seeing— AS: Before this had been pretty much people in recovery? 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17 It was one of these recovery churches? 7, 8 WL: We called it a recovery bar. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 We got kicked out of that Lutheran Church on the 364th day. 11, 19 We were about to recognize one year and they came to me and said, “Wade” —and they wouldn’t call me pastor— “You guys are going to have to go. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 We found cigarette butts out front and that’s not going to be acceptable.” 7, 11, 18 “Where are we supposed to go?” 14 “That’s not our problem. 7 I’m sorry, you just have to go.”  AS: Wow.  Because you had a very large crowd?  WL: People from Sunday morning were coming on Saturday night. 7, 9, 19 AS: And then not coming on Sunday. 7, 19 WL: That’s right. 8, 14 AS: When did you get the tattoos? 20 WL: Not until I got sober.  I didn’t get my first one until I was clean. 12, 15, 16, 20 I was arrested once. 7 Remember I told you I went to jail one day? 13, 16, 19 I went to jail one day and they took a mug shot. 13, 19, 20 I watched them take everyone else’s that was in line with me, and they made them take off their shirts and they took pictures of their tattoos. 7, 8, 13, 15, 20 I swore as a person dealing dope and running guns and doing stupid crap I was never going to get a mark on my body. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 20 Too easy to recognize. 7, 11 This solidifies my recovery. 7, 8 Now I am very recognizable; it is hard to forget me. 6, 7, 18, 20 Hard to forget. 20 I want to mark myself. 14 I am marked with the cross literally because now people go, “That guy is marked with the cross, marked with a Jesus on his arm, he’s got scripture, how he has battled sin and wants to do the right thing. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 19 If it’s not him that does it is the sin that does it.”  I want to be recognized. 7, 14 I don’t want there to be a chance to ever go back to that life. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I want to be marked. 14 AS: Would you mind sharing the scripture? 6, 7 WL: Corinthians five seventeen.  Romans six and seven.  Romans seven is  Paul talking about his battle with sin. 6 If you take it and replace the word sin with addiction it makes perfect sense. 7, 8, 9, 15, 18, 20 It is the addiction within me that does these evil things. 5, 8, 15, 19 “Oh what a wretched man that I am. 7 Who will free me from this life that is dominated by addiction?” 7, 8, 15 Thank God the answer is in Jesus.  That is what Pastor  Al showed me when I was in that treatment center that time. 7, 9, 13, 16, 18, 19 He challenged me.  He said that addiction was in the Bible. 8, 13, 14, 15 I said, “Yeah, right. 8, 13, 14 He said, “Replace the word addiction with sin in that paragraph.” 8, 13, 14, 15 The more I read it the more I started to cry. 6, 7, 15 I was like, “You mean Paul was an addict?” 9, 14, 15 “I don’t know if Paul was an addict, but the battle is the same, isn’t it?” 15, 17 He’s doing something that he doesn’t want to do. 14 Oh what a wretched man that I am. 7 Who will free me from this life that is dominated by all of this? 7, 8 Everything fell in line.  At the end of the three years in ministry, a lot of it had to do with normal, regular people that have great intentions, came in, and their traditions were not seen there because we didn’t do communion. 5, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18 AS: You didn’t do their Baptist traditions.  I don’t have a comfort in that.  AS: So did the Baptist Church hear of you and then— WL: Pastor 14 Al took me under his wing and taught me all things. 5, 19 AS: Is he a Baptist minister?  WL: He is with the Dakota Baptist Convention.  Part of the Southern Baptist Convention.  I’m trying to think of the executive director’s name. 7, 11, 14 He was told by Pastor Al that he had this young protege and his is just sharp. 6, 13, 16 He is on fire for the Lord. 7 He has this gift of gab.  Man, he can preach up a storm. 7 He just brings it and the emotion behind it.  You’ve got to go see him. 5 He comes to Sleepy Eye and he sits in the pews like a visitor. 7, 17 Afterwards he goes, “Wow.”  I said, “What?” 13, 14 “You have a gift.”  I said, “Thank you. 13, 14 He introduced himself and said he wanted to underwrite my ministry. 13, 14 I said, “I don’t know what that means.” 13, 14, 17 “We will give you money.” 7, 11, 12 “Okay.”  [laughs] 10 “We need that.  What can we do with the money?” 7, 12 “Anything you need.”  “We need a trailer so we can go to a different church once in awhile on Sunday mornings to bring the message.” 7, 9, 15, 18, 19 It turned into a huge production. 18 It turned into a five piece band and a ten thousand dollar PA system and soundboards and computers and a board of directors. 7, 18, 19 “Normie” church.  We just started this thing with guitarists hanging out talking about what recovery really means and why it is so important to— AS: Have a spiritual life? 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 19 Then it turned into money. 7, 12, 18 It turned into, “I want you to do a baptism for my grandson. 14, 17, 18 I want you to marry so and so. 14 I want you to do communion. 14 I want you to do a mass.” 14 Whoever came in with ten thousand dollars to donate wanted me to do something different for their family or their stuff. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 They thought themselves to be significant enough because they donated. 10, 16, 20 Pastor Wade will just do it.  AS: How long did it take you to figure out it wasn’t working? 7, 20 WL: Three years. 16 I told the congregation I was leaving. 7, 13, 16 I told them we had lost our mission and it doesn’t look anything like Set Free anymore. 7, 13, 16 AS: Set Free was the name of it? 7, 11 I just said I was done. 12, 13, 14 I’m going to go to graduate school now. 11, 17 I graduated with my four year degree. 7, 11, 16, 19 I didn’t start college until a year after I was sober. 6, 16 AS: How old were you? 16 I started my bachelor’s because my wife said, “You’re so smart. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I said, “You’re wrong. 6, 7, 13, 14 I’m not as smart as you think I am. 20 I’m a manipulator.  I’m really good at getting what I want.” 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 19, 20 She said, “Do one class. 6, 12, 13, 14 It’s no big deal.”  “Fine, I’ll do one class.” 6, 12 I did one class. 6, 12 AS: What was the class? 6, 12 Was it psychology?  WL: Well, my undergrad is in human services; management. 15 It was probably literature or English or a writing course. 7, 12, 13 AS: But you liked it? 9, 14 Well, I had to take the textbook and set it next to the dictionary because every other sentence I did not know any word. 16, 17, 19, 20 The first word I had to look up was efficacious. 16 This is how far down the socioeconomic scale I came from. 9, 13, 17 Efficacious is not a word that my people use. 9 What are you talking about? 6 Even to know the definition wasn’t enough because it didn’t settle with me. 16, 17, 20 I didn’t get it. 20 Today I think learning is so great. 5, 7, 8, 19 The first class I got an A. 6, 12, 16 My excuse was that it was an easy class. 6, 9, 11, 12 The second one I got an A and I told my wife that everyone in that class got an A. 6, 12, 13, 16 It was an easy school. 11 It was a crappy school. 11 The third class I got an A in. 6, 12, 20 The teacher was a pushover and she didn’t care. 7, 14, 20 The fourth one I was sitting with peers and I was saying the same thing. 7, 12, 14, 18, 19 This girl with tears in her eyes looks at me and said, “If you say one more fucking time that this is easy I’m going to slap you. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 I got a C last class.” 6, 12 That helped me. 18 Immediately I was like maybe Colleen is right. 8, 14, 16 Maybe I have some smarts. 20 I got through the bachelor’s and graduated with honors. 11 I went on to my master’s degree and took another master’s at night while I was going that. 7, 19 I got to meet Marv Seppala, the chief medical officer at Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation]. 11, 18 We became weight room buddies and started talking about neurology. 6, 9, 13, 15, 17 He told me about addiction neurology for free as I taught him how to lift weights. 7, 8, 13, 15, 16 AS: You just happened to meet him? 5 WL: He is the chief medical officer at Hazelden. 11, 18 AS: Right, but how did you meet?  WL: I was a student there. 11 As he walks in I was like, “Hey, Dr. Seppala. 9, 14 “It looks like you lift weights!  I could never gain weight.” 13 “Well, you’re an ectomorph and this is why. 7 You need to eat this way and lift like this and you will put on a few pounds but you are never going to get huge, but you can feel better about your body.” 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 “I’ll tell you what I’m going to be in here every so and so. 13 Do you want to come in and talk about addiction and you can show me how to do this.” 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17 Done. 12 I got a free tutor. 7 That was the two years following ministry. 16 I stayed up in Center City during the week and came home on the weekends. 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I became kind of an uncle to my kids. 13, 15, 17 My wife started drinking to cope with being a single mom. 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, 19 My meeting structure shifted. 6, 7 I maybe went once a week. 16 My eating disorder flared. 5, 7 I have been bulimic since I was twelve.  I learned how to meet weight when I was wrestling. 5, 7 Having low self esteem from growing up how I did was a way to keep my body composition in check. 5, 7, 17 I could binge purge and I wouldn’t drink or use when I was doing that. 9, 19 I did that pretty badly during graduate school. 5, 7, 11, 14 I got really thin and exercised twice a day. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 I was feeling shitty about being a dad that’s not there, but trying to get to the next level of my life because I have to do this. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 It wasn’t something I felt like I could do—I had to do it. 6 I felt compelled to do it. 6 Got to graduation day and got it done. 19 The only people there for graduation was my wife and my inlaws because five years prior to this I cut my mom, dad, brother, and sister out of my life for six years. 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17 I couldn’t have their chaos in my life anymore. 7, 8 AS: Which had continued? 19 WL: Just because I quit drinking doesn’t mean that that stopped. 15, 19 Her gambling and her lying and manipulating. 12 My brother’s meth use and my sister’s—I don’t know. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 She had several children with different men who were addicts. 7, 9, 13, 15, 18 It was just never a healthy scenario. 13 There were six years where there was no contact whatsoever. 13, 16 Not even a phone call. 12, 14, 17 We lived in the same town, so we would see each other and not say hi. 5, 11, 14, 16 Two years at grad school and then for the three years following that I was at Project Turnabout in an intensive inpatient treatment center there working with gamblers for the first two years and with chemically dependent for a year after that. 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 Nine months after that I was in public mental health at Sioux Trails in New Ulm. 11 Just this last October I gave notice and said I was going to start a treatment center. 6, 7, 13, 14, 18 I had no idea how to do that or if that could ever happen. 5, 13 I prayed about it and quit. 19 I had the gift of gab and we could make this happen. 5, 18 I’ve been talking to people, our policies and procedures have been submitted, the building has been bought, the outpatient building has been bought, furniture has been bought, and the employees have been hired. 6, 7 We are just waiting for two licenses and we are ready to go. 7, 18 AS: In Montevideo?  AS: What kind of a treatment center? 7, 13, 18 Then can you talk about your work with trauma? 6 This is going to be a mixed cohort of men and women. 12 There will be ten in the inpatient center.  AS: There is inpatient and outpatient?  WL: We have an inpatient and an outpatient, two sober homes, and a gambling unit all at the same time. 7, 16, 17, 19 All or none! 12 The inpatient treatment center is a six bedroom, four bath home. 7, 9, 13, 17, 18, 19 It is forty-six hundred square feet. 7 This is in a residential setting. 7, 9 It is a beautiful, big house. 9, 11 Ten folks in that place. 8, 17 We are going to focus on trauma using excelleration therapy. 10, 18 We are going to treat trauma first, and then we are going to treat chemical dependency second. 7, 16 I am very much in belief that chemical dependency is a coping strategy for whatever got you there.  Very seldom do you see the organic alcoholic where they take that first drink and say, I love that and I have a supportive enviornment. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 My parents loved me, I had everything that I needed—well, that can be a problem too. 7, 8, 9, 12, 17 I firmly belive that trauma is the nucleus of compensatory behavior such as drinking, over eating, shopping, gambling, relationship addictions. 7, 8, 11, 15, 19 In some way I am getting out of dealing with the original issue, which could be in my case the childhood sexual and physical trauma. 5, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20 AS: What do you mean in some way you are getting out of it? 15, 20 WL: You don’t have to deal with it.  I don’t have to deal with the somatic responses that are procured from my amygdala from the trauma. 7 AS: What does ART stand for again?  WL: Accelerated Resolution Therapy.  The God of my understanding works like this: he always shows me things that I need to know first hand. 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 The veteran that I worked with almost a year ago now that was committing an act of suicide caused in me PTSD. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 My symptoms were— AS: This was a man you were treating? 7 WL: I was called to an emergeny situation. 7, 13, 14, 17 I was not treating him. 7 He had put on social media that he was taking the coward’s way out. 18, 19 He was done. 12 He was not happy.  “I will be by the lone tree” was the word we got. 7, 12 I and another therapist and my wife raced across two counties to get to this place. 8, 12, 20 AS: You knew where it was? 6, 12 WL: My colleauge did.  He had a recollection as to where this was. 7 We raced to get there at ninety miles an hour to get there. 20 Behind me is a state trooper with his lights on. 17 He zooms past, so I get right behind him. 8, 14, 20 Another five miles goes by and he pulls over.  I pull over in front of him and he says to me, “What are you doing?” 14, 17 I said, “I’m going to the same place you’re going. 7, 8, 13, 14 I’m going to find so-and-so.” 9 “I’m a mental health professional.  I’m going to the scene.”  “Alright, but you can’t go faster than me.” 8, 14 I said, “Okay.” 13, 14 [laughs] 10 We got up to the spot. 10 He went past the turn off and I took a right and there were squad cars and an ambulance. 8, 14 I thought, Shit, he already did it. 6, 7, 10, 18, 19 We got behind the ambulance and my phone rang. 12, 14 It was him and he was asking me where the fuck I was.  I said I’m behind the ambulance and he told me to go up there. 13, 14, 16 I’ve got to talk to these guys and see if they can let me through the blockade. 5, 6, 8, 15 I went up to the sergeant and said, “Here are my credentials. 7, 13, 14 I’m a veteran.  Let me talk to him.” 6 “He has a weapon.”  “I understand.  I just need to go up there.”  They let me through and I spent three hours at his window. 7, 20 It got to be nighttime. 7, 16, 19 AS: What window? 20 Was he in a car? 14 WL: Sorry, he was in a car. 14 He had a gun. 10 Three hours of trying to negotiate with him.  I shared with him my military experience and his and how can I do this and then live. 7, 11, 15 How can I take that many lives and not be affected. 11, 18, 20 I was like, “Listen. 9, 14 You haven’t had the kind of therapy that I do. 18 I want to work with you and help you to get better.” 14, 17, 18, 20 I’m telling him about Accelerated Resolution Therapy which at the time I had only heard of. 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 I hadn’t needed to. 9 I had heard of other veterans who have. 7, 14 I was just telling him to work with me. 13 Anything just to get him. 20 Finally, we get down to that last minute and he looks at me and says, “I can’t. 14, 17, 20 I’m going home.” 17, 19 He grabs the trigger and I screamed as loud as I could. 7 I said, “By the blood of Christ I bind you.” 13, 14 And he stopped. 15 He cried.  He said, “If I get out of this car they will put me in jail.” 13, 14, 19, 20 I said, “If I go and get a letter that says no charges pending will you get out?” 13, 14, 17, 20 He said, “Yeah, I’ll get out.” 13, 14, 20 By this time the lieutenant is on the scene. 7, 16, 19 He said, “You’re not going back out there.” 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I said, “Just give me the damn letter. 11, 13, 14 He is willing to come out.” 17 I had to negotiate with him and send him a picture to his phone. 7, 12, 14 Finally he did get out. 20 I get in the ambulance with him. 20 I fill in the social workers. 18 I told them he was a vet and these were his experiences. 13, 15, 16 Be cautious.  Just trying to give them some insight. 11 We go home. 17, 19 I’m fired up. 7 My adrenaline is off the charts. 7 I don’t go to bed that night until four in the morning. 9, 19 Three weeks go by and I start to not feel okay. 6, 13, 14, 16, 18 I don’t know what is going on with my. 17 My motivation is low, I don’t want to do much. 14 I come home at night and I just lay around. 17, 18, 19 Pretty soon I had stopped shaving, I called in sick a few days, and I start to get very angry at the drop of a hat. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 I was suicidal and I’m not telling anybody that I am and I am. 13 By this time my wife started to notice. 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 19 She said we needed to call somebody. 9, 13, 14, 17 I started my own process of Accelerated Resolution Therapy. 6, 15 I went and got one session and my PTSD was gone. 12 It was lifted.  I walked out of there like I was pre-episode. 7, 20 I’m crying at my wife saying how sorry I was and that I didn’t even know. 12, 14, 17 I tried to explain myself as to why I was being such an asshole before.  She is such a sweetheart she just said, “It’s okay; you’re better now.” 6, 7, 13, 14, 17 I don’t deserve you.  I go back and do five more sessions. 11, 17, 19 We work on things like an old man that used to beat me with a stick and punch me and kick me. 5, 9, 16, 19 I babysitter that used to stick things in me and have sex with me when I’m little. 5, 7, 9, 19, 20 All of the bullshit I did when I left my son. 8, 10, 17, 19 I worked through that with Accelerated Resolution and I rewrote every one. 7, 12 I went and rewrote my first drink, my first cocaine experience, my first marijuana experience. 7, 10, 15, 16, 19 I don’t remember it anymore. 7, 13, 15 Can you give me a quick description of what that means? 11 WL: The reference on this is that this would be Dr. Candell and his work around dendritic spines and the protein synthesis that happens. 5, 7, 20 Images sit on the dendritic spines. 7, 15 It takes protein synthesis to activate the image in the brain. 5, 15, 20 When you recall a traumatic image it renders it unstable. 7, 14, 15, 17, 18 At that point it is maleable and can be manipulated. 5, 10, 18 When we use bilateral stimulation in the way of horizontal eye movements that mimic REM sleep we know that it reduces brain waves from a sedentary eight to thirty hertz to one to four. 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 My theory is that that’s what peels away the emotional response from the traumatic issue because it is like throwing icy cold water on hot trauma. 7, 16, 20 Just like that.  Immediately I went from being unable to talk about the experience to calm. 6, 15, 18 I went through the image in my mind as I was looking at the bilateral stimuation of the eye movements. 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 19 The first time I went through it I emoted. 7, 16, 19 I emoted around the fact that I saw his chest being blown open. 6, 20 I emoted around I couldn’t save him. 18 I emoted around I’m standing here and nobody is helping me. 7, 17, 18 This colleague that I brought with me went up to the window with me and fell apart. 8, 20 He didn’t make it. 18 He saw that man and he was drunk and had a gun and my colleague couldn’t handle that. 6, 8, 10, 11, 13 He starts to weep. 6 I was like, “Dude, go tell those police officers to go tell those ones over there to shut their fucking lights off. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 I sent him away. 20 Abandonment has always been an issue for me. 7, 10 Now my best friend abandoned me to stand at this window by myself to save this guy’s life. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 20 All that tied together I worked through with the eye movements for me because it was very much connected to past stuff. 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20 As we rewrite it we use imagination. 7, 9 Positive images. 7, 15 We rewrite it using the same bilateral stimiulation because it is maleable and we can write new images. 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19 All we have to do is imagine it.  It is voluntary image replacement. 7, 8, 15 The therapist I’m working with said, “You could replace this now. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17 The first time through the scene is emotion. 7, 16, 19 The second time through is no emotion. 7, 16, 19 The third time through you’re the director. 7, 16, 19, 20 You can make it better. 17, 18 How would you make it better? 17, 18 You can bring angels or a higher power.” 11 My imagination was when I pulled up on the scene I walked around the corner of the ambulance and someone came and walked right in between me and my colleague. 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 He’s got a big right hand. 8, 13, 14 He walks up to the window and the guy that is in the car that sees me there with none other than Jesus looks at him, starts to cry, gives Jesus a big hug, and we walk away and get him treatment. 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 When I think about that story I think about how real it is to see Christ standing there between me and my colleague at the time. 5, 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 It is a new, better image that prevents new triggers and new things. 5, 6, 7, 15, 17, 19 When I say I rewrote my first drink, instead of Derek handing me that Tab I slapped it out of his hand and I watch it roll across the street going all the way down. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 I never drank. 13, 18 AS: Why would you say that? 14 Why does that make you feel better? 13, 17, 18 WL: Why does that make me feel better? 13, 17, 18 Why does making the right choice make you feel better? 8, 13, 14, 17, 18 AS: Are you saying that is replacing a painful memory in your brain? 5, 7, 14 That you have pushed it away? 20 WL: I’m saying that I’m no longer an addict or an alcoholic. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 AS: You know your history, clearly. 6, 13, 17 Retelling it doesn’t affect you in the same way anymore because— WL: 7, 13 I’m not ever going to use drugs again because I know today as a professional what drugs do to the body. 5, 9, 10, 13, 17, 19 Since I’ve had ART I’ve had a drink. 19 I don’t drink to get drunk. 8, 11, 19, 20 I don’t drink everyday. 19 I don’t steal from garages. 15 I don’t—right? 8, 14 I say that not to prove a point but because I’m using myself as an experiment. 10, 14 AS: I think there are a growing number of professionals in the field that are thinking the abstinence only and abstinence always attitude towards substances— WL: 9, 10, 14, 20 When I went back and ARTed myself for every first that I had, I then felt comfortable enough to have a glass of wine with my food. 6, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I still felt guilty the first time. 6, 7, 16, 19 It’s been eleven years. 16 This is okay. 14 AS: Right.  What will I do the next day? 16, 19 This was October.  The first drink I had was in Tampa. 16, 19 It was with my wife in a beautiful restaurant and we had a beautiful night. 7, 12, 16, 19 I drank two glasses of wine and I didn’t think, “We should get a ball of cocaine!” 10, 18, 20 [laughs] 10 I’m not going to advertise what you should do after having ART therapy. 18 What I am going to do is give people the knowledge that the traumatic event and the compensatory behavior to eliminate the somatic response induced by that original trauma—when that trauma goes away you aren’t going to have the need to use. 7, 9, 11, 17, 20 You’re just not. 7 I’m not recommending that someone do that in the first twelve months. 7, 11, 16 I think there is a period of acclimation that needs to happen in the endocrine system because we have acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate and our transmitters that are very important in regulating my central nervous system. 5, 7, 15 Just making sure that those things return to equilibrium and homeostasis. 5, 7, 17, 19 We know homeostasis can take eighteen months for some people who have used exponentially. 9, 11, 12, 17, 20 Give yourself that time. 7, 16, 19 It has been eleven years for me and I’m not going to revert back to the town drunk in a week. 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 I am being very scientific about this.  I am journaling when I drink and how much I drink and what the effects are. 19 In four or five years, or less than that, when ART becomes the go-to modality for the world I’m the first. 12, 16, 17, 18 I am the first addict or alcoholic that has some kind of documentation that says this works. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 What does that mean for AA and NA?  I don’t care. 7, 14, 20 I don’t think those fellowships will ever go away because it is great to come together beneath one— AS: Yeah. 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 20 It is the support. 9 Can you talk about the ear thing? 6, 19 I looked it up but I would like to have you describe it. 9, 13, 14 WL: The bridge is a device that was created for the sole purpose of pain relief. 7 It was originally created for people dying of cancer. 7 They had dire pain. 7 A doctor recognized this opiate addict that was having this pain and utilized this machine on the opioid addict. 5, 7, 15, 20 He found out that it attenuated his opioid withdrawal symptomatology. 5, 11 He took it off of him and the symptoms came back. 11, 13, 17, 19 They created this device called the Bridge. 7, 13, 14, 17 I wish we knew we were going to talk about this because it is such a new science and it isn’t my specialty. 6, 12 I don’t have all of the details.  AS: That’s okay. 14 Just that you are considering using it. 9, 10 WL: Yes, we are going to use this. 9 It has been FDA approved, not that that says a lot. 14, 17 AS: Same with Oxy!  [laughs] 10 It does attenuate the withdrawal effects up to 62.8 percent in twenty minutes. 14 AS: It is a medical device? 11 WL: Right.  No drugs are used. 9, 10 It is an electronic device.  It sends an electric signal through the cranium into the amygdad reducing the amygdala’s response by fifty-two percent. 7 The amygdala is the fight or flight, freeze or faint. 7, 13 It is also affecting other areas of the brain such as the hypocampus to reduce symtomology. 5, 7 Imagine if you would jsut for a second offereing to an opiate addict like myslef, “Okay, listen. 7, 15, 16 You can be clean and it won’t cause any pain. 9, 15, 16 Are you interested? 7 Yes or no.”  I would have said yes. 9, 13, 14 No pain whatsoever? 13 Well, you might get the shits. 10, 19, 20 Other than that, no pain.  On day five they are boasting ninety five percent. 19 AS: That is phenomenal.  WL: There are videos.  I will forward you the videos so you can watch these patients prior to and after having this device put in. 15, 19 they wear the device for five days and in that five day period they become biologically clean. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 At the end of the fifth day we transfer immediately into medication assisted therapy [MAT]. 12, 16, 18, 19 Our treatment center is going to specialize in MAT. 7, 13, 18 We are working with an addiction psychiatrist for prescriptions. 7, 8, 15 We will be doing a lot of telemedicine because of our location.  AS: Are you going to do Suboxone? 12 WL: Suboxone, right. 8, 14 Suboxone is the only thing I am comfortable with. 18, 19 I am not as comfortable with methadone. 18 It just has too long of a half life and has no naloxone in it. 7, 8, 12, 16 I don’t want to take the risk of someone being on that and then using because they will die. 10, 14, 20 It has happened so many times. 5, 7, 16, 18, 19 That is our focus.  The ten inpatient group will come in as a cohort: they will get there together and leave together. 11, 16, 17, 18, 20 It is not going to be the same— AS: You gain a person, you lose a person. 10, 13, 17 WL: Nope.  You come in together and you leave together. 11, 16, 17, 20 AS: What if someone leaves?  WL: We aren’t going to fill another bed.  Tough.  AS: If it is down to three people— WL:  Then it is the three survivors.  That’s right. 8, 14 It is like a platoon.  AS: You will also be using a different financial model, as well. 7, 8, 10, 18 WL: We are using funding from the state. 10, 17 We are going to refund money when it comes down to— AS: You might be using money from the state but if people leave you won’t be getting money anymore. 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20 You’re taking a new approach. 6, 7 WL: God is our financer.  Do you think I’m kidding? 15 I’m not kidding at all. 15 Watch him do it.  I want to share something with your listeners. 7, 14 Probably a couple of graduate students that are writing this up for you— AS: Undergrad. 7, 11 WL: Undergrad.  Oh my gosh you are getting them young. 6, 15, 20 AS: They are very smart. 20 Great typers. 7 WL: Smarter than most.  Great typers. 7 Very educated.  Here is something you will be entertained by.  I left the public mental health clinic in October. 8, 11, 19 My mantra was:  I am going to outgive God. 11 I am going to work until God is made to look a little foolish for not giving. 13, 20 AS: Are you challenging God?  [laughs] 10 WL: A little bit. 20 What is the impact on you?  WL: Here is what happens. 5 He’s already blazed away. 6, 7, 18, 20 He introduced us to a donor; the patriarch of this family. 7, 19 He owned a goldmine. 16 When I say goldmine he literally owned a goldmine. 14, 16 He left for the wife, the children, and the grandchildren a trust. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19 They decided to spend all the amounts of money they have to spend in order to reduce their taxable responsibilities on recovery in Montevideo. 7, 8, 12, 18 I don’t know how much that is yet because we haven’t been given the check, but she asked us what we needed and we rattled off, “We need a van for this, we need a sprinkler system in the homes, medical devices.” 9, 11, 15, 17, 19 AS: Did they buy the house, too? 9, 11, 20 WL: No, we bought the house. 9, 11 This is what I mean by God has bypassed anything I could do. 9, 17 The house was already zone R4 when we bought it. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 18 We didn’t know that. 17 WL: Residential 9 Four mean that it is ready for occupancy for the levels we want it to be. 7, 9, 14, 18 Otherwise we would have needed a conditional use permit from the city. 9 I even went to a city planning zoning meeting and one of the people there said, “I’m sure there will be a public hearing on this.” 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 The city manager said, “No, there won’t because it is already zoned R4. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 We wish Recovery 101 all the best.” 13 [laughs] 10 I was like you’ve got to be kidding me. 15 I walked out of there in five minutes and it was done. 12, 14, 20 There is nothing they can do to stop us.  We have people coming out of the woodwork to help. 7, 18 There has not been one bump.  It has everything to do with the opiate issue that is going on. 7 AS: The people in the area. 7 We’ve got Dr. Willenbring that is doing all of our scripts.  Shelley Alkington is our board president who lost her daughter at age twenty-six to opiate overdose just last year. 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16 She has a bill at the House right now that would add a certain percentage to—don’t quote me here—but I think every microgram of opiate that is prescribed. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17 She came up with that. 13, 17 AS: A tax?  WL: It’s a tax.  If that happens that will mean literally millions of dollars, if not close to a billion dollars, in relief for treatment in Minnesota. 5, 6, 7, 13, 18 AS: That’s like cigarettes and the tobacco companies. 7 WL: How many therapy facilities do we have? 18 Less than a handful. 13 AS: We don’t even have enough treatment beds. 7, 13, 16, 18, 20 We don’t have enough sober houses and we don’t have enough—people should not have to wait a second when they say they are willing to go in. 9, 11, 14, 16, 20 Now that we have this bridge device, now that we have medication assisted therapy, now we have all these little things together. 5, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 We just need these great marketing tools to say, “Here we are! 7, 8, 14 If you need us here we are!  No pressure; no rush.” 7 I used to be an interventionist where I would go stiffarm people to go and leave no matter what. 9, 10, 19 Then there is this blow back of the addict that doesn’t want to go, or they fail and the family comes back and says, “We want our money back because our person didn’t get fixed!” 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 I’ve so walked away from that. 20 It’s just not a model I’m interested in anymore. 7 There were so many times along my own process where I was willing. 7, 16, 18, 19 Balling, willing, wanting out, but not knowing how to get out. 14, 17, 20 I knew there was a way, a number—we’ve got the new law too where if you call— AS: Steve’s law? 6, 12, 14, 16, 17 The Good Samaritan law. 16 And that came out of a non-profit organization that Shelley is on as well. 8, 13, 14, 17 AS: The Steve Rummler Hope Foundation.  We see all these great things happening. 5, 7, 8, 19 AS: Your wife might have been able to call for help without anyone seaerching the house. 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18 That’s right. 8, 14 AS: If your wife hadn’t been a nurse you would have died. 12, 17 WL: I wouldn’t be doing this interview right now. 8, 14, 17 WL: We’ve been married twenty-four years. 12, 16 She’s very healthy.  AS: And your kids are seventeen— WL: Seventeen, twelve, and seven. 15 My kids think I’m a hero today. 5, 15, 19 They really do. 6, 7, 8 My youngest, seven, who thinks dad is going to be some kind of celebrity. 6 AS: How have you dealt with the issues of drugs and alcohol with your teenagers? 7, 10, 15 WL: I’m open. 20 I said, “If you are going to use please just let me know.” 9, 13, 14, 17 AS: Do they know your story? 13, 17 WL: Not the details, but enough to know. 16, 17, 20 I don’t harp on things. 5, 19 AS: Do you tell them they are likely—do you use the genes thing? 9, 13, 14, 19 WL: No, but I let them know that it is very easy to use as a coping mechanism for things. 5, 9, 11, 17, 19 To use for coping. 9 You can get caught up in that.  I try to have an open and communicative platform to say how we feel. 13, 14, 18, 20 Being a psychotherapist I am attuned to eyes and facial expressions. 7, 9, 14 AS: Are you kind of driving them crazy? 18 WL: No, I give them their privacy. 11 I am a little less direct with them. 7, 20 I give them a little space. 11, 20 I let them fall. 11 When there are obvious things going on I have no problem saying that we need to wrestle with this a little bit. 5, 7, 14, 19, 20 Let’s talk about this. 6 They are great kids. 7, 8, 15 I know they haven’t used. 9, 17 I just know they haven’t. 17 I think they really want to make the best of their lives. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18 They have seen me struggle. 5, 13 Even in early recovery it was so hard to go from living in that old house. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16 I have remodeled every room in that house. 7, 9, 11 AS: Are you still there? 7 I took pine palettes and broke them apart a month into my recovery. 7, 8 I stored them in my garage for like five months. 7, 9, 11, 14, 15 They were enough to create wood floors for my kitchen, dining room, hallway, and living room all down to one and three eighths inch butt jointed together and laid them all myself. 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 Sanded them, stained them, polyurethaned them, put in carpet. 7, 14, 19 I have a lot of energy coming in. 7 [laughs] 10 AS: Went to college, redid your house, ran a church. 7, 9, 11 AS: Thank you.

"6","Cole_Bill","Ian McLoone Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 30, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Ian McLoone-IM Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan. 12 I am here in St. Paul with Ian McLoone at Alltyr Clinic. 12 Can you state your name and say you give me permission? 11, 14, 17 IM: Ian McLoone, I give you permission. 11, 12 AS: Thank you.  Do you want to start with your childhood? 6, 9, 14, 19 IM: Sure. 7 AS: Where did you grow up?  I grew up here in Minnesota. 7, 19 St. Louis Park mostly. 5 I was the eldest of four kids. 15 I was an overachiever throughout grade school and high school. 11, 13, 19 I was a big athlete and loved playing baseball. 17 AS: Can you give an example of being an overachiever? 11, 13 IM: I always got really good grades, was in the gifted program, was held up as an example in each class. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 19 I always had a lot of feedback like that. 10, 11, 17, 19 Positive feedback. 7, 11, 17, 19 I didn’t really get in trouble. 6, 7, 8, 20 I hated getting in trouble. 15, 20 The first ten years of my life my family was really close and loving and secure dynamics at home. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 19 I really would describe the first ten or eleven years of my life as idyllic. 6, 7, 8, 16 My dad was a professional musician for most of his young adult life. 6, 7, 8 When he met my mother he was going back to school and worked in the field of nutrition and wellness and eventually got an MBA selling weight loss programs to doctors and clinics throughout the country. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 He was a representative for Optifast or Nutrisystem or one of those things. 5, 7, 19 Novartis was bought by Nestle.  My mother stayed at home with us. 10, 14, 16, 17, 19 She was almost ten years younger than my dad. 6, 15, 16 When they met he was thirty and she was twenty-one. 12 She had us: me, my sister two years later, my brother after that, and then four years later my youngest brother. 5, 6, 16 AS: When were you born? 5 Right around eleven or twelve my mom started getting sick mentally. 6, 15, 17, 20 She started having more symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder and got into some drugs: cocaine, meth, heroin, and prescription drugs. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15 My dad was travelling at the time a lot. 7, 16, 19 He would be home every weekend, but he would be gone for a couple days at a time. 7, 16, 17, 18, 19 It must have been when my youngest brother was maybe four or five—I was thirteen or so—and she was spending longer and longer periods of time downstairs in the basement on the computer behind a locked door. 6, 7, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 I didn’t really think anything of it. 6, 7, 8 AS: Were you in charge?  IM: A little bit, yeah. 8, 20 One day she was obviously very emotional and all of us kids were at home. 15, 17, 19 She said, “Stay here, don’t go anywhere. 7, 13, 14 I have to step out, but I’ll be back.” 11, 16, 17, 19 We didn’t see her the rest of the night and my dad was out of town I’m pretty sure. 5, 7, 14, 19 At one point one of our cousins must have come over and hung out. 10, 17 I came to find out later that she was really depressed and in a bad spot and she went to Methodist hospital in the parking lot, slit her wrists—did it the right way so they would take her seriously—and went in for the first of what would be countless hospitalizations and rehabs and stuff. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20 She was sick for several years off and on in rehab, half-way house, stable, fall off, rehab, halfway house. 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 They kind of started to split. 6, 15 Something else happened and they broke up. 5, 8 She stabilized for a while.  AS: Did you live with your dad? 11 Soon after that she came out as bisexual or gay and was dating women. 12, 13, 17 Again, she got several years of stability. 13, 16 She met this woman and they had a child together. 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 She went back to school and was working on her Master’s and was teaching. 11, 17, 19 I’m in high school and continued to play baseball. 11, 19 I dabbled in drugs and partied and loved partying and having fun, but wasn’t enough to get me in trouble or negatively impact my life. 7, 8, 10, 16, 17, 19, 20 My senior year I was the ace of the pitching staff. 11, 16 I had been on varsity for at least two years at that point. 7, 10, 16 We went down to Florida for spring training and it went really well and I played really well. 6, 7, 8 We came back and were playing the season opener against Hopkins at home and I started the first inning and I couldn’t get out of the inning. 6, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 I was walking people and they were hitting runs off of me and my shoulder was aching. 6, 8, 19 It hurt like hell. 14 I had to leave the game and sat out. 15 I saw a doctor and got an MRI done and learned I had tore the cartilage in my shoulder. 5, 6, 14, 15, 20 That ended my season. 17 So, I didn’t really think anything of it and I finished school. 6, 7, 8, 11 I had decided to go to University of Oregon. 7, 8 I took a year off and lived in Portland to establish residency so that I could go to the U of O as an in-state student. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17 That was all fine. 14 Meanwhile, my mom and her partner started to fight and not get along. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 20 At one point she had a recurence to addictive substance use. 7, 9, 10, 15 Her partner withdrew and took the child with her. 7, 8, 9 At that time gay marriage wasn’t legal and she hadn’t yet adopted the baby. 7, 15, 16, 19, 20 She had no parental rights, period. 7, 8, 14 That just spun her off into a bad place. 8 She ended up getting really sick. 6, 7, 8, 15, 20 Crack and heroin and stuff like that. 10 That was going on throughout my whole college experience. 15 My sophomore year of college I came back to get the shoulder surgery done. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I was told that if I ever wanted to play catch with my kids when I grew up I would need this surgery to fully heal. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I came back for my sophomore year and had the surgery. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 Up until that point I loved drugs. 10, 17 They were great, but I didn’t do them all the time. 7, 8, 16, 19 I didn’t do them during the day or the week necessarily. 16, 19 It wasn’t getting in my way. 15, 20 I remember doing the surgery and getting out and going to my dad’s house and sitting in the basement and taking an extra dose of Vicoprofen and just loving it. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20 I had one of those moments when the clouds parted and the angels sang and I was home literally and figuratively. 8, 15, 17, 19 After that it was pretty much off to the races. 5, 7, 14 AS: What year is this? 16 From that point on I would buy pills off the street from whoever I could get it from. 7, 10, 20 It wasn’t quite full on dependence, but I had a love of opiates. 7, 17, 19 That continued throughout my junior year. 16, 19 My senior year I did an internship in Costa Rica, so I didn’t really use opiates while I was there. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17 When I moved home I had one semester left. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 I moved into a house where the guy who owned the house and was going to be my roommate did oxycontin together. 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 20 I just fell way into it right away. 8, 14, 20 Oxycontin continued throughout the school year. 11, 16, 19 In order to pay for it I had started shipping mushrooms from Oregon to Minnesota because you could get four hundred percent profit. 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 20 AS: What kind of mushrooms? 9 IM: Psilocybin mushrooms. 9 Magic mushrooms. 9 That wasn’t too much of an issue because my buddies here could get rid of them like that. 7, 20 It was so much easy access there. 11 I would just overnight them in a FedEx box. 19 I hadn’t even learned what the laws were or what was protected. 5, 16 I figured it was mail and people can’t go through your mail. 7, 19 I just figured you could ship it out and no big deal. 7, 19 It was fine for a while, but one day I needed cash and I had been doing a bunch of opiates and was not in a good place. 6, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19 The overnight shipping in the box I had packed was going to cost eighty-five dollars. 13, 18, 19 If I could get it into the smaller box it would only cost twenty-five dollars. 12, 18, 20 Being the fucking privileged idiot I was I was just like, “What could even happen to me?” 5, 9, 14 I switched the packaging in the shipping store. 7, 13 Obviously the dude behind the counter saw I was being weird and looking shady and he called the 6, 13, 14, 17 Eugene police department and they came to my house and arrested me. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17 My poor roommate was coming home as they arrived and they asked him if they could search his room—because they only had permission to search my room, and they didn’t find anything. 7, 9, 11, 17, 19 They asked him if they could search his room and he had a big stash. 9 We both got into a lot of trouble.  That was going on right as I was finishing school. 8, 11, 14 I graduated and a week later that happened. 5, 11, 16 I was out in Eugene with no reason to be there, no family, no job or anything and was just miserable. 7, 10, 17, 18, 19 My opioid use was spiking. 5, 9 Eventually I went back home to Minnesota. 11, 17, 19 My mom had been out of rehab for a while and was dating this guy who had offered to put us up in an apartment in St. Louis Park totally paid for a year. 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 19 It had two bedrooms and we would each have our own space if I would come home and move in with my mother. 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 I figured it was my turn because my siblings had been doing all this shit the whole time dealing with all of it. 5, 7, 10, 16, 19 It was my turn to come help. 17, 18 I did and the best thing to come out of it was that my first week I was there I was out at the Cabooze seeing a show and happened to meet this girl there. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 She was also into that scene of jam bands and hippies and fun.  I was standing along the bar and she thought I was with her friends or knew her guy friends that were there. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17 We started talking, but I wasn’t. 6, 15 We exchanged phone numbers and I called her the next day and we went on a date. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 Ten years later we are married and have three kids. 5, 12, 15, 16 It turned out well. 8, 18 AS: Can you back up to when you got into a lot of trouble? 11, 17, 19 What happened in Oregon? 5, 7 IM: They let us go that day because we told them that we would find a way to snitch on some people for them. 9, 13, 16, 19 I really didn’t have a dealer to snitch on and the people that I did know I had no interest in doing that to. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 My roommate though knew a dude who was responsible for more drugs than my roommate was, and he ended up being a confidential informant. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 In return we both got light sentences. 7 We were charged together and we both negotiated this similar light sentence. 11, 16, 20 It still was a Class C felony, which can be expunged. 7 I had to do three years of probation here in Minnesota. 16 I had to go back out there and serve a week in jail and do work release and community service stuff. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 That was a full year later I want to say. 5, 7, 14, 16 Felony on my record really made life uncomfortable and was a big pain in the ass. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 18 I had to go meet with the probation officer every month. 11, 18 It was not good. 6, 19 AS: How long did you continue using when you moved back to Minnesota? 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19 IM: I moved back home and I continued using oxycontin for several months. 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 The guy I got it from one day told me he didn’t have any more oxys but he did have black tar heroin. 6, 10, 13, 16, 19 I smoked it and it did the same thing that oxycontin did. 19 None of the horror stories came true. 12, 13, 17 I didn’t die.  It was identical almost except that it was a fraction of the price and way easier to get. 15, 20 From that point on I switched to heroin and smoked heroin for the next couple of years. 7, 10, 16, 19 Then I shifted over to intravenous use for the next while. 9, 16, 19 Things got really bad. 6, 7, 8 My wife didn’t know I was doing it for a long time. 7, 12, 16, 17, 19 I would just lie to her about it.  When she finally find some tin foil with the big black lines on it I told her it was opium. 9, 13, 16 That worked until she found needles and then I had to tell her I was doing heroin. 10, 11, 12, 13 We would have a big fight and tell her I would swear it off and that I was going to change and I wasn’t going to do it anymore. 5, 7, 13 The next week she would find more needles. 9, 16, 19 We got married and then bought a house and then had our first child and the whole time I was lying and trying to hide it. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 19 It all came to a head in 2010. 12, 13, 17 I had been going to the methadone clinic, which was helpful, but then I just started getting heroin and mixing cocaine with it and doing speed balls and fell in love with that. 6, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 AS: But you were on methadone? 10, 12 IM: I was on methadone, yeah. 8, 10, 12 The methadone would dull the heroin high, but if I mixed cocaine with it it was awesome. 10, 11, 12 I did that for several months and then I lost my job. 11, 13 IM: I was running a food shelf for a non-profit because I was fluent in Spanish. 8, 9, 12 I was the language guy of the agency. 6, 15 AS: You managed to hold a job, be married, have a house, have a baby? 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20 IM: Yeah, like I said I was kind of the overachiever. 9, 13, 14 It was really easy, but a big pain in the ass too. 6, 7, 8, 11 It would have been a hell of a lot easier if I wasn’t putting a needle in my vein three times a day. 7, 14, 16, 19 My employer had gotten suspicious and I was taking long lunch breaks and spending a lot of time in the bathroom. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 I got a new job at another non-profit and within the first week they knew something wasn’t right with me. 6, 8, 12, 14, 16 They let me go and I was on unemployment for the summer. 17 My son had been born in January and we had moved into the house earlier in November and I was on unemployment and my wife was working. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17 She had to go back to work sooner than she had planned because I wasn’t working. 5, 11, 12, 17, 19 I was taking care of my son half of the time because we had this other half time daycare that was essentially free. 7, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 I got so sick.  I spiraled.  It all came to a head one afternoon in the summer when we had some family friends over for a barbecue. 7, 12, 13, 17, 19 I still needed to make another purchase of heroin for a buddy of mine that night. 7, 9, 10, 18, 19 My friends were over and the guy I was getting heroin for was in another part of the city, but my dealer came through. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 My big plan was that I was going to pretend that I was cleaning off the grill out in the alley and my friends were in the backyard so I would just go around the garage and hop in the car, buy the heroin, and hop out, come back out, and have the clean grill and everything would be fine. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 We are sitting there and I didn’t think anything of it. 7, 18 All of a sudden one of my neighbors walks by down the alley.  Right across from us this big conversion van is there and the door slides open and this whole swat team comes out and arrests my neighbor. 5, 7, 17, 20 They subdue him and then one of the sargeants comes over and says, “You! 14, 17 What were you doing in that car? 14 You come over here. 17 Get on your knees.”  There is a shotgun in my face and my friends are all like, “What the fuck is going on?” 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 20 “Did you know he was doing this? 17 Did you know?” 17 They patted me down, found the drugs, and arrested me in front of my wife’s really good friends. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 I went to jail and spent a couple of nights in there. 7, 13, 19 My wife, bless her heart, she worked her ass off and got me an attorney and the attorney got me out. 6, 12, 14 She had even put money on my commissary so they gave me this check for forty bucks on my way out and I was like, “Cool.” 7, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 I cashed it at the bank, met up with my drug dealer, came home, and I wasn’t welcome at home. 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 I had to leave.  For the next three months I spent it worming my way back into my house with my wife and then getting caught using and then having to go to my dad’s house and worming my way back in. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 She kicked me out one night and my dad wouldn’t let me come home. 11, 17, 19 That was the moment when I had to make a choice. 15, 17, 18 He was just like, “Dude, come on man. 9, 14, 17 Stop what you are doing.  You’ve got a kid and a wife and things you’ve got to do.” 5, 12, 15, 19 I said, “Okay. 13, 14 If I go to rehab will you let me stay at your house tonight so I don’t have to sleep on the street?” 7, 9, 11, 14, 19, 20 The next week I did a Rule 25 Assessment and I went to Eden House. 9, 16, 19 Do you know about that? 17 AS: No. I have heard of RS Eden, but tell me more. 7, 13, 14 IM: Have you heard of the Synanon group? 7, 14, 18 They were the original therapeutic communities developed in the late fifties but mostly in the early sixties and seventies. 5, 6 They break you down and then build you back up. 7, 10, 11, 17, 19 King baby, hot seat on the bench. 20 AS: These are those people?  What is king baby? 20 IM: Somebody who acts like a baby but thinks they are the king. 20 It is really fucked up. 6, 7, 8 Back in the day they would shave your head or put you in a diaper if you were king baby. 12, 19, 20 At Eden House they would do that back until they got in trouble for it in the seventies. 9, 11, 17, 19 They had to tone down some of the blatantly abusive stuff, but everything else horribly abusive. 8, 12 From day one they were pressuring me to come off methadone. 7, 10, 12, 17, 19 They really wanted me to stop the methadone. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14 I wasn’t really sober and it was Hitler’s drug, all that shit. 6, 7, 8, 10, 19 They never explained to me what the research says or science or getting my consent. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 It was just old school nonsense SynAnon bullshit. 10, 11, 16, 19 AS: What year was this? 16 I bought into it.  A lot of it was prison mentality. 8, 17 You have to go along to get along, but on the side people are doing drugs and smoking fake weed and doing shit like that. 7, 9, 10, 15, 19, 20 I worked my way up in the hierarchy of the clients and was the executive client or whatever. 12, 14 The main client.  I would be the chaperone for things, or I would lead meetings. 5, 6, 12, 19 AS: You were on the good side. 6, 9, 19 I was the ideal client, but I was also smoking fake weed and acting a fool and playing along but acting both sides. 5, 7, 9, 10, 15 One day one of the other clients had a pass and I was his chaperone. 12, 17, 19 We went to his house and it was pretty uneventful. 5, 7, 9, 11, 14 At the last minute he asked me to give him a ride back to rehab. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 We had to be back by seven. 11, 17, 19 His dad said, “I’m not giving you a ride.” 13, 14, 17 We took a bus and went back home and explained what happened. 5, 11, 17, 19 We were an hour late or something. 5 We submitted a UA [urin test] and they were negative and everything was fine, or so I thought. 10, 13, 14 The next day was my pass and it was my son’s first birthday party. 8, 16, 17, 19 I went home and we had a birthday party. 8, 17, 19 Family and friends were there. 7, 13 It was a little odd because I was still in rehab, but everything was okay. 7, 14, 20 I get this phone call midway through and the guy on the line said, “Hey, you’ve got to come home now. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 Your pass is revoked and you’re on ban. 7, 17 You come home right now.” 8, 14, 17, 19 I was like, “It’s my son’s first birthday party and I’ve got family and friends here. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 It’s kind of a big deal.”  He said, “I don’t give a fuck. 11, 13, 14 Come home now.” 17, 19 I excused myself, went home, and then I was put on the bench for the next three days. 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: What does that mean?  IM: That means you sit on a literal bench out in the hallway. 7 You can’t participate in groups, you can’t visit with any of the other clients, you can’t attend lunch and talk to people. 6, 7, 8, 11, 18 At the end of the day you have to go straight to your room. 9, 19 You can’t watch television. 15 You’re on ban. 7 You’re persona non grata. 7 The only group that you can attend is your primary group, but all the other groups you are banned from. 11, 18, 20 AS: This is because you came back an hour late because you couldn’t get a ride? 5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20 It didn’t make sense. 9, 18 When the program director came in that Monday she was like, “I can’t be co-dependent. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19 I can’t let you let my feelings about your son’s first birthday dictate how I make a decision on this matter. 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 You have to be on ban and on the bench until I say so.” 14 I think that was the moment that I became utterly fed up with that model. 13, 15, 17 It felt like in my heart that there had to be another way. 6, 14 Had they managed to get you to get off of methadone? 10, 12, 15, 20 IM: I was tapered way down. 7 Usually what they do is you taper down to thirty miligrams and then you stop for a couple of days. 7, 18, 19 Then you take suboxone for a couple of days, and then you’re done. 7, 18, 19, 20 I was down, down, down, down, and actually that weekend before I was supposed to make the transition off my mom came to visit. 7, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 We sat down and she was like, “Ian, why are you so antsy to get off methadone?” 10, 12, 20 “Everybody says I need to get off of it and that I’m not really sober if I do.” 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 20 She said, “Dude, do you know the science about it? 13, 14, 17 It is incredibly effective. 7 All the messages you’re hearing is stigma. 7, 14, 15 It’s not grounded in truth.”  She said, “Ian, you’ve got a baby. 13, 14, 20 You’ve got a wife. 12 You’ve got a life to take care of and a house and all these things. 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 19, 20 People are rooting for you.  You have one chance to get this right and you should use every tool at your disposal and take advantage to make this most likely to be successful.” 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 20 I was like, “Oh, yeah. 8, 9, 14 I am happy when I’m on this stuff.  It does make me feel normal and fine. 13, 14, 18 I can sit and do things and be a human being. 5, 7, 19 Why am I in such a rush?”  I held off on that to their great displeasure, but I stuck to my guns. 7, 8, 10 AS: How long were you there? 7 IM: Four months. 11 At the end of four months I moved into the sober housing that they had and would just come for groups all day. 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 It was pretty much the same I was just living in a different location. 5, 6, 7, 14, 18 One of the kids that was in the program got busted for drugs or something. 8, 10, 15 They cornered him and made him write a list of all the people that he had ever heard of doing drugs or fucking around. 7, 10, 13, 14, 18 My name came up as someone who had done the fake weed. 11, 13, 17 They confronted me about it and thought I was injecting drugs while I was there. 10 I did cop to smoking K2. 10 They kicked me out. 11 I was going to go into longer-term sober housing, but because that was no longer an option I was able to go back home to my wife and our kid. 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 It ended up being such a blessing in disguise.  I just had to find another continuing care plan so that my probation officer didn’t kick my ass. 7, 9, 11, 14, 18, 20 I did and I did evening outpatient at Fairview and completed it and it was fine. 14 Somewhere around there I decided I would go back to school and pursue a Master’s degree. 7, 8, 11, 17, 18, 19 Right around that time I found the University of Minnesota’s Addiction Studies program. 7, 8, 11, 16, 19 I got into that and loved it. 17 At the end of my second semester the program director announced that they were doing an Integrated Behavioral Health Master’s program. 7, 8, 16 A full Master’s degree. 7, 19 I was admitted in the first cohort of student in the program, and she had gotten a grant from the state to develop a center of excellence for the study and dissemination of practice in cocurring disorders. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, 17 She offered me a graduate research assistant position. 7, 12 That paid all my tuition, a good wage, and I had some incredible experiences. 6, 7, 8, 15, 19 AS: What made you want to go into addiction medicine? 8, 13, 14, 15 I just want you to articulate that a little bit. 5, 14, 20 I know it is implicit, but you talked about the Eden model and Synanon. 6, 13, 17 IM: I had two felonies.  First of all I thought there was no way I was getting a job doing anything else, but I could get a job being a counsellor. 8, 10, 15, 19, 20 I think the experience at Eden House really made me question the conventional wisdom that was driving not just the program at Eden House, but everything that you would hear among people in recovery. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 How AA was the only way, it works if you work it, it is one hundred percent effective if you just do what you’re told. 7, 8, 13, 16 The whole time I am going to AA meetings, but I’m not able to disclose that I’m on a medication and I go to work with a sponsor and he tells me to get off of it, and it was all messed up. 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 When I found the addiction studies program and got into my first couple semesters I realized, “Holy shit. 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 None of that shit that people talk about in meetings and in rehab that I went to is grounded in science. 6, 7, 10, 12, 19 It is all lore. 7 It is all mythology and it doesn’t stand up to scientific scrutiny.”  That was really motivating. 6, 7, 8 As I was working in my graduate assistantship I started to become aware of some other folks in the field who were doing things. 5, 6, 7, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 That’s when I met Paula DeSanto and was just floored by her approach and the way she looked at things. 5, 7, 12, 13, 19 That was my favorite class that I took in my whole graduate program. 6, 8, 12 She stopped teaching at the U, so they just asked me if I would teach that class. 6, 12, 15 I will get to teach that, which is pretty cool. 5, 7, 14, 20 I read an article on thefix.com and this doctor was being interviewed about medications and why there is such stigma against medication. 7, 16, 20 I was reading through and going, “Good point! 7, 10 This guy knows what he’s talking about.” 6, 17 I scroll down and I click on his name and look at the link of his clinic and it turns out it was in St. Paul, Minnesota. 11 I said, “What the hell. 13, 14 It wouldn’t hurt if I sent him an email to see if he would want to have coffee and I could pick his brain a bit.” 5, 14, 20 I met Mark Willenbring in 2012. 12 We had lunch together and I was just enthralled and fascinated by what he was talking about. 6, 11, 16, 20 I asked if I could shadow him and hang out and learn from him. 5 He ended up overseeing my clinical internships and then once Alltyr Clinic got started I started very early on seeing his patients and doing therapy and counseling. 5, 6, 15, 18 After I got licensed I had a half a day here and the rest of time at traditional rehab. 7, 16, 18, 19 Over time I ended up working with Melanie Heu at Pangea Care. 7, 16, 19 They do culturally specific programming and different language specific tracks. 7, 8, 15, 18 I helped to develop the Spanish language track there. 15, 18 While I was there I had maybe a day or two days a week and then over time built up my caseload here. 7, 16, 18, 19 I built up my caseload over there and two years ago this coming August I moved over full time here. 7, 11, 14, 16, 19 I have been full time here ever since. 7, 13, 16, 19 AS: What is the model here?  IM: We are an addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. 8, 15 In the continuum of care there is a gap of services. 7, 14, 20 If you go to your primary care doctor’s office and you screen as a heavy drinker and your primary care doctor wants to help you get some help historically they probably would just have a rebah that they could refer you to. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 The problem with rehab is that the educational and professional requirements of the staff of a rehab are notoriously very minimal. 7 Very few doctors are going to want to refer their patient to a counselor who has got a GED and intrust their medical care to a doctor. 6, 7, 11, 14, 20 Most patients don’t need or wouldn’t meet the criteria for long-term intensive rehab in a residential setting. 7, 9, 15 If you have a sleep disorder your doctor is going to refer you to a sleep specialist or a neurologist or a neurology clinic or a sleep clinic. 7, 20 If you have schizophrenia your doctor is going to refer you to a first episode psychosis clinic or a mental health clinic. 7, 16, 20 Up to this point there has not existed a medically anchored addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17 We are trying to fill the gap on the continuum of services.  We have psychiatrists on staff, we have a nurse, we have four Master’s level trained counselors, and we provide fully integrated treatment for substance use and all mental health disorders under the same roof with the same clinicians. 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 20 Every patient that comes into our clinic gets assigned a primary therapist and primary physician. 17, 20 The first in-take evaluation you spend an hour with a therapist gathering history, finding out course, severity, symptoms, and past treatment. 7, 8, 9, 13, 16, 18, 20 Then you spend an hour with the addiction psychiatrist where you really dig into the important stuff and develop that first initial treatment plan. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18 If a patient needs a high level of care like a structured living setting and additional support than what we can offer in a patient clinic setting then we have partners that we can refer them to to get sober housing and LINE and IOP [intensive outpatient treatment] if necessary. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 We remain the constant in the patient’s team over time. 5, 7, 16, 19 We’ve got patients that work with us for a month and patients that work with us for five years. 15, 16 It all depends, but it’s not a set program. 8 All patients’ treatment plans are individualized. 7, 13, 15, 18 As things come up or the facts on the ground change, we change our treatment plan using the latest, best science and research to form our approaches. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 AS: How many clients are you serving right now? 8, 14, 17, 18 IM: I’m not sure. 7 That’s a good question. 6, 15, 19 I don’t know off-hand. 13, 17 We have a research assistant right now that is crunching numbers and things like that. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17, 19 Since we have opened it is over three hundred I would say. 7, 14, 20 AS: And that was just a few years ago? 16 A couple of summers ago Julie Rehovet who was the program director for the IBH [Integrated Behavioral Health] program until recently asked if I would be willing to teach a course with Dr. Willenbring. 7, 8, 16, 17 We taught psychopharmacology together. 9, 11, 16, 20 They had it the next semester but it didn’t really go well. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 The instructors didn’t really do a good job and she offered me the gig to teach that. 6, 7, 8, 19 I have been teaching psychopharmacology for a little while. 9, 20 Like I said just recently they wanted to start teaching the synthesis seminar in client centered care—Paula DeSanto’s class. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20 I’m going to give that a go this summer and see how that goes. 5, 11, 17 AS: How did things resolve with your wife? 5, 7, 12, 19 How did she deal with your addiction? 8, 15 IM: It was so fucking hard. 6 I was such an asshole to her.  I really feel badly. 6, 7, 8, 13, 18 AS: You still feel badly? 7, 13, 18 IM: I put her through the wringer. 19 She did not sign up for that.  All I could really do was work my ass off to try to repair things and make things better and be responsive. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19 I’m madly in love with her and she is the love of my life. 7, 8, 17 AS: There must be something more there on her part too because you don’t have to stay with someone through addiction. 8, 14, 15 If it is your child it is one thing, but if it is your partner it is different. 7, 8, 9, 18, 19 There is more to you than your addiction. 8, 15 IM: Thankfully. 7 She certainly could have cut me loose on numerous occasions. 14 AS: Did she find support where she needed it? 9 IM: No, not really. 6, 7, 8 She went to some Al Anon meetings and some Nar Anon meetings, but it was either WASP-y parents of folks who would talk about spending the weekend on their boat in between meetings, or she was the token wife of an addict and everyone else was there for their kids. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17 That was really tough. 6, 7, 8, 9 We have still gone back and forth on maintenance and stuff like that and it has always been an issue. 5, 7, 10, 11, 17, 19 I got off methadone a year and a half ago, but that is always a question. 10, 15, 16 Is there still a part of you that has cravings? 7, 8 Because they know now that it is really a brain thing. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 19 It’s not some sort of depraved part of you. 8 It is an actual mechanism in your brain. 5 IM: Yeah exactly.  I switched to buprenorphine. 7 That has been really nice. 6, 7, 8, 14 I got disillusioned going to a methadone clinic all the time. 7, 16, 19 Not because I didn’t like methadone and it wasn’t incredibly helpful. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 It had really minor side effects. 6, 7, 8, 9 But the system is so over regulated. 5, 7 There are five regulatory entities that oversee methadone. 5, 7 It’s insanity.  It is ghettoized.  The treatment plans you have to do are junk. 7, 13, 18 AS: You can only get it in certain places. 8, 20 You have to come every four week and you can’t go out of town. 13, 16, 17 Going to my primary care doctor’s office every couple of months was huge. 7, 11, 14, 18, 20 AS: Could you describe your typical work day here? 19 IM: My typical work day is just back to back individual therapy sessions. 11, 17, 18, 19 First of all we are an out of network private pay clinic. 5, 18 We don’t take insurance. 20 We don’t see too many people who are on Medicaid or Medical Assistance. 5, 18 We also really don’t have too many patients that are really wealthy either. 6, 7, 8, 15, 18 There are a couple that I can think of whose families are very affluent. 7, 15 Most of our patients are solidly middle-class working adults. 6, 12, 14, 15 We have some younger patients whose parents are helping them and maybe have come to Minnesota for rehab. 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 Went through the wringer a dozen times and finally found us. 7, 11, 16, 19 AS: Do you have a lot of people who have been through multiple rehabs? 7 IM: I want to say that is probably the majority of our patients. 12, 13, 14, 15 We do have a niche among patients that are on more of the mild to moderate end of the spectrum of [unclear] disease disorders. 5, 15 They come home each night and have three or four glasses of wine and can’t stop. 17, 19 They feel like that is too much and they have tried to cut back and quit and have found that really difficult to do who would never in a million years leave their life for thirty days and go to an inpatient rehab program or spend five nights a week going to a three hour group or doing an IOP program. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 We have a really solid niche of patients that are working professionals, especially thirty to sixty year old women who work or have busy lives and have struggled with drinking for five, ten, or sometimes twenty years but never found a place that they felt could serve them well. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 They will initially come in and we will develop a treatment plan which is often some combination of anti relapse medications and behavioral therapy. 7, 13, 16, 17, 18 As a team we will work together and find an approach that works. 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 20 AS: Do people have different plans for how often they come in? 7, 17, 18 AS: That too is very individualized.  IM: Completely.  Often times it is patient driven. 7, 14, 16, 19 If we think that they aren’t coming in enough and they are having symptoms and struggling then we will make recommendations, but it is very collaborative and patient driven. 7, 14, 16, 18, 20 If something isn’t working or they aren’t getting the support they need or are in crisis then we will refer them to Paula or a sober house and get them stabilized. 7, 9, 11, 15, 20 There’s noting magical about the treatment a person receives in in-patient rehab. 7, 10, 13, 17, 18 It is just delivered on-site. 7, 11 Once people realize that it makes a lot of sense. 7, 9, 18 AS: What do you see in the future for opioid treatment? 5, 7, 13, 18 What do you see as the best case scenario? 5, 13 IM: Back in the seventies if you had depression you would go to your doctor and they would refer you to a psychiatrist and nobody wanted to prescribe antidepressants because they were dangerous and had a lot of side effects and there was a narrow therapeutic window. 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 If you didn’t get help from you psychiatrist then you’d be committed for six months in the state hospital and treatment was essentially fresh air and sunshine. 7, 8, 11, 13, 17, 18, 20 In the eighties and nineties there was the Prozac moment. 15, 17 Prozac hit the market and was the first to come of many low side-effects, well tolerated, effective antidepressant medicines. 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 Nowadays, if you have depression the first person you go see if your primary care doctor. 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 They try something and in one out of three people it works on the first try and then if it doesn’t work they try a second one and they refer you to therapy and then maybe a psychiatrist and then maybe if you’re circling the drain and doing really poorly then you’ll go to a hospital for inpatient treatment and ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] for treatment resistant depression. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20 If you have addiction the first place you go is the hospital. 8, 15, 16 You go to inpatient treatment for thirty days and then build out from that. 7, 13, 18, 19 All of our treatments were all devised using samples of convenience: 7, 10, 13, 18 those who were hospitalized in a setting who were really sick. 6, 7, 8 All of our treatments were developed for the sickest of the sick. 7, 13, 18 Then we say that is what addiction looks like for everybody. 8, 14, 15 That’s like looking at an asthmatic on a ventilator in the ICU and saying that’s asthma, so we need to devise all our asthma treatments using that as the model for the illness. 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 18 Most of us are hoping to see that the first line of treatment for alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder, and hopefully eventually stimulant use disorder, as being the primary care office or clinic. 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 If the initial treatments don’t work then referring for specialists. 7, 13, 18, 20 What we need is a Prozac moment for alcohol and stimulants. 10, 15, 17, 19 We don’t have anything that is widely adopted, easy to use, and patented so there is a big push to promote it. 9, 11 We have it for opioids. 5 If primary care doctors would adopt it it could be effectively treated and managed in a primary setting with little to no stress. 7, 14, 15, 20 For alcohol use disorders we have several effective medications, but they aren’t being widely adopted partially because of the fact that there’s not a big incentive to use them. 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16 A lot of doctors don’t know or want to find out about it. 9, 14, 17, 20 AS: They also don’t know how to deal with addiction. 8, 15, 17 It will be education and training and getting new people. 6, 8, 15, 20 IM: That’s what we are trying to do here as we try to spread the word about this approach. 7 Most of our patients have jobs and families. 15 AS: Not to mention the cost of rehab. 7 There’s not just the actual monetary cost, but the cost to the family, employer, spouse, and children. 7, 9, 12, 19 There are so many rings around that model that are disruptive. 18 IM: Hugely disruptive.  AS: Thank you. "

I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this interview. 7, 11 AS: We're sitting in my home, 1942 Irving Avenue South. 7, 17, 18, 19 Also present is Zachary Mallet. 7 Did I say it right? 8, 14 ZM: Mallet.  AS: Sorry.  Mike we know each other and so I'm going to do my best to not presume in our conversation. 7, 13, 17 You can tell me things you've already told me before. 5, 6, 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 In my questions I'll make sure I do my best to make it clear for the purposes of this recording. 7, 11, 13, 15, 18 What I do with parents is I start with their own childhood and their early adulthood and some of their early parenting experiences. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19 I basically want you to tell me a condensed version of your life, keeping in mind where addiction or other issues you can kind of see. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17 MO: I was born in Ohio in 1963. 5 My dad knew that Youngstown, Ohio was not going to have a future for his very large family. 6, 7, 12, 19 I was the twelfth child born to Catholic parents. 5, 7, 9, 12 My dad just had the foresight to see there wasn't going to be a future there for his family so he took a big risk and moved to Southern California which not many people were doing at the time. 5, 7, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19 A lot of people were doing it but most people were like, ""Who wants to go live in that god awful desert? 6, 7, 9, 11, 14 There're no trees."" 7 I moved out there. 11, 14 Honestly growing up in Orange County in the 1960s and 70s was dreamy. 6, 7, 12 I say I grew up in sunshine. 7, 14, 19 I remember lolling around on the floor in sunny windows. 7, 13, 15, 18, 20 I had two very functional parents. 7, 12 I went to a good Catholic school which was a good experience. 6, 11, 15, 19 It was also a tough experience. 9, 15 I learned a lot about shaming. 5 I learned about control that I didn't like. 5, 9, 10, 14 I grew up with lots of brothers and sisters that I got along with well and loved dearly and did lots of things with. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 19 I had lots of friends. 7, 13, 15 I just had tons of friends ever since kindergarten. 7, 13 Life was pretty good. 5, 6, 7, 14, 19 It was good to be me. 6, 19 I got to spend my summers at the beach and it was easy. 11, 17 I never saw anything but pretty much middle class function. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 There were a few kids that went to my school that definitely had more challenges than I did. 11, 14, 15 I wasn't that tuned in on it.  There were kids that didn't want you to come over to their house. 9, 11, 14, 15, 17 I started to notice as I got older, I have lots of older brothers and sisters up to twenty years older than me. 6, 15, 16 They were long gone by then. 7 Some of them were moving out at sixteen because of all the kids in the house. 9, 11, 15 That my house was a refuge for a lot of my older brothers and sisters, they had friends that they were with all the time and they spent a lot of time at our house. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19 I didn't understand.  Some of these women were like other sisters to me they were around so much. 12, 15, 16, 18 They kind of helped care for me. 7, 14, 18, 20 I didn't know that they came from really tough houses and our house was a haven. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17 My mom was a gracious, giving, loving person. 10, 17 The holidays there were anywhere from forty to seventy people in our house at the holidays. 7, 9, 11, 18, 19 So many of them were these older teenagers who basically home wasn't a good place. 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 My mom had gifts for them and she'd cook for them and she would talk to them. 6, 17 She would counsel them like a healthy adult would which they didn't have access to.  I started to become more aware of that later on and I actually really admired that. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18 That people looked up to my family and that, ""You're so lucky"" and stuff. 7, 13, 19 There was definitely a culture of drugs and alcohol in my family. 7, 10, 14, 19 My dad drank but not a lot. 18 He would drink nightly when he got home from work but he would drink a little bit and have dinner. 17, 19, 20 He'd have a drink, he'd have dinner, he would maybe have another drink after dinner maybe not, then he would read the paper and go to bed. 7, 16, 19 He ran his own business. 9, 12 My mom was a little bit of wine on a Friday night, that was about it. 17, 19, 20 Older brothers and sisters drank a lot. 15, 16, 18 Some of them couldn't finish a beer if they had to in a night. 19, 20 Others couldn't have less than ten beers. 20 I definitely at a young age started to see drunks in my house. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15 Either my brothers and sisters’ friends, this is the 1960s, early 70s, lots of marijuana, lots of alcohol and no doubt other stuff that was going on that I wasn't keen on or aware of at the time. 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 I became very attracted to it when I was in junior high school. 11, 13, 16, 17 I knew it was a matter of time before I was going to enter that arena. 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 19 Sneaking a drink here or there at a wedding was one thing. 19 At my thirteenth birthday I smoked pot for the first time with my sister. 7, 10, 16, 19 I couldn't wait for it, just couldn't wait.  It was just kind of dark and mysterious and lovely and away I went. 17, 20 Probably the most regrettable choice of my life was using drugs and drinking alcohol when I was a teenager. 7, 8, 10, 15, 18, 19 I used excessively in high school. 9, 11 I smoked pot pretty much on a daily basis all throughout high school. 5, 7, 10, 11, 14 I drank pretty much every weekend, definitely to excess. 5, 7, 14, 16, 18 I got kicked out of high school. 11 Easily one of the smartest kids, just natural ability, things were easy for me. 5, 11, 13, 15, 19, 20 I could test out with “As” on everything but couldn't finish assignments, I couldn't stay in class. 6, 12, 13, 14 I just was bored out of my mind. 6, 7 I really wasted a lot of really good opportunities because I was way more interested in partying. 6, 7, 8, 19 I got into the business world. 9, 12 AS: No college?  MO: Just a little bit of junior college. 16, 20 I liked it but I had to go make money. 7, 9, 12, 14, 18 It took a lot of extended focus.  Paying attention was always a challenge for me. 6, 10 Off I went into the business world. 9, 12 All I can say is I was lucky. 14 I got into cocaine way too much in my early twenties. 6 I never stole or anything like that but spent too much of my own money and lied a lot about it. 7, 12, 13 I didn't like that I was always having to justify. 9, 10, 14 I didn't like that. 9, 14 My friends and I were always lying all the time about our lives. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 ""It was free tonight."" 7, 19 AS: You were lying about how much money you were spending. 7, 12 MO: You were stealing from yourself is what you were doing.  AS: You would have to justify it to other people.  MO: ""This one was free tonight because I did this deal for this guy and I helped him find some other people."" 6, 7, 9, 12, 18, 19 You just knew everybody was lying and you knew you were lying and I didn't like that. 6, 9, 12, 14 Cocaine was a problem. 7 The real problem was the alcohol that went with the cocaine because of the high, the amphetamine high and then to neutralize. 7, 10, 11 I've had hangovers for like three days before from cocaine binges and the alcohol. 5, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19 I could feel my kidneys just aching. 13, 15, 18 In my mid-twenties, maybe it was my frontal cortex came along, I was twenty-three and I had a horrible experience with cocaine one weekend and I just stopped cold turkey. 7, 13, 15, 16, 17 I just said, ""I'm done with that."" 12, 13, 14 I knew enough to stay away from the people that I used with. 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20 Pretty soon I was used to not doing it and I was okay. 5, 7, 9, 14 I still drank alcohol but not... 7, 10, 18 It was just weird.  My brain was changing and I was just less interested in partying like that, I just was. 5, 7, 8, 19 I was lucky because a lot of the people I grew up with are dead, are locked up, are institutionalized or basically still live at their parents’ house in their fifties. 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 Their lives never changed. 5, 6, 11, 13 I love those guys dearly but I just knew I couldn't be around them. 6, 8, 12, 15, 17 I got lucky.  AS: When you say the business world what were you doing? 9, 12, 14 MO: I was doing promotional marketing.  I was going around the country and anytime a big company was going to introduce a product to the market there was a giant assault on Peoria or whatever. 7, 10, 16, 19 Coupons, and billboards, and newspaper fliers, and coupons, and ads on TV. 6 We would show up with the samplers in supermarkets. 9 Sampling yogurt, or bacon, or paper towels, or Nestle Quick, in thousands and thousands of stores across the entire Midwest. 7 It was fun.  AS: They would fly you here?  MO: They'd fly me there and I'd be in a market for anywhere from two weeks to six weeks at a time. 7, 16, 19 Four weeks in El Paso, Texas was the longest summer of my life. 7, 8, 16, 17 It was good. 6, 19 I learned a lot. 5 I got into that business. 9, 12 I got into HR and I was doing training. 8 Part of it I really liked. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14 I liked the development, people development. 9, 14 Part of it I didn't like because mostly I had bosses who were just crappy. 5, 9, 14 They just weren't very good leaders at all. 6, 19 Some of them were really smart about business but that didn't really matter. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 20 The ones that I did like were few and far between. 6, 9, 12, 14 I was kind of interested in that. 7 I had a big triggering event for me.  I hired a young woman who was really terrific, just fantastic. 6, 7, 8 I was so proud to have her come join our team. 5, 17 The day she was supposed to show up she didn't show up and I was pretty pissed. 5, 7, 9, 14, 19 I made a bunch of phone calls. 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 The next day I found out she was hit head on and was killed the week before. 11, 12, 16, 19 She was pacing herself to see how long it would take her to get to our office. 5, 7, 18, 20 She was hit. 19 She was a newlywed. 6 I was devastated, just devastated. 17 I didn't even really know exactly what was going on but I was bereft. 6, 7, 8, 17 Not long after that I went to the food marketing show in Chicago and I went and saw some improv theater and I thought, ""God that was awesome."" 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16 Somebody in the group who I didn't even know, I had just met them said, ""You know what? 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 You'd probably be good at this. 6, 12, 13, 19 You should move to Chicago."" 14, 16 I'm like, ""I can't do that. 9, 14 I'm going to be a vice president."" 7, 9 I think a week later I gave a two weeks notice and I moved to Chicago and went and studied improv theater for three and a half years. 5, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18 Best move I ever made in my entire life. 7, 8, 13, 14 I moved to a big city, learned a lot about me, learned a lot about society, getting on stage doing improvisation and you will find out who you are. 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 20 It will tap into all of your darkest fears.  Seriously.  It will tear at you and you will find out how much you spend time in your head and how much you were trying to protect an image. 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 It's an amazing equalizer.  I got to watch some ridiculous talent in Chicago at the time. 7, 15, 16, 19 Amy Poehler was one of my classmates. 6, 12 AS: Were you at Second City?  MO: Yes, I was a student at Second City. 11 Steve Carrell was one of my teachers. 7 I used to watch Stephen Colbert on a pretty much nightly basis. 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 19 He was a remarkable talent, not entirely brilliant but he was just so brave. 7, 18 I'd just watch a person fail, and fail, and fail, and fail and then take off like a bird. 10, 15, 17, 20 That's a rare thing. 7, 19 Tina  Fey was just about a year behind me in the classes. 6, 12, 16 It was an awesome group of talented people that it was great to be around, thrilling to be around. 7, 8, 18 Artistic people and people who really gave a damn, social activism that I didn't grow up around in the very white Orange County, California. 6, 7, 8, 15, 18, 19 I met my former wife in Chicago. 12, 16 We got married and knew we weren't going to stay in Chicago because we'd end up out in the 'burbs and we didn't want to. 6, 12, 14, 16 We moved back to Minnesota where she is from and I really liked Minnesota. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19 In '97 we had a son. 17 My son Devin was born. 5, 17 It was just everything I've always wanted. 10, 14 I've grown up around tons of children, nieces and nephews, and I've always enjoyed children but I knew I wasn't a very mature young adult. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 I didn't want to get married or have kids when I was young. 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20 Here I was at thirty-four and I had my first child. 9, 16 He was just delightful.  He was just a lovely little guy. 6, 17, 20 I was just madly in love with him, we did so much stuff together. 11, 16, 17, 20 His mom was way more into labelling. 17 ""He's a spirited child."" 9 He's just a kid you know. 15, 17 He got along with everybody. 7, 15 Every kid liked Devin. 9, 14, 15 He just followed along. 7, 15 All through school every review of teachers was, ""I wish I had ten Devins in every class."" 6, 7, 11, 12 That being said, it's like, I wish he would say more. 9, 13, 14 He plays very safe.  he doesn't say much. 14 He's compliant.  He's a nice person. 10, 14, 17 There's no problems with him ever, at all. 7, 13 He seems to hang around the good kids. 5, 6, 15, 19 They seemed to guide him. 5 He was kind of a follower.  Attention deficit like me, no doubt about it.  No hyperactivity at all.  He had a really hard time paying attention to just about anything. 6, 7, 8, 16, 18, 19 He grew up in Montessori which is very self-directed. 5, 7, 19 He would find the path of least resistance constantly. 7, 9 ""Can we just go do nothing?  Awesome.""  AS: Again today? 5, 19 MO: They would reel him in on that. 7 His sister 16 Anna was two and a half years younger than him. 6, 16 They were super tight.  They did everything together. 11, 16, 20 They were just in each other's shadows.  She adored him. 7 She wore his hand-me-down Buzz Lightyear shoes and underwear and she said, ""I'm not a gore."" 7, 13, 14, 16 Girl.  ""I'm not a gore. 7 I'm a boy.  It's not a ja-jina, it's a peen.""  I was like, okay I've got a trans daughter or a son or whatever. 5, 9, 14, 17 Your choice, kid that's cool 15 Those two were very tight.  She was very self-directed. 5, 7 She was her own little boss. 20 She just knew what she wanted and she thrived in Montessori. 6, 12, 14 Devin didn't.  Devin's mom, Anna's mom, Amy is her name, Amy and I are definitely two different people. 7, 11, 14, 17, 18 Whether times were good or bad it was kind of a constant stress between us. 6, 7, 16, 19 It was hard being married. 6, 12, 16 We really like each other, in fact we loved each other very much but it just wasn't going to sustain. 6, 7, 8, 17 We were just wired so entirely differently. 7, 18 In 2010 we separated and got back for a short amount of time but it just wasn't going to work. 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 I moved to Denver, Colorado to separate ourselves. 11, 14 I knew divorce was just impending and I just wanted to get away from...I just had to go heal up for a while and get away from all this. 6, 12, 14, 20 I was traumatized, not that I wasn't going to be married anymore—that was actually kind of a relief. 7, 12, 16, 18 Not that she's a bad person, but it was toxic that we were together. 10, 11, 16, 17, 20 Just traumatized that I wasn't going to be under the same roof as my kids. 15 That was horrid.  That I wasn't going to be there with them and have dinner with them and make them breakfast. 7, 10, 18 That was terrifying to me.  Probably the biggest trauma I'd had in my life up until that point. 7, 8, 10 They were just too young. 6 I knew I wasn't going to make their lives more toxic by having them tolerate parents who didn't get along. 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 18, 20 AS: How old were they at that point? 10, 16 MO: Devin was thirteen, Anna was ten.  I was in Denver, Devin just started eighth grade at the public school and his mom called me and said, “Hey are you sitting down?” 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 I said, “I am as a matter of fact, I’m in my car. 10, 13, 14 “Devin’s been kicked out of school.” 11 “Okay.  What happened?” 5 “He was selling pot from the bus.” 9, 10, 19 Day one.  Day one of eighth grade he had marijuana and he sold some marijuana to somebody on the bus and of course thirteen year olds leak the story. 13, 16, 19 Maybe was he fourteen by then? 16 Doesn’t matter. 10 He got kicked out of school. 11 They interrogated him, it was not okay the way they interrogated him. 14 It was sort of no amnesty at all, you’re out. 7, 8 AS: No tolerance.  This was a public school? 11 MO: It was a public school. 11 He went back to the Montessori school for eighth grade which he was miserable about. 11, 17, 18, 19 It’s like, “You know what? 9, 14, 17 You are totally in charge of this having happened.” 5 We tried as much as we could to talk about, and we got divorced that fall, to talk about divorce and having talked to counselors. 6, 11, 13, 20 He was pretty surly, pretty pissed off. 5, 7, 14 He was a pissed off eighth grader. 19 “I don’t care about the divorce. 7, 14, 20 It doesn’t matter. 10 It’s okay. 14 It’s okay.” 14 I figured it was a problem but he just said, “It’s okay. 7, 13, 14, 19 It’s okay. 14 Just shut up.  Leave me alone.” 12 He got through eighth grade and was starting to hang out with some older guys who just were not very positive elements at all. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 He’s always been a follower. 10 Groups of guys hanging out wanting to cause trouble want to find followers. 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15 They always want to build their pack. 10, 13, 14 They were just kind of lost souls, if you will.  He was probably smoking cigarettes with them. 7, 10, 12, 13 At the time, I find out later that’s when he started to actually eat OxyContin. 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19 He was eating Oxis, occasionally.  They started out free of course. 6, 7, 15 Smoking pot here and there but for the most part we didn’t find, he never came home drunk, we didn’t find and paraphernalia on him. 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 We thought we were, because both his mother and I had had experience with youth drinking alcohol and using drugs that we’d for sure know. 7, 10, 15, 17, 19 I think he knew enough that we were savvy so he was pretty discreet about his use. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20 As far as we know no heavy use in eighth grade. 9, 17, 19 Freshman year was pretty much just disastrous, just barely enough, path of least resistance just enough to get by. 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 20 He swam, he was a swimmer.  Sophomore year same thing, just barely enough to get by. 7, 12, 16, 19, 20 Interestingly enough a counselor at school, this is telling because it kind of shows up later, a counselor at his school happens to get a hold of Devin’s academics and it wasn’t his counselor, it was a different counselor. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 I don’t know how this happened or who this guy was but he was an angel if you ask me. 5, 6, 17 He said, “Hey come into my office. 13, 14, 17, 18 You’re actually a smart kid. 7, 15, 18, 20 Based on what I can see here you’re smart enough to be an AP student next year.” 5, 7, 11, 16, 19, 20 He did because his best friend is really academic, scholarly young man. 6, 7, 8, 13 Devin says he didn’t know what that was. 14, 17 “You know what? 17 You can be an AP student next year if you turn this around the rest of this year. 7, 11, 16, 19 What do you want to do about that?” 14 It’s interesting all of his life we’d been saying, “You can do better. 7, 8, 9, 14, 17 You’re smarter than this.” 7, 20 It’s just like Charlie Brown’s teacher, “Wamp, wamp, wamp.”  A stranger happened to see something that he thought was promising and all of a sudden it kind of took hold and Devin worked hard that second half of his sophomore year. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17 He got into AP classes his junior year. 6, 12, 16 AS: Was he in a public school by this point? 10, 11 MO: He’s in public school. 11 He’s in Chaska High School which at the time was huge, it hadn’t split yet. 7, 15, 16, 19 It was an enormous high school. 11 It had lots of wealthy Chanhassen kids, farm kids from Carver County, lots of Latino kids from down by the river. 9, 15, 19 It was a pretty diverse mix of a very very large high school where you can get lost. 5, 7, 11, 14, 20 You can hide out in a big school like that. 11 His junior year he was taking AP classes. 6, 12, 16 He had to hang out with kids who were good AP students. 5, 6, 11, 15, 19 He had to follow them and learn how to study and learn how to do homework and learn how to prep. 5, 7, 17, 19 He struggled mightily with all the courses, especially the AP courses but he was passing them. 8, 17 His junior year his swimming was great. 7, 8, 16 By springtime he was really fit and I’m like, “Yay! 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 19 We raised a good kid.” 5, 6, 15, 19 We were kind of cocky about it, I was.  AS: Are you back here at this point or are you still in Denver? 7, 10, 11, 17, 19 MO: I’m living in Chaska with my fiancée Priscilla. 6 She was living with me in Chaska. 6 That junior year Cilla and I got married up at Lake Superior. 12, 16 Devin was there with his sister and Cilla’s two grown children. 7, 9, 16 Cilla’s two grown children and my son smoked pot that weekend up at that rented house we were at. 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 No big deal, seriously not a giant big deal that teenagers smoke a little pot. 10, 15, 20 In the spring his mom found him smoking dope in the house and we confiscated some buds from him. 9, 10, 11, 17 Then all of a sudden it was interesting he started to get pretty surly. 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 20 A very gentle, compliant, nice young man was all of the sudden showing a nasty side of him. 6, 9, 14, 17 It was uncomfortable but it was also like he was expressing himself. 7, 18 He kind of wanted to create his own space and keep what was his. 7, 14, 17 Basically he blamed us. 14, 17 “There was no problem until you caught me. 7 Everything was fine.” 14 “It was a really good springtime until you caught me. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 So I’m not the problem, you’re the problem.” 7 Oh okay. 14 We started to sporadically test him and he was testing negative with urine analysis. 6, 13, 14, 15, 17 That summer he was working at a restaurant and he really liked it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17 They really liked him and he was making money and he was making friends at work. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 His high school buddies and he was hanging out with some older kids and meeting customers. 5, 6, 11, 15, 16 The diner busboy and waiter and cook and all kind of aprons at that place. 8 It was a pretty good summer overall. 5, 6, 7, 14, 17, 19 There were a couple things we were starting to just notice a change. 5, 6, 7, 19 He was becoming more of an adult for one thing. 7, 19 There was a bit of a darkness that was starting to show up. 5, 6, 9, 20 It got my attention and it got his mom’s attention. 6, 17 Sometimes it was him being sort of a brooding seventeen-year-old and other times it was weird, there was a transformation going on there. 7, 8, 12, 16, 19 I had a brand new marriage. 6, 15 We rented a beach house in California in August and the morning that we were to go I found Devin spaced out in the kitchen, no in the basement, gaming at six in the morning or five in the morning. 7, 9, 11 We had to get on a plane pretty soon. 5, 7, 14, 20 He was tripping really hard. 6, 7, 8 We didn’t know what was going on and we didn’t know if we were going to be able to get him on a plane or not. 17, 18, 20 Ultimately we found out what he did was he ate a bunch of Ambien and then if you stay awake, if you don’t fall asleep it tries to put you to sleep but if you can stay awake through that it’s like a Quaalude, you don’t fall asleep you trip. 11, 14, 19 He was tripping and he doesn’t even know how much he took. 17 It was not a good sign at all, that he was experimenting. 6, 19 The internet had loads of methodologies out there. 10, 12 He started his senior year at Normandale [Community College]. 6, 11, 15, 16 He was a PSEO student, is that what they call it? 11, 14, 17 AS: Yes.  MO: He was going to start to chop away some college credits. 6, 7, 20 Things almost immediately got dark. 12, 15 Things started to really get bizarre. 6, 7, 8, 15, 20 He had his own car so he was commuting to school. 11, 14 It was a lot of mysterious behavior.  Lots of, “I need to bring something to my math teacher at nine o’clock at night.” 19 Really?  If he says he does, he does right? 8, 14, 17 His mom just got married. 12, 16, 17 So she was in a brand new marriage. 6, 15 I was in a new marriage. 6, 15 Amy calls and says, “Hey are you sitting down?” 7, 14, 17, 18 Tell me what’s going on.”  “Devin’s been fired from his job.” 7 “He stole five hundred dollars cash, taken it out of the till.” 18, 20 AS: From the restaurant? 7, 16 From the restaurant. 7, 16 We called the guy who fired him. 6, 7, 13, 14, 17 Devin was devastated. 17 He was just demoralized.  He was just dropping into a hole having been caught doing this.  It was interesting, the guy said, “Hey I don’t know what’s going on with him but six months ago he was our best employee and everyone loved him. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 Customers, employees, bosses.  Couldn’t pick a better guy. 5, 6, 17 Six months later he’s the fucking worst. 5, 11, 16 We were ready to fire him anyway. 7, 18 He’s just awful. 7 This is a firable charge. 18 We could actually press charges but we’re not going to because I suspect there’s something definitely wrong with your son and you should check what’s going on.” 6, 7, 14, 17, 18 As soon as I got off the phone I called my wife who was at work and I said, “Do you have cash here at the home?” 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 She did, she had several hundred dollars stashed to give to her sons for birthdays and stuff. 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 That money was gone. 7, 12 We started to find close to a thousand bucks had already been… 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18 He just said it was cigarettes and gas money which was bullshit. 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 My wife works at a family practice clinic. 6, 7, 8, 12, 19 A physician in her clinic, Dr. Levy, is an addiction specialist. 8, 15 She was telling him about these patterns and he said that was really telling. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14 He asked her, “Does this guy Devin have any felonies.” 6 She said, “No, I don’t think so. 13, 14 He said, “I assure you he’s engaged in felony behavior. 7, 13, 14, 15 I assure you.” 7 I called Amy and told her that, Devin’s mom, we started to circle the wagons around a…we didn’t know he was a heroin addict. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 He’s a poly-user but he had started to go from eating, snorting, smoking Oxi to snorting and smoking heroin and finding out it’s cheaper and much more effective to shoot it. 6, 9, 10, 15 He was shooting dope.  He was dealing. 5 He was dealing club drugs. 5, 10 The entire southwest metro my son was the dealer. 7, 12, 14, 17 He was the big connect for all the schools down there which was very demoralizing to me. 11 Things came to a head. 12, 13, 17 We really started to circle things up pretty tight on him. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 19 He was very vicious.  It was very dark because we were cutting off his… 14 when you cut off an addict’s supply it’s like you’re cutting off his air. 7, 14, 15 He was getting incredibly mean and really dark. 6, 7, 8, 15, 20 Turns out he was terrified of the heroin but he couldn’t quit. 10, 19 He tried to quit on his own. 19 He was going through horrible withdrawals and then he would go and score again. 7 It got to a point where he forged a check, drove to Minneapolis to go score, he went to go just by a couple of premade syringes to kill himself. 7, 10, 13 He was going to kill himself with heroin that night. 19 He gave a couple guys a hundred bucks and those angels flew away, they just took his money and said, “We’re not going to get him anything. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 We’re just going to take the money for ourselves.” 7, 12, 20 They didn’t give him anything. 11 He ended up overdosing on DXM which is just over-the-counter cough medicine. 8 That’s all he could get. 20 He was so desperate which isn’t lethal.  It could kill you if you took enough. 16, 20 Basically it put him into Hennepin County Medical Center, he was in the emergency department for overnight and then spent four days in the ICU. 7, 8, 14, 17, 18, 19 We were just devastated that our son was as sick as he was. 17 AS: He had done cough syrup but he was also in withdrawal.  MO: Oh yeah. 8 AS: So he was in opioid withdrawal. 5 MO: He was in opioid withdrawal and then took all this over-the-counter DXM which really messes with your blood pressure. 5, 6, 7, 8 He was in Hennepin County Medical Center and circling the drain but mostly terrified, mostly so scared, very very sad. 5, 7, 14, 20 AS: When was this Mike?  MO: This was November of 2015.  We got him into Hazelden.  He did the outpatient.  You’re under the illusion that twenty-eight days sleep is going to shine him up and take some of the dents out and he’s coming home. 7, 17, 18, 19, 20 He was just clean, that’s really all he was. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16 He was surly.  The Twelve Step didn’t mean anything.  Instantly right off the bat he was saying, “I’m just going to go back to smoking pot and drinking because that was fine. 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 That’s not a problem. 7 I’m just not going to do heroin anymore.” 7, 10 “You can’t do that now.” 17 I’ll be fine. 14 Just leave me alone.” 12 Happened to find out that this was where the anger really started to come up, he was dealing directly with gangs in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Russians and Latin Boys. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 17 He had carried a series of weapons, one, two, three pistols including a cop killer, including a forty-five with cop killer rounds. 14 Those rounds would go right through a vest. 8, 14 Found out that he’s been shot at, found out that he has shot at people. 11, 20 He was hanging out with the gang and he threw a pistol out the window. 5, 7, 20 He fired some rounds at boys who were in a neighborhood, in a neighborhood! 7, 12, 17 He robbed a person at gunpoint. 10, 17 He robbed a couple people on the street at gunpoint. 7, 10, 20 AS: When did you find all this out? 9 MO: Just found out about all that from debriefing and Hazelden. 11 He was still a minor so we had access to his interview records and stuff. 7, 11 AS: He was seventeen?  MO: He was seventeen.  He was seventeen doing horrid felonies at great risk to kill himself and kill other people. 7, 8 That’s when my rage really came up. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17 I was just unbelievably distraught that my gentle son who basically had to quit football in seventh grade because he couldn’t hit a guy—it wasn’t him. 6, 14, 17, 19 That’s why he switched to swimming.  He’s just such a gentle soul and here he is doing very dangerous drugs and making life very risky for other people. 7, 8, 10 I was just really distraught. 6, 7, 8 Along the way I knew and I remember hearing something at Hazelden at the family program about find a family program. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Find a NarAnon or an AlAnon therapy group. 18 I knew enough about recovery because two of my brothers, two of my oldest brothers, had been in recovery at that time for almost fifty years in AA. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 I had lost a sister, one of my sisters. 15, 16 This year will be ten years. 16 Dead from alcoholism. 10 Zero treatment just drank herself to death. 7, 13, 18 I knew that I needed help because I was in so much torment between sadness, anger, sitting on top enormous fear, a brand new marriage, a daughter the good kid, the proverbial good kid, who was getting ignored, the stress between Devin’s mother and I. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 She found an AlAnon meeting and I found a NarAnon meeting. 6, 11 Learning almost immediately, one of my friends came up to me, one of the dads, and said, “This is going to unfold for a very long time.” 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 Which was stunning to me, it hurt because I knew he was telling the truth because his own child had been in addiction for a number of years. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I started to get better at accepting the brutal reality. 6, 7, 15, 17, 20 Having people say things like, “Hey the good news is he’s young. 5, 6, 9, 14, 19 It sounds like you caught it early, that’s great.” 6, 7, 8 The challenge is he’s young. 6 They think can outsmart this brutal disease, their healthy, their bodies are fairly healthy and they can bounce back from drug trauma. 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 You’re kind of like, you know it’s tough. 7, 9, 14, 17 One of my friends told me the anger that I had about the terrible violent violations that were going on, “Use that energy when you go to set boundaries. 7, 13, 16 Don’t bring the energy to the meeting but bring that energy like here’s why it’s important that we set these boundaries.” 6 So I started to find out very quickly that this wasn’t a problem that was going to get solved, very quickly. 5, 6, 7, 9, 15 Nobody was there to tell me what to do. 13 I just showed up and kind of just shut up and listened, feel safe and having a safe place to tell your story and what it’s like to feel like this in learning from other people who have been doing this awhile that there are ways to navigate this. 5, 8, 9, 13, 18 This was really important to find out. 6, 7, 8, 9 I wanted to fix it and it wasn’t going to get fixed. 14 Having another dad walk up to me and telling me that relapse is predictable in young addicts, it’s extremely predictable. 6, 7, 13, 15, 18 Most addicts do relapse after treatment number one, especially young addicts. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 You have an opportunity to prepare for what you’re going to say, how you’re going to stand, your tone, everything. 7, 12, 14 What he said was, “Don’t do what I did.” 13, 14 He blasted his son when he relapsed and he made it worse. 7, 13, 17 Just other things I learned along the way was, for me, again everything I learned there I just stole shamelessly from other people what they said. 5, 13, 14, 19 Not the first time I heard it, a lot of times it took a couple times to hear it. 7, 14, 16, 19 AS: It’s not stealing.  MO: It’s borrowing shamelessly.  Shameless borrowing.  AS: That’s the whole point. 10 MO: Exactly.  I’d hear something ten times and on the eleventh time it would crystallize. 7, 14, 16, 19 Of course you plan and you go deal with this, the enemy always gets to vote. 10, 20 You would start to learn very quickly that you have to learn how to be resilient and not go off. 5, 6, 7 One of the things I noticed when I was interacting with this addict and he was now sober but he was not in recovery. 5, 7, 8, 15, 17, 19 I was more scared of me than him. 7, 14, 20 I was so awful in how I would interact with him and he wasn’t doing what I expected. 7 AS: Can you back up a little bit and talk about how you approached fathering. 6, 11, 17, 19, 20 We don’t say fathering very often but how you approached it and then what his addiction changed in you and how that rage kind of manifested? 5, 6, 8, 14, 15, 18 I don’t have the sense that you were an overbearing and unreasonably demanding father. 7, 9, 10, 17 If you could just talk about what kind of a father were you? 6 Where did that rage come from? 15, 17 MO: Mostly I’m a pretty gentle soul. 5, 7, 14 I’m a bleeding heart. 6, 14 I like to have lots of experience but I don’t like to ruffle things too much, maybe. 5, 9, 14, 15, 16, 19 Some people would say I’m very much a ruffler. 14 I kind of say what’s on my mind. 6, 14 Living in Chicago changed my heart, changed my mind about the way I saw the world. 5, 6, 12, 14, 16 Life wasn’t lily white Orange County; it was challenging, it was troubling, it was a lot of people. 15, 19 I had enormous exposure to the gay community and to Jewish people and people from all ethnicities. 7, 19 It started to really change the way I saw the world and how I wanted to be in the world and of course how I wanted to influence my children. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15 I had no belief that I was going to affect how they saw the world. 6, 12 They’re going to choose it for themselves. 7 I grew up with pretty conservative parents who probably, my dad definitely wanted me to be like him which never worked for me. 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 19 With my children I definitely had a very experiential, way way way less about stuff and way more about experiences. 7, 9, 14, 15 Kind of like the Canadian model or the European model.  I’d rather that they do things than have things. 5, 19 I was definitely outspoken politically, talk about how it’s not okay to not treat people okay. 6, 7, 14, 17 We grew up in very white, my children grew up in very white Carver County and Chaska. 7, 9, 15, 19 Extremely Christian, extremely white, extremely conservative. 7, 15, 19 I likened us to being blue eggs in a very red nest. 7, 9, 14 There weren’t a lot of us out there.  I would challenge some of the norms out there in thinking.  My children saw the city a lot. 6, 7, 9 We went in to the city a lot.  Including walking around and seeing things like homeless people and people who were acting completely bizarre on the street. 5, 6, 7, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 I was like, “I’m not there to judge those people. 9, 14 That’s a person who has problems. 7, 10, 17 That’s a person who needs help. 10, 15, 17, 18 That can happen to anybody.” 5 I didn’t want to shelter them from the way the world is or the way the world was. 12, 14 I really wanted them to see the world and not have to go to a Minnesota school and marry somebody just like you and live in a neighborhood like this. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 God forbid you would do that.  The reason I liked living out here was there was just a lot of open space. 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20 That was the experiential part. 8 I couldn’t care less about the neighborhood but I loved the trails and the open space and just lots of nature and water and cool places to be with my kids. 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20 For the most part I’d try to be as conversational as possible, not too punitive. 8 Time outs, there were times when those freaking spaced out little kids needed a time out more for me or for their mom than for them. 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: That’s what I used to say. 9, 14 MO: They grew up in Montessori. 7, 19 If you turn their room into a cell they’re not going to like going into their room. 7, 9 If you get punished in your room you’re not going to have a lot of joy in your room. 7, 9 I grew up in parochial school where you were basically told you were a filthy, awful sinner and you weren’t to be trusted so good luck. 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 Montessori was like, “Why don’t we give them one hundred percent trust? 6, 9, 11, 14 Trust them one hundred percent at the beginning and then they get to demonstrate whether they can keep the trust. 6, 17, 20 To the extent that they violate it we reel them in. 5, 7 There’s a consequence for violating the trust but we start to give them opportunities to reel the slack back.” 6, 7, 11, 17, 19 Some parents out there in Carver County were like, “No way!” 7, 9, 12, 14 I’m like, “Yes way. 9, 14 That’s exactly how I think you should treat people, trust them. 6, 7 Trust them and if they don’t present that they’re trustworthy then you have to keep them close, then they have to start to show up differently. 6, 7, 9, 13, 17, 18 I want them to learn that early on.” 5, 6, 14 That was really my methodology. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 I spoke very openly, before my son and daughter were even ten we were talking about drugs and alcohol. 5, 6, 10, 17, 20 I talked about the disease in my family. 6, 7, 13, 19 I talked about my own experience and I talked about my own regrets. 6, 7, 13, 15 I knew enough about brain science that their little brains, if they can get through their teen years without experimenting, especially any sort of heavy use the likelihood of addiction drops dramatically. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 Addiction is a really tough illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 I said, “Your Aunt Eileen is dead now. 13, 14, 17 Those people downtown, they started early. 6, 15 I started early and I wish I wouldn’t have.” 6, 15 I was really transparent about my own use. 6, 7, 8, 9 I probably sounded like Charlie Brown’s teacher to my son as he started to get older. 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 “I’ll be fine. 14 I’m just going to experiment.  I’ll be fine.” 14 I was angry about that, that he went as far as he did even though I told them about it. 9, 13, 16 Somehow that made it a pact. 13 My wife now, Cilla, she’s like, “That doesn’t mean shit coming from a parent.” 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19 It really doesn’t. 6, 7, 8 A teacher would have way more impact, a physician could have way more impact than your actual parent. 7 You mean well, you intend well that doesn’t mean you have influence over their lives. 8, 11 You have an enormous amount but the stuff you really want to have it’s so hollow. 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 Right?  “You could do better; you could do better.” 17 Then some counselor comes in and says, “You could do better” and all of a sudden he did better. 14, 17, 20 Kind of humbling.  AS: Can you describe a moment where you felt like you were kind of out of your body with your anger? 6, 15, 17 I feel like there’s a point for a parent where we just can’t take in what’s actually happening and how we respond to that I think says a lot about addiction. 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 MO: The combination of the violence and the potential violence and the weapons and dealing. 5, 10 I knew there were probably parents who would gladly, if they could have, they would have shot my son right in the head. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 If they would have known that he was the one who got drugs into their little kid’s hand they would have shot him right in the head. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 Part of me couldn’t argue with that as a parent. 7 That was the stuff that really like, “I thought you knew better. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 We’re gentle people. 7 We move away from fights.” 13, 14, 20 I didn’t watch football. 15 I grew up watching football but it got to a point where I’m like, “This is so stupid. 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 19 This is just such a stupid waste of time.” 7, 16, 19 Fairly passive people. 17 For him to engage in stuff with such ease it seems like, there was a lot of identity stuff that went on for him. 5, 9, 14, 15 Where he wasn’t a star athlete or a star scholar.  In his interviews he said, “Basically I became one of those drug people who get things for you.” 5, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 That was a power, there was an identity that he really relished that he was seen as the guy to go to. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13 That was the value that he brought. 20 At that age it makes sense. 9, 15, 18 I’m not going to argue with his logic.  It made sense for him to do what he did because it gave him an identity that he couldn’t achieve through other methods. 9, 10, 12, 13, 18 Really just absolutely inside out challenged that he could have done that. 9 I was at the point, I’ve said this a lot and I’ll say it again, you get to the point where I would choose to have him die than to kill somebody. 10, 13, 14, 20 I choose to have him die than to harm somebody irreparably. 7, 9 Than to have those parents standing in my driveway threatening me or screaming at me because my son drunk or high either ODed with somebody or he drove over them drunk. 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17 I got to that point. 10 I felt horrible feeling that and saying that. 6, 13, 14, 17, 18 It was interesting having other parents go, “Oh yeah. 7, 8, 9, 12 Totally identify with that.  I don’t like it but I totally identify that feeling where your own child you’d be better off if they were dead and not harming.” 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 I started to really wrestle with that kind of stuff. 6, 7, 8, 15 That identity of I’m the dad, he’s my child. 9 When I went through divorce, identity is powerful stuff.  My wife, my house, my children. 7, 9, 11, 12 I really struggled with it through addiction that one of my fellow parents is like, “She’s an adult I birthed a long time ago. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 I try not to refer to her as my daughter, as my kid anymore because it’s too hard.” 5, 6, 7, 15, 20 Your daughter? 5 MO: No this was one of our friends of NarAnon. 7, 13 That I have to start to separate from this parental thought that this is a little kid that needs me. 6, 7, 10, 15, 20 That will pin you and put you into such great sadness and such confusion. 7, 8, 19 I remember what it’s like, my parents, I don’t need you to do those things anymore. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I did actually. 18 I didn’t think I did.  It was important that I started to establish some of my own space. 6, 15 When he was sober, he was sober ninety days at Hazelden not for twenty-eight. 18, 19 Almost ninety days and then off to sober living. 6, 18, 19 He was just sober; he wasn’t in any kind of recovery at all. 7, 8 Sober’s tough and it’s so dangerous. 9 The way I liken it is you’re just standing on the edge. 7, 9, 14, 17 You can step off, one bad thing can happen and you can step off or your close to the edge and ultimately there’s prelapse. 5, 6, 7, 13, 16, 19 You don’t just relapse. 7 Generally, people it’s planned.  They just walk over to the edge and they just wait for the trigger to happen or that moment or that safe space and they’re going to use again. 5, 7, 9, 15, 17 Sober definitely wasn’t, I knew it was dangerous. 6, 12, 14 He had no idea what recovery was and no interest in going through the vulnerability of sitting in meetings and telling the truth. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 18 Basically it’s you’re going to strip naked in front of everybody and you’re going to do some spins and some yoga in front of them. 7, 14, 17 Seriously, I’m sure he thought, “If that was an option I would have done that instead, naked yoga in front of everybody rather than telling the truth that I’m a fucked up person. 7, 10, 13, 17, 18 I’m confused, I’m sad, I’m angry, I want to kill myself, I want to be a better person.” 9, 10, 14, 17 That’s really hard especially for a fairly stoic seventeen-year-old who’s got a lot of image to protect. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16 Part of me got it and part of me was so frustrated that he was doing nothing about it but he was sober. 8 He had a sober summer back at his mom’s house, his mom’s house and my house. 9, 11, 17, 19 He worked temp work and he was sober and we had him pee in a cup. 12 He got into Step Up at Augsburg, the sober college program at Augsburg which is renowned. 7, 8, 17 They have administrators come from all over the country and actually from overseas to say, “What are you doing and how are you doing it because we’re interested in creating something similar at our university.” 7, 10, 14, 17, 18 I’m going to go back in time for a second. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 Christmas, I think he was about three and a half years old, budgets and I don’t want my kids to have a lot of stuff I want them to get things that are necessary and fun but let’s have experience. 5, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 I’d rather go sledding on Christmas than sit around opening gifts. 7, 18, 20 Amy’s parents are well to do and he’s their first grandchild and they can do whatever the hell they want. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16 So they brought over a barrel of gifts. 7, 12, 20 He was excited about these gifts under the tree and then Christmas Eve there’s an enormous amount of gifts and they’re all his to go through. 7, 12 I’m sitting there probably having a beer, watching my son open gifts. 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20 He would rip open the gift and then get the box open, we’d maybe have to cut a little bit of tape, we’d open up and he’d look at what it was with these wild eyes and then it’d fade and he would just throw it to the side and he’d go to the next one. 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 It was the same every time, wild eyed, ripping things open. 5, 7, 16, 19, 20 He’d see it and then it would just fade and he’d go to the next one. 5, 12, 16, 19 I just sat there thinking, “Oh fuck.  I’ve seen guys smoking crack cocaine and it’s the exact same body language.” 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15 AS: You thought that when he was three and a half? 10, 16 MO: Yes.  It hit me like a bolt. 19 I talked to his mom about it later, “He was just excited.” 5, 6, 13, 16, 17 “I know he was excited.” 17 I didn’t really dwell on it but I never forgot that. 6, 7, 8, 13 That what I saw was exactly what I’ve seen people smoking crack cocaine do. 5, 6, 10, 13 It’s never enough and they just keep going. 13, 16, 17, 20 It was chilling.  I went, “Oh my gosh.  He’s got the chip.”  AS: So he’s at Step Up.  He’s at Step Up and we’re at orientation and there was a student panel that got up there. 7, 11 It was great. 7, 8 One kid’s like, “Hey. 9, 14, 15 Ten schools 11 I think I dropped out of.  Pretty much I was planning where I was going to do suicide and how was I going to get it done because I’m an addict and every time I go to college there’s just drugs and alcohol everywhere and I’m a fuck up. 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 I found this school and I’m like ‘Okay whatever I’m desperate. 11 I don’t care anymore.’ 7, 14, 20 I got to Step Up.”  He has a 3.9 now, engineering. 17 He’s like, “I love my life. 7, 8, 9, 14, 17 I love my smart brain. 5, 17, 20 I love recovery. 7, 8, 17 This is so awesome.”  Everybody is just like, “Yes! 9, 14 My kid’s going here.” 15 AS: They found their poster child. 9, 11 MO: Yes.  Another student got up there and said, “So people will want to know what do we do when we’re not students? 7, 11, 13, 14, 17 Most students when they’re not students they are partiers. 7, 8, 11 Here’s what we do we go bowling, we go clean graffiti off walls, nasty graffiti not the art stuff, we go read to the Somali kids. 7, 15, 16 They read English to the Somali kids and they read English back to us. 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 We do yoga, we go to the gym, we go to meetings, we scoop food, we bring coats to homeless people. 6, 12, 17, 19 We’ve got so many things you can do and we do it in groups. 5, 11, 18, 19 I’m like, “Yes! 9, 14 Great!” 7 Then this young lady said, “So here’s what happens every year. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16 There are going to be some of the students who are like, ‘This is so stupid.’ 11 They’re not in to recovery. 7, 8 They’re not into service work. 7 They’re not into helping people. 7, 18 They’re just very selfish and miserable. 5, 7, 18 They’re going to try to recruit and find other people who think this is stupid.” 7, 9 Amy, Devin’s mom and I, look at each other like… 17 Sure enough that’s who he hung out with. 7, 16, 20 He was smoking cigarettes and hanging out under the bridge with kids who just were sober Step Up students. 5, 7, 10, 11, 15 It wasn’t in our control. 10 I’d learned enough at this point. 5, 10, 16, 20 There’s nothing I could do about that but hope he’s doing okay. 13, 14 Pretty soon his grades started to get dodgy. 5, 6, 7, 15, 19, 20 There were some gaps in some of his stories.  AS: This is just the first semester? 16 MO: First semester.  He started in September in October one of his best buddies that he hung out with, this kid relapsed on a Monday night. 6, 7, 13, 15, 19 He went and used on a Monday night. 9, 19 He got kicked out of Step Up but was still an Augsburg student. 7, 11 On Wednesday another one of these Step Up students used with that kid who just relapsed. 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 Now that kid’s been kicked out of Step Up. 11, 15 Then we called Devin or sent him a text that said, “Stay the fuck away from Michael. 13, 14, 17, 20 Stay away from him. 20 He is so dangerous right now.” “I’m fine. 8, 14, 17 I’m fine. 14 It’s cool.  No problem, no problem.” 7 On Friday night Devin used with Michael. 9, 19 They used synthetic Xanax from China. 9 Just lab pills that they bought online.  The kid that he was with, Michael, he flatlined at Hennepin County Medical Center. 15 He overdosed.  Devin only took a half of dose but had a pretty bad night. 5, 7, 14, 16, 19 He prelapsed and then he relapsed and he was kicked out of Step Up. 7, 11 AS: Did Michael live? 11 MO: Michael lived and just basically went—he’s still an Augsburg student. 7, 11, 14, 16, 17 Just back to school, just living in the dorms, “I’m fine.” 6, 11, 14, 17, 19 He’d been through a lot of trauma in his life. 7, 8 His mother died when he was young and his dad’s a high powered downtown workaholic attorney. 6, 7, 10, 11, 17 Michael was just kind of a problem. 7 Devin was now commuting from his mom’s house and my house and enormous stress as he is now a college student at Augsburg. 7, 9, 11, 17 Academics were just falling apart all around him. 8, 11 Then he disappeared on a Wednesday night in October. 7, 19 No, no in November.  It was early November. 6 He disappeared and he went off and we found out through phone records that he sold his laptop, sold his speakers, bought a pizza and stayed in a hotel in Wisconsin. 7, 11, 12, 14, 16 We figured he was probably on his way to Chicago. 7, 12, 13, 16, 19 We didn’t know what he was doing but he went to Chicago and binged heavily with hundreds of dollars in his pocket. 7, 16, 17, 18 Crack cocaine and that synthetic Xanax stuff.  AS: He tried that again?  MO: Yes, you have no idea. 5 The chemist who made it probably doesn’t even know what’s in it. 12, 13, 17 It’s so unspecific and so deadly.  He was on Vivitrol so we knew he probably wasn’t taking opiates because it’d be worthless. 6, 12, 13, 17 He just did a huge amount of drugs for several days and came home, limped home after four days. 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 I’ll be honest with you. 6, 12 We’ve never gone through this before, my son’s never been homeless, he’s never gone off on these disappearing acts, he’s never overdosed on opiates as far as we know, as far as he knows. 9, 13, 17, 19 He never lost his breathing. 7, 13, 19 We’re really lucky. 6, 7, 8 We had very very few like the long traumas so many of the parents have been through. 7, 12, 18 We were lucky.  He’s a very dangerous user. 9 He went and used excessively. 9 Enough that he could have killed himself or killed somebody else. 8 You’re driving around just… 7, 18 AS: Was he in touch with you during these four days? 18, 19 Just waiting, contacting all of his friends. 7, 13 I went through his phone records and contacting everybody like, “I’m sorry. 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 I don’t know what to tell you. 13, 17 I’m sorry.”  It’s like, “If I hear from him I’ll tell him that his parents love him and want him to come home.” 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 He started to pop up some messaging on Facebook popped up. 6, 15 Like on Saturday morning, “I just needed some time to myself.” 7, 9, 16, 19 He came limping home and went to detox at The Mission out in Plymouth. 13, 17, 19 In those days that he was gone I remember getting dressed in the morning, I remember looking in the mirror and going, “Wow. 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20 Are these the clothes I’m going to have on when I go to the morgue?  Am I going to have to identify his body wearing these clothes right now?” 8, 14, 17 Just a random thought. 10 It was a very poignant thought. 10 His mom’s not going to identify his body. 17 That’s not his mom’s job that’s my job. 17 Or am I going to see him in a county jail somewhere or am I going to see him in the press? 5, 7, 13 Is a horrible thing going to happen? 5, 19 Are these the clothes I’m going to wear when I’m going to be with him.  Saturday he fortunately limped back. 11, 17, 19 No money and I said, “Devin, how are you?” 7, 12, 13, 14 He said, “I’m chill.” 13, 14 It just hit me like right in the spine, the fury in me that he was chill after what we went through for several days. 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 I had to leave.  “See that’s the fucking problem. 7 Dad doesn’t know how to talk.” 6, 17 I just went out to the car because I wasn’t going to sit in there because I was going to say horrible things and I had nothing to say if all you are is chill when I went to give you a hug. 5, 7, 11, 14, 19 I get that he was so addled at that point that he’d done a crap load of drugs, way more than we thought. 10, 20 We just thought that he smoked crack but he’d done a huge amount of drugs. 10, 12 It was go time. 7, 16, 19 It was like something has to happen now, what are we going to do? 5, 17 We started looking at options. 6, 15 Hazelden, we weren’t interested in going back to a center that was very good about education and comfy and stuff. 6, 7, 11, 17, 19 I thought the middle of the Yukon was a good idea at that point. 5, 6, 10, 14, 19 Let’s go put him in a harsh fucking place, have him struggle. 8, 19 The Retreat was an option. 7 Then we happen to find out that treatment in California was an option. 5, 7, 9, 13, 18 California is different. 7, 18 There’s just some wrangling out there if you’re covered by insurance and then you can actually end up in sober living covered by insurance if you’re doing outpatient. 6, 7, 18 It’s not totally legal, it’s not totally straight up but they bend the rules. 13 We’re like, “We’re okay for bending the rules. 7, 9, 13, 14 Any means necessary.”  I had a conversation with him, not a lot, we didn’t have a lot of contact because he was just so apathetic.  I had to set a boundary.  “Until you can identify or demonstrate active recovery I don’t want you at or around or near my house.” 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 I wanted to get into lots of details about what active recovery looks like but I don’t know what it looks like because I’m not an addict. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 20 That’s all I had to say. 14 If he starts to use again he’s going to start to hang out with dangerous people again. 5, 6, 9 I don’t want him anywhere near my house or my wife or my dogs or my daughter. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 His mom didn’t set that same boundary and that was her choice. 17 That’s what I said to him. 13, 14 My hope was maybe he’ll want to go find out what active recovery looks like. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16 He went to treatment in California. 7, 13, 18 It was pretty scary. 5, 7, 14 He was actually presenting schizophrenic hallucinations, schizophrenic presentation. 7, 18 Active hallucination not only voices and sounds and light but visual.  He was seeing things. 5, 6, 19 They said, “He’s just so toxic still.” 7, 13, 14 He already detoxed but all the shit in that Chinese stuff is a mess. 6, 7, 10, 18, 19 We don’t know a lot. 17 They did a good job with him. 6, 19 I didn’t like them but they did a good job with him. 6, 9, 14, 19 AS: The treatment center? 7, 13, 18 MO: Yes, they really work on the co-occurring condition stuff. 6, 7, 8 They really get into, “Who the fuck are you? 6, 7, 8, 20 What’s your story? 13 Who do you think you are?  What do you want to do with this stuff? 14 How do you want to turn out?” 14 They really get into digging in and cornering you. 6, 7, 8, 20 It’s not gentle like Hazelden.  It’s pretty fierce. 5, 7, 14 Just from what we heard, he actually expressed in a moment of clarity, “I want to be a dad. 7, 14, 15, 17, 18 I want to see the world. 5, 12, 14 I want to go to school. 11, 14 I want to have a successful life.” 7, 8, 14 Then he said, “I’m terrified I’m never going to have that stuff.” 13, 14 They said to him, “Well if you use the way you use you won’t. 9, 13, 14 We see thousands of people and you won’t. 5 If you use the way you use, you’ll put your brain into a state where you won’t have any of that stuff. 5, 9, 17, 19 That’s not a threat. 7 We see it a lot. 5 Pay attention.” 6 He got bounced out of there and went into sober living just about a year ago. 6, 16 Right here it’s the middle of January and he been in recovery ever since. 7, 8, 13, 14 He found a sponsor. 11, 13 He had kind of a bullshit sponsor, just a path of least resistance sponsor. 7, 10, 13, 19 Somebody probably said to him, “Dude that’s not a sponsor, get a real sponsor.” 7, 12, 13, 14, 20 He had the guts to go up and find a sponsor who had what he wanted and basically the sponsor told him what a lot of good sponsors tell a lot of good people in recovery. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 “Shut up and do what I do.  Don’t think.  You’re thinking got you into this place so stop thinking and do what I do. 7, 8 You’re going to copy everything I do. 7 You’re going to call me. 7, 14, 17 I’m not going to call you. 14, 17 I’m not going to put up with any bullshit. 10, 19 You’re either in recovery or you’re not in recovery. 7, 8 If you’re in, you’re in. 7 If you’re not, you’re not. 7 I’ll figure you out very quickly.” 5, 7 This is a veteran.  AS: A war veteran or a recovery veteran? 7, 8 MO: No, this guy’s been in recovery a long time. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 Devin was doing old school AA Los Angeles Hollywood recovery. 7, 8, 11, 16 NA is interesting it’s got a lot of war stories. 7, 9 People go to NA and they tell lots of the drug war stories. 10, 13, 15 Young people thrive on it but it doesn’t help. 18 You go to a meeting and listen to people tell war stories all night. 6, 13, 19 It was so bad.  AA is more about recovery, old boys. 7, 8, 16, 17 People who’ve been through shit and lost everything. 10, 19 AS: I’ve heard people call them old timers. 7, 14, 16, 17, 19 MO: Old timers, lots of veterans, the old guard. 7, 15, 16, 19 Devin found an old guard. 11, 16 I don’t know if the guy is twenty-eight or sixty-eight. 6, 17 It’s none of my business. 9, 12 I think his mom met him last night in Los Angeles which is really huge. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 19 AS: Amy’s in Los Angeles.  MO: He got into recovery and he worked for a sober living company and he’s doing remarkably well. 6, 7, 8, 12 I’d say he’s healthier now, he hasn’t been this healthy since he was twelve. 14, 17 He’s a different person altogether. 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20 He’s healthy, he’s well. 8 I’m wildly grateful and also very realistic. 7 He’s only nineteen and a half. 16 Long term recovery starts after five years. 6, 7, 8, 16 You’re a toddler, you’re not a toddler until five years, you’re just crawling around. 7, 16, 18 It’s very humbling.  This sponsor, remember I said that counselor in high school told him the things I told him and it made sense to him. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 The things that sponsor is saying are things I’ve probably said or could say or would say but it doesn’t mean shit coming from me. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 His recovery has nothing to do with me and I’m okay with that. 7, 8, 14 It’s not my business at all. 9, 12 My recovery is my business and what he does and chooses and who he hangs out with is his choice. 5, 7, 8, 9, 12 Right now I’m just a lucky guy. 6, 17 AS: Could you talk just a little bit about what you mean by your recovery? 6, 7, 8, 20 When did you realize that you had something that you had to recover from? 7 MO: I said I got into NarAnon while he was in his first month in treatment. 7, 13, 14, 16, 18 This was not unfamiliar.  I had actually been to AA meetings with one of my brothers years ago. 6, 12, 15, 16, 18 I was stunned at the stuff I heard. 7, 14 Those were real people. 7 His mom was familiar with recovery and a lot of people in recovery. 7, 8, 17 I was like okay I guess I’ll go to this thing. 14, 19 I thought it was going to be miserable. 10, 18 I really thought I was going to walk in with a bunch of people on…they were hugging people and sharing baked goods and talking about, “Yes! 6, 7, 8, 10, 19 She got arrested last night. 7, 19 Yay!”  Everyone’s all excited about someone getting arrested on a felony. 7 I’m like, “Who are these people?” 9, 14 I started to realize that there were these healthy people who had it way worse than I did. 6, 7, 15 I didn’t know they had it worse. 17 My son was in trouble but these were people who’d been dealing with this for a long time and they weren’t miserable. 5, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19 They were scared, they were very challenged, they lost sleep at night but they were getting back to their lives. 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 I see things in pictures, I always see everything in pictures. 5, 7, 10, 19 That’s kind of the way I see the world and the way I try to communicate the way I see things. 5, 12, 19 It’s like you go to the edge of the forest and you have this little tiny machete on your skinny little arms and you think you’re going to chop through this thing to figure out how to fix this thing and you’re just not going to. 7, 19, 20 You don’t have enough energy and it’s just too thick, it’s too brutal. 16, 20 There are elephants who know the trails. 17 You just got to go get behind the elephants like my son has been told, “Get behind me.” 13, 16, 17, 20 I just kind of learned to get behind other elephants. 5, 20 Mostly moms, not a lot of dads in recovery unfortunately but mostly moms who kind of know the path because other people had created it. 5, 7, 8, 17 Who knows where the path was initially created and it doesn’t matter. 7, 10, 17 There’s a path.  There’s not one path, there’s lots of paths but I kind of stopped trying to chop my way through this thing and started hanging out with people who knew a lot more than I did. 5, 6, 12, 15, 19 I started to find out I had a lot of stuff to work on. 6, 9, 15 My son didn’t bring my sadness, my rage, my terror to me it was always there. 10, 15, 17 It just got uncorked.  Own your shit as they say. 10, 14, 19 Everything I was feeling was mine. 13, 17, 18 I’d get challenged and sometimes I’d actively challenge in a meeting when somebody blames that other person for the things they’re experiencing. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 I try to do it gently but that’s your stuff.  That’s your stuff.  I guarantee there are addicts who get well and then there are family members and parents who don’t get well and go bat shit crazy. 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 19, 20 The addict’s like, “I’m doing okay now. 9, 14, 15, 17 What happened to you?” 5 One of the best things you can do, as I learned and borrow shamelessly, is just work on your own recovery. 5, 7, 8, 13, 19 The best way you can support them in your recovery is to be working on your own recovery so you don’t go off like that person that terrifies me. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17 That furious, raging, spitting, angry Irishman.  It’s the Wizard of Oz, behind that is this terrified person back here behind the curtain. 10, 11, 17, 19 Work on that guy because it’s not just going to be my son’s addiction where these things happen. 5, 6, 8, 15, 17, 19 It’s going to happen in traffic, it’s going to happen with my in-laws, with my wife, with colleagues and clients, and somebody that I bump into on the trail. 5, 12, 16 I could actually be better at a lot of stuff. 17, 18 It really has nothing to do with my son’s addiction. 6, 7, 8, 15, 17 That’s incidental.  Sometimes I feel okay. 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 It’s interesting, I’ve missed only two meetings in only two years. 6, 7, 9, 12, 16 Last week I’ve been sick otherwise if I have work, something else planned or booked I go. 8, 16 I just try to show up there for humility and inspiration, which I get every single—I got a lot of humility last night. 7, 9, 13, 19, 20 This is just what I noticed is every time I go to a meeting if I’m paying attention I will hear things I’ve never heard before. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 I might because I went in the right way I’m going to think things I’ve never thought before which in turn will lead me to possibly do things I’ve never done before, possibly. 5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 19 That doesn’t mean I just get it and go. 20 A lot of the stuff just goes in one ear and out the other.  “Well that’s really interesting.” 6, 7, 8, 9 But I don’t use it. 9 Sometimes it actually penetrates and I go and do something with it. 7, 12, 16, 18, 19 It doesn’t work exactly the way I thought it would but it works in a way that I can learn from it. 5, 8, 10 All these different experiences along the way. 7, 15, 18 It’s just a lake.  It’s the lake I go to so I don’t feel so horrible, so worthless and I don't blame myself. 13, 18 When you're by yourself it's like man the best of me does not come out. 13, 17 By myself with my dogs on the lake I'm actually in a pretty good place. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 18, 19 Sitting by myself in a chair looking out a window, pulling at my skin, my best thoughts are a long way off. 6, 7, 10, 13, 20 It's my worst thoughts, my shadows like I've got this I'll take over right now. 8, 10, 14, 17, 20 It just kind of spills.  There's so many people that just do that and that's the heartbreaking thing for me. 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 19 I want to try to change that to get more people off of their butt. 5, 14, 20 They have every right to sit by them self but they also have an opportunity to go hang out with people and heal and learn. 5, 7, 8, 14 An addict alone, you're in dangerous company as they say. 12, 14, 15 Same with a parent, same with a spouse, same with a brother, same with a daughter. 5, 7, 9, 16 When you're sitting alone you're not helping yourself. 7, 12, 18 The only way things have been figured out since the dawn of time has been community, people sitting in circles and talking about what's real. 5, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19 White people brought clipboards and said, ""We'll call this therapy."" 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 The brown people are like, ""We've been doing this shit for thousands of years with no methodology other than sit in a circle and tell the truth."" 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 I'm just a big fan of it.  I really am. 6, 7, 8 AS: Can you talk about what you're planning, when you're just talking about wanting to help other parents. 6, 7, 12, 14, 18 Can you talk about what your thoughts are about what you want to be doing in the next few years? 6, 10, 14, 16, 19 MO: I'm working on a plan right now with a colleague, a fellow parent of an addict who just lost her son, right before Christmas. 7, 8, 14, 15, 17 I'm actually heading over there right after this meeting to go talk a little bit about this stuff. 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20 Ultimately what we want to do is help, we want to facilitate and accelerate the process for people to learn that there's a lot of work they can do to help themselves. 5, 14, 18, 19 There's three ""Cs"" that they talk about in addiction. 6, 8, 15 You didn't cause it, this is interesting for the addict to know and certainly for the family members. 7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 19 I didn't cause it. 9 I cannot control it and I will not cure it. 7, 10 There's a fourth ""C"" that I really gravitate toward. 6, 7, 8 It's really important and it's controversial, some people don't like it, but there is something called contribution. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17 I can contribute the way I show up, there's no neutral, I'm adding to the mix. 9 I'm either helping to improve things by working on my own recovery and learning not to engage where I don't need to engage or I'm exacerbating things by bringing my rage. 5, 7, 8, 15, 18, 19 By trying to control I'm adding, I'm contributing, I'm exacerbating the injury. 10 AS: The contribution can be positive or negative? 7 MO: Contribution is neutral but you're always contributing. 10 Are you aware of how you're contributing? 7 AS: Which is different from the other three? 7, 18 MO: Yes, absolutely.  I've heard parents say, ""I'm going to bring them home and we're just going to love him up. 7, 12, 14, 17, 19 We're going to cook his favorite meals and we're going to watch ﻿Home Alone ﻿and I'm going to buy him some socks."" 12, 15, 20 The addict's like ""Okay. 15 Fine with me.  I'll just sell those fucking socks."" 19 Or, ""We're going to punish you.  We're just going to make it really difficult for you to do anything."" 6, 7, 8, 10, 18 Okay.  Bring on the shame.  I have an idea that we can help more people if we can get in front of audiences and just help them understand that there is a different experience if you're willing to lean in just like an addict has to lean in to their recovery. 5, 7, 8, 15, 18, 20 You can lean in and go find a healthy group. 9, 18 There's nothing we can say or do that will change anything for them. 5, 14 We just want to try to invite people to find a community where they can sit and have this stuff happen that just happens. 5, 7, 9, 14, 19 I'll be damned if anyone can say exactly how it happens. 5, 14 I don't know. 17 I don't know if it's realistic or not. 7, 17 I'd like to make a living out of it. 6, 9, 14, 18 I don't know if there's a living to be made out of it. 6, 13, 17 I do know that I have enough resources and energy and skills to be able to impart to some people who are terrified that it doesn't have to keep feeling this way. 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20 I don't mean just going to Anon because Anon's not healthy.  You can have a different experience, you can protect your marriage, you can protect your finances, you can protect your spiritual life, you can protect your other relationships with other family members. 7, 8, 15, 18, 19 All of that stuff, every bit of that can go away if you're not paying attention. 6, 18, 20 While you're trying to rescue somebody who doesn't want to be rescued. 7, 14 You'll go right over the falls with them and you don't have to. 8, 11, 14 You can get out. 20 Say, ""I'm going to climb down.  If you're down there on the side of the river I'm going to come down and help you if I can but I'm not going over the falls with you. 9, 11, 17, 18 Those are those pictures I sent right? 7, 8, 14 It just breaks my heart that there are people sitting alone. 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18 Either afraid to share because they think they're going to get judged, they might. 7 They may have some family members or community that they're at risk in. 7, 19 The dads, I'd love to get more dads to show up because they spend a lot of time very angry, deep in their grief because they can't fix something. 7, 9, 16, 17, 19, 20 That's a big problem. 7 Then you got new problems. 6, 7 All of a sudden your family's feeling something that really has nothing to do with the addiction anymore. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 It's all my own beast, my shadow has shown up and everything else in my life has become a mess. 7, 8, 9, 17, 18 If I can help people learn how to turn down their noise, help them learn how to do it them self. 5, 18 I have no experience, I just have an experience learning how to turn down my own noise and be like, ""This is nice. 5, 9, 14, 15 I can still hear it."" 7, 14 AS: But it doesn't overtake your life. 7, 8, 20 MO: It doesn't overtake my life. 7, 8, 20 What else? 8 Anything else? 8 AS: Do you have anything else? 8 MO: I'll say what one of my friends says about this. 7, 13, 14, 17 She has two addicted children. 7, 9, 15 It's not good. 6, 19 Here's what she says, ""I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 14, 17 No way.  It's way too hard."" 6 She also says, ""I wouldn't go back to the way it was before. 11, 14, 17, 19 Speaking from a selfish place."" 5, 8 Not selfish in a bad way. 5 She's a better person and she knows it. 10, 17 She feels that she's a better person having... 10, 13, 17, 18 And learning a lot about herself. 5 Just the little petty stuff she used to really get wrapped around the axel. 6, 7, 8, 9, 20 It doesn't matter anymore. 7, 10 She's walking with a different grace. 6, 7, 18 Imagine that.  It's like the cancer patient that's like, ""This is going to kill me but man I have learned so much about me. 5, 9, 14 I'm a better dad or I'm a better family member. 7, 17, 19 I'm a better human having been shown that I'm going to die soon."" 5, 9, 17 Wow.  I'm so grateful for the exposure to the lovely friends. 7, 13, 17 Heartache, I'm going to experience things I don't ever want to experience again. 5, 13, 14, 15, 19 Lately and I'm still in it. 7 I don't like it at all, I hate it. 9, 14 It's kind of a number games when you're in a community of addicts. 13, 14, 15, 19 People die or people's lives come apart. 8, 11, 17 It's really hard. 6, 7, 8 In the meantime, they can do things to make things better. 5, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: That's right. 8, 14 There's definitely an intensity to this particular path that we're on. 7, 8, 14 MO: Either way, intense joy.  One other thing I discovered a couple years ago. 7, 16, 19 When I was in really deep sadness, out on the lake with my dog. 6, 7, 8 You get sad and your posture changes. 5, 7, 20 Your head goes down. 12 It's just evolutionary biology.  It just kind of keeps us close to home. 6, 13, 17, 19 It's interesting. 7, 9 My head was down a lot. 12 I was crying I was so scared. 7, 14, 20 I was so everything, mostly just scared. 5, 7, 14, 20 I just look up at the sky and the sky was brilliant.  Clouds kind of tumbling through and brilliant winter blue.  I realized my son's under the same sky right now. 7, 8, 10, 14, 17 Not very far away at all, he was actually right here in the Twin Cities. 8, 9, 14, 18, 20 I'm a pagan.  I'm a born again pagan. 5 I was raised Christian but I'm a pagan truly. 5 That's my church.  The sky's kind of this palette that day or night I just kind of look up whether it's starry or cloudy or grey. 7, 19 There's no bad sky.  All the people I love are under that sky. 17 Little things like that kind of bring me to the lake. 5, 19 There's a lake story in here somewhere but it kind of helps, it lightens things for me. 5, 7, 13, 18, 19 When I look up at that sky and those lovely people I love and the people who aren't here anymore, they also used to experience that sky too. 7, 9, 15, 17 It helps turn down my noise a little bit. 18, 20 And just keep walking. 6, 17 That's enough. 16, 20 AS: Thank you Mike.  MO: You're welcome. 17 Thanks for listening. "

When I ended up having the surgery, that's when I started getting hooked up on opiates. 6, 15, 17, 20 Can you backtrack just a little bit and talk about you know, how old were you when you first started getting high? 6, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 MO: I was twelve years old. 16 It was my mother. 10 My mother was the one that gave me my first joint. 10, 12, 16, 18 It was because of, we were already living in tents. 6, 7, 18 Uhm, my mom was being raped by my father and I knew it. 6, 12, 17 Uhm, she was being beaten by my father and I knew it. 6, 12 And the more I tried to talk to my mother about it, to leave him, the more problems it caused. 6, 7, 9, 10 So, to my mom's sense was if she got me high, I wouldn't care just like she didn't care. 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 20 That I would continue to deal with it just like she deals with it. 19 So that was my first time using. 7, 10, 16, 19 And, I was a lot younger when I started drinking. 6, 15, 16, 19 I was actually like ten. 18 SP: So you started drinking and then smoking pot? 6, 10, 15, 19 When I was ten my mother used to give me drinks to deal with a lot of, to deal with our homelessness, and to deal with a lot of the traumas that was happening cuz even my brother was starting to beat on me. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 Uhm, and it was becoming normal. 7, 18 Uhm, and then when I started using that was pretty much how I dealt with, that's how I was taught, how to deal with trauma was to use. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15 And, I, continued to keep that with me all the way up until I turned twenty-five. 17, 18, 19 When I turned twenty-five was when I learned that there was a different way of dealing with trauma. 5, 7, 18 That it wasn't drugs and alcohol, that it was another way. 10 It was actually a healing that could happen, which I didn't know about the healing process until I got involved in my culture. 5, 7, 17, 18 SP: What happened at twenty-five? 5 MO: Well, I almost lost my child to opiates. 9, 15, 17 I was using a lot of percocets and oxycodones. 6, 10, 12 I was using heroin. 10 I was using everything under the sun to deal with the trauma that was just my past. 8, 10 To deal with my past. 8 SP: Is this before the surgery or...?  MO: This was after the surgery.  And then, when anyways fast forward a little bit. 20 I started getting involved in my culture. 6, 7, 15, 20 An elderly lady, a medicine woman. 8 She came to me and she told me that I didn't need to be like that anymore. 7, 13, 16, 17 That I had a choice.  And, I was just in the building just because I, she was an advocate that was working with families, and I was just there because I had to deal with child protection over the opiate use. 9, 15 And she saw me sitting there crying and begging them to not take my children away (it's still recording I think...indeterminate noise) and she told me I didn't have to be like that no more. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 I didn't have to do this anymore. 7 And I didn't, you know, I asked her well then what am I supposed to do? 8, 14, 17 How do I deal with all of it.  How do I deal with me?  How do I deal with my past? 8 How do I deal with the pain?  And then, she started inviting me to different ceremonies. 6, 7, 15, 18 they started bringing me around to all these women's ceremonies. 6, 7, 12, 15, 18 And the more I told my story the more healing I had. 13, 16 And to have other women tell me that they've been sexually abused, they've went through the same things I went through, and they are strong for it. 5, 9, 12, 13, 19 I wanted to be strong for it. 14 I didn't wanna be, I don't wanna say weak, I just don't wanna be lost in my pain anymore. 7, 14 They helped me find a different way. 7, 9, 18 It was through those ceremonies I was able to become my own woman instead of hiding it. 7, 17, 18 I was so afraid of who I was that I didn't know my purpose. 17 They helped me find it. 9, 18 Ever since then I just continue to do, I do work for the community. 19 I work on behalf of many different organizations to be able to address opiate abuse. 7, 9, 16, 18 SP: How did you get involved, like in the work? 20 It just came as an outgrowth of the wisdom of the women that you were hanging out with? 5, 12, 13, 17 Like what brought you to the actual work? 20 MO: It was the, there was a lot of my friends that were dying. 7, 13 I lost a lot of my childhood friends that I grew up with. 7, 9, 13, 19 I lost family members. 7, 19 I lost my closest cousin. 6, 13 She was using when I started doing this work. 6, 10, 15 And, no matter what I did I couldn't get her to stop, and I tried everything. 10, 20 There was no programs available at the time to get her help. 7, 8, 10, 16, 18, 19, 20 So, I lost her.  She died. 17 And, when she died I just continued to keep not only talking to the addicts that are still out there that are struggling. 6, 7, 13, 15, 17, 19 But I started trying to find more resources. 6, 7, 9, 15 And there was hardly any. 6 So I wanted to help build them. 14, 18 So I started talking with other organizations, other directors, to start creating these programs. 6, 7, 8, 15 Uhm, I started meeting with tribes to start creating these programs. 6, 7, 8, 15 that we were losing people on a massive level. 9 We had a death in our community every two days. 18, 19 Uhm, and in which, in the native community, we're such a small number that when we lose someone, it hits home because we're all pretty much related. 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 And, we all know each other since, we were you know born. 5, 17 SP:Are you talking about specifically about Little Earth? 6, 14, 17 MO: Mhm.  Every two days? 18, 19 MO: Every two days we lost another person to opiates. 10, 17, 18, 19 ANd during that time is when I really worked my tail off to get us narcan and at that time there was no narcan available for the community. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20 SP: How long ago was that. 7, 16 If you can just give me a timeframe? 7, 11, 16, 19 MO: 2015... they didn't' have narcan available. 10, 18 In 2016 was when we finally fought, we had a good enough fight to make narcan available to the community. 6, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 ` SP: Is we... is that natives against heroin? 10 That was just me and the Little Earth Residents. 9 I'd like to hear more about that!! 9, 14 [laughs] 10 MO: [laughs as well] 8, 10 Yeah so we, I helped organize a lot of our residents. 7, 9, 18 So we had meetings. 6, 12 We had sit downs where we were talking about this issue. 6, 7 Like, we're losing people left and right. 8, 14, 19 Everyone is hooked on opiates. 17 And we're trying to figure out, what are we gonna do? 7 There was even people in there that were still `using and they're trying to figure out like, how do we save not only myself but save our, you know... my cousin that's also using to. 7, 9, 10, 14, 17 So, we had these meetings and from those meetings our numbers got bigger and we started fighting for different... something to save people when they are ODing. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 At the time there... we didn't even know that there was something called naloxone. 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 It wasn't until a paramedic, uhm during one of our overdoses that we got a call about that the paramedic that the paramedic used a drug called naloxone to reverse the overdose. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17 That's when, that's just when, that just struck a light.  Like, we need that.  We need that here and we need that for everyone.  We started meeting with our state representative. 6, 7, 15, 17 I started bringing in our state reps, I started bringing in our city council, I started bringing in all of these other political people that I knew. 6, 7, 12, 15, 17 that I knew. 6, 12 that i was working with on these issues. 7 But, you know, just trying to brainstorm. 5, 17 But I started actually giving them this is what we need. 6, 15, 18 this is what I need you to do.  And once it became available we just started training every resident. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 Every resident had to go through naloxone training. 7, 8, 9, 12 Every resident had to have narcan in their home. 7, 9, 17, 19 And, we made sure that we went through every house and trained everyone. 7, 9, 11, 13 Our overdoses had dropped.  Our deaths had dropped.  And we were just happy enough to have our loved ones. 6, 12, 16, 17, 20 We didn't even think about social programming. 8, 18 I didn't think about social programming until a year later. 5, 8, 16, 18 And a year later was when I created and helped create Natives Against Heroin. 5, 7, 16, 18 SP: Ah, so it started at Little Earth? 6, 15 MO: Yes.  And, tell me a little bit about that. 13, 20 And I also would ask the question: 15 You know, I'm from Minnesota but haven't really been a while for awhile. 6, 7, 8, 17 What about Steve's Law and Rummler?  Were they helpful? 18 MO: Yeah they actually helped a lot when it came to advocating at the state for the naloxone to be available for the community. 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 So the state was going to pass a bill to, there was Karen Clark I was working with, and she said that there's a bill in place but it wasn't from her, it was from another lady. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17 She said, there's a bill in place to make naloxone available to the community. 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 And I was like really? 6, 7, 8, 9, 14 And she was like yes but I need you to go meet with her. 9, 14 And I need you to have Little Earth residents come meet with the other state reps. 7, 9, 17 And that's when I met Steve's Rummler. 12 They were already there advocating for it. 6, 7, 18 So I was just able to piggy back. 11, 17, 18, 19 It was like a dream come true. 7, 17 It was easier enough for me to just bring Little Earth residents just to come testify. 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 20 And it was like it was handed out. 13 It was meant to be.  So we just worked with Steve's Rummler, and they helped us get the nalaxone. 12, 18, 20 It was easy, it was much of a blessing, when the health department was able to do that for us. 7, 8, 11, 18 SP: And so then there was the creation of Natives Against Heroine? 7 MO: Yes, SP:  How did that come about? 17 MO: Well, we, what we realized was no matter how many, you know naloxone kits we handed out, no matter how many people knew how to use them, we were still losing people. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18 We still lose people today. 5, 7, 13, 19 And it's just, we needed to have a support system. 9 Somewhere where addicts like myself and others would feel comfortable about telling their story, feel comfortable to be involved, to become their own advocates on this issue. 7, 13, 15, 17, 18 So that way they feel empowered to not only, not only speak about the issue, but help their friends, their family members, in becoming sober. 7, 13, 18, 19 So we created Natives Against Heroin as a healing circle. 7 At first it was just a healing circle, where we would just sit around and talk. 6, 7, 16, 18 And it was just a support group. 9, 18 And then, after much of the issues started rising with the drugs. 6, 7, 10, 15 When they started stripping the doctors form giving the opiates away, you know so easily. 6, 15, 17, 20 When that happened the drug dealers became a big thing. 5, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19 No longer were you able to go to your doctor as your drug dealer. 7, 10, 14, 18, 20 You now had to go through the gangs. 17 And the gangs were having wars in Little Earth.  They were actually having big wars where they were shooting people left and right. 8, 14, 18, 19 We weren't dying anymore of opiates, we were dying from guns. 7, 10, 17 So then, that's when we started Natives Against Heroin to start doing patrols. 6, 15 So our addicts, the ones that were in recovery, started actually patrolling Little Earth. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18 Then we started walking around, talking to all the gangs and the drug dealers. 6, 10, 14, 15, 18 And telling them, we have children here. 7, 9, 13 We've already had children shot multiple times. 6, 7, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20 We don't need no more, our children cannot be going through this, not our kids. 7, 9, 15 We had multiple children that were shot and brought to the emergency room because of the drug war in our community. 7, 9, 10, 19, 20 So we did, we started that patrol. 6, 15 From there became the marches. 13, 17 We started doing marches to shut down drug dealers. 6, 10, 14, 15 So, we started going up to drug dealer's houses that we knew. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 That we were tired of talking to, to tell them to quit. 6, 7, 13, 19 SP: And they were living at Little Earth? 6 MO: They're living at Little Earth, they're drug dealers in different res's that we went to. 6, 7, 10, 14, 18 We went to the reservations too because drugs were being transported not only from Little Earth but from the res's to Little Earth, from Little Earth to the res's. 7, 10 So we were going all over through the state of Minnesota. 17 Shutting down drug dealers. 10, 14 So we would go to the drug dealer's house and we would all stand out there and we would all tell them, like a big group of us, sometimes there were thousands of us out there, telling them— ""You need to quit dealing drugs in our community."" 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 SP: Wow that is a bold move. 14, 16 It went well, it went well! 8 SP: I mean, like, can you give an example of your first march up to a house? 9, 11, 14, 16 MO: Our very first one we had over seven thousand people. 16 We marched all the way from Red Lake.  All the way to different drug houses in Red Lake. 7, 9, 10, 11, 18 It was, at first it was just an awareness march. 7, 16 Then the people wanted to address the drug dealers. 7, 9, 10, 14 Because they wanted to address the drug dealers, we just said let's go for it. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 And we winged it the first one. 16 And when we did that drug dealer's house, at first he didn't quit. 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19 He fought.  He was arguing with us, yelling at us, telling us to stop. 13 ""You guys are shaming us."" 6, 8, 15 All this stuff.  And then, six months later he becomes one of our members. 5, 7, 11, 16, 17, 18 He quits dealing and he becomes one of our members. 5, 7, 17, 18 And then that's when we knew. 6, 12 We're gonna keep doing this. 17 When we started, when we started going from different res's and different res's we were able to change drug dealers from dealing for their—'cuz a lot of them are dealing just for their use, 'cuz they're users—and we understand that. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 18 So once they become a part of our membership, then they create their own, instead of doing it on a drug base, you create your own chapter. 7, 8, 10, 17, 18 And you have your own addicts and everyone that you used to deal with, deal to, have 'em come in, and you become their support to become sober. 9, 13, 15, 17, 18 SP: So, through that are people like getting access to treatment? 7, 13, 15, 18, 20 MO: Mhm.  Yeah everyone has contacts for treatment facilities. 7, 13, 18 People go to treatment. 7, 13, 18 Some people will just go through ceremony and just do ceremony to get clean. 7, 15, 16, 20 Some people will just use the sweat lodge. 9 We have a few members that I know. 7, 17 They were active users and on just, they were just using Percocets, but they used the sweat lodge to become clean. 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18 SP: So, is it safe to say that NAH supports harm reductive efforts? 7, 9, 14 MO: Oh, of course.  We do that a lot.  We even have members in our group that are still active users, but since they're active users we still, they still need support, they still need a family, they still need help, and we're still there for them. 7, 9, 18, 19 And it's, it doesn't, we don't shame them.  We know that they're using. 10, 17 It's okay. 14 It's more so when you're ready. 7, 18 And, and when we help with that, like when you're ready, you can do more. 7, 18 But it's up to them when they're ready to do more. 7, 18 SP: Wow.  So, you're a community organizer? 19 MO: Yes.  SP: And, prompted by opioids? 5 And trauma?  MO: Yes, yes. 9, 14 SP: And, so you start organizing at Little Earth. 6 Natives Against Heroin grows.  And then, tell me more about your organizing from that—NAH— to you know running to be a state representative? 7, 8, 9, 13, 17 How did that happen? 5 [laughs] 10 Well, so with NAH., because we were going through all different towns and reservations and the state, We startedm well I started getting to know the state representatives. 6, 7, 8, 15, 17, 18, 20 Started getting to know a lot of politicians, because I knew that there was bills that needed to be passed so that we could address more of the harm reduction side of this. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20 SP: So, were you educating?  MO: I was educating quote “politicians” on the issue [Sue laughs]. 7, 10 That was my job, was to educate them on what they didn't know. 17 So, what brought me into running was more so that my state representative was retiring. 7, 8, 9, 17, 20 The one that was helping me through all of this. 7, 12, 18 SP: Karen Clark? 7 The one that was helping me through all of it was retiring and I had, I didn't know what to do. 7, 12, 17, 18 At the time I was like, I freaked out. 7, 9, 14, 16, 19 I was scared 'cuz I was... 5, 7, 14, 20 all the work that we've done, all the work that we still need to do, still needs to happen in the House. 5, 7, 9, 15 And when she said she was retiring I just, I knew somebody had to take that mantle. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20 I knew somebody had to step up and do something. 6, 12, 16 So that way our harm reduction services actually go through so that pharmaceutical companies actually have to pay for what they're causing. 7, 9, 10, 18 So I decided to run. 8 And then, when I decided to run I didn't realize that I would become bare naked. 7, 8, 12, 17, 18 That my story would come out. 13, 17 And I would have to, I would say I would have to deal with the trauma in a more public eye.... again. 11, 14 Like usually when you deal with trauma, you can deal with it in a private setting. 5 You know, where you're just with you and your therapist, or you and your healers and stuff. 17 It's more private. 5 But when you're running in public view, your traumas come out for everyone to see. 5, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18 And they wanna use those traumas to help push your agenda, right? 8, 9, 14, 15, 18 But what they don't understand is that it's a bare naked feeling. 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 You revealed everything about yourself to the world. 7, 12 And I wasn't ready for that. 7, 18 That was the hard part. 6, 8 I wasn't ready for that. 7, 18 I didn't know that that's what I was signing up for at the time. 7, 16, 17, 19 That I was, I really thought that I could run and not have to tell my story and not have to tell people that I was a user, that I was sexually abused, that I was you know beaten as a child, that I was homeless for four years... you know? 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 I didn't know that I had to tell everybody that. 13, 17 And, when I was running it all had to come out. 8, 9, 17 And how did you deal with it?  MO: It was extremely hard to deal with [laughs]. 6, 7, 10 It was very... painful?  Because it was a public pain. 11 And it... how I dealt with it was mostly... 5 I tried to remember that all of who I am, those traumas are me. 7, 13, 15, 18 They made me who I am. 13 And I, I needed to use that. 9 I've been using it all this time to help my community. 7, 10, 16, 18, 19 I've been using all my traumas all this time to make a different life for everyone in my community. 7, 8, 10, 16, 18, 19 And I just needed to remember that and continue to remember that whenever people would you know, at the doors some people would, you know like say: ""You don't have no business running."" 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 You know, ""You have no business running. 8, 9, 12, 17 You're just ...all you are, you're just full of all this trauma. 7 You're just one trauma"" [laughs]. 10 But, the thing was, the thing was, I had to fight against that stigma. 13, 19 SP: So it must have been very public. 11 I mean, I can only imagine to the degree that I have been you know, publicly involved working in community, but never in a political sense. 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19 And having to share information, and then you get people's response. 7, 20 I mean like, it must have been, I can't imagine. 9, 14 I mean like... like... MO: 9, 14 People thought, there were some people that thought that I was running just for people to feel sorry for me or something. 8, 9, 10, 13, 18 SP: And they would say things like that? 5, 14, 19 MO: Mhm, mhm.  And it was more so, it was more so like, me trying to prove myself to people. 9, 14 That I'm different. 7, 18 I'm not my past. 8 I'm not my traumas. 18 My traumas don't define me. 14, 18 They help push me, but they don't define me. 14, 18 I had to prove that to people time and time again. 7, 16, 19 And it was because of all the interviews.  So I was the first Little Earth resident to ever run for public office. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 We've never had a Little Earth resident that ever ran. 7, 9, 13 So, for me to be the first I had a lot of interviews. 16 A lot of interviews from different you know radio stations, to reporters, to newspapers. 6, 7, 17, 18 And it was being the ""first,"" that's where my story had gotten out, of who I am. 7, 13, 16 And that's how everybody found out. 11 And that's how everybody saw me. 6 So that's, that's where it all began with the trauma part. 8 And then, that was the hardest part of my campaign. 5, 6, 8 SP: Was that the beginning of the campaign or throughout the whole campaign? 5 MO: It was more so in the middle of the campaign, towards the middle. 5, 14 In the beginning I kept it really hush. 6, 7, 8 I kept my past out of it. 8 It was my campaign team that wanted to have me talk about my issues with a reporter. 5, 6, 7, 14 Talk about my past traumas with a reporter. 7, 8, 18 And it was my campaign team that thought it would be best because that's what made me stand out from all of the other candidates. 5, 10, 13 There were seven candidates running in my race. 8, 9 So, to make me stand out, what made me different from all of them was my life, my life story. 7, 8, 13, 18 That I was the only one, out of all of seven of us, that has lived this life. 7, 8, 11, 12, 16 And that has actually used those traumas to address the issues. 7, 9, 18 So, that's what they wanted to use. 9, 14 And that's what made it come up in public. 11, 13, 17 I just didn't realize how hard it was gonna be afterwards. 6, 7 For me anyway, just for me.  It wasn't, it wasn't hard for everybody else, it was more so hard for me [laughs]. 6, 8, 10 SP: Well I would imagine it was just hard for you! 6 [Ortega laughing]  And so the campaign is recently over. 5, 7 What about two months maybe? 11, 16 Not even that?  MO: Yep, yep.  It's recently over. 7 SP: And so, how did the campaign turn out for you? 5 MO: Well, I got...  no matter what my team is like ""We won!"" 5, 10 Even though we didn't win.  I had the least amount of money out of any campaign, out of all seven. 5, 7, 12 I only had ten thousand dollars throughout my whole campaign. 5, 18 Ten thousand dollars. 18 But I got, I got the most votes on election day. 19 I won primary day, I lost early vote. 6, 19, 20 SP: Wow.  Right on.  MO: Yeah, and they were all running with around 90 to 100 thousand dollars—their campaigns were. 5, 8, 9, 18 SP: How did you go about fundraising?  MO: I didn't wanna.  I fundraised right off of the doors. 5, 8, 14, 17, 19 So when I would talk to people at the doors, they would give me money right at the door. 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 I would ask them if they would vote for me, if they would support me. 9 And then they said yes, and then I would ask them, ""Well would you be able to you know contribute to my campaign. 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 You know for regular costs of printing and everything."" 7, 17 And that's how I raised ten thousand was just off from the doors, off from neighbors. 5, 17, 19 That's what I wanted. 14 I wanted to make sure my campaign was fully ran by the community. 5, 7, 14, 18, 19 I made sure that the money that we got was only from the community. 7, 12, 13, 19 Which I guess was my downfall. 11, 19 I should've accepted money from PACs and everybody else, but I wanted to make a statement. 7, 8, 12, 14, 17, 18 SP: It sounds like you did.  SP: And so, now that the campaign is over, what are you doing now? 5, 17 The two part question...and then, would you run for office again? 8, 15, 18 [Both proceed to laugh].  MO: Right now... 17 I'm gonna go back to school. 11, 17, 19 I still have a lot of contracts that I have to fulfill. 7 So, and I still have Natives Against Heroin that I'm turning into an org. 7 So, there's still a lot of work that I'm doing. 7 And then, I'm just gonna go back to school for a while. 11, 17, 19 Finish up my degree. 7, 19 And I don't think I'll run again. 8 I don't know. 17 Maybe, maybe not. 16 I know I'm, this coming next few months, I'm training other Little Earth residents to run. 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 SP: Fantastic.  MO: So, I got a grant to train other Little Earth residents to sit on neighborhood boards, to sit on commissions, and to also run for public office. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 18 SP: That is fantastic. 8 MO: I'm a power builder.  I like to make sure I help lift people up. 7, 9, 14, 18 SP: And, what about school? 11 Get a degree in what? 7, 19 MO: Law enforcement is my degree. 7, 19 SP: Really?  So, can you talk a little bit about that. 6, 20 Why did you decide law enforcement? 16 [Ortega laughing].  I just didn't expect that!  A lot of people don't.  [Both laughing].  A lot of people don't!  I wanted to change the criminal justice system. 5, 14 So I started my degree back in, 2013? 6, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 I went to college.  I started it out but I never finished. 6, 13, 15 I dropped out of college so that way I could you know raise my daughter. 5, 17 She was going through a lot of health problems at the time. 7, 16, 19 So I stopped school to take care of her. 7, 11, 14, 15, 20 And then, from there I went on working and then started on doing all of this community organizing stuff, so that just became a farther priority. 6, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19 But my degree, my major, has always been law enforcement. 7, 10, 16, 19 Only because of the police brutality that was happening in my community, and to a lot of my family members. 5, 7, 17, 19 I wanted to change the criminal justice system from the inside. 5, 9, 14 So I thought I would become a cop to do that. 10, 17, 18 So I will go finish my law enforcement degree. 7, 16, 19 Then go to the U of M for criminal justice.  SP: Right on.  And so, do you think, like at some point working within the criminal justice system somehow other that a cop? 10, 17 Or do you think it's really, or do you wanna be a ""peace officer""? 6, 7, 8, 11, 18 I think that's what they're often... 18 MO: Mhm.  No, I don't wanna be a peace officer. 11, 18 I will do something different within the field. 7, 18, 20 I'm, at first I wanted to be a ""peace officer"" and then reach detective. 11, 14, 16, 18 But then I was like, that's just... 9, 14 I wanna be there before the problems occur. 7 I wanna be able to address it before everything gets to the point of, you know... 7, 9, 10, 17, 18, 20 I don't wanna be there afterwards.  After all is said and done, and everyone is already hurt and families are already destroyed. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 18 I wanna be there to help fix families. 15, 18 I wanna be there to help address the traumas that our criminal justice system does to our families. 7, 9, 15, 18 'Cuz there's, not matter what, I get it people make mistakes. 10, 18, 20 We're human beings.  But I also understand that, we also have other human beings that are connected to us.  If we throw someone in prison, when we throw them in prison like that, their children suffer, their families suffer. 7, 8, 9, 15, 17 They are in prison just as much as their family member is in prison. 7, 8, 17, 19 And we need to be addressing, how is it that we keep... how do we minimize the trauma for the families that are going through this system? 7, 9, 15, 17 We do understand that he or she has a price to pay. 18 We understand that.  But we have to minimize the trauma.  How can they still parent? 7 We have to allow them to still be a parent. 7 We have to allow them to still... if it's us providing rides for their kids to go here, to see their parents on a weekly basis. 5, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17 If it's doing live Skypes so they can see their kid's dance recital. 5, 7, 11, 15 You know, like, if something we have to do something to minimize and allow them to still be parents while they're incarcerated. 7, 9, 12, 14, 17 SP: I would agree with you a hundred percent. 7 MO: 'Cuz they should be able, we could do Skype videos, you know? 17, 18 Like have some [laughs] 10 ""It's my kid's first soccer game."" 15, 16 ""Well guess what? 19 You're gonna sit here and watch your kid's soccer game. 7, 15 Like you're still in prison but, here's your kid's soccer game."" 7, 8, 15, 17 You know? 17 You can still be a part of that, in some type of way. 7, 8 We need to be providing something to help minimize this, because we're just, we're creating a generational trauma that is continuing to play out with a lot of our communities. 7, 18 SP: Are you a leader in the broader Native community in Minnesota? 19 MO: Yes.  SP: Well that's fantastic. 8 MO: Yes.  It's not just the Native community. 19 Ever since my campaign it's all over Minneapolis. 5 I wouldn't call myself a leader, I'm more so just an advocate. 14, 17 I just like to help people. 9, 14, 18 It fills my soul.  It's one of those things where you say like, if you don't like a job you're not gonna stay there very long, but this is one thing where helping people, it fulfills me. 5, 7, 9, 14, 18, 19 Where I go home, and I feel like I've done good. 6, 13, 17, 18, 19 I've done what I needed to do for the day. 9, 19 And then I can wake up the next day and do it again, and feel good about it. 6, 13, 16, 18, 19 I've had plenty of jobs where... 15 I worked in a homeless shelter. 12, 17, 19 It was the hardest job I had. 6 I told myself I'll never do it again. 13, 16 I worked in a youth homeless shelter for Native kids. 12, 15, 17, 19 And, the shelter would take children—it would be child protection—would take children away from their parents. 7, 9, 12, 20 And they would put them into this, our shelter. 19 And, having to see them, their little faces crying for their parents. 5, 7, 12, 20 All they want is love. 14, 17 And you can see it, and you can feel it. 5, 13, 18 That's all they're yearning for, is their parents' love. 7, 12, 16, 17 I couldn't be a part of that. 8 I couldn't be a part of holding them from their families. 8, 15, 16 All I wanted was for them to have their parents. 7, 12, 14 And when I had to see that, and deal with it every day, I told myself I needed to do something different. 5, 7, 9, 13, 16, 18, 19 I can't be a part of this. 8 I can't hurt these babies. 14 They didn't deserve it.  They didn't do nothing wrong for them to have to be sitting in a shelter, wondering what's gonna happen to them. 5, 6, 7, 18 They shouldn't be worried about what's happening to them. 5, 7 So that's, it just reminded me of boarding schools all over again. 6, 7, 11 SP: I can understand why.  I suspect that many people see you as a leader despite your protest that you're just an advocate [both laugh]. 5, 13, 18 And especially for women, and for Native women. 8, 12 You know, I think that for me, I think a lot about, well certainly harm reduction is something I believe in. 7, 8, 9, 14, 17 I've worked in for over twenty years. 12, 16 But my focus, and my emphasis has always been around women. 10, 12 Not to exclude men, but women, women identified, and trying to create positive change for the lives of women, and that are pregnant and parenting, and no access to resources, and desperate. 5, 7, 11, 12 So, I'm wondering...  MO: Women that are incarcerated have harsher sentences than men. 14 SP: Yes.  MO: They get longer sentences. 7, 20 And it's, it pissed me off when I was in college.  I argued with a lot of my instructors in college.  I know I'm going back to go argue again [both laugh]. 11, 17, 19 Because it was, it's discriminatory.  It's discrimination.  And we have a protective class against discrimination against sex. 6, 12 But yet, our criminal justice system can blatantly and openly discriminate over and over and over again. 15, 20 And no judge, no one, gets held accountable. 12, 18, 20 Especially when these women have children, or they're giving birth in prison. 7, 8, 9, 12, 17 A lot of children die from giving birth, from their mothers giving birth in prison. 7, 8, 9, 10, 17 The babies, some of 'em don't even survive.  And it's only because of the kind of treatment they get when they're giving birth. 7, 13, 18, 20 They're cuffed to a bed.  How would you like it to give birth, being cuffed to a bed? 9, 11, 14 That's... SP: I can't even imagine.  MO: Right?  It's just...  oh my god... like, the things that I've read. 5, 7, 9, 14, 19 I tend to take up the harsh topics in everything I do. 20 Even in college I did it.  I don't know why it is about me. 17 I take up the topics that nobody wants to talk about. 6, 14, 20 And I tend to write about 'em, and research 'em, and do what I can to figure out well how can we change it? 5, 7, 8, 12 And my instructors were always, me and my instructors were always at each other's necks [laughs]. 10 And it was only because I was always wanting to change a system. 5, 10, 14 Like this can't be happening. 5, 7 Like look at these numbers. 14 And, my instructors are always, you know like... well we'll find out how they feel when they see me come back [laughs]. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 SP: Well it sounds to me like it's fantastic. 8 Like you are really there to learn. 5, 6, 7, 8 And to create positive change for yourself and for other people. 5, 7 And it sounds like you educate your instructors.  SP: I don't know, in my experience, you know when I would do some education in schools around harm reduction like in the '90s, nobody had ever really heard of it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17 And, it's Minnesota so abstinence is expected.  So it was a hard conversation to have, and it was like spending a lot of time explaining to people what harm reduction was. 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 And it was more related to HIV and Hep-C, rather than overdose. 5, 7 So I'm curious now, like, harm reduction seems to be fairly common-place throughout the country, and in Minnesota! 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17 What is your experience like? 9, 14, 15 You know like in school, or other community places? 8, 11, 17, 19, 20 Do people know and support harm reduction? 7, 9, 17 Do you spend a lot of time explaining to them why it matters? 7, 10, 16, 19 Or what's that like? 9, 14 MO: What I've noticed, harm reduction is much more accepted in the communities of color. 7, 9 In communities of color, it's way more accepted, more looked at like yes we need this. 9, 13, 14 But when you look at the counterparts, like white society for instance. 8, 15, 19 They still believe in abstinence. 7, 9 That's where the hardest part is. 6, 8 The older white folks. 15, 16, 17, 19 It's harder to explain to them. 6 There are still some, you know cuz I, throughout my door knocking when people would ask me about my background in opiates and all of this. 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 It was more so the older white men, that would have the hardest time to accept harm reduction. 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 19 That I was giving people a way to just continue to use and use and use and use... and to keep the drug stuff going and going. 9, 10, 17, 19 No matter what we do, the drugs will always be there. 10 And that is not because of communities of color.  That is because of our country. 10 Our country is allowing the drugs to be there. 10 They are allowing that to be shipped in.  It's just communities of color, because they deal with a lot of trauma, they deal with a lot of poverty, and poverty creates trauma, that's why drugs are so susceptible in the communities of color. 7, 10 It is not their fault, why it's here.  So, the more I tried to explain that to an older white man, for instance... 15, 16, 19 I think it's because I'm a woman of color.  That gives them sometimes the feeling of ""I don't need to listen to you,"" or ""You're not talking."" 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 You know? 17 Being a woman, like you said, you automatically lose some type of respect from some male counterparts. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17 There are a lot of males out there that will automatically lose respect for you just because you're a woman. 7, 13, 14, 17 Being a woman of color you even lose more. 13 So, in this state it's a lot more simpler and easier 'cuz if you go out to like Georgia for instance.... 5, 17 Georgia is so far away from harm reduction. 7, 9, 20 They're still in the criminalization stage where they just wanna criminalize every.... but, I get it, they have a lot of overdoses and stuff going on over there too. 7, 13, 15, 20 But it's, it's gonna take them a while to learn that harm reduction actually helps reduce overdoses. 5, 7, 9, 18, 20 Harm reduction actually helps promote more sobriety, but that takes time to show them that. 7, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20 Because harm reduction is so big in Minnesota, we are the lab rats. 7, 9 We are the ones that will do the data, we'll be the ones to collect all this data, and then we'll start seeing the trickle effects in other states. 5, 6, 12, 17 But we have to be the first. 16 So, right now we will make all the mistakes. 8, 14, 17, 18, 20 But, it's okay to make mistakes, 'cuz we can learn from them. 5, 14, 18, 20 And, we're just fortunate that we have a lot of people in our state that believe in the same thing. 9, 17, 19 That want to be the first to try this. 14, 16 So it will take some time. 7, 16, 19, 20 We'll see it throughout the country, but it'll take time. 5, 7, 10, 16, 19, 20 Am I making sense? 9 SP: You are absolutely making sense. 9 I was just thinking about where I wanted to go with that. 14 I think that, you are such a strong, I'm sorry I'm gonna use the word leader. 9 I can see that in you. 5 Your willingness to stand up.  Your willingness to be heard. 7, 14 Your bravery and your courage just shine through. 15 And, I'm wondering, like just really I guess in many ways excited to see where you will go next [Ortega laughs]. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 18, 19 You don't strike me as a person that is necessarily content [Ortega laughs]. 10, 17 You've just got to keep moving and keep building with what you're doing, and your passion comes through. 17 I could be so bold, it's like it's grown out of your own experience. 15, 16 MO: Yes, it has.  SP: And that, you share that. 7 And that, you know your face, and how you radiate...like you're infectious [Both laugh]. 17 MO: Well, thank you! 9 [Both laugh].  SP: I would imagine that, really for younger women, for young girls, for your daughters... two of them right? 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16 MO: Mhm.  That you are a very strong role model.  I started out mentoring kids, you know? 6, 15, 17 MO: Mhm.  My very first job was a youth mentor. 16 SP: And were they youth using drugs? 10 MO: Mhm.  [Ortega laughs]. 10 I mean like, did they expect, I mean like what was the relationship like? 7, 9, 14, 15 I think oftentimes like youth expect, you know adults to be finger wagging. 7, 16, 17, 18, 19 And, telling them that they shouldn't be using drugs. 10, 13 I mean like, what was that conversation like when you were a mentor of youth, based on your own experience? 9, 14, 15 MO: I was honest. 6, 12 I was very honest with them. 6, 12 That's really where, that's where the trust came in. 6, 7, 8, 13, 17 That's where I was able to build trust. 6, 18 The more honest you are with people, the more trusting a person can be. 6, 10, 12, 17 And then, once a person trusts you the more impact you can make on them. 6, 10, 17, 18 Especially when it comes to kids and teens. 15, 17 I was honest with them! 6, 12 Like yeah, I used. 8, 9 I used and you guys are using. 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 But guess what? 19 We can do something different. 7, 18 The more I showed them, and gave them a part of me, the more they gave me them. 8, 9, 18 So, I was able to change a lot of—I call them my kids cuz 5, 14, 15, 17, 18 I'll always look at them as my kids—I was able to change their lives. 5, 10, 11, 15, 18 There's a lot of my kids that already graduated college. 6, 7, 11, 15, 18 A lot of my kids that are already you know, I have one kid that's already almost a lawyer! 6, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18 She's got one more, like session, or like class bar she was saying. 6, 12, 14 One more test, and she'll be able to be a lawyer. 13, 16, 18 I still keep in contact with a lot of my kids. 7, 15, 17 And they still, wherever they see me they still get super excited to see me. 5, 7, 13, 20 And it's like, they're always so happy to tell me how well they're doing. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14 And how much I've helped them. 18 And it's more so listening and being a part of their story, just as much as they're a part of mine. 8, 13 SP: That's really powerful isn't it? 6, 7, 8 SP: Growing experience. 15 That's one thing that I try to explain to people a lot. 19 Life experience means way more than a textbook experience. 15 I'm gonna go back to school and go get my degree and everything, and show everybody like, yes I can do your textbooks. 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 That's totally fine. 14 I'll do your textbooks.  But one thing they can't do, is live the life that I lived. 7, 8, 11, 16, 19 One thing they can't do is experience what I've experienced. 15, 19 'Cuz there is a lot of lives that I've impacted. 11 A lot of lives that I've helped change. 5, 11, 18 And, I am humbled by how much people have trusted me into their lives. 6, 11 And, I am able to help them have a better life. 7, 8, 17, 18 Give them hope. 13 Cuz there's a lot of addicts out here that don't even have hope. 13, 15 And for me to be able to give them hope for another day, that we can do this another day, and we'll get through it. 11, 13, 18, 19, 20 It means the world to me. 12 It means the world to me to see the light in them come out. 5, 12, 17 SP: Thank you.  I think that's a wonderful place to end the interview [Ortega laughs]. 8, 10 I guess I should ask, is there anything else you want to add? 8, 14, 19 MO: Nope! "
"9","Devich_Stephanie","Dr. Marvin Seppala Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer Interview 2 January 23, 2019 Amy Sullivan’s Home Minneapolis, Minnesota Marvin Seppala-MS Amy Sullivan-AS MS: I'm Marv Seppala and I give you permission to record this interview. 7, 11 AS: This is January 23rd, 2019 and we are at my house in Minneapolis. 9, 11 Alright, let's go! 8, 14 So, when we left off last time, we were talking about how you went to Drake University and then you had just gotten in to medical school and one of your mentors from Mayo, was it Dr. Shepard? 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, 19 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 AS: You were talking about Dr. Shepard and I was making a joke, ""Oh, yeah, of course you got in because he was there..."" 6, 8 Or I made some kind of comment. 13 I was just listening to that.

AS: Why don't we open there? 20 You guys had been in Iowa and you were going to move back. 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 MS: Yes, and Linda needed to do one more year of college when I started medical school. 6, 9, 11, 15, 16 So, she stayed at Drake one more year and I started medical school in Rochester. 6, 11, 14, 15, 16 And immediately, I told all of my peers, it's a small class, just forty people at Mayo per class. 6, 12, 13, 16 It was really nice and intimate, so you get to know everybody well and all the good and bad with that, I guess. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 19, 20 So, I just told all my peers that I am in recovery from addiction, which the first week of class, I am just meeting these people on Monday and Friday night I was living with two other guys. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 One, who I had known from freshman year of college at St. Olaf. 7, 12, 16, 17 We both left St. Olaf and we both got into Mayo, so we roomed together and another guy from Minnesota roomed with us as well. 6, 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 We just decided, well, we had a big apartment. 8 A friend of mine owned a house in Rochester and rented it out as apartments, so he let us use it. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 Well, we threw the party at our place on Friday night and I made sure there was not alcoholic drinks, right? 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 19 But there were all kinds of alcohol. 10, 12 And I am standing by the drinks and a guy who is now my best friend from medical school, comes up to me and says, ""Here, have a drink."" 6, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 and I say, ""No, thanks."" 9, 14 and he says, ""Have a drink."" 14, 17, 19 And I said, ""No, thanks."" 9, 13, 14 And he said, ""How come?"" 13, 14, 17 and I said, ""I'm an alcoholic, I don't drink."" 10, 13, 14, 19 And he walked away dumbfounded because he'd never met an alcoholic and he finally meets one and it is his medical school classmate and he doesn't even drink. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20 [laughter] 9 So, it turns out that he now works... 8, 17 he is an anesthesiologist, but he does the whole drug diversion program for the Mayo system because he took a real interest in addiction over time and was really involved. 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 19 AS: Interesting. 7 MS: And then right before Christmas, that first fall, I decided to tell the dean that I am in recovery. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16 AS: What made you do that? 13 MS: Well, all of my peers knew, and I was really open about it and I thought I might as well just tell him, you know? 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 20 In case anything comes up about it, which was... 17 And I knew... 6, 12 MS: I'll tell you the story. 13 It was really problematic in an odd way. 6, 7, 8 So, I thought that they would hear so I might as well just get it out there. 8, 10, 14, 20 So, I went to his office. 18 I told him I'm in recovery from addiction. 7, 8, 13, 15, 16 I was told not to let anyone know when I applied to medical school, that I was in recovery. 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17 I'd never get into Mayo. 13, 20 And I didn't tell anyone, and it was a little hard in one interview, and only one. 6, 12, 13, 20 All of my volunteer activities from college were addiction related. 5, 7, 8, 15 And the family practice doc who I knew, actually, asked me how that came to be? 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 And because these two docs I knew at Mayo told me, they said don't mention a thing or you just will not get in. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 I lied to this guy and said, something like ""Oh, we had a family issue."" 6, 7, 13, 14, 19 Which wasn't a total lie, I was the family issue. 7, 19 [laughter] 9 And he let it go at that.  So, I got through the interviews.  So, that was one of the reasons I thought I should tell the dean. 7, 10, 13, 17 AS: So, that was your conscious that was like, ""I better tell."" 9, 13, 14, 17 MS: Yeah, better to just get it out there and let him know that I am in recovery. 7, 8, 17, 20 So, he was this really gregarious Irish guy and I told him, and he just didn't say a word and he had this terrible grimace on his face. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16 He just kind of said, ""If we had known that, we would have never let you in here."" 12, 13, 14, 17 Really?  MS: And he never talked to me again. 6, 13 MS: There was just this tremendous bias against it. 7 AS: That you would someday be a doctor with an addiction problem? 7, 8, 15, 19, 20 MS: I guess so, that I could be an embarrassment to the school. 11, 12, 19 That someone would find out or that I would relapse or have some sort of... 7, 8, 9 AS: Did you ever hear of that book called, this is a little off topic, but called ""Thirty Rooms to Hide In""? 13, 14, 17, 20 AS: About a doctor with really severe alcoholism. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 20 Okay, it's by one of his children. 7, 9 MS: No, I don't know that book. 17 Really?  AS: We'll just move on and I will give you a reference for that, because that makes me really curious about why Mayo, in particular, would have that stigma? 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 18, 20 He was a pretty famous surgeon. 5, 7, 14 He was pretty well known. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17 MS: It's interesting because during medical school, the Chairman of the Surgical Department was a known alcoholic. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 And when I was on a surgical rotation, so I am around all of the surgeons. 18 We're going down the hall on Monday morning and there he is, and he's got this bandage across the whole side of his face. 9, 15, 19 And I am with a whole group of residents and we are with our attendant, who was a peer of the Chair of Surgeries in that department. 7, 8, 9, 18 And he says hi to him, and the chair says, ""Hi."" 14, 17 And he says, ""Wow, what happened?"", you know because he's got this huge bandage. 5, 14, 15, 17 ""Ah, the garage door was going down and I just had to run and jump under it and I just kind of fell and scraped my face."" 8, 15, 17 It made no sense at all, you know? 9, 13, 17 I mean who scrapes their face jumping under the garage door? 15, 17 AS: Yeah, that was quite a leap.  And it was known as a really angry guy. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17 AS: What was his name? 11 MS: I am blocking out his name, maybe it will come to me. 11, 16, 17 But anyway, he was well known as an alcoholic and I knew of other situations like that, and I was told that one of chairs of the board of Mayo at one time, went into treatment at Mayo for his alcoholism. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 When he walked in, the whole staff lined up and shook his hand as he walks into treatment. 7, 13, 18, 20 Which didn't really set up a good situation for him or with his peers. 6, 7, 8, 19 AS: Because everybody knew? 6, 12 So, it was just really odd some of the stuff that went on there. 6, 7, 8 But, nonetheless, that was my introduction to my dean and he never talked to me again. 6, 12, 13 But, other than that, school went really well. 6, 7, 8, 11 And the second year, I am planning on being a cardiac surgeon, because of that lab and because of my experience with that. 14, 15, 16 You know, the guy who influenced me most was a Brazilian (?) surgeon and I wanted to be like him. 6, 14, 17 And, so that was the plan.  AS: So, you enjoyed surgery?  MS: I loved it and I was really good at it because of my experience in the lab. 6, 7, 8, 15, 17, 19 And they let me do things that they never let students do, because I could do it! 5, 11, 13, 19 [laughter] 9 Yeah, it was really neat. 6, 7, 8 So, I was just psyched about it, but I noticed on clinical rotations, all of these people with alcohol and drug addiction underlying the reason that they were in the hospital. 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 Or, coincidental to it, but often underlying their hospitalization. 8, 12, 18 And we weren't diagnosing it, we weren't writing it down even.  We were not giving referrals, we were not giving consultations. 7, 20 Nothing that you would normally do for an illness, did we do. 18 So, I was going to this AA meeting in town and the same two doctors who told me not to say anything about being an alcoholic or addicted were at this meeting, they were in my home group. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 And that's why I asked them, because I knew them from AA. 6, 12 And they said, do not say a word. 13, 14 So, I'm going to the meeting and every weekend complaining about this situation on clinical rotations all over the hospital. 6, 7, 8, 16 There are people with addiction and alcoholism, and we do nothing about it. 8, 10, 15 It is awful. 7 And one night those two took me aside and they said, ""Marv, you've got to quit bitching about this and do something about it."" 9, 13, 14, 19, 20 And it was at that point where I kind of opened my eyes to the possibility that I didn't have to be a cardiac surgeon. 9, 10, 14, 20 As much as I liked doing it, I could do this instead. 9, 14, 18 And shortly after I had a psychiatry rotation, and they are all like one-month rotations, I enjoyed it, a lot. 8 I found an attraction to it that I didn't expect, and it was a gate way to work in addiction. 8, 11, 15 So, that's what I did and that is why I changed my mind. 5, 6 All because of that statement and that experience. 15, 17 So, then I needed a place to do that and I wanted to do an addiction fellowship. 8, 9, 14, 15 There were only a few around the country at the time. 7, 10, 16, 19 AS: A few as in only for a few people or a few different programs that were larger? \ 7, 8, 18 Yeah, only a few where you could do fellowships, that you could do an addiction training fellowship. 8, 15 So, I wanted to do a psychiatry residency and then an addiction fellowship. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 So, I wanted to, ideally in the same place for whatever reason I thought I would want to stay in the same place. 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 17 This is a funny part, but I applied to program on both the West Coast and East Coast for psychiatry because I didn't want to stay in the Midwest. 8, 14 [laughter] 9 For whatever reason, I thought that I might as well go to one of the coasts and Linda agreed. 7, 8, 10, 17 I made all of the applications and got rejections from every West Coast school and acceptance from every East Coast school. 7, 11, 13 And I didn't have enough money to go to both coasts to interview in both places, so I was kind of seeking direction and I got it. 5, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20 I went to the East Coast to look at all of these programs. 8 And they either had nothing going about addiction, and or, when I said I was in recovery from addiction and that's what allowed me to go down this path, they were like psychoanalytic programs. 7, 8, 13, 14, 15 So, they just couldn't even tolerate this idea that I would be... 5 AS: That someone in recovery would want to be in addiction medicine? 7, 8, 14, 15 MS: Yeah, one guy actually started to do psychotherapy with me in the interview when I mentioned that. 6, 12, 15, 18 It was just bizarre. 7 AS: Okay, so let's put a time on this. 7, 16, 19 What year is this? 16 Do you remember? 7, 13, 15 For my history of medicine pursuits. 8, 13 MS: [laughter] 9 It would have been 1984.  I graduated from medical school in 1984 and it was that winter and spring leading up to that, that I was doing those interviews. 11 AS: Would that happen today? 5, 19 MS: No, not to that degree. 7, 19 But also, this is the basic understanding. 17 I told all of the attendants on the rotation that I was on, I can't remember if it was internal medicine or neurology, but I said ""Hey, I'm going to go into psychiatry and specialize in addiction."" 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 And he said, ""You're throwing away a good career in medicine."" 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 19, 20 And that was the basic feeling about psychiatry in general, but also, even more so about addiction, which nobody did. 8, 13, 15, 17, 18 Like, who would do that, Marv?  Why would you even consider it? 9 So, it was like really... 6, 7, 8 AS: I've heard that story before, from doctors that I have interviewed. 7, 13, 14, 20 MS: Okay, so it was like really going against the grain. 6, 7, 8 Yeah, it's like, why would you want to do that? 9, 14 Like, think of who your patients are going to be, was the underlying message. 12, 15 MS: Exactly.  ""It isn't even an illness"", you know? 17 AS: Oh right, you had that even. 8, 14 MS: Yeah, so I get back from the East Coast and I am just perplexed and disappointed because there wasn't a single place that I wanted to go. 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 And I applied to the best programs in the country, you know? 8, 10, 13, 17 It was awful. 7 So, I am walking past the secretarial pool in the medical school... 6, 7, 11 AS: At Mayo?  MS: Yeah, and I knew a lot of these women because I had worked there and I grew up in the area, right? 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 19 So, I always talked to them and one of them says, ""Marv! 6, 10, 13, 14, 17 Are you going to finish your application to the University of Minnesota?"" 7 And I said, ""I haven't started one."" 6, 13, 14, 15 And she said, ""Well I think you have."" 13, 14 So, I said, ""Sure."", because they helped us with it because we didn't have to do our own applications. 7, 13, 14, 18 Which was really wonderful. 6, 7, 8 AS: Are you kidding me? 15 I mean why as a secretary? 7 Oh my gosh, you guys were so spoiled back then. 6, 8, 11, 15, 17, 19 MS: So, spoiled.  [laughter] 9 We were just treated really well. 6, 7, 8 So, she said, ""You want to?"" and I said, ""Yes."" and she sends it off. 13, 14 And they call me, and I get an appointment for interviews and I am driving up to Minneapolis and I am half way here and it hits me. 10, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 And I don't know what this is, or what happened, but I'm like, ""This is where I belong."" 5, 7, 9, 14, 17 It is just overwhelming.  And I get to the University and I have to park at the Medical Center and my parking spot overlooks the Mississippi there and eagle flew down below me, because you are on the cliffs, right? 7, 8, 10, 14, 20 This eagle goes by.  And I'm like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" 9, 14 It was funny because I get this sense that this is where I belong, and then I got anxious like, man, now I really got to perform this interview. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 20 But then, I realize that this is where I belong, so it doesn't matter! 7, 10 [laughter] 9 However, it was just like, this is where I belong. 7, 9, 13, 14 And then the eagle.  And I go in, and the interviews go fantastic, they've got an addiction fellowship program. 8, 15 If I perform well in the residency, I can do that in my fourth year rather than adding a fifth year. 7, 8, 9, 16 Because the whole fourth year they have are electives at the U. Which is like, oh my god, that is amazing. 9, 14, 16 I can get done in four instead of five years. 16, 18 So, it was where I belonged and it's where I went. 7 And they had great people at the time, and a really robust program and a lot going on. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 I mean, it was fantastic. 8 So, I had a great experience. 7, 8, 15 AS: So, who were your mentors there?  MS: Joe Westermier was one.  He oversaw the whole addiction department at the U, at the time and later became the Chair of Psychology at the University of Oklahoma and then came back and was Chair of the VA here in Minneapolis. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 And he was a true academic and over three hundred publications and books and stuff. 11 We had a Southeast Asian Mental Health Clinic and a Southeast Asian Opium Clinic at the time, because the church sponsored a lot of refugees after the Vietnam War and that included a lot of Hmong, and with those folks, a lot of opium addiction. 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 And they basically brought it here and there were opium dens all over the Twin Cities. 14, 17, 20 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 There probably still are. 7, 12, 13 AS: In the Seventies?  And Eighties?  MS: Yeah, Eighties now, but starting after the Vietnam War, so late Seventies into the Eighties. 5, 6, 17 And so, he set up programs during the Vietnam War. 8 He was a family practice doc and later went into psychiatry. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 He spent a lot of time over in Southeast Asia during the war. 7, 16, 19 And he actually spoke Hmong, Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodian. 11, 18 I mean, he was an amazing guy. 6 And so, he was a true mentor and really knew addiction and really Twelve Steps stuff and had a really great program at the U. AS: I suppose he's passed? 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17 MS: No, he is still around, here in town. 7, 18 AS: Oh, my goodness, wow. 6, 14, 19 MS: He'd be worth talking to. 6 He still does some stuff at the VA, so that would be a place you could easily get a hold of him if his number isn't available. 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 20 I don't have a home phone number, I just call the VA to talk to him. 6, 12, 14, 17, 19 So, he was tremendous. 7 And then, Mark Willenbring.  Do you know Mark? 17 AS: I've interviewed him.  Twice!  I had to interview him twice, too! 16 [laughter] 9 I was going to ask if you knew him. 6, 12 MS: Yeah, Mark was at the VA.  Yeah, we're good friends. 6, 7, 13, 19 We get together a couple times a year and have supper to talk over stuff. 6, 7, 11, 16, 19, 20 But he was closer to my age than Joe. 6, 13, 15 Mark was early in his career and at the VA and was my attending when I did my addiction rotation. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 And for just a couple weeks oversaw some of my work during psychiatry rotation, too. 6, 7, 8, 16 AS: That is fantastic. 8 I love that... for my storytelling. 13, 17 To have that connection is really incredible. 6, 7, 8, 18 MS: So, it was those two, primarily, who really mentored me in remarkable ways, really beneficial. 6, 7, 8, 18 And John Brantner was a psychologist at the U who did die some time ago. 7, 16, 19 But he was part of the group that developed the MMPI. 8, 18 And John was in recovery but also just this really brilliant, eccentric psychologist and his main focus was thanatology, so death and suicide. 6, 7, 8 AS: Wow.  It's called thanatology? 13, 14, 17 And he, because he was in recovery, but also a really well-known therapist. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17 I mean, really, really well respected. 6, 7, 8 Joe Westermier was one of my psychotherapy supervisors. 18 You would do that for a year. 16 Every hour of therapy, I had to have an hour of supervision, which never happens anymore. 5, 7, 13, 18 And one year, I had John. 16 AS: So, what are you saying? 14 Repeat that again, what you had to do with the program. 8 MS: If I did an hour of psychotherapy with someone where I was providing the psychotherapy, I'd have to go do an hour of supervision about that hour of psychotherapy. 18 AS: You mean, you would have to go and talk to one of your supervisors about what had happened in that session? 5, 6 Hour to hour?  MS: Yeah, and some of them required that I record the sessions. 7, 11 Some required that I write every single word down during the session. 7 Just writing away and trying to talk at the same time. 6, 7, 16, 19, 20 I learned how to do that really well, because it was so frequent that I had to do that. 5, 6, 7, 8 That's hard. 6 [laughter] 9 AS: That's really hard. 6, 7, 8 You can see, I'm not doing that. 5 MS: No, the recording is a lot easier. 7, 11 Yeah, so those two both did that for me for a year. 16 The addiction fellowship, more than anything else, well first... 8, 15, 16 I was in my training during a time when psychoanalyses were still really a major aspect of psychiatry, but the biologic psychiatrists who were coming in, and the University had hired a biologic psychiatrist as a chair, Paula Clayton, and she was trying to change the department. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 So, they were both still there though, and they were waring with each other basically. 7, 14, 17 Which seems like that kind of conflict could be a difficult time to train, but it was wonderful because you got to hear everything. 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 19 I got both sides of this whole issue and training from both sides, and the understanding of things from both sides. 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 19 And there was still an emphasis on psychotherapy and biology. 7, 18 So, I thought it was awesome. 10 Some people didn't and they thought it was difficult that way, but I just loved it. 10, 17 And, I got both, which is what I wanted. 14 I wanted to be a therapist more than handing out medications, anyway. 13, 14, 16 AS: So that is also just on the cusp of when medications took over psychiatry? 8, 16 MS: Yeah, oh yeah. 8 AS: So, that's the mid-Eighties?  MS: Yup. '84 to '88 I am in my training and while I was there... 8 While I was in medical school, just to kind of put this historically, I guess, someone in infection disease came to give us a lecture one day down at Mayo. 7, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 He said there that there is a new illness that we had just been informed about, and it was HIV. 6, 13, 14 It didn't even have a name when he told us about it. 11, 13, 16 It didn't have a name, we didn't know anything about it, not sure what is going on. 7, 11, 17 AS: This is when you were in med school? 11 MS: Med school. 11 Then in my residency, I saw the second patient with HIV at the University because the first patient attacked a nurse and just got psychotic and took her pin off her shirt and tried to puncture her with it and infect her basically. 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 17 He was just psychotic.  So, they decided every person with this disease, again, I think they were calling it AIDS by then, but I'm not sure. 7, 8, 10, 14, 17 I can't remember when it kind of transitioned. 7, 12, 13, 15 So, they said that they had to have a psychiatric consult before anything else happens, because of this first episode. 5, 8, 13, 14, 16 Because no one knew this disease. 6, 12 Well, they made us wear space suits basically, because no one knew what this disease was or how it was transmitted. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17 So, I had to cover myself with, you know, protective garments and gloves and a helmet type thing. 12, 17, 19 I mean, everything.  Not a breathing apparatus, but you know... 7, 17, 19 I'm a psychiatrist walking in like that. 6, 8 And after a couple times of that, I just said screw it, because no one was getting sick that I saw. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 But still, no one knew, but it was so disruptive. 6, 7, 12 But at the same time, the pathology department at the University of Minnesota, refused to take the blood samples from these people. 7, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20 Refused to study the blood samples because they didn't know if they were at risk or not. 5, 9, 17 And so, in medicine, isn't that your job? 8 I mean the essence of risk... shouldn't you be the ones wanting to figure this out? 6, 7, 12, 14 They didn't want anything to do with it. 14 They refused. 7, 9 So, there was so much controversy going on about this.  AS: That is such a powerful story. 13 It is really bizarre that that went on. 6, 7, 8 All kinds of weird things like that. 5, 12, 19 And so, what else? 8 I was mentioning something else. 8 AS: We were talking about... 6 I was asking you about when the shift to medications in bio-medical psychiatry? 8, 11, 16 I was going to ask you, when did Prozac enter your story? 13 MS: During my residency. 7, 9 It was released for use. 7, 9 So, it was the same kind of story. 13 All of the sudden, there is a new... all we had were the old tri-cyclic antidepressants basically and the old anti-psychotics. 6, 7, 14, 16, 17 They all had a lot of side effects and people hated taking them. 9 And they worked, in fact, even now, sometimes those old antidepressants are used as the backup in nothing else works. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 And then suddenly, there was this new medication, Prozac. 6, 16, 17 So, I just happened to be on a rotation working with the psycho-pharmacologist in the department at the time when Prozac was released. 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 19 So, I'm like right on top of it and get to learn all about this new medication and stuff and its potential. 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20 AS: But you were at the same time also being trained in therapy? 7, 16, 18, 19 MS: Yeah, so it was wonderful.  Because to me, that is still what a psychiatrist should do, both. 7, 8 And yet, a lot of training programs have put psychotherapy behind. 8, 15, 18, 19 It is really weird. 6, 7, 8 AS: Or completely separated them. 14 MS: Yeah, or just biological.  Just let the psychologist do it or something, I don't get it. 20 They want to just do psychopharmacology which... 9, 14 It is really a wonderful and useful tool, and necessary. 6, 7, 8, 9 And I suspect...  The brain is a new organ of study, right? 5, 6, 8, 14 There was taboo against even opening the skull and studying the brain, and yet, the rest of the body, you can open and look at and study and do whatever you wanted. 5, 7, 14, 15, 20 And so, it' been only recent that we've really had that opportunity. 6, 7, 8 It is really complex. 6, 7, 8 And so, we are way behind in a way, but it is also a brand-new field, which is one of the things that did attract me to psychiatry, it's like wow, this is... there is nothing known about this whole field. 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20 It is really wide open, and I had thoughts about academics at the time. 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 19, 20 Which, because my parents didn't pay for any of my education, I had so much school debt that I couldn't go into academics. 7, 11, 12, 18 AS: You thought about academia for a minute and then realized that you had to be more practical? 7, 10, 14 [laughter] 9 That was a good decision probably. 6, 7, 12, 13, 19 MS: Yes!  I just couldn't do it.  Well yeah, the school debt was enough that I had to make decisions in terms of income to pay that off. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20 [laughter] 9 AS: So, at this point, do you have any children while you are in residency? 7, 9, 10 Or what's happening? 5, 7 MS: Yeah, well, during my internship, I had to do a rotating internship in St. Paul Ramsey to start with. 6, 8 So, my first year was at St. Paul Ramsey with all of the internal medicine and family practice people doing internal medicine feeds, ER, all of that stuff, just in case you'd decide to bad psychiatry and... but it also gave you a really solid foundation in medicine. 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19 It gave me that. 18 And, during that, I was on all every other night in the hospital and our daughter was born. 5, 8, 19 [laughter] 9 AS: Oh, that is so much.  MS: I know, and she didn't sleep well. 8, 17 So, I'd be up all night and get home and be woken up regularly. 7, 17, 19, 20 I think I was just...  AS: And then Linda on the nights that you were gone, not sleeping, she was really not sleeping either. 6, 7, 8, 12, 19 MS: I know. 17 It was probably tougher than I noticed at the time. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 AS: Yeah, you were both sleep deprived.  MS: Yes, terribly.  And then later, Adam was born in my third year of residency. 5, 7, 9, 16, 20 It was down to every third night then. 19, 20 But it all worked out, you know? 12, 17 You just do what you have to do.  AS: It's true.  You look back on it and you can't believe that you did it. 9, 11, 17, 19 It's good that when you're in it, you just have to keep on moving forward. 6, 17, 19 [laughter] 9 Okay, so your residency is over. 7, 9 MS: So that's my background. 11, 17, 19 My background is in... 11, 17, 19 AS: It's also on the cusp.  MS: Yeah, it is on the cusp of all these new medications, all of this promise, but you know, from my own bias and my own recovery, I think psychotherapy is really important. 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18 AS: Right.  MS: So that's my background. 11, 17, 19 My background is in... 11, 17, 19 AS: It's also on the cusp.  MS: Yeah, it is on the cusp of all these new medications, all of this promise, but you know, from my own bias and my own recovery, I think psychotherapy is really important. 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18 AS: Right.  MS: And I've got this experience when I got sober of the spirituality of the Twelve Steps and the science of working in that lab, and then my college and medical school experience and residency. 7, 9, 11, 15 So, there's these somewhat diverse influences going on.  But I think they left me in a remarkable position because I was open to all of that, and not, in a single lane, kind of. 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 And I think that allowed me to do a lot in my career, that I would have maybe not otherwise been able to do, like Core Twelve, actually. 7, 14, 16, 18, 20 And when I finished training, I was looking for a job and had hoped to work for Hazelden and they didn't have any openings for a psychiatrist... 6, 8, 13, 20 AS: Because they didn't have a psychiatrist? 8 MS: No, they did have a psychiatrist. 8 They used consultants, just like a few hours in the evening and they were guys from the VA that I knew. 6, 8, 9, 12, 15 AS: So, the preeminent addiction treatment center in the state did not have a psychiatrist on staff? 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 18 MS: No, not on staff.  Yeah, they were using these consultants. 10 AS: Can you explain why that is?  Just for people reading this? 7 MS: Oh, sure. 7 So, they had a pretty big psychology department and a lot of full-time psychologists. 5, 7, 8, 14, 16, 19 So, it was still a psychotherapy oriented mental health program. 7, 8, 18 But there were still plenty of folks coming in that had medication. 7, 16, 17 So, they had these psychiatrists come in the evening, you know, it was a consulting job, so you work all day at the VA and you head up to Hazelden for a few hours in the evening, see a bunch of patients and make sure they are okay on their medications or look at the psychotic books or someone that is suicidal and do what is necessary. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 So, that was the bulk of the job.  Then, I knew that the guy who was running the addiction program at the VA was Dick Heilman 6, 8, 9, 12, 15 And, I don't know if Dick is still in St. Paul or not. 7, 17 I don't know if he is alive. 11, 17 I think so.  But Dick was long term recovery guy, really committed to the VA and to Hazelden. 6, 7, 8 So, I worked under him during my fellowship. 8, 12 So, he was actually a mentor too. 18 I should have mentioned him earlier. 12 And he was a mentor in that... really about recovery itself and what people needed spiritually and interpersonally to get there, you know? 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 20 I remember telling me that group therapy was just as important as surgery and you cannot interrupt it. 7, 13, 15, 18 AS: Wow.  MS: Yeah, which I thought was a really nice way of describing just how important the work was, that you are doing with people. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14 That is profound. 11 MS: It is, yeah. 8 And he was always really interested in my life beyond medicine. 6, 7, 8, 10 Like, how was I leading my life and that sort of thing. 7, 8, 19 AS: Like who you were as a person? 10, 17 MS: Yeah, yeah. 8 Exactly.  AS: That's a good mentor. 6, 19 [laughter] 9 AS: I agree. 7 MS: So, I couldn't get a job here, and being born in Seattle, I somehow must have somehow imprinted on the Northwest. 5, 17, 20 And I thought, let's move to the Northwest, it would be fun to go out there. 10, 14 And Linda was game [laughter] and so I was looking for jobs in these psychiatric throw away journal things and there was a little ad for Portland. 5, 6, 9, 15, 19, 20 This little hospital there that was a dual diagnosis hospital, which was unheard of at the time in 1988. 7, 8, 14, 16, 19, 20 But they had a program and they needed a psychiatrist and when I went out and interviewed and everything and they not only wanted me to do in-patient work there, they would set me up in an office right next to the hospital to have a private practice and they could be, like the medical director had this little adolescent program about twenty minutes away. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 So, I had all of these, like three different positions in one job, basically. 7, 14, 17, 18 I didn't understand...  I had to bill you know? 17 To get paid for all of this stuff in the hospital which was all new to me. 6, 8 It all worked out fine because the other guys told me how to do it and who to use if I wanted to or do it myself. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: So, were you... was the adolescent part of the job a surprise to you? 8 Or had you been drawn to it because of that?  But that wasn't described until I got out there for the interview.  It was the dual diagnosis, but the dual diagnosis hospital had both an adolescent and an adult program. 8 So, it was right up my alley. 8, 14 That's how I was trained.  I knew psychiatry, I knew addiction and I got the job. 6, 8, 12, 15 AS: What was that little hospital called? 8, 13, 14, 17, 20 MS: It was Pacific Gateway.  It no longer exists. 7, 20 AS: It got eaten up?  MS: Yeah, by a bunch of condos. 19 AS: Oh, the hospital is even gone? 8, 12 MS: Yeah, it's gone. 12 It was this great program when I was there, run by people who really recognized the necessity of treating both the mental illness and the addiction in concert, you know? 6, 7, 8, 15, 17 In an integrated manner, way back then before people were doing that and they were like writing about it and stuff and teaching all about it all over. 11, 17, 19 And doing some great stuff. 7, 8 So, I just had a ball there, but the hospital was for profit, which I didn't understand at that time. 7, 8, 16, 19 I just wanted a job and didn't know the difference, really. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 AS: So, what did that mean?  MS: Well, it got purchased by another hospital system and then they started to change what was going on, and then was purchased by another on and it got even.... and the program kind of slowly deteriorated, and people started leaving as a result. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 Staffing diminished and then it got purchased by another.  And I had left, to do other things. 5, 8, 19 First, we were only there a year and a half, and we came back here for three years and we lived in Hopkins because I got a job at Hazelden as one of those consultants, but at the adolescent program. 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 So, that was my first job in the system, but it was like twice a week for three hours maybe. 16 AS: And you moved back for that? 11, 14, 17, 19 MS: I know! 17 For a six-hour a week job? 16 MS: It was crazy because I had this great situation going, I moved back to this and I had to pull all of these other jobs together. 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 So, I had a job out in Waverley, a treatment center called Waverley. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18 It was Hubert Humphrey's old home. 7, 16, 17, 19 AS: Yeah, I think there is still one out there. 7 MS: Oh, yeah, yeah, there is. 8 I got a job doing consultation there and at Wayside Women's, I was doing consultation for them. 9 A couple half way houses and a bunch of programs. 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 I was just doing like five or six different consulting jobs a week to get forty hours. 7, 15, 16, 18, 20 You were like a traveling salesman.  I would go and I would do my psychiatric evals for them and help them out and provide medications and therapy.... and I was the only one doing it in a lot of these places, you know? 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20 Because there are no mental health services at a lot of them, and I was it.  So, I got... the good news is as a result, I got a really broad experience, really fast. 6, 7, 8, 15, 19 And I went back to Oregon and just kept doing that kind of thing. 7, 11, 17, 19 I failed to mention, one of the jobs that I got. 15 I moved to Oregon in summer of '88 when I finished training. 7, 8, 11, 14, 17 January '89 a treatment center opened there, called Springbrook. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 Which is now Hazelden's Springbrook. 17 AS: Right, I was going to say, is that the same place? 8, 14 MS: [laughter] 9 So, it opened and they tried to just treat physicians. 7, 20 And within a year and a half went bankrupt doing so. 16 They didn't treat anyone else, only physicians, right. 7, 8, 14 And the doc who was running it was just spending all of this money and not getting enough patience. 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 20 And so, went bankrupt and one of the businessmen who had invested initially, owns the biggest dental supply company in the world, in New Borg, Oregon, right next to Springbrook. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19 He was involved from the start. 6 Then, he bought everybody else out and reopened it and had it as a treatment center for anyone, with a specialty for physicians. 7, 8, 13, 18, 20 AS: Oh, right. 8, 14 MS: And it did much better. 17 I finally realized that I'm not getting anywhere with Hazelden, it's just this six hour a week at most. 7, 10, 15, 16, 20 So, we decide that we love Oregon and that we were going to go back, and we went back. 7, 11, 17, 19 And then I did the same thing there, multiple jobs. 15, 19 Springbrook was one of them, I did Pacific Gateway for a little while, I worked at that adolescent place for a little while, then I worked at a women's program, I worked at a Native American program. 8, 12, 20 I did consulting for the Board of Medical Examiners and you know, on docs who have addiction and stuff like that. 8, 15, 17 And then I did some for the nursing board, too.  Just throwing all of this stuff together, again, trying to get a forty-hour week or whatever. 11, 16, 20 And, [laughter] there still really weren't full time jobs in addiction for docs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 19 Hazelden still didn't have any and even Springbrook. 7 Springbrook and a couple of full-time docs. 7, 16, 19 They had a detox area and they liked more of a medical model, because it was started by a doc, you know. 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17 So, they had a couple, but not psychiatrists. 7, 8 AS: Did they also focus on other professionals like pilots or? 15 People who need like licensing?  Yes.  And it was really kind of a natural that way, because all of the stuff in medicine with licensure issues was similar in the other professions. 6, 7, 8 It worked out really well. 6, 7, 8, 12 And those groups got along well too. 7, 8, 11, 15, 18 There were a lot of similarities.  A bunch of attorneys. 19 AS: Yeah, I had another doctor say that pilots and doctors, like they would rather die than lose their license. 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 Man, absolutely.  AS: That it is so meaningful to their identity...  that threatening that, usually gets people into treatment. 7, 13, 18, 20 MS: It does, it really does. 6, 7, 8 AS: Or that the idea of losing... 5 MS: Both are so highly trained in one thing, that... 11, 19 AS: Right, what would you do?  I know docs who have been working in restaurants and all kinds of stuff, because they have no other skills, really. 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 17 Although, I also know some who did do, that were like techy guys on the side and they had been able to, during a period without a medical license go work for, you know, a tech industry doing something. 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 18 AS: Right.  MS: But, there's not much.  AS: Okay, so are we in the Nineties now? 17 MS: Yup, early to mid-Nineties. 6 AS: And you're still on the West Coast? 7 MS: I moved back here, this is a horrible tale, in some respects. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 Hazelden, right after we moved back to Oregon, six months later I get a call from one of my friends at Hazelden and he says, ""Marv, we finally decided that we want a medical director for the company."" 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 And, I said that I would be interested. 7, 13, 14 I foolishly said that. 13, 14 I just had this struggle with myself and with Linda, you know... 17 AS: Because meanwhile, how old are your children at this point? 7, 9, 10, 16 You have two daughters? 5 MS: A daughter and a son. 5, 17 AS: A daughter and a son, okay. 5, 14, 17 MS: And so, they are in grade school. 11, 19 Second and fourth grade, maybe. 16, 19 And, so '95 I move back. 11, 14, 17, 19 It took nine months for them to decide after I interviewed, and they finally gave me the job. 11, 18 Then we moved back, I only moved back for nine months. 11, 14, 17, 19 The job was so undefined, and I just hardly did anything. 6, 14 I had no oversight of anything and no responsibility for anything. 7 AS: So, you just sat around? 18 [laughter] 9 MS: I saw patients a lot, like a psychiatrist, but nothing else of use to them. 6, 8, 9 It wasn't what I had in mind, and so, I just left and took the family back. 6, 7, 8, 11, 17, 19 They came for just four months. 11, 13, 17 Luckily, the four months was a fall from the start of school to Christmas, and we were back. 6, 11, 17, 19 They were both in grade school at the time and they both just finished the first year of a two year with the same teacher, same classmates. 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 19 So, they missed just one part of that, and they came back to the same classmates, the same teacher and everything just fell right into place. 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 It was really a tough time. 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 19 AS: So, would you say that Hazelden wasn't really ready at that point? 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 18 MS: Yeah, I never... the president at the time, Terry Spicer, I think he talked to me once. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 19 AS: So, they didn't really understand why they should have a medical director? 6, 7, 8, 11 MS: So, I was the first full-time doc hired and I left because they didn't have anything really going. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 And it was really hard to do, to leave. 6, 7, 8 Because I had given up so much to get there and drag my family around the country for a second time. 7, 10, 11, 16, 19, 20 And all because, probably because... and there is still some of this. 7, 12, 13 I'm sure that, because of my own treatment at that place, there was a commitment to it, you know, that otherwise I probably wouldn't have. 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18 And a connection to it. 18 And some, perhaps, even a feeling that I owe them somehow. 13, 17, 18 AS: Interesting. 7 AS: And you were still feeling that twenty years later. 5, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18 Right?  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 8 AS: That is pretty powerful. 5, 7, 14 MS: I mean I didn't get sober right after treatment, but they opened my eyes... and they kind of gave me my life. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 20 right, right, the place. 8, 14 MS: So, yeah it is really powerful. 6, 7, 8 And so now I get to live in Oregon and work for Hazelden. 7, 11, 17, 20 AS: So, how did that happen? 5 MS: So, in '95, nine months in that job. 11 I am the medical director of Hazelden. 7, 11 And at the time, just a couple sites. 7, 16, 19 Minnesota, Center City and Plymouth, and St. Paul, and then we had a place in Florida at the time, as well. 7, 8, 16, 19 And I was the medical director of all of that. 7, 11 So, basically the same job that I have now... 14, 17 AS: Wait, that was the job you left that was so.... unfulfilling? 8, 19 MS: Yeah, yeah. 8 Cause they had no idea what they were doing, at the time. 5, 7, 16, 19 With a doc, you know? 17 So, we go back to Oregon, same situation. 7, 11, 17, 19 AS: You go back to doing all of the consulting, piecing... 11, 17, 19 MS: Yeah, piecing all of this together, and the private practice that kept growing. 5, 6, 11, 16, 20 It got really big which was kind of neat. 6, 7, 8 AS: Yeah, well I bet by that point you were also a special kind of psychiatrist, if people weren’t able to get... 8, 10, 18, 20 That's true.  People started to recognize their needs, yeah. 6, 7, 8, 15 AS: But did you continue that model of talking, spending more time talking with your patients, than just prescribing them medicine. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 19 MS: Yeah, so, about half of my time I was spending doing psychotherapy and the other half doing medications and still, talking more than my peers were, with patients on medication, so it was really nice. 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 AS: Right, right. 8, 14 So, I can see why that would make you popular. 5, 18 MS: Yeah, yeah, and people come to me and say ""I go to my doc and he sees me for five minutes and just gives me a prescription, and you talk to me. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17 So, I'm coming back."" 7, 11, 17, 19 I heard that repeatedly. 7, 14 AS: Oh, I'm sure. 7 I'm sure. 7 MS: And I also did psychotherapy for real, you know. 7, 17, 18 AS: Right, it wasn't just trying to be nice and listen patiently for a few minutes. 14 MS: So that went well and then, I was kind of involved behind the scenes, telling folks at Hazelden, that same guy who asked me to come back for that job, he became like a COO at Hazelden. 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, 19 They didn't call him that. 14, 17 And he and I were talking, and I said, ""You know, the guy who owns Spring Brook is kind of interesting in selling it."" 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19 It was that guy who owns this big dental company, and he just kind of lost interest. 6, 7 He was in recovery, that's why he did it, but now he just wanted to get rid of it. 7, 8, 14, 17, 20 And no one was buying it. 12, 20 So, I said, ""You guys outta consider it. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 It's a great program."" 7, 8 So, he came out and looked and then they never did anything about it. 13, 17 And then a new president came in, who was just there a year. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17 It didn't work out well, and the board, you know, kind of got rid of him. 8, 17 I don't know the details, but he came out to visit. 7, 13, 17 I talked to him a lot about it and he thought it was a good idea. 5, 6, 10, 13, 19 So, he decided to buy it. 8, 20 And we're a non-profit and they were a for-profit, so it required all of this juggling about that, legally. 7 But, while he was there, he brought Linda and I out for supper with he and his wife and he asked me if I'd consider coming back as the medical director. 7, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 I said that I will if I can stay here and do it from here. 13, 14 And he said sure. 7, 13, 14 And he came out of hospital administration, so he really knew docs and medicine and he had a whole different perspective on how to run Hazelden and we had never had a person like that. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18 AS: And you said he only lasted for a year at Hazelden? 13, 14, 16 MS: Yeah, only a year. 16 But it was mostly interpersonal stuff that didn't work out. 5, 10, 17 It was problematic stuff, not because of his perspective. 7 Yeah, unfortunate stuff, but sometimes it happens that I can't mention. 5, 7, 12, 16, 19 AS: That's fine, I understand. 14 MS: But so, he asked me one day if I would be interested, and the next day, I have the job. 7, 16, 19 So, it went from nine months that first time, to overnight and I had the job. 7, 11, 16, 19 MS: And they didn't replace me when I left in 1995. 7, 8, 19 This is 2001 when they purchased Spring Brook and they get me. 20 AS: And they hadn't replaced you in that whole time from 1995... 7, 8, 16, 19 they didn't have a medical director? 7, 11 AS: Marv, that is just a crazy story. 13 So, I become the medical director, well now I am the chief medical officer. 7, 8, 11, 17, 18 They changed the title, but it is the same job, it is just bigger now. 5, 6, 17 So, I'm going back and forth. 5, 11, 17, 19 The day I start my job, they invited me out to a board meeting, and that was my start day. 6, 19 And I get to Center City and walking toward the board meeting I run into a board member, Ellen Brier, and we're just talking, and I've never met her, we're walking to the meeting, and the guy who hired me is not there. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 20 And they announced that he is no longer at the organization. 7, 20 This is my first day on the job. 16, 19 And Ellen Brier, the woman who I just met walking in, is the interim CEO. 6, 12 Ellen Brier has never been a CEO of anything, has no health care experience, comes from Godiva Chocolate. 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 AS: [laughter] 9 Oh my gosh.  MS: So, I start when she starts. 6 So, this goes on and she is... one of my neighbors in Oregon, I did a lot as a neighbor and then we did a lot of fishing together, and he was a CEO of an international computer firm out of LA and then they had moved to Phoenix. 7, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20 He was doing basically what I was doing, working elsewhere. 7, 8, 14, 17 I asked him if he would help me out as a business mentor and he did, and after a couple of years, probably three years, he told me that I needed to get out of there because she was going to run the company into the ground. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20 And I couldn't do it, I just held on until 2007, really trying to emphasize quality of care and outcome measures of our patients. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 17, 20 We gotta know that what we are doing work and we gotta prove that it works and be able to stand on that. 8, 17, 18 AS: How was that received? 7 MS: It was well received by the clinical people, you know? 7, 8, 17 But, not necessarily by her and her ideas for the organization. 5 She was more focused on the money and didn't really want to put money into doing something like that. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 19 AS: She didn't want to put money into you all proving or trying to study whether what you were doing was working? 5, 7, 12, 14, 19 MS: And we were already doing some outcome studies, but I wanted to really enhance that... 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 18 AS: You wanted to do that because you were trained in science. 14 MS: Yeah, yeah. 8 AS: But you're saying that it was the leadership at the time, not the culture of the 12-Step Minnesota Model? 7, 14, 16, 19 MS: Correct. 7 Yeah, and I will admit, the councilors in general...  I'm blocking out the word for it...  It was like an apprenticeship program. 7, 8 AS: Right, the peer training. 8 Alcohol and drug counselors, that's their whole history. 10, 13, 20 MS: Yeah, they had a whole certification program at the time and you just kind of come and become an apprentice for a year and then you could be a counselor and get licensed and everything. 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 It was an oral tradition.  AS: Right, like a peer coach.  MS: But there wasn't much in the way of academics associated with it.  Nothing like the grad school now, but the training program started in the mid, I think '64. 6, 8, 11, 15, 17 It's old and established. 16 But, without the academics, there was not a learning culture at Hazelden. 5, 7 Coming out of Mayo and the University of Minnesota, I mean, there are lectures every day, all day long you could go to on all of these different specialties, diseases, all this stuff. 7, 18, 19 And that sort of culture wasn't in place, and they were kind of just resting on their morals and starting this Minnesota Model and all these remarkable things that they had done, but they weren't really pushing anything that was new. 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 I was wanting to do that. 14 I thought about... 10 I left in 2007, and before I left, I was thinking to myself that we really outta consider this medicine, the only one for opioid use disorder. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19 AS: You mean methadone?  MS: Suboxone. 12 Methadone was available, but that is so highly regulated and [not-audible] and Suboxone was just coming around and I thought maybe we should consider it. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18 I had already been involved in really driving medicine for alcohol use disorders, only Naltrexone and Antabuse and then Acamprosate were used. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18 AS: Acamprosate?  MS: Yeah, it is another medicine for alcohol. 8, 10 It hardly ever works, maybe ten percent of people? 6, 8, 13, 16 When I say that, just today we had a lecture by video by one of the leading researchers down at Mayo. 5, 7, 12, 14, 19 A cancer researcher who now is a genetics researcher actually, really an internal medicine doc. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 18 For cancer research, he started using genomic and metabolomics to try and figure out responses to medications and who would respond to what. 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16 So, he did that for antidepressants and now he is helping out in the psychiatry and addiction department. 7, 8, 15, 17, 18 And we applied with them to [inaudible 58:33] alcohol abuse and alcoholism for a grant to study Acamprosate for alcoholics to see if we can define biologic markers that would predict response. 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 AS: Wow, that is so interesting. 7, 9 MS: Because if ten percent respond, and they respond well of those that respond, it works. 7, 8 But, say you were an alcoholic.... 10, 13, 14 Here try this, you have a ten percent chance.  MS: It probably won't work, but if it works it will work great. 7, 8, 12, 13 Who wants to do that? 6, 14 It's expensive and you gotta take it three times a day, well that's not going to happen. 5, 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 AS: No. MS: But, if we could define who it works for, and you could just do a blood test and you can go, ""Hey, this will work for you."", that's a big deal. 8, 13, 14 It'll take four or five or six years. 16, 20 We just started... 6, 15 AS: Wow, that's great. 7, 8 MS: Yeah, it's really neat. 6, 7, 8 AS: Okay, so 2007 you leave.  You were already thinking about why don't we use these... because at that time, we're already seeing the consequences of overprescribing of opioid pain pills. 5, 6, 7, 9, 16, 18, 19 And you were on the West Coast.  MS: I was doing lectures about it. 7 AS: Right.  MS: And ASAM even, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, I described the stuff that was going on.  And no one was listening. 12 Cause you could see in the national data trends, we were starting to see it within Hazelden with the number of people with opioid use disorders is increasing. 5, 6, 7, 9, 14 People at Hazelden and people on the ground, they were recognizing it. 7 We're talking about it. 6 I'm trying to bring attention to it and give them lectures about it and writing, not articles for research or anything, but just writing about it and doing interviews about it. 6, 7, 11, 12 People were not paying any attention. 6, 18 So, I go out to Portland.  I needed a job, and a couple of nurse-practitioners I knew had just started to work with a woman who ran a home health service and they were going to do detox in people's homes. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19 Which is done in the UK and in Australia, it's really common. 6, 7, 8 And so, I thought that'd be really interesting. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 I'll work with them and we can also start an out-patient program, because those people will need treatment. 6, 7, 8, 13, 18 You can't just detox them.  So, we'll do out patient, help with the detox, figure out how to do this and see if we can prove it useful and convince insurers to use it. 5, 7, 9, 18 It'll be cheaper in the home, if we do it right. 8, 14, 17, 19 So, we got all of that going, but I decided in the out-patient program that we would do Suboxone, Vivitrol wasn't available, Naltrexone hadn't been approved for opioid use disorders yet, it had for alcoholism, so I started prescribing that, and convincing the councilors who were all from Spring Brook, basically. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 AS: They were your councilors that you had worked with at Hazelden? 12 MS: Yeah, we stole them kind of.  And they came to work for us. 13, 17 They decided it would be more fun to try and get a new program off the ground and I convinced them that we should do this thing where we provide a real 12-Step, abstinence-based treatment programming, just like you normally would, just like background in treatment is, with the use of suboxone, this new medication for opioid use disorders because it looks really promising. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I think we should try this.  And initially, they were just aghast that anyone would want to give that medication to patients, but after a few patients, and the whole excitement of getting it going, they just got totally supported. 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 20 AS: Because they were seeing really good results? 5, 6, 7, 8, 19 Yeah, people kind of settled down...  I mean it wasn't all good. 6, 19 There were problems and people didn't keep coming and abused their Suboxone or whatever. 7, 9, 12, 17 There was a whole gamut of things happening, but most people did well. 5, 7, 8, 19 And so, we established that program and I did it for two years. 8, 16 And unfortunately, the woman who had that in-home health company that owned this whole thing, basically was going bankrupt. 14, 17, 19 And not telling us and trying to just... she was just a mess kind of. 13 All of the sudden, it was in dire straits. 7, 17 At the same time, Mark Mishuck had been hired at Hazelden. 7, 16, 19 MS: He is our CEO.  AS: Oh, okay. 14 MS: Yeah, sorry.  [laughter] 9 It's okay! 14 You shouldn't know. 17 AS: Sorry, I didn't study up on that! 5 [laughter] 9 You never know what I remembered and might have picked up. 5, 7, 13, 15, 17 MS: So, I get a call from his assistant, Karen Colander. 7, 14, 17, 20 Karen is an old friend, I've known her for fifteen years or something. 7, 12, 13, 16, 17 And she says, ""Marv, Mark is coming out to the northwest and he wants to meet with you. 6, 7, 14, 17 So, he and his wife want to take you and Linda out for supper."" 12, 14, 20 AS: Here it comes. 17 MS: And I'm thinking, why does he want to talk to me? 6, 14 And she doesn't know. 17 She says, ""I don't know."" 14, 17 And I'm thinking well maybe he just wants to know the history or something that I know. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 Honestly, that's what went through my head. 6, 12 And cause when I left, I forgot to tell you this, when I left, the woman who was CEO, Ellen, was absolutely furious with me for leaving. 8, 13, 19 And, I also told the board why I was leaving, I wrote them a letter that, she's doing this, and my thoughts are quality. 10, 13, 16 If we're going to make money, we have to, but we gotta have a quality program. 7, 8, 12, 18 AS: Right.  MS: And I'm being roadblocked for trying to accomplish these things. 5, 19 So, that of course wasn't the brightest thing to do. 8, 13, 14, 19 I had never left a job and I didn't know how, and I did that. 8, 13, 17, 19 AS: Right, and then she read the letter. 7 MS: Right, of course.  She withheld my mail, she told people they couldn't email or call me. 13, 14, 16, 17 AS: Wow.  MS: Oh yeah, she was really upset. 6, 7, 8 But, within a year, she was fired by the board. 7, 16 And then they had an interim, and then they hire Mark who comes out of hospital administration, and he is in recovery. 7, 8, 17 And so, he is coming out and I am working in this program, but it is going bankrupt and I am trying to figure out what I am going to do next, but I've got a bit of a private practice starting and I can't keep things afloat. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 19, 20 And he comes out, and half way through the meal after we have just been talking about addiction and treatment and Hazelden and all of that, he offers me my old job back. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 [laughter] 9 AS: You can't get away from the place! 8, 20 Actually, one of my peers, Val Sleighmaker who oversees the grad school and research and stuff, she tells me it is my Hotel California. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 18 [laughter] 9 AS: Seriously!  [laughter] 9 That's really good actually. 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 That's very poetic of her.  So, I tell them that I'll do it and I'll move back to Minnesota, because I think I better in order to get this done right. 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 But Linda says, ""Okay, I don't really want to leave Oregon."" 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 AS: For the third time... 7, 16, 19, 20 MS: We both love it there. 17 I know! 17 So, she kind of stays at home and fixes up our master bedroom and master bath, which the realtor said we should do. 7, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19 It's 2009 and the downturn has already started. 6, 7, 15, 18 And she does that, takes about six months and she's going to sell the house, while I am already out here, and the house is worth even less than before we did that. 6, 7, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20 So, we say the heck with this, this is okay, it's not that bad living apart, we'll just do it a little longer and see what happens. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 20 So, she stays in Oregon and I was here in Minnesota first living in Center City and then in White Bear, just renting. 6, 7, 14, 16, 19 First, I was living in a friend's house, they just let me stay there because they moved to the Southwest. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14 Whenever they visited, I would just get out for a week or whatever. 7, 13, 16, 20 And then, it went on for almost four years living like that. 6, 15, 16 AS: That's hard. 6 MS: And finally, I just told Mark, my boss and CEO, this is just too much. 13, 16 I have to do something different. 7, 18 And about at the same time we were starting to negotiate with Betty Ford, so we would have a bigger presence on the West Coast, and he agreed that I should just be able to work out there and work out of the office there and come here regularly. 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19 And that's what I've done since.  Before I left in 2000... 8, 19 yeah, before I left, we hired our first full-time psychiatrist. 7, 8, 16, 19 For here in Minnesota.  MS: Yeah, Steve.  Here in Center City.  Springbrook had full time people. 7, 16, 19 And I had worked there full time for a period of time before I was hired by Hazelden that first time, or that second time. 7, 12, 16, 19 [laughter] 9 AS: That's okay. 14 We'll try to make a timeline or something. 7, 16, 18, 19 I'll get your CV. 20 MS: [laughter] 9 So, basically, when I was talking with Mark about coming back, I said that I have been doing this in-home detox stuff which is exciting, but more exciting is that I have been dealing with opioids and I think we ought to consider this and go down this path with Suboxone. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 And he says, ""That makes sense to me."" 9, 14, 17, 18 And he comes out of hospital administration. 8, 17 Of course, it makes sense, a doctor tells me, ""Here is the research and here is my experience."" 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20 AS: And here's what we need to do!  MS: And it was still not getting attention nationally. 6, 7, 15, 20 I mean it was, but it wasn't.  I come back and finally, it's kind of exploding, and I am still talking about it. 6, 7, 11, 17, 19 And we haven't done anything yet, I gotta do all kinds of other stuff as well, getting back involved there and getting some things taken care of. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 And then, I decided let's do it. 8 And I had to convince the board because it is really controversial for our group. 6, 7, 8, 18 AS: I'm sure. 7 MS: I would bet about half of the board or more were older alcoholics in recovery and had biases about medicines, like buprenorphine. 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16 AS: Right, any medicine. 8 MS: Yeah, oh yeah. 8 But we already had full mental health services with full-time psychiatrists now. 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: So, people understood that there was a need for psychiatric-based medications. 16 MS: Yeah, and they'd already gotten the medicines for alcoholism in place before I had left. 6, 7, 8, 10, 18, 19 AS: At Hazelden?  AS: Oh, I didn't know that you guys were doing that. 6, 8, 15, 17 MS: Yeah, so the foundation... 11 Yeah, we did that around 2003 maybe. 16 So, Naltrexone came along, we decided to do that, with rare use of... 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17 Oh god, what's the stuff that makes you puke if you drink. 9, 18, 19 AS: Anifuse. 9 MS: Anifuse, yeah. 8, 9 We hardly ever use it because it is so dangerous in a way, and then Acamprosate came later, so we added that. 5, 6, 9, 13, 16, 17 We had already established that. 6, 7, 18 I came back and started to talk about this. 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 The board chair at the time was a catholic priest from inner-city Minneapolis. 7, 16, 19 He had been a really high-level administrative priest and then kind of got that out of the way in his career and then kind of went to real street level type work. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 20 A lot with the homeless and with other organizations like that. 17, 19 Father Michael Connell.  And he was wonderful.  Because of his experience with all of that, he had seen the opioid crisis. 5, 13, 15 He was also in recovery, but he had seen it for what it was in inner city Minneapolis. 5, 7, 8, 13 He thought that we should do this too and was really supportive. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 So, I had the support of the CEO and the support of the board chair, spent a bunch of time educating the board, and then they voted unanimously to support doing this and going down this path. 7, 9, 16, 19 MS: It was probably 2011 when they actually supported doing it. 9, 12, 13, 18 So, I started my plan in January of 2012 and pulled that team together and we took people from all parts of clinical from all sites on that team to kind of get this figured out for the organization. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 Initially, one of the councilors who I asked to be on this team, he said to me when I asked him, ""Is this a good career move, Marv?"" 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 19, 20 Because no one knew. 6, 12 Yeah, should I even be on this team if I am going to be suggesting that we use this medicine in this organization, what's going to happen to me? 5, 8, 9 And others, I got a four-page, single-spaced email from one of our councilors in St. Paul. 7, 15 Because it had leaked out, this was about a month and a half project with the team. 5, 16 We we're communicating about it, we were just planning to figure it out. 7 We were actually just reading the literature. 7, 18 AS: Right.  MS: Right, and I had already done it in that outpatient program. 6, 7, 8, 18 Basically, the whole model was already established in the outpatient program and we're just going to put it into Hazelden, kinda. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 18, 19 And yet, I had to convince people of it's worth, so I thought I would just use the literature. 7, 9, 10, 15 It made a huge difference, because I had everybody read a couple of papers about the early research on Suboxone and how it was working for people and they came back and had to present their two papers and everybody did their two papers, or three or whatever. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 And they were all like, wow, this is kind of hard to refute when you read this stuff and you hear all of this. 6, 7, 9, 14 So, it made it huge difference. 7, 13 AS: What was the four-page email? 15 MS: Oh, sorry.  It was why we should not do this and about, maybe two and a half years ago now the woman who wrote it came up to me at one of our leadership meetings, basically the one we are having tomorrow and gave me a big hug and actually, with a tear in her eye, said ""Thank god that you had us do this. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 It works so well."" 8 [laughter] 9 Yeah, so it was wonderful because I didn't pick people that I thought would support it, I picked people I thought could get it done and decided that the research itself and my experience should help, you know win the day of whether we should do it or not. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 We already had the board approval, so we were going to do it. 6, 7, 18 AS: Right, and... it's happening. 5, 7 MS: Are you going to get on board or not? 20 And I had one of our main kind of national speakers, Fred Ulmquist, ran the renewal center at the lodge at the time and Fred is like an AA, Twelve-Step professor. 6, 7, 16, 19 AS: [laughter] 9 MS: Also, his parents were professors and he wore bowties and he teaches like a professor, you know, he just does. 7, 12, 17 And he's wonderful and really bright. 6, 7, 8, 14 I've known him a long time, we're old friends and we've worked together on the alcohol medication thing. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I asked him if he would help because I wanted to have his AA-cred for the staff, of course we're doing the right thing. 8, 14, 18, 19 So, Fred comes along, and he get on the team too, for the Suboxone, and Fred's wife, I'd known this but forgotten, Fred's wife Paige was in recovery from heroin use. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20 And Fred was also in recovery, not from heroin. 7, 8, 10 So, he knew that whole side of heroin and he said ""Absolutely, I want to be involved in this. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 I want to help."" 14, 18 And Fred, there's a book ""The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions"" and the third tradition, there is a description, a full paragraph, of all of the people who really early kind of established when they went to AA who should not come to these meetings. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20 And there is a whole list, includes ""fallen women"", whatever that is. 11, 12 AS: Yeah, that's classic. 6, 12 MS: And then on the next page or two, it says we realize that to limit anyone from coming, could possibly sentence them to death and they decided against any limitations. 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 And Fred had brought that to our team, which we used throughout anything we did. 5, 7, 9, 20 AS: When people would start to push back? 6, 11, 17, 19 MS: Even before, we just had Fred get up and describe that and say, ""Hey, we are going to do this, and we need to. 7, 14, 20 This is a precedent set by the founders of AA."" 7, 11 [laughter] 9 And there's no limitations to medication that are described in AA. 16 AS: Why do you think that that myth persists?  Because I hear so many stories of people who've struggled with whether they tell their sponsor that they are on Suboxone or on Methadone, because there is still this idea that... 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18 Why does this myth persist if it is in the traditions?  MS: There's even a pamphlet from AA about medical care and the use of medication and it says that it is between you and your doctor. 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20 MS: I think it's because historically, the medical profession has addicted a lot of people to a lot of different medications and sold a lot of medications as if they were not addicting. 7, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: So, there is basically a distrust of the medical profession, which I understand in the history of medicine very well. 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17 MS: Okay, that's it.  That's the main reason, that's why it has nothing to do with the treatment of addiction and alcoholism. 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 AS: Not for a long time. 7, 16, 19 MS: Yeah, and finally they start to. 6 But during my residency training, one of the other faculty members in psychiatry was studying Xanax for alcoholism and saying it was a safe mediation. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 MS: Yeah, and people back then thought so. 10, 11, 17, 19 Not that long before that, TIME Magazine's cover was ""Cocaine is not addictive"". 7, 15 And I knew it was, I used cocaine. 6, 9, 10, 12 AS: Right, it's like smoking cigarettes isn't bad for you. 7, 10 MS: My god! 9 It was really addictive. 6, 7, 8, 15 And, you know, all of us within recovery knew this stuff was so terrible. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17 So, I think that that was what it was.  A distrust. 6 And there was a real distrust in Methadone, even though it was remarkably useful. 6, 7, 9, 12 Well, because it got associated with crime and inner-cities and people of color.  But also, most of that was because of the for-profit methadone maintenance programs that were established and still are all over the place. 7, 8 Because once you get someone on methadone, they keep coming back and you get money from them. 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 And they are for profit?  There are some that are not-for-profit, most of them are for-profit.  And they don't provide all of the services that are supposed to be done in methadone. 14 Yeah, so all of these wrap around services, well not in those programs. 8 They hand out methadone all day long and that's it. 7, 13, 19 AS: Well, that's another extreme that is just as, I think, just as problematic as just saying ""Twelve Steps are going to heal you."" 7, 14 ... from opioids. 5 Absolutely.  And every time they have looked at people that are on long-term methadone and they stop, they relapse. 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19 Well, if you've got nothing else but methadone, of course you are going to relapse! 7, 8, 10, 12 AS: Right, right. 8, 14 If your life still is horrible... things are the same. 5, 7, 8, 19 So, I've always... 10 that was the beauty of suboxone.  Is that, it's not under the same regulatory requirements as methadone, so you can do it right from your office, which was fantastic. 7, 8, 14, 18 AS: Right.  MS: You don't have to have all of the licensure for methadone either, which is really onerous. 6, 7, 8, 12 And our board, there was still bias about methadone and I had had experience in a couple of different methadone maintenance programs. 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18 One, my training at the VA and one, I consulted at and did psychiatric work for in downtown Portland. 8 So, I knew that there was a real utility to methadone, and I had seen the research. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13 It was kind of like... but I also knew a lot of people who had a history of heroin, who were sober in NA and either had used methadone for a period of time and stopped or had never done it and now were sober. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 So, I had that experience too, that it is not absolutely necessary. 15 But in our setting, there was no way that we would have done methadone.  AS: Right, I totally understand that.  MS: Partially, because of the onerous nature of the regulatory system. 7, 12 And we do this in people's offices, and we knew that they could get the care later, easily. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 So, vivitrol had been approved so we said we were going to do both medications. 13, 14, 16 I didn't have experience with vivitrol from that practice, because it wasn't approved when I was there, so this is new, but it makes so much sense to use both. 6, 9, 15, 18 So, we decide that's what we're going to do right from the beginning. 8, 14 AS: You mean to offer both?  AS: Yeah, so people could have a choice.  It is always nice to have a choice among medications, for any illness. 10, 14, 16 And for docs, that's better to have the opportunity for more than one or two... but the guy who asked me if this was a good career move, and Fred, who was our AA professor and I, decided that the three of us would do training forums around the organization about this whole program that we are putting together. 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 Doing that mainly.  And the first one we did was at Center City. 16 It was in our biggest room in the grad school, and there were over one hundred people there, standing along... and we're thinking, in preparation we were thinking that we need flak jackets because... 7, 9, 11, 15, 17 [laughter] everything, this is going to be awful. 7, 9 But we each talked briefly, about five to ten minutes each and then we opened it up for discussion because we wanted a forum, we wanted an interaction, we didn't just want lecture about this. 6, 7, 13, 14, 20 So, I went first and talked about the medication, which, you know, I just had to get it out there and describe both medications and why, and a little information about the research. 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 And then Scott the councilor talked about, you know, how it would affect treatment and what we would do that way. 6, 7, 13, 17, 18 And then Fred talked about why we should do this, even in a Twelve Step based program. 6, 7, 8, 13 AS: Right.  MS: And he used the stuff from the Third Tradition. 9 [aside] My phone has gone off a couple of times.... 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19 It's Linda, it is probably nothing. 12, 13 [laughter] 9 But so, the first run, all of these people, Scott in his section right after me, I led the meds, he says, ""How many people here have had a patient here die of an overdose after treatment?"" 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 Three quarters of the room raised their hands. 5, 9, 13 Now, there was a lot of overlap among those.  One patient could have been ten people, you know. 17 AS: Right, but it was a person who they had touched... who they had been working with. 10, 17 MS: Right, three quarters of the room. 9 And you could hear a pin drop. 14 It made our whole argument, in one question. 13, 15 Then Fred talks, and we open it up for discussion and I'm thinking, okay, here it comes. 6, 7, 14, 17, 20 We get softball question after softball question and support for this program and that we need to change that people are dying. 5, 8, 9, 15, 20 You know, ""This makes so much sense."" 9, 17, 18 Somehow, we're going to do it, type questions. 15 And then, we're ten or fifteen minutes into the questions and one of our most conservative councilors raised their hand and I am thinking, now it's going to start, this is the flapjack. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 17 And she stands up and she says, ""My daughter,"" she was twenty-eight or something, ""went to residential treatment three times for heroin, relapsed after each treatment right away, could not get sober until she started taking suboxone. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 And now she has been sober three years, she's part of my family again, she now takes of her children and I don't have to anymore, she has a job, and she is doing wonderfully."" 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 19, 20 And no one knew. 6, 12 She hadn't told anyone. 13, 16 And she just got up and gave this testimonial and it was like, we couldn't have asked for anything better to say and it was just from the most unlikely person in the room, just this big book thumping woman who, who no one ever thought would ever support this. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 And it was the most incredible description of the utility of this medication that you could ever hear. 7, 13, 14, 16 And her daughter went to AA, right? 5, 8, 14 And took the medicine. 8 It turned the entire conversation... there wasn't any griping, let alone absolutely anarchy. 7, 12, 18 There were certainly pockets of people who didn't agree, but they didn't talk in that meeting and they kind of got silent as we went down this path and just silently just tried to disrupt things. 5, 6, 7, 14, 19 It was amazing.  It was the absolute opposite of what we were expecting. 7 AS: That's incredible. 7 MS: Yeah, and it told me, once again, the passion of our counseling staff, our clinical staff-- our docs and nurses as well and councilors --- is so tremendous. 7, 8, 13, 16, 17 They just want to do what is right for our patients. 8, 14, 15 And we finally said, here's what we should do for this particular group of patients, and... [aside conversation about incoming phone call]. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 AS: So, what would you say... 14 So, I know that you did, just in the interest of time, you did a webinar, this is how I started to reach out to you, because you did a webinar about what has happened in the few years since you started. 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 17, 19 Okay, so I could watch that and then get a lot of your answers. 15, 20 MS: Okay, yeah, that would tell you how we did and what our early results were. 6, 7, 8, 13 AS: Okay, that is good to know. 6, 17, 19 What would you say...? 14 I have a couple things. 5, 7, 19 What would you say to people who still say, ""Hazelden is a dinosaur.""? 7, 14 MS: [laughter] 9 I laugh, nowadays because man... 17, 18, 19 AS: You must have heard that. 7, 14 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 AS: And this is in the context of the opioid epidemic. 5 MS: We were talking about it this morning actually, because a couple of our folks who are out on the East Coast, I don't know if they are in Rhode Island or in Connecticut, and they are talking with the executive director of the AAA, the American Association of Addiction Psychiatrists. 6, 7, 9, 14, 17, 18 And this person in this group that we are talking to, they think that we are a dinosaur, that we're just living in the past. 6, 8, 10, 17, 18 They have no idea what we were doing. 5 They had no idea about Core Twelve, they know nothing about our treatment, they just made all of these assumptions based on twenty years ago and what we were like. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 As if somehow, we had never changed. 5, 6, 13, 17 You know? 17 And they were able to tell them all of this stuff, and when they left, they said, ""Oh my God. 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 We had no idea."" 5 Thanks for coming. 7 AS: Yeah, thanks for showing up. 9 MS: [laughter] 9 Yeah, so now I tell them about Core Twelve, about the research project that we have completed that we are trying to get published. 7, 12, 13, 17 We still haven't heard from the publisher. 7, 14 We submitted the paper and asked for the edits, we submitted the edits.  AS: To which publisher?  To a scientific journal?  MS: Yeah, Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment. 7, 9 The right one, right? 8, 12, 14 [laughter] 9 AS: Yeah, you picked the right one there. 5, 8, 12, 14 MS: Yeah, so we're hopeful. 13 It was a naturalistic study, so it didn't have double-blind controls with the medications, which it a bit unfortunate for a study because you don't have the controls that you might want. 5, 10, 14, 16, 20 But we were told when talking to several researchers that both medicines have been adequately approved to be effective, we just need to see what they are like in practice. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16 AS: So, what does that mean, naturalistic?  MS: That the patients get to choose which medicine, we don't force that on them. 8, 15, 20 AS: You don't demand that?  Because that's what I... reading that short piece from 2013, that patients can continue to choose, if they want just abstinence or if they want one of these drugs. 7, 10, 14, 15, 19 MS: And that's still the case. 7 And we recommend that they take one of the two medications. 7, 16, 20 AS: But how much... okay, okay. 14 MS: Every single person with an opioid use disorder, we recommend the medication. 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17 They can refuse it. 7, 9 That's the deal.  MS: You can't force it on them, we can, and we do continue to try and convince them, because this conversation is right when they get into treatment during detox it starts. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 And we're continuing to try and tell them to try the medicines. 8, 13 We will their family, not necessarily successfully because a lot of the times, family are not involved at all and they don't want anything to do with the person anymore, or, they just... 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19 ""We didn't bring them there for that.""  Especially that suboxone stuff, because there are real biases about it. 7, 12 And we have to do a lot of education about it there, and even then, they might say that we're not going to support that. 9, 14 ""We just want them sober."" 14 AS: Have you noticed a difference between what happens at Plymouth versus Center City, in terms of opioid addiction? 5, 7, 8, 15 MS: To a degree. 7, 19 One of the main things, the one big difference we noticed right of the bat, is that some of the younger people especially misused suboxone on the street. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 19, 20 And some of them, to me that's not a big deal, if it's just that they are using suboxone... 10 AS: But they are trying to use it between? 9 MS: Yeah, detoxing themselves...  But if they are injecting it or something, that would suggest that we're not going to give it to them. 11 Because people certainly do that. 14 AS: How do you inject suboxone?  It's a liquid?  It is a liquid, well you can turn it into a liquid really easily. 6, 7, 8 AS: Because it's the little sublingual... 20 MS: Yeah, it's either a tablet or a film. 18 You just put some warm water on it, and it goes right into a solution. 8, 14, 19 But also, you're not supposed to be able to inject it because it's got Naloxone in it, it's supposed to block your receptors and put you into withdrawal. 7, 14, 18, 19 Suboxone is really tightly bound to those receptors and might not let that happen. 5, 6, 7, 8 It's really a weird thing. 6, 7, 8, 19 Yeah, so some people actually do inject it and get high off of it. 11, 18, 20 Most people don't try for that reason. 7, 10, 17 AS: What are you guys doing with Naloxone and Narcan? 6, 8, 12, 15 MS: We give that to every patient that has an opioid use disorder. 5, 9, 11 AS: When they leave?  AS: When did you start doing that? 6 MS: At the latter part of installing this whole system. 8 So, it's been going on for quite a while now. 17 What else? 8 Shoot.  AS: Sorry, I interrupted you.  MS: I can't remember what I was going to say, that's okay. 7, 13, 14, 15 AS: That's bad oral history. 13 It's a violation.  MS: [laughter] 9 AS: I'm in trouble now. 17 [Aside, moving cat away from interview] 9, 20 MS: I can't remember what I was going to say, but when we went public about this, we got just lambasted by other treatment programs and, especially, Twelve 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 Step program type treatment. 7, 8, 13, 18 AS: By saying that you were going to use medication? 9, 14, 16 They said we were... 13, 14 We heard form a real kind of prominent AA person in the Twin Cities that were ruining AA. 7, 10, 14, 17 We were told we were turning our back on our entire heritage and ruining the treatment field, that we were, and me in particular, were ruining Hazelden. 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 AS: Is this a public document? 11 MS: There was some in the media, but I don't know. 17 You would have to ask Jeramiah.  He might be able to dig some of that stuff up. 18 AS: Who is Jeramiah?  MS: Jeramiah Gardner is our PR person. 10, 17 AS: Oh, okay. 14 Well because that is kind of the opposite of what I was... 7 That's the opposite of some of the things that I have heard. 5, 7, 14, 19 MS: And now it's changed. 5, 6, 17 Now it's really switched. 6, 7, 8 AS: No, but I mean that you weren't doing enough. 16, 20 MS: Oh, sure. 7 AS: And when you do it, you're criticized by people for not doing enough. 16, 20 MS: It was both, we were getting both. 15, 20 AS: But, let's talk about that for a second... 6, 16 Oh, go ahead. 12 MS: In the same month, I was told that we were ruining addiction treatment of this type, you know Twelve Step, abstinence-based treatment, and it's not going to work what we are doing, by one person from a different treatment program. 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 And a couple weeks later, told by a doc in St. Paul that we weren't giving enough people Buprenorphine and we shouldn't even be giving Vivitrol to anybody. 5, 7, 13, 16, 20 And neither were true at the time, he just was making assumptions and of course, the other one wasn't true either. 7, 12, 16, 19 It was ridiculous.  And that was just constant for a while, that sort of stuff. 8 In spite of the fact that we were doing...  We were the first of the major addiction treatment programs to do this. 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18 We weren't this first program to do it, but we were the first to write about it and the first to get it out there in the media, to really bring attention to that issue. 6, 7, 8, 16, 20 I have trained all kinds of people who were from other treatment programs, some of whom couldn't even tell their treatment program when they were coming to visit us and learn about this. 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 18 Yeah, they didn't dare. 7 Some who were trying to convince their board that we should do this, but you know, they couldn't and still wanted to learn how we were doing it and stuff like that. 5, 7, 14, 17 It was really weird. 6, 7, 8 I didn't really care, because we were doing what we needed to do, and it was so exciting. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 AS: For your patients. 15 MS: Yeah, and patients were getting better, and it was really useful and wonderful. 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 17, 20 AS: Does your program support people staying on Suboxone for some amount of time or are they encouraged to get off before they leave? 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 MS: Well, initially we said we only wanted to use it for some period of time, like a year and a half, two years or something. 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 Until you get into good solid recovery, and then if you want to get of the medicine, just fine. 6, 7, 8, 14, 19, 20 I still think that is a useful tool for most people probably. 7, 9, 12, 13 Not all by any means.  And yet, the Federal Government doesn't agree, and a lot of researchers say, ""I can't take people off of their medication."" 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20 But the truth is, medication adherence study shows us that two weeks of an antibiotic, less than half of people do that without stopping it early. 5, 6, 7, 9, 16 It's terrible.  And all of the suboxone studies, those early studies we used in that literature review, show that less than fifty percent of people were staying on it. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 And they were really quitting early. 6, 7, 8, 19 So, our goal became... 13, 17 We want to keep people on it, keep them engaged in treatment, and that's where we shifted our model because we wanted people to stay engaged with us long term who had opioid use disorder. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Not in residential, we wanted residential to get into out-patient in St. Paul and stick around in this program, getting the medicine there, living in a sober house, you know, stick with this long term. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 And, we will help you figure out if you should stop the medicine or not, and we will support you all along the way. 7, 8, 9, 18 So, Core Twelve became this really kind of long term out-patient program. 6, 7, 8, 13, 17 Now there are over two hundred people in St. Paul in this program. 8 AS: Oh, wow. 14 MS: Yeah, it's great. 7, 8 And that's where we ultimately resulted in... in our whole model. 7, 19 We saw the utility of a residential stay for stabilization, followed by long term out patient, during which the people could transition from professional care to self-care over months and years, if it was necessary. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 20 And it gave us the opportunity to maintain involvement and support ongoing use of medications, and ultimately, if they wanted to get off, we could be there to help them with that and insure continued support. 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 Because so many people stopped anyway, to me, that was just an essential feature of this. 7, 15, 18 And I knew that the craving of opioids goes on so long, I didn't want to say, ""We're just going to do four weeks of treatment,"" or whatever, now our average is about three, and then say... 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: Oh, really? 6, 7, 8 MS: Yeah, in residential. 7, 9 Our average in out-patient after that is now like several months. 11, 13, 15, 17 And for our Core Twelve folks, our initial Core Twelve group was going two years later with all of the same people still there. 5, 7, 16, 17, 18 I mean, they didn't want to stop. 14 And they were all going to Twelve  Step meetings and doing all of this other stuff, but they still really appreciated what they were getting there. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 20 And so, my bias was...  There's literature on physicians with addiction and a lot of them are opioid addicts, and a lot of those are fentanyl addicts, so even more powerful drugs that what they have on the street. 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 20 They are taking pure fentanyl. 7 And a high death rate for those folks as well. 8, 11, 17 But, in most states, they were not allowed to use Suboxone and go back to practice medicine. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 19 But also, they had the highest recovery rates recorded in any literature because of all of the long-term monitoring. 7, 8, 11 AS: Oh right, so you could use that monitoring model... 8, 9, 14 MS: It was two-fold. 16 I must be getting tired, I can't remember anything. 7, 13, 15, 20 AS: That's okay, I understand. 14 You have been talking for two hours. 6 You should be running out of words. 8, 9 MS: [laughter] 9 So, contingency management is an evidence-based practice for addiction. 6, 8, 15 The biggest contingency, the easiest to understand what this means, is if a physician or a nurse or anyone that requires a license, like a driver, a semi-driver or a pilot, if you're going to go back to your work, you can do that as long as you do this, this, this, and this, too, and we'll let you maintain your license. 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 If you don't do any of these things, we are taking your license away. 5, 18, 19, 20 If you relapse, we are taking your license away. 7, 18, 20 So, that's a contingency management, that's an evidence-based practice. 6, 15 Sometimes, a different type of contingency, and when we used this at St. Paul, if everybody shows up for group today, we'll have a pizza party next time we meet, and we'll supply the pizza. 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 And the thing is, when we did that, they were all supporting each other. 9, 19 ""You gotta go to group we want that pizza party."" 8, 14, 18, 19 Right?  They are calling each other and texting, ""Get to group!"". 14, 17, 18 So, it supports abstinence, it supports continued involvement. 9, 19 So, we were using that. 10 So, for the docs, its contingency management, they could lose their license to practice medicine, as well as that long-term monitoring that I think results in the really high outcome rates. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18 And even for those with opioid use disorders, although a lot of the data is a little skewed because some people drop out, ones with opioid use disorders and they weren't used in the final analysis, but still, they've got seventy-five or eighty percent abstinent in five years. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20 AS: Really?  Wow.  That's great. 7, 8 MS: It's incredible. 7 Yeah, but most of them can't use suboxone and go back to work. 9, 11, 12, 17, 19 There are a couple of states that allow it, but most states won't. 7, 17 AS: You mean for doctors? 20 MS: Yeah, these doctors cannot go back to work on Suboxone. 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 So, I knew of that literature and I knew all kinds of people in NA, who, like I said earlier, have either never used methadone, or used methadone and stopped and now are sober. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 So, I know that people with opioid use disorder can stay sober without medication. 5, 9, 14, 16, 17 And I don't know who is who, so that's one of the reasons that we recommend everyone take one of the two medications, but it also is one of the reasons, initially, that I thought we should support people who want to stop medication, at some point. 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 20 That only after their really good recovery, because the risk of relapse is associated with the risk of overdose and death. 6, 7, 8, 19 So, it can't, we can't, be undisciplined about this.  We've got to really make sure that we are only supporting that, if they are in solid recovery, and even then, there is still a risk. 6, 7, 8, 9, 18 We've had all kinds of people stop the medications and we've had some stay on the medications. 12, 14, 16 AS: Right, it is just so personal. 10, 17 MS: Right.  We don't know who is who. 17 AS: And you haven't been able to test that. 13, 18 MS: No, and I would like to. 9, 14 That would be a great research project, but it would be really hard to do and take a really long time. 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 20 It would still be worth it. 7 AS: Okay, just one more question. 15 Do you need to go?  AS: So, if you could change something for the better right now, if you could change something right now regarding addiction treatment, what would it be? 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 MS: If I could just suddenly change something? 5, 17 MS: I guess the main thing would be to allow access to anybody to have addiction treatment and as long as they needed addiction treatment. 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19 AS: To have it for as long as they need it? 7 MS: Yeah, and in a system like our own, where they start with residential if they need it, they go to day treatment, they go to out-patient, intensive out-patient and have long term follow up. 6, 7, 9, 13, 18, 19 AS: And that's if they have the insurance or the funds.  MS: Well, if I get to change anything the funding is somehow provided so anyone can access treatment and they can have the treatment they need. 5, 7, 13, 17, 18, 20 AS: Okay, that's what I knew you were getting at. 6, 12, 15, 20 MS: Which is hard to get. 6, 20 It's hard to get the treatment you need. 6, 7, 13, 18, 20 AS: Well, and to have it be consistent based on people's insurance situations. 7 It's still hard for us. 6, 7 AS: It depends on who your insurer is whether you can even go to Hazelden or not. 7 MS: I know, yeah. 8, 17 Now most, all of the major national insurers cover us now, we're partnered with. 7, 8, 17 Ninety-two, ninety-three percent of our patients use their insurance. 9, 15 AS: Is that recent? 7 MS: That's the last couple years now. 7, 16, 17 AS: Yeah, that's what I wondered. 7 MS: It's a big change from... 5 Oh, this is what I forgot earlier.  So, Betty Ford Center, so we merged with them shortly after, in like 2014, we initiated this program in 2013. 8 Some of the most vocal folks against us were Betty Ford Center. 17 It was mostly, if you could say if we have competition in the addiction field, it was the people who thought they were our competitors were the most vocal against us, trying to get patients to go there instead of going to us, basically. 5, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 But also, they just didn't agree with us. 7 AS: I was going to ask you how the Betty Ford merger happened, and how well that went. 5, 8 MS: Well, so, the first meeting... 6, 16 AS: Like philosophically. 14, 17 MS: Yeah, the first meeting of the Betty Ford center board with our president and CEO Mark Mishick, he told me that I needed to go along with him because they were so concerned about this new program Core Twelve. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16 AS: They needed you to explain it? 9 MS: Yeah, and on their board was Tom McClelland, who is a major addiction researcher, now semi-retired, who has been supportive of medicines all along, but he couldn't convince them or the rest of the board about it. 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17 So, I go in and told them what we've done and why. 13, 16 AS: And he's like, ""See what I've been telling you!"" 9, 13, 14 And basically, we did it because people were dying. 14, 17 People were dying of addiction and in overwhelming numbers that we have never seen before, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help and that's what convinced me more than anything, and what convinced our staff more than anything. 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 And the medicines work, and they work well, and that helped a lot in convincing. 8, 18 But the Betty  Ford folks, their board actually agreed and still went through with the merger. 7, 17, 18 It took over a year before their staff would even consider it. 9, 16 And it required a lot of them coming to visit to see what it was like in action and to meet our patients. 5, 7, 15 AS: So, they're very new to the Core Twelve Program? 6, 7 Within a couple years. 7, 16 It might be three now or so for them, but it took a while. 17 And they were really biased initially, but now they just love it too. 6, 7, 8, 17 AS: So, what was the impact, and you might not know this, but what was the impact on staff at Hazelden when these deaths started happening and how were you finding out about them? 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 17 Were you finding out through the grapevine or how was it? 9 MS: Well, it depended on how long they had been out of treatment and probably circumstances with their families. 7, 12, 13, 15, 18 If they were still involved with us, we were absolutely finding out. 7, 9 If they weren't involved and patients who were still in our system were involved with them, we would find out through the patient once and a while. 7, 9, 15 The family would tell us regularly. 7, 13, 19 We have a quality review committee, which is like a peer review committee in a hospital that has to review every sentinel event. 7, 8 It would be like a death, a very bad outcome, an injury, a medication error, stuff like that. 16, 17 And so, I oversee that, and I am the liaison to our quality committee to the board, and so I was seeing everyone we were aware of, we reviewed. 5, 6, 7, 17 Which is really hard. 6, 7, 8 AS: Was there a time when there were a lot of them? 7, 16, 19 MS: It didn't suddenly peak, it just kind of slowly got to become more and then it kind of leveled off, but it's been... before that, before this opioid crisis, we hardly had any deaths. 5, 6, 9, 17, 18 I mean there would be a suicide now and then, I mean we were not reviewing regularly deaths all the time, no, and now we are, which is horrible. 7, 16, 17, 19 But I can't prove this.  But the numbers are so much more now, in terms of the numbers of people with opioid use disorder than it was at the start of all of this. 5, 6, 9, 14, 17 And although we have more death, I think we would have way, way more without the use of the medication. 9, 16 I can't prove it, I suppose I could try.  AS: Well, hasn't evidence-based medicine already proved it? 6, 7, 8, 18 I mean, do you have to prove that it is you?  MS: It has, there is proof.  There is proof in the literature. 7 However, in our research study of Core Twelve, there were two-hundred and fifty-nine participants and they basically, almost a third in each group, a third on Naltrexone, mostly vivitrol, a third on Suboxone, and a third who refused medications. 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 There were three deaths over the 2013 to 2017, in that two-hundred and fifty-nine people.  One used buprenorphine and two used naltrexone, nobody with no meds. 7, 9, 12 It goes against anything that we would have thought would have thought would have happened. 5, 10 AS: Nobody with no meds?  MS: Nobody.  We don't have all of the deaths because somebody could have died and not told us. 13, 16, 17 I am intending to do... we lost a couple of people in our research department, so I haven't been able to carry this out, but I want to study like a thousand of our patients with opioid use disorder and look at all of their deaths through the social security death index, because they have gotten really much better by defining death by overdose. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 And then I could look back and see who was on no meds, who was on Suboxone, who was on vivitrol. 5, 11, 12, 17, 19 I won't have the detail of how long they took it after treatment or anything, so I am not sure how much it will be helpful, but I will at least... 7, 13, 18 No one has published anything like that, looking at death following addiction treatment, and that is so important. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18 Because every single treatment program in the country is experiencing this. 7, 8, 10, 13, 18 When we first started talking about this, I was talking about death and overdose at every single discussion that I had about it, because it is so necessary to the discussion if you are going to change your whole model, you have to have a good reason. 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19 There is no better reason. 7, 10, 17 And nobody would engage in a conversation about that. 15 No other treatment program, no other providers. 7, 8, 13, 18 They wouldn't even bring it up with me.  And I would ask sometimes. 7, 12, 16, 19 AS: And when you say treatment programs, you mean those usually based on Twelve Step programs? 7, 8, 13, 14, 18 You weren't talking to addiction medicine doctors who were already using it. 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 18, 20 AS: They didn't even want to talk about the death rates. 6, 14 AS: Why do you think that is?  MS: At ASAM there was more and more discussion about that over the years, but I think people were so used to a field that barely ever had deaths that they just didn’t know what to do about it. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 And the other thing is that most treatment centers do no outcome studies. 7, 13, 17, 18, 19 They do no follow up of their patients. 15 AS: Well, that's what really shocks me in my whole process of what I have been studying for this. 5, 6, 7, 8 MS: Yeah, it's horrible.  AS: I don't even understand how that is possible.  MS: It's amazing.  It's ridiculous.  And so, if you assume that everyone is doing great and put on your website that ninety-percent are abstinent at one year, you can't look and see who died. 5, 7, 8, 16, 17, 19 Man. AS: Right.  Well and how can you even prove that people were abstinent.  Yeah, you can just call them and ask them... 14, 17 [laughter] or don't even. 9 Or just take that, say it's ninety-percent. 14, 20 AS: Just say it, right. 8, 14 MS: Because you can't know and there's no group that is ninety-percent, ever. 13, 17, 18 [laughter] 9 Even in treatment it might not be ninety-percent. 7, 13, 18 AS: Right, exactly!  MS: [laughter] 9 AS: Even when they are in the building.  MS: Yeah, yeah. 8 AS: Anything else that you want to say? 8, 14 MS: Ah, man.  Oh, just a little bit more about... you know, so I was talking about how we switched from basically a programmatic model and it wasn't all Core Twelve, there was other influences going on, but Core Twelve was the major influence in switching this through-out the whole organization. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 20 Part of it was going down a path of insurance, you know, and trying to work with insurers. 7, 17 AS: Oh, okay. 14 MS: So, changing from, you're coming into treatment for four weeks whether you need it or not, right? 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 18 Four weeks is it. 16 Maybe you can stay for six, but four weeks of treatment and then you are leaving and there won't be any follow up. 7, 13, 14, 16, 18 Betty Ford was still doing that when we merged. 7 Yeah, and there are some longer-term programs for the people that could afford it, because it was purely private pay, but hardly anyone could afford that. 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 20 And there are still all kinds of programs doing that nowadays, private pay and long-term treatment. 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 And some of that probably gets better outcomes because it is long term treatment. 7, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20 AS: Because it is long term, right. 7, 8, 14 MS: It's just that no one can afford to do that, or like the one-percent can, I guess. 12, 19 And so, so now our model is that residential is for diagnosis and stabilization, and not just diagnosis if your substance use disorder, it's all the mental health too. 5, 7, 9, 17 AS: It's about all of the mental health, right, right. 8, 14 MS: And then, we want you to go to day treatment with sober housing in IOP, intensive out patient, prior to sober housing and then we want you seeing a counselor or somebody once a week, or every couple of weeks for a while. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 It's a chronic illness, let's be sure that you are really stable and that you've got a foot hold in recovery. 6, 7, 8, 16, 18 So, that's how we started and how, because of the long-standing nature of the craving, like I said earlier, and other factors, and the high relapse rate with opioids, I wanted long term involvement. 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 And insurance of course doesn't want to pay for that. 14, 18 AS: Right.  MS: Shortening residential reduces the cost dramatically and allows for longer out patient. 7, 9, 14, 17, 20 Right, right. 8, 14 MS: Yeah, cause then you can shift your cost to the out-patient and get it really long. 6, 7, 8, 9, 20 AS: So, you were part of that, that thinking? 8 MS: Oh yeah, that's Core Twelve, that's was our thinking. 7, 8 We've got to keep people... 17 AS: Oh, that came out of Core Twelve? 7, 13, 17 That has now been applied... you've seen the benefits for people who don't have opioid issues. 5, 7, 13, 17 MS: Yeah, yeah, it's become our model as a whole now. 8, 17, 18 Long term care for people. 7, 14, 20 And there were other influences.  It wasn't just me, but I was doing it both for Core Twelve and suggesting we do it because it is a chronic illness. 7 [laughter] 9 AS: I know, yeah. 8, 17 MS: I mean my own experience was four weeks of treatment in 1974 and relapse in five days, no care of any kind, told to go to AA... 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 AS: No support groups, right. 8, 9, 11, 14, 18 AS: And you were also a teenager. 15 MS: Yeah, yeah. 8 AS: You think of all of the risk factors.  MS: There was no professional...  No, there wasn't anything available. 10, 18 AS: So, what would you say your most proud of in your work? 14 MS: I would say Core Twelve itself. 7, 14 I am most proud of that for my entire career. 7, 14, 20 Although, one thing I am doing right now comes as a close second. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 MS: And over the long run, may be more important, I don't know but I've instituted a program that we can FIT. 7, 8, 17 It's Feedback Informed Treatment and it is in our electronic health record where we have a portal for our patients. 7, 11, 15, 17, 19 And they can go into that portal and we want them every week to fill out these objective tools about how they are doing. 14, 16 And they are in the literature, the research literature, all of these tools, well, not all of them. 7, 8, 12 Three of them are in the research literature and are associated with positive outcomes from treatment. 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 They've been used individually, never in combination. 9, 13 And then we added two tools that are used in primary-care. 7, 9, 14, 20 One for anxiety and one for depression and the new understanding of addiction as a disease is one of... initially it is all about positive reinforcement, ""it feels good, I am going to do it again"". 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 Then it becomes negative reinforcement, ""I feel so bad but when I get high, it's relieved"". 7, 11, 13, 17, 18, 20 And that negative reinforcement is a release of negative stimuli. 7, 19 And so, the whole kind of new neurobiological theory of addiction is that it is negatively reinforcement associated with a combination of depression and anxiety and angst that is sort of driving continued use and driving relapse. 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 18, 19 And so, no one has ever measured to see if anxiety and depression are high... do people have more relapses? 5, 7, 11, 12, 13 Or if they are low, do they have less?  AS: Right.  MS: And it is not necessarily anxiety and depression that are true anxiety disorders or mood disorders, it's just that negative affective state that is associated with addiction. 5, 7, 8, 15, 17 And so, we added those two so we can do that and see, but also to see if they are predictive by themselves. 5, 7 So, now we have all five of these, we're asking our patients to fill out weekly. 15, 16, 17 AS: Woah.  MS: And they fill it out online, it goes into their chart and we're working with our electronic health record provider so it'll come up as a graph so you can see it over time, but then the next thing is we'll be figuring out interventions based on certain scoring. 5, 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 AS: Things that they say? 14 That they report? 7 MS: Yeah, to see if they are doing great, not going to change much, if they aren't then we better do some changing and what exactly that we change and what makes a difference. 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18 It is going to take a decade or more. 20 AS: That might overshadow.  [laughter] 9 MS: So those two I am very proud of.  AS: What's interesting about that though is that also has a really hopeful... 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 [laughter] 9 AS: That's a very positive... 7 I don't know how to say it. 14, 17 It has a positive overlay to it, versus the intensity of the opioid epidemic which is that you are trying to prevent death. 5, 7 MS: Exactly.  AS: This is a program where you are trying to like, keep people supported and feeling loved and cared about, right? 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 Whereas with Core and with the opioid epidemic, we're just trying to keep people alive so that they might get better at some point. 5, 7, 10, 11, 17, 20 MS: True.  In fact, one of the medicines... 8 AS: It makes sense to me why would you excited about this. 9, 18 Sorry, you were going to say? 14 MS: But still, Core Twelve is currently the best thing I have done in my career. 7, 13, 14, 19, 20 [laughter] 9 AS: Yeah, that's really good. 6, 7, 8, 19 MS: Although, I did really like individual work with patients. 6, 7, 8, 15 This is probably more important in an overall scheme of things and probably has already effected more people than I ever could have by myself. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 So, yeah. 8 AS: That's great. 7, 8 Thank you so much.  MS: Oh yeah, thank you. 8, 9 [End of recording at 2:06:02] 7, 11"
"10","Eden_Frank_Rae","Marvin Seppala Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer November 6, 2018 Minneapolis, Minnesota Marvin Seppala -MS Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan interviewing Dr. Marv Seppala.  It is November 6, 2018.  We are at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation in Center City.  Dr. Seppala, do you give me permission to record this? 7, 11 MS: Yes, I do.  AS: Alright, thank you. 8, 9, 14 So tell me—you might state your name, your birthday, where you grew up. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 MS: Okay, my name is Marvin Seppala. 11 I go by Marv. My birthday is July 22nd, 1956. 19 Born in Seattle, Washington to Finnish parents. 7, 12 I am 100% Finnish.  My mom immigrated from Finland with her brother to Tacoma, where a second-cousin sponsored him after World War II. 7, 13, 16, 17 My dad, his parents were both born in Finland and he grew up in Northern Minnesota in Virginian after it got logged out. 5, 7, 12, 19 My grandfather was a lumberjack.  He moved out to Tacoma with the family to the other Finnish community. 7, 11, 14, 19 AS: Oh wow, so you had roots in Minnesota too. 14 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 So ultimately, we moved back here and I grew up in Stewartville, Minnesota. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 AS: Stewartville.  How old were you when you moved back here? 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 MS: So, I would have been eight when we moved to Minnesota, but we lived in Eden Prairie for just a few years. 11, 14, 16 Before the start of sixth grade I moved to Stewartville. 6, 11, 14, 19 AS: And what do your folks do? 17 MS: My dad was a chemical engineer at IBM and my mom was a housewife. 9, 11, 12, 17 AS: Mmhmm.  And you’re, are you… 7 tell me about your siblings, or... MS: Sure. 7, 13 I am the oldest of five and I have three brothers and the last sibling is a sister. 15, 16 She is ten years younger than me. 6, 16 AS: Oh lucky girl [laughter] 9, 12 MS: [laughter] 9 So, that ten-year gap was big because it was at seventeen when I was kicked out of the house for my addiction. 8, 9, 11, 15, 16 She was just seven years old, so we never really bonded very much. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16 AS: Oh, right, right. 8, 14 Right, you wanna talk about that? 6 [laughter] 9 You kind of jumped to it.  MS: [laughter] 9 I know, I did jump to something AS: Seventeen, being kicked out, it seems like an important place. 5, 8, 11, 17 You want to go a few years before that? 14, 16 What happened in Stewartville, you got there in sixth grade? 5, 19 MS: Yeah, just before the start of sixth grade. 6, 19 AS: What was that like? 9, 14 MS: You know, it was funny because I think about it... 8, 17 Seattle, San Jose, Bloomington, Eden Prairie... and then Stewartville.  For me, as a kid, at that age, I didn't notice the difference really, in terms of being in a big city and then being in a really small town. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15 My focus, this was the fourth move already, and every four years, which is kind of funny when I start college and medical school.... training is every four years! 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 AS: Oh yeah, your life is in four years, that’s interesting MS: [laughter] 7, 8, 9, 16 Which seemed kind of nice is a way, it was weird. 5, 14 AS: So, every four years you’re like hmm… 7, 16 is it time to go somewhere now? 7, 16, 17, 19 MS: [laughter] 9 So, what my difficulty was being a somewhat self-conscious, anxious kid and now I've got to make new friends and start a new class, and I don't know anybody. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 AS: Yeah, and in sixth grade that’s starting to be awkward. 5, 6, 19 MS: Yeah, it was really awkward. 6, 7, 8 But also, in a small town, I think it may have been easier. 12 I don't know that. 17 I met people pretty readily, in class of course, in the only school [laughter]. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 AS: One school, where all the kids are in the whole town [laughter]. 9, 11, 15 MS: Everyone in sixth grade is there, so it worked out that way [laughter]. 9, 12, 19 AS: So, who’d you meet?  How’d you start getting in trouble? 6, 15, 20 MS: Sixth grade was nothing like that. 19 It was that summer though, after sixth grade, so twelve-years-old.... 16, 17, 19 I'm just trying to get this right. 8, 14, 20 Yeah, so twelve years old, it must have been the start of seventh grade and I am at a farm with two friends, Kim and Rick, both guys, at Rick's family farm, right outside of Stewartville. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And, I don't know how this idea comes up but all the older guys that we looked up to, are like the athletes and the sports teams. 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17 You know everybody. 17 So seventh grade we were in the high school. 11, 19 There was no junior high. 11, 16 It was seventh grade through twelfth. 19 So sixth grade I was in grade school and seventh grade I'm with everybody. 11, 19 All the older guys are drinking and they're all the really popular guys and the guys on the athletic teams. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 My mother was a cross-country skier in Finland growing up and was on the Olympic team but broke a leg and never got to compete. 5, 10, 13 Her dad, my grandfather, was a world-champion cross country skier. 10, 12 So I grew up with athletics being a really big deal. 6, 7, 8, 19 So was academics.  But in my mind as a kid, athletics was certainly more important. 6, 14, 15 So, these athletes are all doing something that we're not supposed to but it seems like fun so I am attracted to it. 5, 14 So the three of us are at the farm, we steal some whiskey out of the kitchen and we go out to the barn, which we had to clean [laughter]. 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 It was just part of the deal. 8 It was a little dairy farm. 9, 19, 20 And we drank. 18 I can still remember it. 7, 13, 15 At one point in my training, I was at the VA hospital and the councilor there, this ex-chief-petty-officer in the Navy, six-five, big guy. 6, 8, 10, 11, 18 Chief Petty Officers are known for being very deliberate, really strong minded. 6, 7, 8, 12, 17 So he was this incredible guy, remarkably passionate about what he did for these veterans. 6, 7, 17 He had them all describe their first drink. 16, 19 And they almost to a person, they could. 10, 15, 17 AS: Really?  MS: It really captured them somehow. 6, 7, 8, 17 As if something really important had happened. 5, 6, 7, 8 AS: What is that called, in addiction medicine? 8, 13, 14, 15, 17 There’s a name for that. 11 MS: I can't remember that. 7, 13, 15 So I'm not sure if I should do it really, but I'm all in. 6, 7, 8 AS: But you remember it feeling good? 6, 7, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 MS: I remember I just could hardly understand why anyone would swallow this stuff. 6, 7, 13, 15 It tasted so bad.  It burnt my throat and then all of the sudden, feeling like I belonged. 7, 13, 17, 18 Like I was part of these other two guys who had grown up together and I no longer had these worries or fears about that or anything else really. 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 20 It was like I was suddenly part of the world or something. 8, 12, 17 I don’t know, it was like my whole life changed. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17 It was really remarkable. 6, 7, 8, 18 And I knew I was going to do it again. 6, 12 That's for sure. 7 I didn't get to for months, but it was like a goal. 11, 20 I wanted to feel that way again. 13, 14, 18 So, ultimately, the following summer, I did again. 17, 19 Then I started doing it more frequently that summer. 6, 7, 15, 17 AS: Do you remember if you got drunk the first time you tried it, or you just got the buzz? 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19 MS: I didn't get sick or anything. 20 We just took a few sips each, you know, because we had to replace the bottle. 7, 8, 17 [laughter] 9 So it was mostly just this remarkable feeling. 5, 7, 13, 17, 18 AS: Yeah, that warmth, and... MS: Yeah, and there was more to it.  It felt like I was part of something for the first time, and that is a strange thing to describe. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 In the midst of my addiction, it seemed like it was almost a quest to feel that way. 5, 8, 13, 15, 18 It was almost like this spiritual quest because it felt like that almost, at the onset. 6, 15 And almost every new drug I took was that same sensation of ""Wow. 6, 10, 15 This is what life should be like."" 7, 8, 9, 14 It never would last. 13 I never really could get back to it. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20 There was a sense that I am missing something and I am looking for it, and seeking it, and never finding it. 5, 6, 9, 13 Except for those first couple of times with each particular substance. 7, 8, 9, 16, 19 Other people have told me that as well over the years of my work. 8, 13, 16 And even I've heard some speakers describe the same thing in regard to their substance use. 7, 9, 14, 19 It certainly was for me. 14 It was just like, ""Man. 9, 14 This is what I thought life would be like."" 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 AS: Yeah, and to be twelve or thirteen... how old were you? 16 MS: Yeah, twelve the first time. 7, 16, 19 So a year later, drinking again with some friends and then an older brother of one of my friends that was a year ahead of me in school had just returned from the University of Minnesota after his freshman year. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 He was a guy I really looked up to, both an athlete and a really good student. 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 19 He was on the honor roll and everything.  Also went to the same church as I did, and overall, just a really good guy. 6, 7, 8, 19 So, he comes back and tells the two of us that he is smoking pot at the University and describes the importance of it and how fun it was. 7, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19 And I remember saying, ""I would never do that."" 7, 13, 14, 15 That was my initial response. 7 I am really young, and then, a week later, I'm doing that. 5, 6, 7, 8, 16 [laughter] 9 AS: That was short [laughter]. 9 MS: [laughter]. 9 It's funny because I have certainly read about peer pressure and thought about peer pressure in regard to its influence on people. 7, 8, 10, 14 When I look back on my own life in regard to substance use, I was always pushing the envelope and seeking more substance use and I needed to find people who were doing the same, so that I wouldn't stick out. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 19 There might have been some peer pressure to start something… 6, 7 once I got going, I didn't want people to know how often I was using, how much I was using, all of the different drugs I was using. 7, 10, 14, 17, 18 AS: Right.  So you looked for those people… 13 MS: I had to hang out with people who were doing the same so I wouldn't feel as bad. 5, 13, 18 AS: Right.  So it was more like peer support. 9, 14 All of this shame and guilt about doing it at all.  At least I wouldn't have to be around people who would elicit that in me.  [laughter]. 9 AS: Right, right. 8, 14 That’s really powerful, that’s a really interesting take on it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 20 Because other people get blamed a lot—the “bad kids.” 15 And I was probably one of those bad kids because I did try and convince my friends. 7, 12, 13, 15 You know, ""You gotta try this now! 17 I smoked pot and it is so much fun. 10 It was only a couple of people, less than a handful of people that I would do that with. 7, 13 It was the late Sixties, early Seventies. 5, 6 It was one thing to do it quietly, it was another to get other people involved. 19, 20 There were a few friends that every time I tried something new, I would go tell them just how great this was too. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19 You know, ""You gotta try this."" 17 [laughter] 9 So I was probably pressuring other people for sure. 7, 12, 13 AS: So you’re smoking pot, at this point you’re thirteen, fourteen… 7, 10, 16 MS: Yeah, thirteen or fourteen and once I kind of broke through smoking pot when other drugs became available, I didn't have that same resistance or hesitance. 7, 10, 13, 17, 18 I just tried it.  So speed was available, and not that much else. 8, 10, 18 There was LSD.  Sometimes. 7, 12, 16, 19 AS: Who were you getting it from? 15, 20 These college kids, when they came home? 13, 15, 17, 19 MS: You know, there would always be someone in town, usually an older guy. 6, 10, 15, 16, 17 [laughter]. 9 And there was just a group of people who used drugs and a larger group who didn't in the high school. 9, 10, 11, 18 The people who did, they just somehow got it from somebody, I don't know. 17 There were dealers that some people knew. 6, 10, 12, 14 When I was younger, I didn't know who or what and they would just kind of share and sell to each other basically. 6, 7, 14, 16, 17, 19 By fifteen, I am using just about anything and almost everyday. 10, 15, 19 So, it just really quickly went to daily. 5, 6, 7, 8 I would say it wasn't absolutely every day but pretty much every day. 5, 7, 14, 19 AS: How was it at home? 17, 19 Did your parents know? 7, 12, 17 MS: My parents really didn't notice initially. 6, 7, 8, 12 I don't know how that is. 17 I did everything I could to avoid them knowing and to prevent them from knowing, that's for sure. 7, 17 I didn't want them to know and I lied a lot. 14, 17 When you are that age and you are staying out late with older people, you gotta have a reason to be out every night after school. 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 And I was still on sports teams, so I was usually gone anyway for that and I wasn't missing most practices and I wasn't missing school at this point. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 But I came up with all of these other reasons and things that I would be doing later in the evening. 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 Early on that wasn't that hard because I wasn't staying out past curfew or anything. 5, 6, 8, 14 Then I did later, as a junior or senior start to do that. 5, 6, 11, 16 And there wasn't much in the way of them controlling that. 10 I just kept doing it.  It was usually a combination of things. 5, 19 Once in a while you would get caught and just drink or just smoke pot, but in general, it was a combination of substances and again, just kind of in small groups. 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19 And every now and then we would get up to Rochester, of course a bigger town where more drugs are available and probably more dealers. 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 But it was usually still within this same, well-known group that that occurred. 7, 8, 12, 17, 18 And with that, I had summer jobs, but until I was over sixteen I really couldn't drive. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 17 So I couldn't really get a job. 6, 7, 8, 20 We had a minor allowance.  I had to start finding a way to get drugs or get money, so illegal stuff fairly early on to do so. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20 AS: What would you do, like steal stuff?  MS: Yeah, steal stuff or sell it. 19 The first time we took the whiskey from the parents' supply in the kitchen. 7, 12, 16, 19 That next summer I had gotten a job loading trap at the local gun club. 7, 10, 16, 17, 19 The guy who picked us up to go to the gun club had this really old rusted out station wagon and he always brought the booze out to the gun club. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, 20 So he would carry in the cases of beer and cases of whiskey, whatever, into the gun club. 10, 12, 13, 14, 20 It was part of the job. 8 It didn't occur to me at the time because I was younger, it was like the seventh or eighth grade. 6, 7, 16, 19 At this later point when I started drinking, thirteen or fourteen, was when I realized that.... 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 19 No, so this is what happened. 5 I was hiking... this would be early spring, late winter. 5, 6 I am in boy scouts and there are three of us out on a hike.  We're out on the root river and we've got one 22-caliber rifle, a single shot. 7, 9, 20 Once in a while we were shooting something.  We're just hiking along the riverbed and it was a really unusual day. 6, 7, 8, 9, 19 The river ice was breaking up. 7, 9, 10 There were these giant chunks of ice floating down the river. 9 This is the same Rick that I drank with the first time. 7, 16, 18, 19 So he and I tell my brother Brian, who is also with us, we give him the 22 and we hang out from this oak branch that’s out over the river waiting for a big chunk to come off and we dropped on top of it. 5, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17 The two of us-- Brian stayed on shore. 7, 14, 16 Brian then threw us a big stick so we could control it. 7, 10 [laughter] 9 This is a big chunk of ice, probably not quite as wide as this room but pretty close. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 At least how I remembered it. 7, 13, 15 We picked it because it was so big. 5 The river of course was swelling because of the melt-off and I had never seen this before. 5, 8, 9, 13 I haven't seen it since. 5, 13 It was really a remarkable day. 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 We're going down the stream, not fast, but we're moving decent. 7 We realize that every time we move the ice chunk with our stick to try and control it, we just go slower than in the current. 7, 10, 14, 16, 19 So we toss our stick, so we eliminate the only control we have for navigating this thing. 10, 19 We're going along... it was a long straight section where we started, so we're just thinking, ""This is great."" 6, 7, 8, 15 We come around a bend and there is this chunk of ice, a dam of ice chunks across the river. 9, 17, 18 They look kind of smaller than ours. 12 Ours is just big so we thought that we'll just hit this and we'll go right through that dam. 8, 10, 14, 19 That was our discussion.  It was limited to that.  We're right in the middle of the river at this point, the river is wider than this room. 8, 9, 10, 14 We hit that dam of ice chunks and ours starts to go under. 6, 19 I can still remember these little ice chunks going out from under our feet as we're trying to run across them to get to shore. 7, 8, 13, 15, 20 We went towards the shore that Brian was on, I think it was just closer, it wasn't that far. 6, 7, 9, 13 Maybe here to that wall, ten feet at most.  All of the sudden it all breaks through, just as we're reaching a four foot bank of mud. 7, 10, 17 Luckily, there were tree roots in that bank of mud and both of us managed to grab those roots. 15 We're soaking wet, we crawl up the mud, we get out, and it doesn't even occur to us that we almost died. 15, 17, 20 We're just like, ""Wow, that was exciting!"" 9, 14 [laughter]. 9 The reason for this story is that we get up... 7, 10, 13, 17, 20 We were meeting my mom, who dropped us off, and we were meeting her at Low Water Bridge to start the hike at the Gun Club. 6, 17 That's a nice spot for pick up. 5, 10, 14 We were just going to go down the river, but we're on the wrong side now. 6, 9, 17 Usually there is a place where we could cross near the gun club. 8, 10 It's maybe a third of a mile across a field from the gun club. 10, 16, 20 It is usually really shallow. 6, 7, 8 But because of the swelling it was much deeper. 8 Brian is up above his knees, we're all really cold. 6, 7, 8, 16 It is melting.  It is not warm out.  So we're probably close to hypothermia, soaking wet. 6, 10, 12, 13 It is getting towards late afternoon, so we're briskly getting up to the gun club. 5, 10, 15, 20 Because I'm freezing and we're there early... 6, 7 My mom wasn't going to be there for some time. 7, 16, 17, 19 We didn't have cell phones or anything. 6, 12, 14 We were just counting on a specific time. 7, 16, 19 I remembered that when I worked there, the back window by the backdoor, this tiny little window, little tiny back porch, a few steps up to this 3 x 5 back porch where the kitchen was, this window was unlocked. 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 It was broken.  I remembered that for some reason when I worked there. 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17 So I say, ""Let's see if that thing opens."" 5, 14, 19, 20 We can go in and get heated up, we can warm up.  So I try the window, which is up above and it was open. 20 So I crawl through, open the door for those guys, we all go in and we turn the heat on and the ovens on. 6, 8, 15, 17, 20 Everything we could to get heat and warmed up. 20 We took our clothes off and hung them over the deep fat fryer.  I realized I can break into the gun club, but this is meaningless to me at that time besides that we got warmed up and my mom comes and we're all dry, basically. 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19 She didn't even notice.  We don't tell her the story of course. 13 Why tell her this story? 13 [laughter] 9 AS: “We had a great hike, mom” [laughter]. 7, 8, 9, 17 MS: I know, we did. 17 [laughter] 9 So at this later point, I had met this older guy. 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 16 He was a year older than me, not that much older. 15, 16 He was more worldly, let's just put it that way. 12, 19 He had drank, at least more than I ever had, and he was on the varsity football team. 5, 7, 13, 18 He knew all these older guys. 6, 8, 12, 15, 16 So, we're hanging around. 5, 18 I don't even remember how this all even started. 6, 7, 13, 15 But we're hanging around together. 5, 11, 16, 18, 20 He lives in a trailer home, only with his mom. 11, 17, 19 His mom works every day. 8, 17, 19 So, it was just us.  We're trying to figure out how we can get some alcohol and it suddenly strikes me that we can go out to the gun club and break in. 7, 10, 17, 20 And it doesn't even occur to me that this is really stupid and illegal, and I shouldn't do it. 6, 7, 8 It was more just like, ""Oh, we can get some alcohol."" 9, 10, 14, 20 My family had a canoe. 7, 19 So, we grab the canoe, bring it down to Lake Forest right down in Stewartville, paddle up the river to behind the gun club. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 This is summer now. 17 The same sort of spot where we were going to cross that day. 8, 10, 19 We stopped there and got out. 15 We worked our way up through some trees into this final open field to get to the back patio at the gun club with the broken window. 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20 It's open. 20 It isn't locked.  So, I do the same thing. 19 I crawl in, I open the door, I let Al in. 17, 20 We each grab a case of beer, close the door, race across the open field. 6, 13, 17, 20 It was easier for him than it was for me, running across this open field with a case of beer as this tiny little, skinny kid. 8, 9, 15, 20 We hide in the trees and go down by the river where the canoe is and we each have a beer or two, I guess. 7, 9, 19, 20 Then we decide we're going to save it all for that night because he's got a plan to get all of these older guys together and we'll drink beer. 6, 8, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 I think this is fantastic. 8 So, we paddle back into town and we hide the beer back in the bushes by the football field and get the canoe back to my folks’ house. 9, 11, 17, 19, 20 There's a little traveling carnival in town. 14, 20 This really funny little carnival. 6, 7, 8, 14, 20 It was a hot and humid summer night and the carnival is in town, so we meet all of these older guys. 6, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 He and I go and get the beer and bring it there. 20 They have cars. 14 So they think this is wonderful, free beer. 7, 20 Not only is it beer, it’s free beer. 7, 20 There are two cases. 12 So, they grab that and they grab Al and ditch me.  Because why would you want this little kid along anyway? 7, 14, 15, 20 So I am devastated and just go home. 17, 19 But it kind of cemented in me that I did drink enough to have that same feeling again. 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 And it was like, why would you have to pay to feel like this? 13, 18 AS: So you justified it, in your brain. 5 MS: Oh yeah. 8 And it kind of remained that way. 7 I mean I did pay for drugs and alcohol when I had to, but as much as I could, I didn't. 10, 18 It became this really strange pattern. 6, 7, 8, 13, 17 Anyway.  I was on the basketball team. 5 It must have been in eighth grade and I was playing well enough that I could be on the junior varsity. 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 Practice was going really well, and I did a lot of basketball in the front yard. 6, 7, 8 I was in a car accident. 14 I was with a friend... 13 it couldn't have been eighth grade, I would have had to have been older. 15, 16, 19 I'm jumping around a bit… 20 AS: It’s okay, that’s what memory does to us. 14 MS: My friend was driving. 13, 18 He was older than me. 15, 16 Wayne was older than me. 15, 16 We went to a party and there was a keg and sweet corn, which is not that uncommon. 8, 19 We had one beer each. 20 So just one beer. 20 It was his car. 14 We had heard about another party where there were more kids our age that we knew. 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 19 In particular, there were some girls that we knew. 6, 8, 12 So, we decide, let's go there.  Wayne is driving on a country road that neither of us know. 10, 17, 18 We don't really know where we are when trying to find this party. 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 19 We come over a hill and it is dark. 17 When we come back down there is a T in the road, right in front of us. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 He tried to make the corner. 18 It was gravel roads.  He didn't and we rolled through a really steep ditch. 6, 7, 8 I broke my collarbone. 12 And no seatbelts, so we bounced all over as we rolled and then we landed on the wheels.  I didn't notice it initially, I was just in shock I think.  And then all of the sudden I realized, ""Man"", I didn't realize it was my collar bone, but it was really painful. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 So, we get back in the car. 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 It was a really steep ditch, it had to be six to ten feet that we were down in this thing. 6, 7, 8, 19 He is rocking back and forth, rocking back and forth and then he just guns it and we somehow... 5, 10, 11, 17, 19 he tried a couple times and we didn't get out... so suddenly he just really guns it and we fly up on the road, right over the road into the other ditch right on the other side. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 [laughter] 9 AS: No way.  MS: This time, the car goes in and it is stuck. 7, 14, 16, 19 It is not coming out [laughter]. 7, 9 So, we walk to a farm house and we get a ride into town from the family who drop us off downtown in Stewartville, but I am in need of medical care and there is nothing in Stewartville. 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 None of these older guys agree to bring me to the hospital. 6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16 It's pretty late at night at this point... 5, 7, 10, 14, 19 AS: And where are your parents? 7, 12 MS: I've been drinking, even though I had just had one beer… 15, 19, 20 AS: Oh, you didn’t want your parents to even know you’d had one beer. 7, 12, 14, 17, 20 MS: Right.  Right, I didn't want to tell anybody. 13, 14 And finally, I am desperate, so I tell a police officer. 11, 13, 17, 18 He must have smelled beer. 20 He is really strict and angry about it. 6, 7, 8 He agrees to take me up to Mayo, St. Mary's Hospital. 7, 20 He just dropped me off at the ER.  Doesn't ever mention the beer or anything, but he just brings me there and drops me off. 13, 20 So I get the collarbone X-rayed and set, and then my parents get involved because I am at the hospital. 7, 8, 12, 20 I end up at home. 17, 19 The beer never gets mentioned by anybody. 12, 13, 20 [laughter] 9 But that fall, between the start of school and Christmas that year, I was in six car accidents. 6, 11, 14, 16 I was driving in two of them. 18 By the end of it, I was absolutely frightened to go in car, except for my father's. 8, 14 AS: Six car accidents? 14 MS. Six. Yeah.  AS: With people your age? 15 All people my age. 15 AS: Were they impaired while they were driving? 7, 18 MS: A couple of times. 7, 16, 19 A couple completely unimpaired. 7, 14 Wow, that’s incredible. 7 MS: Yeah, It was awful. 7 Yeah, so my girlfriend at the time, he parents said that she could not date me. 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 I was just a ""whatever"", I don't know, I was dangerous. 13, 17 And I couldn't even go in a car, I really couldn't. 6, 7, 8, 14 Actually, Wayne, the guy that was driving in that episode, he convinced me that we gotta go skiing. 6, 18 We were going to drive over to Lake City to Frontenac’s Ski Area, this little tiny place, and I just said, ""I can't do it."" 7, 8, 13, 14, 20 I had been putting it off for a couple weeks because I just couldn't get in a car. 7, 14, 16, 19, 20 I was too scared to get in a car. 7, 14, 20 And finally, I said, ""Okay, if I drive, I'll go."" 13, 14 And I drove like thirty miles per hour [laughter] even slowing down around corners and hills. 9 He was like, ""We're never even going to get there."" 9, 13, 14, 20 He finally just got mad and said he had to drive because I was going so slow. 13, 14 So, he drove and I managed to somehow get there without being too freaked out by it. 7, 15, 17, 20 So then, that is right in the middle of getting high all the time, which kind of relieves some of that. 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 At that age, all you can do is go get high in a car. 11, 14, 15, 20 We would just go drive around the country and stop some place and drink and get high. 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20 It was always in cars. 10, 14 AS: Right.  And therefore, accidents. 7 MS: Well you would think so, but it was just that one four-month period.  Even though I was way more intoxicated... yeah. 8 That's my life basically. 7, 8, 14, 17 And ultimately, one Christmas vacation my senior year, somebody I knew... 6, 11, 12, 16, 19 I can't remember who. 7, 13, 15 But they were dealing speed and he asked me if I wanted to help him out. 5, 10, 14, 18 So, I said, ""Sure."" 7, 13, 14 I had no money again, like usual. 7, 12 By doing so, if I sold it for this price, I would either get a little bit of money out of it and pay him this amount, or I could have some of the speed. 7, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20 So, I did both, kind of somehow. 17 I paid him what I owed him. 8 But I was doing speed consistently for Christmas break, so for maybe two weeks. 7, 10, 16 Which I had never done before. 13 AS: But now you had a steady supply. 17 And I ran out the day before school started and I didn't think that was a problem. 6, 7, 11, 15, 19 I didn't know there was such a thing as amphetamine withdrawal. 17, 19 So, I get to school the next day and I am crashing. 11, 16, 19, 20 That's what they call it, crashing. 14, 17 I had no energy, I actually pretty much passed out in my precalculus class with my favorite teacher. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 I'm on my desk and I am just asleep, and I hear a yardstick slam on the desk and I just kind of look up momentarily and I just went right back out. 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 So, he got me to the school nurse, which they still had. 7, 11 She sent me to the local doctor, Dr. Risser, who immediately sent me up to St. 12, 20 Mary's hospital again at Mayo. 8 And they think I've either got encephalitis or meningitis.  No one asks me anything about drugs or alcohol. 10, 12 AS: No one asked you anything? 12 MS: Not a word.  Not a single question. 7, 15 AS: So they do a spinal tap?  MS: Yeah, they did a spinal tap.  And I don't know what is going on. 17 I probably would not have said anything if they had asked, but I didn't know that amphetamine withdrawal did this to people. 12, 13, 14, 17 AS: Right.  And why would you tell them? 13 MS: So, I am just like, ""What the hell is going on with me?"" 9, 14 I thought it was the amphetamine, but I didn't know. 10, 17 So, I go through this whole thing. 19 The spinal tap leaks, which was probably because I was so debilitated. 12, 13 It meant that I got these horrible headaches every time I sit up or stand up because it was dripping out, not a lot, but it was. 7, 12, 16, 19 When you get a spinal tap, if you lose a little bit of fluid, which because of the pressure differentiation, it causes really bad headaches. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 20 It stuck around for a while because of the leak. 18 It should have gone away within a day or so. 19, 20 So, I can't sit up, I can't stand up, I gotta lay down or I'll get a terrible headache. 7, 12, 20 And they sent me home because there was nothing wrong. 6, 17, 19 They couldn't figure it out. 7 Now I'm fine, except for the headache, which they caused! 9, 12, 14 Right?  [laughter] 9 So, I go home... 17, 19 My mom would go out for whatever, go visit friends or go to the grocery store or something. 7, 13, 17 I would call my friend Dave and have him pick me up. 5, 13, 14, 17 I would lay in his old Chevy and I would go out and get high with him and then try and get back before my mom got back and pretend that I had been there the whole time. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 This goes on for a little while, and then the headaches went away. 12, 20 But I told my mother that the headaches went away and I told the school that I was still at home. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 Then I just didn't go to school and it was great, until my folks figured it out and then I had to go to school. 7, 8, 11, 17, 19 So I go to school. 11 AS: So at this point, you’ve never been caught by your parents? 7, 10, 12, 13 MS: They... my dad gave me his old Volkswagen when he got a new car, and they found in it that fall, before this Christmas break, some kind of a pipe for smoking pot and some papers. 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18 So, they assumed I was smoking pot. 10 I don't know what else they knew. 6, 8, 12, 17 AS: But did you get in trouble? 20 MS: I got in some trouble for that, but not much.  It was like, not that big of a deal. 9, 14 So, yeah, they had no clue the extent of it. 8 But they were getting increasingly concerned, I know that much. 7, 15, 17, 20 But it's a Finnish family, so they're not talking a whole lot. 6, 7, 19 And I want nothing to do with talking, with them about anything, but certainly not about this. 6, 14 So, I am playing this game and I go to school finally, but I'm still getting high every day. 7, 11, 15, 19, 20 But I'm attending at least.  I had a physics class and I really enjoyed that, too. 6, 7, 8, 12 The teacher asked me to go to the board to do these problems the day before we had a test. 7, 13, 19 I was the only one in the class who knew how to do them. 6, 12 And I'm up there writing them out... they were easy to do because I had done my homework the night before. 11, 17, 19 I had done some speed the night before, it was the first time since this happened. 5, 7, 10, 16, 19 I am at home, for some reason, I don't know why, so I did my homework. 7, 10, 17, 19 And I'm all prepared! 7 I'm up at the board writing it all down the next day. 16, 19 That night I went out and got wasted smoking pot, no speed, I don't know if there was alcohol. 10, 17, 19 I get to class the following day for the test, and the only thing that goes on my paper is my name. 6, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20 I cannot remember how to do the problems that I was up at the board doing the day before, because of the pot, you know. 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19 So, I am just ashamed of myself.  My grades haven't really shifted much. 6, 7, 8, 19 I was always kind of bored at school, it wasn't that difficult. 7, 10, 11 I didn't study, but I was always able to maintain them [grades]. 5, 10, 18, 19 Well, I couldn't.  I couldn't even answer one question. 15 I walked out of the class and I walked out of school and I was so ashamed. 6, 11, 12, 20 I just decided I wasn't going back. 8, 11, 17, 19 I didn't think it through that way, what I thought was ""I'm going to go get high and I am not going back."" 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 AS: Right.  You didn’t think you were ashamed.  I just left and it was over. 8, 19 I quit school that day without a declaration or anything. 11, 19 I just didn't go back. 11, 17, 19 I told my parents I wasn't going to go back. 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 I moved out of the house for a little bit, like two doors down at this older guy's basement. 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 I had no money. 7, 12 But did you have any fight with your parents, did they tell you you had to stay in school? 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 MS: Not really. 6, 7, 8 AS: So, you were just like “I’m quitting school and I’m moving out.” 9, 11, 14, 19 MS: Yeah, I think that was part of it. 8 If I left, they couldn't do anything about it, right? 8, 14, 19 So, I just left. 8, 19 And this family had very little money and they let me in. 7, 12, 19, 20 But I had no money and I'm just a freeloader, so that didn't last long. 7, 12 So, I moved back home, but I am now adamant that I'm not going to school. 11, 14, 17, 19 I think that's when they realized that this is really trouble. 6, 7, 8, 10 But it still goes on for quite a while before anything happens. 5, 7 And I am just dawn to dusk now. 17 Until late at night, I am just getting high all the time and hanging out with people doing the same—like I said, I had to. 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 But the shame and guilt is just massive.  I can't stand myself.  I don't know what's wrong. 6, 17 I don't know that it is the drugs and alcohol. 10, 17 In fact, I think that is the only relief I get. 7, 20 I really don't think that it is the problem. 6, 7, 8 I think there is a big problem. 7 I can't understand why I keep doing these things that I am so ashamed of, you know, stealing and lying. 5, 12, 17, 19 I've quit school, which I loved. 11, 17, 19 I've been kicked out of sports by this point, which I really loved. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17 And I don't know how to change any of this. 5, 17 I can't do anything about it, and that, I do not understand.  I'm not really even able to have plans, I couldn't figure out how to do it. 6, 7, 8, 18 I didn't know. 17 I didn't have a clue and I couldn't tell anybody. 13 I didn't want anyone to know how awful I felt. 6, 7, 14, 17 And then I got home at four in the morning one night and my mother wakes me up with the local doctor, Dr. Riser. 9, 10, 17, 19, 20 All I remember him saying is, ""Yeah, he's on something."" 7, 13, 14, 15 and then I passed back out. 9, 11, 17, 19 And I ran home from a friend's house that night at like four in the morning because I had been drinking and smoking pot and I had done some speed and I was scared I would not fall asleep if I didn't run home. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 I drank a lot to be sure that I could pass out, which was kind of what I had become. 7, 17, 18 That was my pattern, to try and pass out so I wouldn't lay there and think about myself, because it was so painful. 17 So, I get home and I pass out. 17, 19, 20 At six, they wake me up.  I am barely conscious. 7, 12 I go back out and I don't know when, but I wake up and the local minister and my mom wake me up and they say, ""We're going to the hospital."" 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 And I... I was just out of it.  It doesn't even occur to me that this is unusual.  I just put my clothes on, like, ""Okay, we're going to the hospital."" 8, 9, 14, 19 I wasn't going to talk to them or ask them questions. 6, 15 [laughter]. 9 So I get in the car and we drive, Stewartville is just south of Rochester. 14, 20 We drive to Rochester, thinking we're going to Mayo, that's where we always get our healthcare, but we don't. 7, 10, 14, 20 We go pick my dad up at IBM. 5 And then, we go north towards the Twin Cities.  And that's just weird.  AS: And you’re like, what’s going on? 7, 9, 14 MS: Well no, not really. 6, 7, 8 I am in this debilitated state. 17 Just kind of intoxicated and wiped out.  I learned later that the minister was right behind me in the car, thinking that if I jumped out, they would be able to grab me. 5, 8, 14, 16, 18 Which at the time, hadn't even crossed my mind. 6, 7, 16, 19 I'm not even thinking, let alone acting. 12 So, we get to Minneapolis/St. 20 Paul and I'm thinking, ""I wonder why we are going to a hospital in the Twin Cities."" 8 Those are the only thoughts I'm having. 10 Yeah, I was not thinking clearly or much. 6 Then we get passed the Twin Cities and that's when I got really frightened. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 17 Because in my understanding of what was going on with me, I just thought I was going crazy. 10, 17 That was my high school understanding of my behavior. 11, 17 I am just going crazy and that they finally figured it out. 7, 19 And now they are taking me to a sanitarium in the North Woods. 17 AS: Oh right, you think you’re going to a mental hospital? 7, 8, 14 MS: Right, yeah. 8 I don't know what it is. 17 I've never been to one, but I am just assuming that must be what they do with people like me. 13 But they kind of did!  They brought me here! 20 [laughter] 9 Not really, but you know. 6, 7, 8, 17 AS: No, but in your mind—yeah, what is this place? 6, 8 And here would be Hazelden.  MS: Yeah, I had never heard of Hazelden when we drove down the driveway and I saw the sign. 6, 7, 13, 14 I was like, ""What the hell is a Hazelden?"" 9, 14 AS: And the year is? 16 Right before Easter.  AS: And how old are you? 16 MS: I am seventeen.  Yeah, they put me in a room with a counselor, who is the first person who I have ever met in my life that actually knows what is going on with me. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 It is just uncanny to me.  I am shocked by this.  He knew addiction, right? 6, 8, 12, 14, 15 So, I am just wondering who told him this, because I never tell my parents any of this, they couldn't have told him this. 7, 12, 13, 16 No one could have told them this, I know that much. 12, 13, 16, 17 But he knows me somehow. 17 He knows what I have been going through and what I have been doing, in this really unusual way. 6, 7, 8, 17 And he is really pleasant and likable. 6, 7, 8, 18 And he kind of knows me. 17 So, I tell him some things that I have never told anyone. 5, 13, 16, 19 Not much, but at least a little bit that I am clearly an addict in his mind. 6, 15, 20 And he said, ""Okay."" and we finished the interview and we go out to meet my parents and there are a bunch of other people and they say that I've got to sign these papers, so I can stay and get treatment for chemical dependency, which was the terminology of the day. 7, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 And I say, because I am not staying here because I realize I am not going to do this, I probably thinking that I wouldn't get high today, I think I was. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 But it was mostly like, I do not want to stop getting high. 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 20 I certainly don't want to stay here. 14 I have never even heard of this. 7, 13, 14 And it's a threat in a way. 7 AS: Oh, absolutely.  MS: In a big way.  So, I refuse. 7, 9 And this is when my bluff was called because I don't think they could have done this, but my dad says, ""If you don't sign the papers, we're all going to meet in court and you will be forced in here."" 13, 14, 17 I don't believe that it could have happened, cause when I got into training later, that wasn't even possible in the Eighties. 5, 8, 9, 16 No, but I'm thinking when he said that, the last thing I want is to be in any legal situation, in court. 7, 13, 14, 19 You've got to be kidding! 15 I'm a drug addict! 10, 15 AS: Right.  What else could they find out about you? 8, 9 MS: Right.  I can't admit to this.  So, I can't go to court.  So, I say ""Okay."" and I sign the papers and I stay. 14 And I am put on the men's unit, in the original farm house that Hazelden started in, in 1949. 6, 9, 11, 15, 19 AS: That little white house? 9, 11, 15, 19, 20 That was a unit.  This building wasn't here, but the parts that were left of the other buildings were built in 1969. 8, 19 So, I am here in 1974, but they were still using the original farm house as a men's unit. 7, 9, 10, 11, 19 That's where they put me. 19 And I find out later that, that unit, called ""The Old Lodge"" was for people who had multiple treatments and really hardcore addicts. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 And they put me there because they didn't know what to do with a seventeen-year-old. 16, 17, 19 Because, five years later, I find out I was the first adolescent to ever be treated here. 5, 7, 9, 13, 16 And that's where they put me. 19 So, I am with all of these older guys, I am the youngest by a long shot. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 20 And I argue that I don't belong there at all. 7 AS: You spent time doing that? 7, 16, 19 MS: Yeah, well, two weeks. 8, 16 It wasn't a lot of time. 7, 16, 19 AS: Oh, you were only here for two weeks? 16 MS: I was here for four weeks, but the first two I argued. 16 You know, ""I do not belong here, I don’t have this chemical dependency."" 7, 17 I still have the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous that they gave me, and the Twelve by Twelve, the twelve steps and twelve traditions. 7, 12, 16, 18 In the margin of the first step in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, I have these little cryptic notes about why I don't belong here, why I'm not an alcoholic. 7, 10, 13, 16, 20 AS: That’s incredible. 7 [laughter]. 9 [laughter] 9 So, every day we would have to fill out something called a significant events sheet, just something we learned today or something we had experienced today. 5, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 And every day, mine was why I don't belong here. 7, 19 I am making my argument day in and day out, based on the books and my experience and what people say. 14, 15, 19 And I am fairly bright guy, and I am writing this up every day. 6, 8, 14, 19 And every morning, there was an intercom system that would say, ""Marvin Seppala, please come to the unit office."" 9, 14, 17, 18 [laughter] 9 It's my councilor, who sits me down to talk over my argument with me. 6, 7 It was never a bullying thing or us butting heads, he is just suggesting that my argument is not right. 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 And he is doing it in a way that makes sense, but I just don't care and I don't belong here anyways, so I'm not going to listen. 7, 9, 14, 18, 20 This is the wonderful thing about group therapy for addiction, actually, is that in the midst of this resistance on my part that I might be an addict, that I can't even see, I can absolutely see it in everyone else in the group. 5, 7, 8, 15, 18, 19 I mean they are describing it.  Even if they believe it or not, I can see it. 5, 9 I mean, they have given all of these examples, you know? 11, 17 They've described their life and they should be here because of what they have been doing. 7, 8 And they're a lot older, but they have lost their jobs, they have lost families, and all of these things. 5, 15, 16, 19 And I can see it in them. 5 And then it finally starts to dawn on me that all of these examples that I am using about them are the same examples in my life, you know. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17 Whether they have pointed it out or my councilors have pointed it out, or that I have thought it through, which was not much. 10 It is exactly the same.  It finally occurred to me. 7 I go to my councilor and tell him that I finally believe that I have this chemical dependency, whatever that is, and that I have to do something about it, and he kicked me out of his office. 9, 11, 13, 18 He said, ""You finally realized the only way out of here."" 7, 10, 13, 14 [Laughter]  Which truly wasn’t the case.  AS: But he thought you were pulling one over on him, he didn’t believe you at that point because you had been arguing so, so smartly. 9, 10, 20 MS: Oh, yeah. 8 Yeah, it was like that one day and then the next day it was like, ""Wait a minute."" 9, 14, 16, 19 So, I talked to my peers and they were like, ""Well it does seem like you kind of changed your tune about this."" 5, 6, 9, 13, 14 So, they just took me in, and they had all along. 7, 15 Which was the most amazing thing about being here, is that they accepted me, which wasn't happening much in my life. 5, 7, 8, 19 They understood what I was going through, which I wasn't telling anybody. 13 Not even my closest friends understood me. 6, 7, 13 And they valued what I said, which wasn't happening with anyone I knew. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 And they validated my experience, which I couldn't even understand because I didn't know what I was doing or why. 15, 17 They understood that and validated that for me.  They cared about me. 7, 14, 20 That is what got my attention. 6 In addition to that, the other counselor on the unit was Ed Jergins. 20 He was this really big, bald, Scandinavian. 6, 7, 8 And my dad and my grandfather are both bald Scandinavians, so I wanted nothing to do with Ed. 14 He scared me. 7, 14, 20 My father and my grandfather were pretty mean, stoic, Finns, right? 5, 7, 8, 14 So, I assume he is exactly the same.  He is bigger than those two.  So, I stay away from him. 14, 20 Then, I'm in group, and this was before that I even figured out that I had this. 7, 18, 19 Ed is sitting there and his eyes are closed and I assume this old guy is sleeping. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18 He was all drooped.  He is supposed to be the councilor and he looks like he is fast asleep. 11, 14 This guy is talking about his marriage and how he wants to get a divorce, and all of the sudden, Ed starts talking from this position. 6, 7, 14, 15, 17, 20 He raises his head and starts to open his eyes and he has heard every single bit of this. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 20 He wasn't sleeping at all. 7 And he expresses this most incredible statement about this guy. 6, 7, 17 Just this really supportive statement and then talks to the whole group in this incredibly loving manner and then he starts talking about love, which I have never heard a male talk about in my life. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 And that got my attention. 6 It was unbelievable. 18 Then after witnessing him do this a few times, and I realize that he talks about spirituality and love all the time, and that, I wanted that. 6, 7, 14, 16, 17, 19 I didn't want to get sober, but I wanted that. 14, 20 Then I wanted that and I wanted to get sober. 14, 20 And I was also starting to experience whatever that was from those guys who were really serious about getting sober too, at least the small group of guys I would stay up at night with and talk about things with. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20 Which was just amazing.  We’d talk about life, really, for the first time in my life. 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 I had a few friends that I could do that with on occasion, but it almost wasn't even real. 7, 13, 15 It was during this period in my life where I was just getting high all the time, so I'm just a mess anyways. 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 I don't know what I was saying or thinking. 14, 17 Sometimes I felt like there was really a bond there with Ed and with this group. 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 18, 19 So, I really decided that I've got to do something. 6, 7, 8 But that wasn't enough. 16, 20 I was scared to leave, because four weeks really isn't enough. 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 20 It goes by quick.  And it was four weeks, whether you needed it or not. 9, 16 It was twenty-eight days back then, and that was it. 11, 17, 18, 19 There was no follow up of any kind for a seventeen-year-old in Rochester, Minnesota. 16 They told me to go to AA. 13, 16 This is the only thing, this is it. 19 There wasn't anything else. 8 There really wasn't anything else in 1974. 6, 7, 8 So, they told me to go to AA, and they would have anyway, but that was the only thing. 13, 16, 19 And there is no AA in Stewartville.  So, I get back. 11, 17, 19, 20 They get me back into high school and back into my house with my family. 7, 9, 11, 17, 19, 20 I wasn't really out of the house, that was part of the deal, I would live at home. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 19 I went back to school and they told me not to hang out with my old friends because they are all using. 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 So, this is a long time in the early part of my life... 6, 7, 8, 16, 19 That’s okay. 14 We’re good if you’re good. 6, 7, 19 MS: Good deal, okay. 14 So, I go to school and it's a small town and a small school. 11, 12 One hundred in my graduating class. 6, 12 The people who I am not supposed to hang out with, I just stay away from. 5, 14, 20 I am trying to do it.  And the people who don't use drugs, especially, they want nothing to do with me. 8, 9, 10, 14 And there were all of these rumors about where I had gone and what I had done.  Just wild rumors.  People had told their kids to stay away from me. 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 You know, it was a small town. 12, 17 So, I am kind of ostracized.  AS: You are alone. 12 MS: Yeah, I was alone. 12 And it hit me rather quickly. 5, 19 I was already sensitive to such things anyway, and I never really felt like I had belonged that much. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 18, 19 I had some friends that were kind of close, but very few and they were all using, so I couldn't hang out with them anyway. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13 But on the weekend before I left, that prior week before I left treatment, I really worried about going home. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 I don't know that I am ready. 7, 17, 18 I am just really scared but I just really want to leave. 6, 7, 8, 14, 20 Both are going through my head. 12 And I see an ad for a Marshall Tucker Band concert in the Twin Cities. 5 So, I decide, that is a great idea, which is really the last thing I should be doing because I had never gone to a concert without being wasted. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 19 Somehow, I don't know how it happened, I think it was after I got home, I convinced my best friend using Dave, that we should go see Marshall Tucker. 5, 10, 13, 17, 19 And this is after these few days of trying to be alone, I decide I am going to go to something with Dave and go see Marshall Tucker. 5, 12, 18, 19 So, we get tickets. 20 As we are driving to Minneapolis/St Paul, he is driving, and smoking pot and drinking. 10, 15, 18, 19 And I am sitting there and telling him all about treatment and why I can never use again. 7, 9, 13, 18 I am like lecturing the whole way to Minneapolis/St.  Paul and  I tried also to convince him, because he is my best friend who is doing exactly what I do, that he has to stop as well, right? 8, 13, 14 So, he doesn't buy that at all. 20 He doesn't argue with me because most of what I am saying seems to make sense to him, just not for him. 5, 9, 14, 18 So, we get to the concert, we meet some other people there. 20 And there's pot being passed up and down the row and a joint comes by and I took it and smoked it. 9, 10, 17 I took some, and then more, and then had some beer, and I don't know what else. 8, 17, 20 I was just right back to where I was, just like that. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 Not any thought about it. 10 Didn't even feel bad about it until later. 5, 13, 16, 18 When we get in the car and we're going back, I finally realize what I have done. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20 I think I was trying to convince myself in telling Dave not to let anybody know that this has happened. 5, 13, 17 That was how I was all along anyway. 7, 15 I tried so hard to not let anyone know about this, so I could live this double life of getting good grades, at least when I was in school, until I quit, and getting still high. 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 17, 19, 20 So, I'm telling him that he can't tell anybody. 13 And I am kind of thinking that I won't keep doing this. 17 I was right back at it the next day with him. 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 And everything I had told him on the way up was like a distant memory. 13, 16 I was just off and running. 8, 9 I got to go through the graduation ceremony with my class but I didn't get a diploma. 6, 7, 12, 20 I did go to school until graduation. 11 I showed up. 9 They even let me on the track team and I was pretending to.... 5, 7 I was smoking cigarettes and pot and drinking. 7, 10, 15, 19 I was a mess.  AS: Did your parents ever clue in that you were using again? 7, 10, 12, 13 MS: They really figured it out and they disowned me and kicked me out. 6, 7, 8, 11, 19 They told me they wouldn't pay for my education. 13, 16, 18 MS: Just a few weeks after the graduation ceremony. 7, 16 So, in June.  They got me a job with our next-door neighbor who was a contractor and I quit going. 16, 17, 19 I never quit a job and I never got fired, I just never showed up. 7, 9, 13, 19 So, I had some other job after they booted me out at Crenlo that built tractor cabs in Rochester. 7 When they kicked me out, I took my Volkswagen, threw my stuff in it and moved to Rochester. 7, 11, 14, 15 You can call that a move when you drive eleven miles without a place to land and just bum from friend to friend and live out of the car. 8, 11, 13, 14, 17 I got this job at Crenlo and then I quit going there. 7, 19 Every time I would just some money and get high and not go back. 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 I had no thoughts about a future, really. 6, 7, 8, 10 I just assumed I was going to die really young. 6, 7, 8 I didn't think I would survive.  Not graduating from high school was kind of meaningless, in spite of the fact that I had been to treatment. 7, 11, 13, 18 That was the only thing-- like I said, I hated lying in bed without being able to fall asleep. 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 Well, it was even worse now, because I knew there was another way for me. 6, 12, 17 Morning and evening were really bad. 6, 7, 8 I failed to mention that my girlfriend at the time, Linda, came to treatment and visited me. 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 And so did Wayne, the guy in that car accident. 6, 14 They were the only two people.  She was the only girl who came to visit, besides my family. 7, 12, 13, 17, 19 And she and I were dating afterwards as well. 8 She didn't know what to make of all of this. 17, 18 She thought I shouldn't use because of what I had been told, but she didn't know anything about it either, except what I told her, basically. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17 Which when I was in treatment, was pretty accurate. 5, 7, 13, 14, 18 So, I'm kind of living with her more than the other people at the time. 6, 7, 16, 19 My dad was at IBM, so I knew they wouldn't give me a job. 6, 11, 12 Mayo and IBM were the two primary employers. 20 So, I go to Mayo and I apply to be a janitor and they sent me away. 20 They didn't have a job.  I lied and said I graduated from high school. 11, 13, 14 Two weeks later, they called my mom and got a hold of Linda who found me, and they said to go back in for an interview. 5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 They sent me over to a cardiovascular research lab where I am hired by David Donald, who is this world-famous physiologist, as a lab technician. 7, 12, 14 So, the way I look at this, I said I was attracted to Ed and his discussions of love and spirituality, and the same discussions I had with people in treatment. 7, 13, 14, 17, 18 I look at it as even before I started to care for myself, I was being cared for in really miraculous ways. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 I get into treatment when I was seventeen, when I shouldn't even be there. 7, 13, 18, 20 Then, I get this job. 20 I stayed sober for five days after treatment. 7, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 I get this job and I stayed sober for two weeks. 14, 16, 20 And my intent was just to stay sober. 14 I tried as hard as I could and it lasted two weeks. 6, 16 On the first day on the job, it was an animal surgery lab, so we were studying a lot about hypertension and its causes and cardiac function and stuff. 5, 9, 14, 16, 19 People from all over the world came to work under Dr. Donald and John Shepard, who were the two leaders of the lab that I was assigned to. 12, 13, 17 Dr. Donald is this eccentric old physiologist. 16 He was trained as a veterinarian, but he became a physiologist and helped invent the heart-lung machine. 6, 13, 14, 17, 18 John  Shepard was the president of the American Heart Association at the time and he was on the board of governors and the board of trustees at the Mayo Clinic. 6, 7, 9, 16, 19 He was really one of the top administrators, the top docs in the whole place, and famous world-wide for research. 6, 7, 8, 12 So, suddenly, there is this drug addict working in their lab. 10, 15, 17 On the first day that I was there... 16, 19 AS: Who’s eighteen?  At this time I had turned eighteen. 7, 16, 18, 19 At the end of the day when they were orienting me to the job, it wasn't them, it was the other technicians, one of the technicians said, ""And there's the drug cabinet and you have to make sure that it is locked at the end of the day."" 7, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 [laughter] 9 AS: That was your job to make sure it was locked? 7, 18 MS: Yeah, it was one of my jobs. 15 Yeah, and I'm thinking, there's no one that is going to pay more attention to that cabinet. 6, 12, 18 So, I last two weeks and we were studying cocaine. 5, 10, 16 I was weighing out cocaine for experiments. 10 Cocaine is a vasoconstrictor and it does it in a very specific manner.  We were studying how veins and arteries constricted and cocaine helped us to understand that process, physiologically to figure it out. 5, 7, 14, 17, 18 So, I took some.  Then I just took more and more, and over a few-weeks-period, I am just addicted to cocaine, in a way that I have never been addicted to anything. 10, 13, 15, 16 I am using a lot of it because I can just grab it out of the cupboard. 10 It's right back to something that isn't being paid for. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 AS: And it’s not being monitored? 7 MS: No one is monitoring it. 12 I am the only one monitoring it. 12 There is no monitoring of any kind.  AS: Did you ever find out how you got this job? 9, 13 I have no idea. 5 Dr. Shepard was out of the country when Dr. Donald hired me. 7, 10 So, he hired me. 7 AS: But you had applied to be a janitor?  MS: I did, I applied to be a janitor.  So, actually, the day I started is when they told me about the drug cabinet. 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 The next day, second day at work, I realize that I have got to tell them that I haven't graduated from high school. 7, 11, 13, 16, 19 I didn't tell Dr. Donald, I went to the HR department and said, ""I haven't graduated from high school."" 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 I didn't say that I lied, but I did. 14 I made up another lie about why I didn't, this big family problem of some sort of why I missed half of my senior year. 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 19 I don't mention that I went to addiction treatment or anything. 7, 8, 13, 15, 18 They still give me the job. 7, 11 They didn't even balk.  They we're just like, ""It's okay."" 9, 14 I don't have a clue how this happened. 5 I knew no one who worked at Mayo, no one in my family. 6, 7, 12, 19 I can only say again that I think I was being taken care of. 7, 14, 20 So, I just plummet with my addiction and I miss a week of work. 8, 12, 15, 16 Which doesn't seem like a lot, but I knew they warned me that I had a three-month probationary period. 5, 6, 12 They could fire me or I could just leave, no questions asked. 7, 15 Which I kind of liked, because that is how I left jobs anyways, but I didn't know that I was going to like this job. 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 19 It turns out from the first moment I walked into that lab, I loved this job. 15, 16, 17, 20 It was like unbelievable to me. 18 I was stimulated in a way that I hadn't ever been in my whole life. 5, 7, 8, 13, 19 AS: And you were just mostly cleaning things up, and helping? 5, 7, 15, 16, 18, 19 But around things you were interested in. 5, 7, 19 MS: Well, yeah. 8 I had to assist in surgery on animals, mostly dogs but sometimes cats. 5, 7, 12, 16, 19 I would stand right across from the doctor or some fellows from all over the world. 8, 12, 14, 20 I was either assisting a fellow or Dr. Donald.  And they would tell me about the experiments and they would tell me what we were doing and why. 13 It was just fascinating to me.  I wanted to learn about it. 5, 14 Physiology, I found really interesting. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 It explains things, right? 5, 8, 14, 19 I just found it incredible and I really liked these people too. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 They cared about me. 7, 14, 20 It was somewhat similar to my experience in treatment, but remarkably, there wasn't really anything at an interpersonal level, but it was in a way because it was more about knowledge. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 But they also cared about me in other ways, like how come I'm not seeking college? 5, 7, 14, 17, 20 And what do you think about going on to school someday? 11, 19 Even at the very beginning.  Dr. Donald in the interview asked me how long I would commit to the lab. 7 I remember this question because that prior summer, I had gone to a recruiting thing in the Twin Cities with a friend to join the army. 7, 13, 15, 17, 19 I was so desperate.  The Vietnam War was over, but it was still a mess. 7 They put us up in a hotel and of course we just drank and goofed off. 18, 19 I had a physical the next day and in the physical, my hearing was inadequate. 14, 16, 19 I had hearing loss that I didn't know about until that moment. 14, 15, 17 So, they told me that I would have to sign a release if I wanted to be in the army because they didn't want to cover my hearing. 7, 13, 14, 16 So, I just couldn't imagine that.  For some reason, that stopped me. 7, 10, 15, 17 I didn't want to sign this release. 7, 14 But Dave went into the army.  My best friend. 13 So, I tell Dr. Donald that I just recently looked into going into the army for two years, so I'll stay two years. 7, 13, 14, 16 That was as far as I could think about my life. 7, 8, 9 You've gotta be kidding me, how long am I going to stay here?? 7, 14, 15 Two years. 16 I told him the story even, I just looked into going into the army but I couldn't because I have a hearing loss and I couldn't do it without a release and I didn't think that was wise. 7, 13, 14, 16 So, it turns out that he was in the Royal Airforce.  He didn't tell me that then, I learned it later. 5, 13, 16 Way later, at that talk that you said you were watching, after I gave that talk and I walked behind the stage, and a woman from Mayo's development department, a young woman, came up to me. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 I had just seen Saturday Night for the second time ever. 5, 7, 13, 16, 19 And she tells me that my father and I have just bought Dr. Donald's old house, that he had died and had donated his house to Oxbow Park in Biren, Minnesota, just outside of Rochester, because it was right adjacent from the park. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 He is a really eccentric guy. 6, 7, 8 He just lived out in the woods and he was really odd that way. 6, 7, 8, 11, 16 She said that we're going to turn it into a halfway house. 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20 She said because my father is in recovery and he wants to do that and I am going to help him with this because it is really important to me as well. 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18 And Dr. Donald was in recovery from alcoholism. 7, 8, 10 Well, he wasn't in recovery when I met him because on rare occasion, he had a terrible tremor in the morning doing surgery. 7, 8, 9, 12 I noticed it just a few times, but somehow, we connected. 7, 16, 17, 19 Most of these fellows came there to work under him and John Shepard, but none of them could really get along with him. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20 And I got along with him fantastic. 7, 8, 15 Somehow, he hires me. 7 I have no clue.  I always tell people that I think he was playing a joke on John Shepard because Shepard was out of the country. 10, 13 I never saw him out of three-piece suit. 6, 13 He's like Mr. Clean.  Dr. Donald wore a white lab coat and had white athletic tape around his shoes holding them together. 7, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 He is just this eccentric, brilliant guy. 6 So, I always thought, ""What the hell, he just hired me so he could give Shepard a hard time with this hippy drug-addict kid."", that he didn't know was a drug addict at the time. 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I had long hair, I didn't look like anyone else in the lab. 7, 8 [laughter] 9 AS: So, you miss a week of work? 16 MS: Yes, I miss a week of work and I am so scared to lose the job, I am getting desperate. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 AS: Were you taking cocaine home with you? 10, 17, 19 MS: Yeah, I had a big supply that I grabbed.  So, I was gone but I still had a supply. 7, 12 My folks had disowned me. 17 I didn't get back into the house for two years. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: Really?  That’s hardcore. 6, 7 After a while, it was both parties’ kind of contributing. 8 Like, I wasn't going to go back there either. 11, 17, 19 There was no invitation either.  AS: That’s hard. 6 It was also probably good for my siblings because I was stealing from them too. 6, 12, 13, 19 I was just a disaster.  And I was certainly not being the role model of the kind that they needed. 9, 14 I never talked to my father, but in this desperation, I called him, which still kind of surprises me when I say it even. 6, 7, 13, 14, 17 I tell him exactly what is going on. 13 I am stealing cocaine from the Mayo Clinic, I am scared 7, 10, 14, 20 I am going to lose this great job and I don't want to lose it, and I don't know what to do. 7, 8, 13, 14, 17 He had, in the meantime since I had last seen him when he kicked me out, helped start this adolescent counseling center in Rochester and he was on the board of it. 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19 It was for kids with drug and alcohol problems. 7, 10, 15 AS: Really?  It was called Sunrise. 13, 14, 17 He says, ""I'll meet you tonight and we'll talk about this."" 6, 14, 17, 19 I tried to put it off because I didn't want to talk to him. 6, 14, 19 I would call, but that was as far as I was going to go. 9, 14, 17 And I am thinking, if I meet him tonight, then... 19 I can't use. 9 So, I don't want to meet him tonight. 14, 19 Somehow, I agreed. 7 We meet and then he brings me to Sunrise and he says that I can talk to somebody there about this. 6, 14, 17 And he knows that he is not the right person, too. 8, 10, 14, 17 I meet Jane, a counselor, who talks to me and I go back the next night and I don't do any cocaine. 6, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20 And I go back the next night, and I don’t do any cocaine, and I realize that this place just opened and that she was a social worker. 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I learned that later when she worked at Hazelden and so did I. 5, 12, 16 [laughter] 9 But I realized that I know more about she does about addiction. 7, 8, 10, 15, 17 More than anyone there does, just from my one month of treatment, I know way more than they know. 7, 13, 17, 18 And, in treatment, they told me the only thing that is going to work is going to AA and I have not done that. 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 So, I go there one night that first week and I tell them that this is not going to work for me. 13, 16, 19 I don’t think this is going to work for me.  I didn't tell them that I think I know more about it than they do… 13, 17 I felt like I did. 6 I think I actually did, honestly. 6, 12, 18 I am going to go to AA like they told me to when I was in treatment. 7, 13, 16, 18 [End of Part I, beginning of Part II]  MS: So, I say that I am going to go to AA. 14 And I am sure they are thinking that this guy is not going to AA, right? 6, 7, 8, 14 They think that I am just going to go get high again and then he is gone. 11, 12, 20 And I didn't go back, so they never found out actually, until I met her much later. 5, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: So, did you start going to AA? 6 I went to an AA meeting that Sunday morning in this club house, the only one that I was aware of at the time in Rochester. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19 I don't think there was another one. 12 It was on Third Avenue.  There were three guys there over seventy. 6, 8, 15 That was their group? 18 MS: That was the group I walked into. 18, 20 Yeah, and I don't know what they said, I cannot remember. 7, 13, 14, 15, 17 But I went back the next Sunday. 11, 16, 17, 19 AS: There was only one a week? 16 MS: That's all that was recommended. 7 Once a week. 16 That’s what people did back then. 11, 17, 19 AS: So, we're in the state of Minnesota in 1974... MS: 1974... 17 MS: No, it was '74 still. 7 AS: Okay, still. 7 MS: And people went to one AA meeting a week. 6, 16 That is what they did and that is what they told me. 13, 16 Come on back next week. 11, 16, 17, 19 AS: Interesting, that is a new thing for me to know. 6, 7, 17, 19 MS: That was reinforced over time too. 7, 16, 19 If things are really, really bad, maybe you go to another one. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19 Maybe you call your sponsor and talk to people. 6, 13, 14, 17 But you couldn't really go to another one. 6, 7, 8, 12 AS: This is something that I will have to look up again, to understand when did it become that you should go every day. 17, 18, 19 MS: Because I moved around with school, you know, so all the sudden I was in places where people went a lot. 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20 I didn't know about that transition. 7, 17 I'll let you know when I find out. 9, 17 [laughter] 9 MS: So, I go back and these guys... 6, 8, 11, 15, 17, 19 I mean, I felt really connected with these guys. 6, 7, 8, 15 It was that same description in treatment. 7, 13, 18 They understood me, they accepted me, they validated me, they valued what I had to say. 14 I hardly talked, but they listened. 6, 13 They supported me and cared for me in ways that I was completely lacking. 7, 9, 14, 20 I hadn't had experience with it, so I went back. 11, 15, 17, 19 And whatever I wasn't getting at Sunrise, I got at AA that morning. 9, 15, 20 I know I got it. 17 I got there out of pure desperation. 7 I called my dad, I went to this Sunrise place. 8, 13, 14, 17 I walk into AA, which I was supposed to do after treatment months before. 7, 11, 13, 14, 18 AS: Right, but how would you have been able to do that given where you were? 11, 18 You went right back home. 8, 11, 14, 17, 19 You were set up to fail.  MS: Right.  Right back to the home where everything went on and school where everything went on. 11, 17, 19 So, AA was like an oasis or something for me.  These people really understood me and really cared for me. 6, 7, 8, 14, 20 The meeting grew rather quickly, so it came to be men and women. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 19 There were several women in this meeting. 6, 12, 13 It never got big, twelve or fourteen people maybe. 13, 16 But there was a police officer, a real-estate agent, and a teacher. 7, 11, 15, 17, 18 A couple of docs started showing up, a nurse was there. 6, 7, 9, 15 There was nobody my age. 15 Nobody even close. 6, 13 So, I was going to AA, staying sober, working in the lab, and then trying to figure out what to do with myself. 5, 7, 14 I was living with Linda by this time. 6, 7, 16, 19 I learned how to fly-fish with a guy who worked in a different lab. 5, 6, 7, 12, 18 I always wanted to fly-fish for some reason. 7, 10, 14, 17 I was doing that a lot in the spring and summer, because I could. 17 I did it by myself because I had no other friends my age, really. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15 There were two other guys, one worked in the lab and one worked with the animals in the kennels and stuff that were close to my age. 6, 8, 12, 13, 15 One was about my age and the other was a little bit older. 15, 16, 20 So, they kind of became friends, but beyond that, I was mostly by myself and with Linda, trying to stay sober, going fishing or whatever. 5, 7, 13, 14, 17 And the meeting grew and because I was so young, there was a lot of parenting in addition to everything else that goes on in AA. 6, 7, 8, 19 MS: Yeah, just because... because, I was a kid. 15 AS: Group parenting. 7 It was great. 7, 8 I know in a lot of treatment now, it is important to separate adolescents from adults, but there's something to it. 7, 13, 17, 18 I really got a lot out of it. 6, 7, 8 So, I am going weekly and I am going on six months. 11, 16 I am feeling better than I have in my life. 7, 8, 13, 17, 18 My job is great. 7, 8 I am just having a ball at work, in a lot of ways.  I am getting close to a couple of these fellows and I really enjoy my work and I really got it down. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 20 I am able to learn some stuff too. 5, 18 One thing that Dr. Donald did, two things: 5, 19 At the end of an experiment, after animal surgery, you know it is just a mess. 17 So, my job is to clean it all up, right? 8, 14, 15, 16 And wash all of the instruments and prepare for the next day, for the next surgery. 7, 16, 19 But, if he did the experiment or if it was in his lab, he stayed and did all of that with me or with the other technician. 14, 16 If he stayed, the fellows stayed. 14, 16 So, it was this whole group of people gets done really quick and everybody goes to their offices except us and we stay in the lab to go do other things, because there is a lot to do. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20 And when he didn't stay, the fellows all disappeared too. 7, 14 There were no rules about this of any kind, but it was absolute. 13 If he wasn't there, they didn't stay. 14 He was remarkable that way. 7, 18 And then we had a Monday morning lab meeting, every Monday morning. 6, 9, 19 And they would present their research and they would present their speeches they were about to give at conferences. 7, 11, 12 They would just talk, have these remarkable discussions about physiology and about what they were doing and ideas. 5, 6, 7, 18 What else we can do? 8 How can we solve this problem? 7 For me, it was just fantastic. 8 It was just fascinating.  In one of the early meetings that I attended, Dr. Donald presented a talk he was about to give at a major medical conference. 6, 7, 11, 12 It was something about cardiac physiology. 14 So, he presents the whole thing and usually when they presented, then everyone there, the six or seven people in the room, would start asking questions and commenting about the topic. 6, 7, 9, 15, 19 He immediately stopped and then said, ""Marvin, what did you get out of my talk?"" 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 And I'm like, ""What?"" 9, 14 I'm still... 7 I have no self-confidence, I am really shy. 5, 6, 7, 8 I don't want to answer this question. 14, 15 But I do, I tell him what I got out of the talk, you know? 6, 13, 17 I am wondering, why would he ask me?  In the process of asking me, he engaged me. 15 You know? 17 I am a part of this team, which was amazing. 5, 8 I felt that, too. 6 And after I said my answer, he said, ""That's good, I'm glad because I am going to be talking to a group of physicians that are not physiologists and I gotta be sure that I can explain it in a way that they will understand. 6, 7, 13, 14, 18, 19 [laughter] 9 And I'm like, ""Wow. 9, 14 This is incredible."" 7 I was valued in a way that I didn't expect.  It was just an amazing experience. 15 So, I am being influenced by science in the lab, but also by people and caring. 14 And in AA I am being influenced by the Twelve Steps and love and spirituality, I think. 17 My life grows in all of those spheres. 7, 8 I am six months in and, like I said, I am feeling better than I ever have in my life. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18 I miss a Sunday morning. 9, 19 I just don't go.  I didn't consciously decide not to go, I don't even know why I didn't go. 17 I was just feeling so good I didn't go, thinking that I didn't really have to. 6, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19 Sunday, I miss. 19 Monday, I open the cabinet, grab some cocaine and walk to the bathroom. 9, 10, 12, 19, 20 And it wasn't even on my mind. 6 There was no deliberate plan of any kind.  What I didn't recognize in that moment, is that those three guys at the first meeting, had died in that six-month period. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17 They were like these angels. 9, 14 They just disappeared. 7 They died. 17 And I didn't even think of it, it didn't even occur to me that this was an issue or a problem for me. 7 I was so self-focused, so self.... 5, 9 I didn't go to funerals, I didn't even think of them, I didn't do anything because I didn't think it bothered me a bit. 7, 20 AS: But you knew that they had died? 6, 12, 17 And There I was using. 10 I didn't think that had anything to do with it.  It took me years to figure out... which is weird to say that. 7, 14, 16 AS: No, I think that is perfectly normal. 18 MS: [laughter] 9 Yeah, maybe that has something to do with it. 16 So, I had been meaning to ask this guy John to be my sponsor. 6, 13 And the reason I hadn't is because I hadn't done anything besides just show up at the meeting. 6, 7, 9, 10, 17 I didn't read about it, I didn't socialize with anyone, I didn't do any of the steps. 7, 12, 16, 18 AS: Was John one of the three?  MS: No, luckily.  John was like thirty-five, I guess. 19 He had five years sober and I always liked what he said. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 I just liked listening to him. 9, 14 He kind of talked from a similar spiritual perspective that I thought of. 6, 10, 13 And so, I did the cocaine and I walked back into the lab and... this is the worst day of my life. 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 19, 20 Six-months and I am no longer sober, and to me, I tried treatment and that didn't work, my own efforts got me two weeks, and AA got me six. 7, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 That doesn't work either.  And they didn't tell me anything else that I could do. 8, 13 There is nothing else that works. 8 There is nothing else. 8 I don't know of anything else. 8, 17 I was never exposed to anything else. 8, 13 I think that I am hopeless. 13 I did as much as cocaine as I possibly could, more than any other day in my life. 7, 8, 19 I didn't even notice it because the pain was so bad of losing that, of what I had.  So, I call John from the lab and he worked just a few blocks away in downtown Rochester. 12, 14, 17, 20 I didn't know that, but he said that he was just three blocks away from me. 13, 14, 17, 20 He said, ""Come on over to my office."" 13, 14, 18 I lied and said, ""I can't, I have to stay and work until 5. 13, 14 So, I am doing as much cocaine as I can and this doesn't work. 10 The pain doesn't go away. 20 So, I go to his office at five o'clock. 18 He has to coach his son's pee-wee football team out in Biren, so he asked me to follow him. 5, 7, 17 So, we talked just really briefly and I just sit on the sideline and watch him coach football. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15 Then we go to his house. 9, 11 I tell him what I just told you. 13, 16 I went to treatment, that didn't work. 7, 13, 18 AA doesn't work either.  And thank god, John says, ""You know Marv, AA works fine, you just haven't started."" 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17 And he said, ""You come to the meetings, but you're not working the steps, you're not reading the books, you're not talking to anybody, you're not sharing yourself with anybody. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 You need to start doing that. 6 AA works fine. 8, 14 I'm proof.""  So, I said, ""Okay."" 13, 14 And I did exactly what he said. 13, 14 I mean, when I say exactly, he gave me this worksheet. 8, 14, 18 He went to Hazelden, too.  Which was also partially why I was attracted to him as a sponsor. 8, 13 This sheet was a ten-step inventory sheet. 16 So, it had thirty-one days across the top and all of these columns and rows that had on one side, a list of liabilities, and the other side, a list of assets. 9, 18, 19 The liabilities were like laziness, dishonesty.... they were listed there, like twenty or twenty-five adjectives. 6, 12 And then the assets were their opposites, basically. 7, 14, 17 He said, ""Fill this out every night."" in addition to everything else that he told me to do. 8, 13, 14, 16, 19 And I filled it out every night for five years, because I was so scared that I would relapse. 7, 14, 16, 19, 20 And then it got so wrote I had to change it around. 5, 18 But, early on, in those first months, I had a black and white description of my behavior to look at. 6, 11, 15, 16, 19 I was putting a ""X"" by dishonesty every single day, day in and day out. 6, 7, 12, 19 And lazy, and other things. 5, 19 I could see it. 5 I didn't have a sense of my own behavior and that gave it to me. 9, 18 AS: What were you being dishonest about every day? 6, 12, 19 I just couldn't be honest. 6, 12 I was so dishonest for so long that it was almost a ritual. 6, 7, 12, 15 Most of the time it didn't even make sense to be dishonest anymore, but I did. 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 So, John, he kept telling me, ""You know Marv, this is an honesty program."" 6, 8, 12, 13, 17 And that's all he would say. 14 It wasn't done in a confrontative way, it was just, ""Marv, this is an honesty program."" 6, 8, 12 And I would think, ""Well, why would you tell me that?"" 13 [laughter] 9 And he kept doing it.  And finally, I realized, because I am looking this end, hearing this question, that I am always dishonest. 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15 It's time to do something about it. 7, 16, 19 He was an ideal person for me. 5, 10, 17 He never confronted me. 13 I would tell him something going on in my life, like I'm having trouble with my girlfriend Linda, or whatever. 7, 8, 12, 13 And he would just tell me some story from his life. 7, 8, 13 It would always have some connection to what I was talking about. 6, 10, 18 But he wasn't analytical.  You hear that a lot of people in AA are always just really, ""Go work Step Two."" 6, 7, 8, 10, 14 It was never like that with John, it was just like, ""Well, this is what I did."" 9, 13, 14 [laughter] 9 AS: That is really great. 6, 7, 8 MS: And I think for an adolescent, if he would have been telling me what to do, I don't know what I would have done. 13, 17 He had kids just a little younger than me. 6, 15, 16, 20 He had a daughter that was maybe two years younger than me-- the oldest. 5, 6, 16 And then maybe two sons after her. 16, 17 I don't know what he was like at home really, but I wasn't that much different that his own kids. 6, 7, 8, 15, 17, 18, 19 AS: How long did you stay with him? 7, 14 MS: I don't even remember. 7, 13, 15 A long time. 7, 16, 19 AS: So, you stayed in Rochester? 14, 16 What did you end up doing?  MS: So, I stayed in the lab and then these docs kept asking me what I was going to do with my life, suggesting that I go to school. 7, 8, 11, 14, 16 Especially the fellows would talk like that with me. 6 I got this envelope in the inner-clinic mail, you know? 17 Those yellow envelopes.  It was addressed to Dr. Marvin Seppala. 7, 9 I still have it actually. 7, 18 Someone just made a mistake and put that on there. 13, 19, 20 And I had already been thinking that I liked what these guys do, and so I started thinking that I wanted to be a doctor like them. 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 20 So, I go to John one day and I tell him, ""You know, John. 13, 17, 19 I gotta go to college because I want to be a doctor."" 14, 20 And this is within my first year of recovery. 7, 8, 16 Most recommendations are don't do anything big in your first year. 7, 16 But I'm not paying attention to that, I really think that I should go to college. 6, 7, 8, 18 I've wanted to go to college in some points in my life but I didn't think it was possible. 7, 8, 10, 14 During my use I had just given up on it. 9, 11 It was not going to happen. 5 Now, it was like, maybe I could go to college. 9, 14, 16 And if John were to have doubted me in any way though, or doubted my ability to do it, I would have just crumbled.  And he knew me as a high school drop-out. 6, 11, 12 High school drop-out, works at Mayo, comes to AA, that's it. 8, 11, 17 So, I don't know what he was thinking when I say that I decide that I want to be a doctor. 14, 17, 20 But he said, ""You know Marv, if it is God's will, it will happen."" 5, 13, 14, 17 That's how he answered me. 7 Those are his exact words.  And I thought, wow, I guess that it is true. 10, 14, 19 If it is God's will, it will happen. 5 So, I just hung on to it.  I started looking into schools and trying to figure out where I wanted to and how I was going to do it. 6, 7, 11, 14, 15 My parents, I didn't even ask for money. 7, 12 I hadn't even seen them. 5, 13 I had talked to my dad that one time and that was it. 6, 7, 13, 16, 19 And I assumed they wouldn't help because they said they wouldn't help. 13, 14, 18 And my younger brother was off at college at the University of Minnesota and we didn't really have a lot of money, so I kind of thought that there was no use even going down that path. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 I hadn't had any contact with them.  I assumed they would stick with what they said. 13, 14 So, my kids are in their thirties now, and they both applied to multiple schools, right? 8, 11, 14, 15, 17 Like eight schools or something. 11 And I decided in the end... 8 I talked to one of the fellows a little bit about applying to college, but I didn't really talk much about it. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 20 I just decided that I was just going to do it on my own for some reason. 7, 8, 10, 17 Just stupidly, you know? 17 So, I apply to one school. 11 I apply to St. Olaf and I decide if I get in, I get in and if I don't, I don't. 20 And I got in.  So, on my one-year anniversary from that six-month relapse, I walk into my first classes. 6, 7, 12, 16 The neat thing is that I was in this dorm with all of these guys and they are all coming to college like it is some free-for-all, and I'm trying to stay sober. 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 19 So, I go back to Rochester on a lot of weekends because I want to go to AA on Sunday morning, which I don't tell them, but I might have told some of them. 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 I went to an AA meeting in town, in Northfield, too. 6, 20 I was still dating Linda. 7 And those guys, like one time, I was studying in the library all evening, which I did a lot of because my memory was just kind of shot. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19, 20 By the end of the first semester though, it was beginning to be quite good. 6, 16, 19 It took a lot of effort.  And I walked back to the dorm and in the entry was a big lobby and they were having a Christmas Party. 11, 17, 19, 20 I start for the punch because it is supposed to be a dry campus. 6, 14 That's laughable. 18 It wasn't a dry campus at all.  There were drugs and alcohol everywhere. 7, 10, 13 But five guys come out of all corners of the room as I am walking towards the punch and grab me, ""Marv! Marv! 6, 8, 9, 15, 17 We spiked the punch!  We spiked the punch!  Stay away from it!"" 20 One time, the second semester, I was somehow... 7, 16, 17, 19 I don't know what was going on, I can't explain it, I don't remember what was happening. 5, 7, 13, 15, 17 But I am in the room known for people who smoke pot all the time, right? 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 And there are about six guys and they are handing a joint around. 6, 8, 13, 15, 18 And I am sitting in there and I am not thinking about using or planning on using, but I am there, which makes no sense of all. 7, 9, 10, 18 So, I must in some way be thinking about using. 10 My next-door neighbor in the dorm, Jack, suddenly shows up in the door and says, ""Marv, come here. 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 I've gotta talk to you about something."" 6 And he gets me out of there. 20 Jack and five or six of these guys and I still get together. 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 20 [laughter] 9 And he got me out of there, somehow. 17 And I had told these guys my story. 6, 8, 13, 15, 16 AS: It probably made an impression on them. 7, 12, 13 MS: Well they just said, that makes sense Marv, you shouldn't do that. 9, 13, 14, 18 That was their response! 7 You just shouldn't do that!  It was true.  So, they were just really practical. 6, 7, 8 And they had no experience with addiction of any kind. 8, 15 Linda and I had decided to get married after freshman year, just stupidly. 7, 8, 12, 16 We're twenty-years-old, we get married. 12, 16 Neither of us have money. 7, 12 She was working but she wasn't in school. 11 She was taking some classes at the junior college in Rochester at the time. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 We decided that we would go to school together. 8, 11, 16, 20 [laughter] 9 Which sounds just crazy, and it was.  But we go off to Drake University in Iowa and went there and it all went well. 7, 8 Neither of us get any help from our parents. 7, 12, 18, 20 Her folks really can't help her out, so we're just getting grants and loans and I'm doing work study and she is doing some work study, which was just basically just a job at the school. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 And we were able to make ends meet. 18 We both went to school and then I graduated a year before she did and got into Mayo. 11, 16 Dr. Shepard, while I was in college was named Dean of Education of the Mayo Clinic. 11 When I applied to medical school, well, the Dean of the Medical School opens a letter from his boss... 8, 11, 20 [laughter] 9 I had done my part in college. 8 After that first semester was rough, I got mostly B's and then it was almost all A's. 5, 15, 16 Did you and Linda stay together? 11, 14, 16, 20 MS: Yeah, I started medical school a year before she graduated, so she was still at Drake and I had an affair with a classmate. 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16 We almost divorced. 15 It was just horrible.  I mean...  It hurt both of us equally. 14 It was just awful. 7 Somehow, we stayed together, and we've been married forty-one years. 11, 12, 14, 16, 20 AS: Oh my gosh, that's incredible. 7 MS: I know! 17 And we love each other! 17 AS: That's really great. 6, 7, 8 And we love each other! 17 Not only are we together, but we love each other. 11, 16, 17, 20 [laughter] 9 That's always a good thing to add. 6, 10, 19 AS: Cause, ""We're still together"" can sound like you're in some kind of marathon. 7, 9, 11, 16, 20 MS: It's true.  But it's just getting better. 15, 17, 20 AS: That's really great. 6, 7, 8 MS: So, I don't know, it's almost 5:30pm. 15, 17 We should probably meet again. 12, 13 AS: Should we meet again?  Then we can get into the weeds about opioids. 5, 10, 20 MS: Yeah, cause that's the trouble talking about my story. 6, 13 Often, my time with doctors has always been longer, because there is the story of the life and then what are you going to tell me about addiction medicine. 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 Okay, so let's just pause for now. 9, 17 [End of recording] 7, 11"
"11","Englund_Gloria","Andrew Tuttle Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer February 16, 2017 Wettingen, Switzerland Andrew Tuttle -AT Amy Sullivan -AS AS: We are in Baden? 7 AT: We’re in Wettingen. 7 AS: Wettingen.  AT: Next to Baden.  AS: Today is February 16, 2017. 19 This is Amy Sullivan.  I’m with Dr. Andrew Tuttle. 7 Would you just say your name? 11, 14 AT: My name is Andrew Tuttle. 7, 11 I explicitly give Ms. Amy Sullivan permission to record what I’m saying. 7, 11, 14 AS: Thank you.  I wonder if this is picking you up. 5 I might put it on top of this, is that okay? 14, 19 AT: Sure. 7 AS: What I was telling you earlier is I like to start with your childhood, where you grew up, your family, some of your childhood experiences. 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19 How you ended up here, where you were born, stuff like that. 5 AT: Do you want me to just go? 14 Okay.  I was born in Minneapolis in 1952. 5 I was the only child of my parents then. 7, 9, 12 We lived on Oliver Avenue in Kenwood in Minneapolis. 11, 16 It was a nice, modest house there. 9, 11, 14 My father worked in the M.A. 12 Gedney pickle packaging company. 5, 13 He later becomes the CEO. 5, 16, 17, 18 My mother then was not employed. 10 She was a mother and a housewife as much as I remember. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 She had been to college and was a very well educated person. 8, 10, 17 She’d gone to college.  She majored in English literature. 7 She was very well read and well spoken. 7, 8 AS: Where did your folks meet? 17 AT: I don’t know. 17 I think it was a family thing. 7, 19 The parents on my mother side belonged to a certain social circle that knew each other. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 18 As well as my grandparents went to places like Minikahda Club. 7, 8, 12, 20 Somehow a connection occurred there. 7, 18 My knowledge of exactly how that occurred is kind of sketchy. 7, 17 Now my father has died. 17 Anyways, the way I remember those first years is rather difficult. 7, 10, 13, 15, 16 I have nice memories. 14 My father and my mother and being tickled and stuff like that. 10 But I also remember them fighting viciously, verbally. 7, 13, 15 AS: Even as a young kid? 6, 15 AT: As a very young kid. 6, 15 I think this was at a stage where I hadn’t completely stopped wearing diapers, two or three or something like that. 14, 15 Definitely before kindergarten.  I have scenes in my head of standing at the top of the stairs just watching my parents just rip each other’s throat out. 7, 12, 15, 17 AS: Were they physically abusive? 14, 17 It was verbally.  I was a difficult child. 9, 10 Retrospectively  I most certainly had ADHD. 14 I was unmanageable. 15, 18 My parents constantly got calls from kindergarten. 7, 12, 14, 17 Later on I spent most of the time in the principal’s office in grade school. 7, 11, 16, 18, 19 I was disruptive.  Give me a hammer  I’ll attack the front walkway of our house and see how easy it is to break concrete apart. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Bicycles, or a car I can let the air out of the tires. 7, 14 I was a troublemaker. 18 I got into fights and was just hyperactive. 13 I was all over the place. 8 AS: Were you still watching your parents fight at this point? 7, 10, 12, 13, 15 AT: That’s not that central.  More central is the way that I met disapproval with adults. 12 Actually kids of my own age who knew that they could get me to do stuff. 6, 12, 15, 20 Then they’d go tell on me. 13 AS: You were that kid. 15 AT: It was kind of a formative experience because I felt myself being that troublemaker and that guy who could never do something right. 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 I think fortunately I was intelligent and could pick things up quickly. 5, 13, 19 I remember my dad once, this must have been before I was six and half or seven years old because that’s when we moved to California, he was just absolutely beside himself because I’d taken some tools and taken his bicycle apart. 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 That’s kind of a memory I can chuckle about now but at the time it was, “I’m just trying out these tools. 7, 16, 17, 19 Why are you mad at me?”  We moved to California before I was seven or after seven. 11, 14 I had just started first grade in Minneapolis and we moved to California and I continued first grade there. 6, 11, 14, 15, 16, 19 We lived in Berkeley where my mother worked. 10, 11, 12, 16 This was after my parents got divorced. 7, 12 AS: When did they get divorced? 20 AT: They got divorced in Minneapolis.  Just after they got divorced my mother moved with me to California where her parents had moved to previously. 7, 10, 11, 12, 14 AS: Your father didn’t move to California? 14 AT: No, this was just my mother. 10 I moved with her to California. 11, 14 First we stayed with my grandparents there, my aunt and uncle who were still adolescents at that time. 7, 12, 14, 16, 19 A very big age difference between my mother and her sister and her much, much younger brother who was four years older than me. 6, 7, 10, 15, 16 He wasn’t even in his teens when we moved there. 11, 14 He was still a kid. 7, 15 We quickly moved to Berkeley where we had an apartment. 5, 8, 11, 14 My mother worked in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory up on the hills of Berkeley as a librarian. 7, 10, 12 That’s where she met my later step-father who was working there as a nuclear physicist. 5, 12, 16 They had a relationship, got married, and in 1962 we moved to Switzerland which was an adventure in itself. 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 We came by boat from San Francisco. 13, 17 A steamer that went through the Panama Canal and across the Atlantic Ocean and across France with a steam engine. 5 AS: Was he Swiss?  AT: No he was German, from Munich.  AS: Is your mom American? 17 AT: Yes.  So is my dad.  My mom had her roots in Ireland and Scotland. 7, 17 My dad’s ancestors come from Southern England. 17 Anyway, we got to Switzerland and I was nine years old. 16 I have a late birthday in December. 5, 19 I’m actually a year younger than the year I’m living in. 6, 16, 18 I became ten in that year but we moved here in Spring. 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 We very quickly moved to a very small farm village in Switzerland where I was in school with the only Swiss students, pupils. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19 It was still an adventure because here I’d come from urban Berkeley to this tiny Swiss village where most of the kids who came to school were farm kids. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 After school we could wander over to the farm. 9, 11, 19 We could watch their parents milking the cows and help them gather cut grass from the fields to feed the cows with. 7, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20 I just thought it was really cool. 6, 7, 8, 10 Within a three minute walk you could be in the woods and the forest. 7, 14 If you walked you would come to a little lake and you could go swimming there and jump off the limbs of trees into the water. 7, 17, 20 It was cool.  My stepfather was a passionate mountaineer. 16, 17 I have to credit him with introducing me to the Alps. 7 We did a lot of Alpine tours and not actual climbing but long, long several day tours up high over glaciers and staying in Alpine cabins. 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 19 That’s where I gained my own passion. 17 Later on I became a rock climber and did a lot of rock climbing and mountain climbing and stuff like that. 13, 17 I still love going up in the mountains and taking long hikes. 7, 17 He was also a difficult guy and my mother was a difficult person. 6, 10, 17 She was the central person for me throughout my childhood, right up to my early twenties, I was very focused on her and very emotionally. 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 She was the person I’d lived with all my life. 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17 Only now with a certain temporal distance and knowing what I know about psychology and dealing with life myself, I know that she was a very, very emotionally difficult person. 5, 7, 8, 10, 17 One that could get somebody to fight with her. 13, 20 With my stepfather it became physically violent. 13, 14, 16, 17 I witnessed her being beat up a lot.  He was a brilliant scientist, well liked. 8, 9, 14 AS: Did he work at the technical place? 8 AT: He worked in conjunction with the Swiss Institute of Technology. 12 He was building what today is known as the Pau Scherrer Institute. 5, 7, 12, 17, 19 Then it was the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.  A short way from here they constructed a cyclotron and now they have a bevatron and a synchrotron. 17 It’s a big nuclear research facility that he oversaw the development and construction of. 6, 7, 12 He was a prominent physicist in his field then. 20 He also drank pretty heavily. 5, 7, 14, 18 They fought viciously almost every night. 15, 19 Occasionally it would escalate to physical. 5 AS: By this time, you’re ten? 7, 16, 19 Eleven?  Was this happening when you had moved here or was it before? 5, 7, 11, 14 AT: They were verbally fighting before. 13 Right from the outset they were verbally fighting. 13 I did not enjoy all of the stress. 7 In my mid-teens I started detaching myself from them. 6, 15 AS: They stayed together? 11, 14, 16, 20 AT: Yes, she had three more children by him. 7, 9 Three half-sisters of mine. 15, 16 The middle one, the second one suffers from Downs Syndrome. 12, 14, 16 She lives in a supervised living situation here in Wettingen. 6, 7, 11 My oldest sister, Christa, she lives not far from here. 9, 11, 16 She’s very much like my mother. 10 She’s a difficult person. 10, 17 She’s one who’s kind of emotionally unstable and will very quickly take offense at something you say that she interprets in a certain way. 5, 7, 14, 18, 20 She’ll start attacking you back. 6, 11, 17, 19 Most of her boyfriend relationships have been characterized by a lot of fighting. 7, 13, 15, 16 That’s kind of how I see my mother now from this point in life. 5, 7, 8, 10, 17 She was a difficult person. 10, 17 If my stepfather beat her she sure knew how to get him to beat her. 6, 7, 12, 16, 20 Nothing justifies each other but it’s kind of something that you can’t just see unidirectionally. 5, 7 I don’t think he really was that kind of person. 6, 7, 8, 10, 17 He never touched me. 13 He was always very correct, very fair. 7, 10 That made it difficult for me to relate with him. 5, 7, 10, 13 I saw him beating up my mother but my relationship was sort of okay. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15 What am I supposed to feel or think? 13, 14, 18 It was very confusing. 10 He was actually a good guy but he really destroyed a lot of stuff. 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 My attention deficit disorder sort of abated. 5, 6, 8 I was able to adapt to the Swiss school system. 11, 18 My antics were a bit, for a while, kind of legitimized because I was a foreigner who didn’t know how to behave. 7, 17, 19, 20 I very quickly learned the language and thought living here was just so much great fun. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15 School was kind of cool too.  It was this Little House on the Prairie type school with three grades in one room. 9, 11, 19 The teacher was really good. 6, 7, 8, 19 He was the kind of person who had a very firm authority but in a way that was gentle. 10, 17 Everybody just sort of naturally did what he wanted. 8, 14 AS: Even you?  AT: Yes.  AS: Interesting. 7 AT: In those times corporal punishment by teachers was not forbidden here. 7, 16, 19 I got him once to the point where he took me out of the classroom, not in front of the other pupils, and slapped me. 6, 9, 10, 12 That’s really not the kind of teacher that he was. 6, 7, 8 The teacher upstairs, it was known that he kept a hazel switch in the corner which he liberally used on students. 9, 11, 12, 17 That was the 60s.  That was when we lived in the Zurich region. 7, 11, 16 A few years after I had completed grade school we moved into Wettingen, here, which is a different canton and has a different school system. 7, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19 I was able to from the so-called second fahrschule, the sort of midlevel middle school in Zurich which actually is a little bit higher than the secondary school here, at that time was at least, and moved into the mittelschule which was the upper tier. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 AS: When you were talking about how kids could move up earlier that’s what you meant. 6, 14, 15 AT: I was a whiz in things like, I picked up things easily. 5, 9, 14, 19 I never had an easy time doing homework. 7, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 I was horrible.  I would always find excuses not to have done my homework. 9, 10, 17, 19 In classroom I could pick up things really easy. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19 Languages and math. 15 I was really good at math. 6, 7, 8, 19 The teacher was impressed. 7 I was able to move along without much effort which isn’t the best attitude academically because even if you can learn things easily you should do some work and apply yourself and study stuff. 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 I was able to weasel my way through. 18 I made it into the canton schule, the one that ends with an equivalent of a baccalaureate. 7, 12, 13 They have three divisions, a natural science division, and a modern language division and one of the classic languages. 6, 12, 15 We had to do Latin or Greek or stuff like that. 7 I did the natural sciences division because that’s something that I found easy. 11 I was able to complete that school. 11, 18 During the first year of that school I actually went to America and visited my biological father there. 7, 11, 16, 18 I complained, “Oh God it’s so awful.” 7 I hated living with my parents here. 6, 7, 12 He offered that I could stay with him. 7, 14 I did, which backfired completely because from the Swiss school that I had been in, which was kind of easy going, students were allowed to smoke in recesses and stuff like that. 7, 11, 14, 17, 19 He put me into this college preparatory school, Blake. 7, 11, 19 I was supposed to wear a tie in the morning. 9, 14 I was just so alienated by that.  I just sort of mentally left the whole scene. 8, 19 I went to school every day but I was just sort of sitting there. 7, 8, 11, 18, 19 After eight months… 11 AS: You didn’t fit in socially? 18 AT: I didn’t fit in socially. 18 None of the students lived nearby where I was living anyways. 6, 11, 12, 16 Everyone was driven there or drove there themselves from various parts. 8, 14 Most of them were from Edina or something like that.  We were living in Kenwood. 6 I barely had any social contacts. 7, 12, 18 AS: And you got plopped down when those kids had been together for years. 11, 15, 16, 20 AT: Yes.  I was able to speak English as a local. 18 Nobody realized that I had a reason to have a hard time adjusting or anything like that. 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 19 It was expected that I was able to do all this stuff which I was confused by and alienated by. 9, 18 After eight months I should have talked with my father about it but was somehow unable to at that age and stage. 6, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18 I ran away. 20 I was able to scrounge up the money to get a Greyhound bus to Chicago. 7, 12, 16, 18, 20 In Chicago I hitchhiked out to Deerport and presented a sob story to the Swiss people there. 7, 13, 16, 19 That I’d been stranded in America.  They put me on a plane. 19 They could confirm that I actually had parents there. 7, 12, 18 They put me on a plane back to Switzerland. 11, 17, 19 AS: Who paid for the ticket? 8 AT: My mother and stepfather eventually. 10, 16 AS: You didn’t even say goodbye to your father? 14 AT: I did later. 5, 16 AS: Were you getting along with him? 7, 15, 20 AT: Yes, I was but I just felt so lost and misunderstood. 6 AS: He had other children? 7, 9 AT: I actually felt that this was my personal failure. 6, 7, 10, 17, 18 I had asked to stay with him and now I was failing him and not fulfilling his expectations or anything like that. 14, 17 It felt awful. 6, 7 AS: Had he remarried? 7, 12, 16 AT: Yes, and already had Karl, my brother, and Jeff. 6, 7, 16, 18 John  I’m not sure. 7 No I don’t think he was born yet. 5, 15 Back in Switzerland I dived into the 1970s psychedelic hippie stuff.  I dove.  I consumed a lot of cannabis and LSD and stuff like that.  The whole psychedelic thing. 19 I don’t think I ever overdid it. 13 Were you living at home then? 6, 17, 19 AT: I was living at home which I did for another year and a half. 6, 16, 17, 19 When I was nineteen a buddy and I were able to rent an old dilapidated farm house a short way from here that had cold water and an outhouse out back for like a hundred buck a month. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 That was affordable. 18 I said, “Bye Mom” and just moved out. 11, 13, 14 I moved together with him and completed my school from there. 11, 14, 16, 20 I took a year off and worked on construction. 12, 16 I travelled some, rode my motorcycle a lot.  I had a big old beautiful 1951 BMW. 16 I rode all over Europe.  Around Italy and Sardinia and places like that. 8, 20 I always have had kind of a tendency to travel on my own. 10 I grew up as a single kid essentially even though I have a lot of half-brothers and half-sisters. 7, 15, 16, 19 I never felt like I was really brothers and sisters with them. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16 They were age wise so far apart. 8, 9, 15 I was the only link between my biological father and my biological mother. 10 I almost kind of saw myself as a single kid. 6, 7, 15 I knew how to be alone. 6, 12 Travelling alone, I have travelled with other people before. 12 If nobody is available wanting to do the same thing I just go by myself. 10, 14, 18, 19 You always meet people along the way. 10 AS: Is that when you went to Bangkok?  AT: When did I go to Bangkok?  No, I’d already started medical school. 6, 7, 11, 15, 18 I did a lot of travelling.  A year after I completed the local high school, the gymnasium, I went to medical school together with the guy I was living with, Chris. 6, 11, 16, 20 He later became an anesthesiologist. 5, 13, 16, 17 It was a great time. 7, 8, 16, 19 Medical school was fun. 11 I extended it by a year because I didn’t want to get stressed out in having to complete it in just six years. 7, 14, 16, 20 I took a lot of time off in between to travel. 7, 16, 19 That is the time I went to Southeast Asia. 7, 16, 19 Once I spent three months hitchhiking through the United States. 7, 11, 19 I did that twice and then went down to Central America and to Mexico and stuff like that. 16 I really enjoyed travelling. 6, 7, 8 It was so cool to meet all these different people along the way. 7, 18 People would be interested in where you’re from and I’d get invited to stuff. 7 It was really, really cool. 6, 7, 8 In a nutshell that’s kind of how things went. 5, 14, 19 I graduated from medical school in 1980. 11 The year that I became twenty-eight. 13, 16, 17 My mother died when I was twenty-three. 10, 17 She had breast cancer. 7 Just after I graduated from medical school my stepfather died from lung cancer. 11, 16, 17 He was a heavy smoker.  AS: You had younger sisters. 6, 15, 16 Were they on their own already? 6, 7, 18 AT: No. After the death of my mother my stepfather remarried with the nanny that had looked after my half-sister while my mother was still in the hospital before she died. 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 A weird thing. 19 She had two further children by him, a boy and a girl. 7, 9, 12 She was stuck with five children after he died. 7, 9, 17 I wasn’t part of that though. 8 AS: That was not your circus.  Can you talk about how you got into addiction medicine? 6, 8, 15 Not addiction medicine, psychiatry. 8, 15 AT: I stumbled into it.  I’ve always been interested, even in medical school I’d pick up some kind of weird book on psychology or some kind of life view approach thing or something. 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19 Primal scream therapy or whatever. 7, 18 I didn’t really get in touch with psychiatry. 6, 7, 8, 20 I never saw myself as a psychiatrist. 6, 8, 13 I thought it was interesting but I never saw myself as such because I thought I was too deranged and disturbed myself. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 These guys who were into psychiatry, we had all of these fantastic ways of speaking and explaining stuff. 6, 8, 15 I’d never be able to do that. 13, 18 AS: Your classmates? 6, 12 AT: Classmates or older people. 15, 16 People would say something analytical and I’d be like, “Wow, I never would have thought of that. 9, 10, 13, 14 How do they know that?” 17 After graduating from medical school I was kind of disenchanted with medicine all together. 8, 11, 16, 20 It’d been seven years. 16 The final exams were a very lengthy thing. 19 These were eighteen or twenty individual exams drawn out over a half a year. 16 Specialty, oral, written, stuff like that.  I was kind of fed up with it.  After graduating I decided I’d do something else for a while. 8 I worked at the post office. 12, 18 I worked at a refrigerator repair place, which was fun. 7, 8, 12 I had my own little van with refrigerator repair parts. 7, 8, 20 I’d go to people’s house. 9, 11 AS: Someone trained you to do that?  AT: They did at the factory.  They showed me how all the refrigerators worked and how to diagnose what’s wrong with them. 6, 7, 9, 12 AS: You do pick things up quickly. 5, 19 AT: For a couple months I also worked at a truck mechanics place. 7, 8, 11, 12 It was a way to earn money. 7, 12 That was the year I got enough money together not only to pay for my motorcycle but I wanted to do an extensive backpacking trip to the Caribbean. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I was kind of looking for somebody to take of my apartment and my cats while I was gone. 6, 8, 12, 20 That was when I met Susan. 12 AS: Did she take care of the cats or did she go on the trip? 7, 14, 20 We very quickly became enamored. 5, 7, 13, 17 She has just come over here and was glad to have a place to stay. 8, 14, 17 I was going to be gone for a couple months. 7, 11 She took care of my apartment and fed my cats. 7, 8, 14, 20 I went to the Caribbean where I started missing her a lot. 6, 15 Two and a half weeks into the trip in Antigua I met a veterinarian from the United States who was there for some government project to look at the cows or something. 12, 16 We got drunk together and he had a motorcycle and wasn’t able to start it. 6, 8, 11, 16, 18, 20 I could see that it was flooded. 5 I kicked the carburetor and adjusted it and started it for him. 6, 7, 11, 14, 15 “Okay.  I’m going over to the other bar there. 12 You want to come along?” 7, 14, 15, 17 Along the way we wiped out and spilled.  He had some lacerations, I just had some contusions.  Nothing serious happened. 5 It kind of was a jolt.  Here I was in what they call the hospital in Antigua and he was getting sewed up and I was kind of sitting there really drunk. 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17, 18 Shortly thereafter 7 I decided this is not the way I envisioned this trip. 8, 12 So I booked a flight to Minneapolis, spent a week with my parents and almost every day on the phone with Susan. 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 Then a flight back to Switzerland. 11, 17, 19 Six months later we got married. 5, 11, 12, 16 After I returned to Switzerland, that was 1981, I was able to secure a job at the medical examiner’s in Zurich where I had worked as a student previously for a couple of months and where I first got into contact with death by intravenous drug abuse. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18 I started writing my doctoral dissertation on that which I completed after I started working there in 1982. 6, 15, 20 In 1980, 1981 was the year I took off and 1982 we got married. 12, 16 That’s where I got really involved in addiction. 6, 7, 8, 15 I started getting really interested especially in opiate dependency. 6, 7, 8, 15, 20 After a year and a half of that I went and I was kind of looking for jobs that had a manageable workload where I didn’t have to stay up a lot at night. 6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 I just couldn’t handle that very well. 8, 13 I went to work for about a year and a half at an orthopedic rehabilitation clinic. 7, 13, 16 I had people who came there sort of electively. 8, 13, 17 You had to manage their rehabilitation and stuff. 7, 15 You’d go home at night even if you had on-call duty you could just sleep there. 14, 17, 19 It was kind of a cushy job, well paid. 8 Residents generally got well paid here in Switzerland. 8, 9 A common starting salary after graduating as a resident would be sixty or seventy thousand dollars a year. 5, 6, 7, 9, 16, 18 My original wish was I wanted to be a general practitioner. 12, 14 I applied for a residency and got one in Hennepin County Medical Center. 7, 9 We moved over there thinking I was going to do a complete residency in family medicine, family practice. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 19 That first year I was there was just horrible. 16 I had to work one hundred and ten, one hundred and twenty hours a week, seven days a week. 16, 18, 19 Every third or fourth night was just working through and continue working the next day. 16, 19, 20 I got really depressed. 6, 7, 8 It was almost a reenactment of when I was sixteen and had gone to visit my father. 7, 15 It was like after about eight or nine months I just threw in the towel and said, “Screw it.” 7, 11, 13, 14 We packed up our stuff and moved back to Switzerland. 11, 13, 14, 17, 19 I felt horrible again because I felt like I’d disappointed my father. 6, 10 He was so glad that I’d come there. 17 It was kind of hard to overcome. 6, 17 I immediately got a position back at the rehab clinic where I had worked. 7, 11, 12, 17, 19 I just was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. 7, 14 I decided to get into psychiatry. 8, 20 I got a residency job at the state mental institution. 7, 9, 17 I immediately liked it. 9, 12, 14 I was immediately liked by patients and personnel alike. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17 I remember that I always wondering, “Why don’t the other doctors get involved more with the patients?” 7, 10, 13, 15, 20 I was spending time in the wards, talking with people. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19 AT: Yes, and the other doctors would come by once or twice a week and make their rounds and otherwise just ask the nurses what was going on. 16, 17, 18, 20 I kind of got stuck there.  I thrived and was doing well, was being paid well. 8 I had manageable hours. 15, 18 Sometimes I’d have to be on call but it was exceptional. 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 That was actually at a time when a law was passed in Switzerland that even medical residents were not allowed to work more than sixty-five hours a week. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: That was in the 80s.  AT: After America a sixty-hour week seemed like nothing. 5, 16 I did that and I worked in various university clinics. 7, 12 I spent a year in Basel and a couple years in the outpatient services here nearby. 7, 16 Then I opened my own practice in 1993. 6, 20 That’s how I got into psychiatry. 8 AS: What happened with the addiction medicine interest? 5, 7, 8, 15 AT: It was always kind of a special interest area of mine. 7, 10 I had lots of methadone patients when I opened my practice. 6, 15, 20 AT: Yes.  That was when methadone was still the substitution medicine. 7, 8 AS: When was the Needle Park?  AT: That started at the very end of the 80s and blossomed in the beginning of the 90s and was there for a few years. 6, 15, 16 After I opened my practice it was still a thing. 6, 7, 19, 20 I think in ‘94 or ‘95 it had already been cleaned. 6, 7, 15, 16, 18 It moved first from one place to the other. 8, 11, 14, 16 AS: From the park to the station.  AT: It moved from Platzspitz to the Letten which was even more horrific than at the first place. 8, 11, 14, 16 Then they clamped down on it and wiped it out.  Police all over the place in areas where it could reoccur, preventing scenes like that from re-sprouting. 7, 8 AS: Were they arresting people at that point? 7, 10 What they doing with people?  How can you arrest a thousand people in one day because they’re using heroin? 7, 10, 19 AS: There was never the criminal, the immediate… 13 AT: Of course there was a criminal element.  AS: To arrest people, was that mostly for dealers? 5, 7, 10, 14 AT: Of course, but how do you make the distinction? 18 Everybody who gets involved in heroin at some point becomes a dealer because they have to deal their own stuff. 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 Of course there are people who are more focused on distributing. 9 The Albanians had a reputation for doing that. 7, 19 It was often somebody connected with some group or criminal organization. 18 Somebody would buy it in a great quantity from somebody and then they’d distribute it in smaller quantities to somebody else and they’d distribute it to the individual people on the scene. 7, 8, 12, 20 Then they would redistribute it and so on. 7 Where do you make the line? 18 AS: Who to arrest? 7 AT: Where is the victim and where is the perpetrator? 19 Where’s the difference? 7 It’s almost a continuum. 15 Some people were arrested just because they were carrying something with them. 7, 14 They were seldom persecuted. 14 Some people were persecuted. 14 Some people  I’m not sure whether it was sensible to be persecuted. 7, 14 A friend of mine who was a dentist, he spent two years in a regional penitentiary because he was caught with cocaine and he was selling it. 7, 9, 13, 16, 19 He was a dentist.  He was making good money off of his profession. 6, 7, 12, 19 It’s not like he needed to become rich by selling cocaine. 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19 It was more something he was just involved in because he was consuming heavily himself.  They put him away. 19, 20 Other people I know died. 17 AS: During that time? 7, 16, 19 AT: Yes.  AS: Friends?  AT: People I knew. 6, 12 Fortunately, none of my closer friends. 6, 7, 12, 13 Maybe the dentist has died since. 17 I don’t think it’s drug related. 5, 7, 10 As Thilo Beck says, his lifestyle. 7, 8, 14, 17 Last time I saw him he was obese and looked pasty and unhealthy. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19 AS: Do you remember what your dissertation was about? 7, 13, 15 What made it unique in the time that you wrote it? 7, 13, 16, 19 AT: The time that I started writing it heroin addiction was just starting to bloom. 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 The title of the dissertation was, “The Exceptional Deaths.”  A term for a medical examiner, somebody who doesn’t die of natural causes. 9, 11 A death that is unexplainable, unnatural, or extraordinary death. 18 Literal translation is extraordinary death.  Of intravenous drug abusers, a canonistic study of one hundred cases. 5, 9, 10, 12 Most of those hundred cases occurred in 1979 and 1980. 7, 12 It was like a flat curve and then it went up like that.  AS: Just like we’re starting to see. 5, 6, 7 During the 80s the heroin abuse climbed and climbed and climbed. 9, 10 Where previously a couple of people had died per year from it, it was dozens in small Switzerland. 7, 12, 16, 17 Or over one hundred per year. 16 Then at the end of the 80s like Beck said, the most intense drug scenes in the world happened in the middle of Zurich. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 People pouring in from Germany, from France just to come there to get drugs. 10, 17, 18, 20 AS: Do you know where the heroin was coming from? 7, 10, 17 AT: Mostly from Afghanistan I believe. 9 AS: Were they able to curb the… 18 AT: Some from Morocco probably also. 12, 13 AS: When the introduction of the methadone therapy happened, was there also a simultaneous bust of the heroin market? 5, 10, 12, 18 Do you know how that kind of worked out? 12, 17 Was there a police effort towards getting rid of it? 15, 17, 20 AT: Yes, there was.  AS: Did those things happen simultaneously? 5, 19 AT: Yes.  It very quickly became evident that it’s useless to pursue the users. 5, 9, 13, 17 You have to find out who the distributors are, the dealers. 9, 10, 14 The police efforts were concentrated on that. 17 A lot of people got caught up in the net but the focus was where is it coming from and how do we cut this off? 7, 14 AS: Were they or weren’t they working in conjunction with each other?  Was the impulse towards the care for the addicts, getting people off the street, did that happen separately or were they cooperating at all? 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 AT: As I remember it, it was separately but there were attempts with communication and cooperation. 7, 13, 15 Politically at that time, it was so open and so visible and so in everybody’s faces. 7, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 It could not be ignored. 7 It could not be denied.  It was part of our society. 8 Almost everybody knew a family whose kid had got caught up in that. 6, 7, 12, 15, 19 It was just devastating.  Society had to deal with it.  They came to this understanding; we can’t just deal with it by repressing it. 7, 13, 17 We have to also do prevention. 7 We have to do treatment. 7, 13, 18 The four pillars that we say, I can’t think of what they are exactly. 14 It’s a more differentiated approach and not just forbidding it. 7, 18 You can’t forbid something, prohibit something that so many people are doing anyways regardless of it being prohibited. 7, 18, 20 It’s not going to go away just by outlawing it. 16, 20 A more permissive attitude sort of came forth then. 5, 8, 13, 17 They started leaving this expectation that people who were on drugs were just going to stop using them and become abstinence and be detoxed and then be okay. 6, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18 It hardly ever works that way. 6, 8, 13 Occasionally somebody does and that’s good. 6, 19 Mostly not.  AS: You opened your own practice, how did patients who had opiate issues find you? 6, 7, 9, 15, 20 Are all psychiatrists prepared to deal with opiate addicts? 7, 8, 13, 15 I’m just trying to understand your medical system. 11 We would say you’re an addiction medicine doctor or you’re just a psychiatrist. 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 Those two in the U.S. don’t often overlap in private practice. 5, 6, 18 AT: I’d say generally psychiatrists don’t want to or need to treat people with this kind of addiction. 7, 8, 14, 15 Oftentimes because it’s viewed as something very strenuous you’re going to wind up with your bills not getting paid, stuff like that. 7, 8, 16, 19 The patients are going to be lying to you all the time. 7, 12, 15, 16, 19 This also stems from the attitude, “I’m the doctor. 20 I’m going to counsel you on what you need to do to overcome your problems.” 7, 17 Especially in addiction you can’t do that. 8, 15 You have to find out where that person is at that moment and take it from there. 9, 10, 15, 17, 20 You can’t superimpose this expectation of yours which doesn’t fit the frame of reference of the patient. 7, 20 You have to very carefully feel out the frame of reference of this person. 7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 Including his substance abuse or her substance abuse and where they’re standing and why they have come to you. 7, 9, 17 What they actually want from you. 14, 18 Without saying, “This is what I want from you. 14 They’re coming to you with an expectation that you’re going to help them in a certain way. 7, 18 You have to find out what that is. 9 It might not be realistic but it usually is not realistic in a way that they are expecting me to do much more for them. 7 Ultimately them achieving much more than they are actually able to do at that moment. 15, 17, 18, 19 Oftentimes my first job is to just find out where they are, give them the feeling that they’re being listened to and understood, and then start toning down their expectations. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 “Listen.  You can’t just stop taking that.  You can’t just detox and everything will be okay. 14 Let’s try methadone or Dolophine or oral morphine, the slow release type. 7 You have to be open to various options and approaches.” 20 Oftentimes you need to accept the fact that in the background they’re using other substances. 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19 Each case is its own individual case.  Of course there are certain patterns that the addict does this and that. 15 It’s very personal. 10, 17 AS: Has your practice always been that way? 6, 10 Do you think that the time you spent working at the hospital, the state hospital where you spent more time with patients, do you feel like that influenced your attitude towards addiction and towards people who were struggling with addiction? 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 AT: I started to. 6, 15 It’s been a long road. 7 I’ve been in this business now for almost thirty years. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 AS: Maybe you could talk about how it’s changed? 5, 6 AT: It has a lot to do with my own personal experience too. 10, 15, 17 A lot of personal stuff and realizing how vulnerable I am. 7, 10, 17, 18 This is not something that is just a bad life choice. 7, 8 This is something that can happen to you. 5 I mentioned in one of the letters that I had my own brush with morphine. 12 This is something that took me completely by surprise. 14 This was shortly before I opened my practice. 6, 20 My friend, the anesthesiologist, had just gotten some practice permit. 6, 7, 13 He said, “Let’s see what this whole thing is about this flash.” 5, 13, 14, 19 AS: Flash?  AT: The flash, the rush, when you inject an opiate.  He had morphine ampules and we shot intravenously ten milligrams. 20 It was at first, “This is kind of relaxing and nice.” 7, 14, 16 But actually a little bit too much because I kind of was woozy and drowsy. 18, 20 I tried it again but with only five milligrams, a very small amount comparatively. 12 That was, “Oh my God.”  All my troubles with attention deficit disorder, my problems with concentration, my problems with the strenuous—with keeping up a conversation with anybody and staying focused on the subject and not drifting away mentally and my ability to read and retain stuff was just better. 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17, 20 I went to twice a week. 16 It was helpful. 18 It was that point where I started feeling discouraged and craving. 6, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 I got addicted. 15 I detoxed three or four times. 7, 16, 19 If you’re taking something you’ve just really got to stay away from it because then my disdain for being dependent on something like that and my willingness to compromise. 6, 7, 8, 14, 20 I’m clean but I’d still call myself an addict. 7, 14, 15, 16, 17 I have vast amounts of oral morphine in my practice because I have to distribute it. 6, 12 I never ever, ever keep injectable morphine in my practice. 6, 13, 17, 18 I know that it’s too tempting. 17 I could go buy it any time from the pharmacy. 7, 9, 16, 19, 20 Because you’re a doctor. 7, 20 It’s just I know I cannot fool myself into thinking, once it will be okay. 14, 17 They come in packs of ten and I won’t be able to not use up the entire pack of ten. 7, 9, 13, 17, 18 You can also buy them in boxes of one hundred ampules. 20 They have ten milligram and twenty milligram ampules.  It’s a really easy split. 6, 7, 8, 11 I just keep it at a distance. 17 AS: If someone needs that they can go somewhere else. 7, 8, 15 AT: This was a very, very profoundly humiliating experience. 11, 15 AT: I never thought that could happen to me. 5, 10, 13 It never did with any other substance. 9, 13 I can smoke a joint tomorrow and then not think about it for a year. 16 I like a glass of wine but I don’t crave it. 9, 14 I could easily go days or weeks without it. 16, 18, 19 I had cocaine, I didn’t like the effect because it made me all tight and nervous and crabby. 9, 13, 14 I talked a mile a minute but I didn’t like the way I was physically feeling when I was on it. 6, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 I avoid it.  AS: How long did that last for you? 7 Did you take it like three or four times? 7, 16, 19, 20 AT: Altogether like ten years. 11, 16, 20 AS: Ten years? 16 How did that go over in your family life? 7, 8, 19 AT: Not well. 8 Susan started to notice. 6, 15 She could tell that I was using. 10, 13 Sometimes she thought I was using and wasn’t. 7, 10, 12, 16, 19 She was never sure. 7, 13 I lied about it or denied it or denied it when I actually wasn’t doing but she didn’t believe me. 9, 18 Stuff like that.  It was a difficult thing. 10, 19 Like Thilo Beck said, I’m a doctor. 13, 14, 20 I can buy the clean stuff and inject it cleanly. 15, 16, 20 I might have injected two or three thousand times but you can’t see anything on my veins. 5, 7, 16, 19 AS: Because you’re a doctor? 7, 20 AT: I’m a doctor. 20 I know how to do it. 17 I know I need to stay away from that. 14, 17, 20 AS: Did you use methadone? 9 AT: No, I never wanted that stuff. 13, 14 I just stopped. 15 AS: But it took you a few times? 7, 16, 19 AT: Yes.  I’d be using it for two weeks and working and performing just fine. 10, 14, 16 Once or twice one of my addict patients suspected me because they just knew. 6, 12, 15, 16 AS: And said that to you? 13, 14 AT: I talked my way out of it. 6, 13 “I’m so kaput today because I didn’t sleep last night.” 5, 19 Then I was off of it and clean. 15, 16 They weren’t sure anymore. 7 AS: What was the humiliating part? 8 AT: I was not in control. 10 I was actually being controlled by the substance. 9, 10, 18 AS: You have a deeper understanding now? 17 AT: I know how powerful that can be. 17 AS: When you talk about a personal connection. 6, 10, 17, 18 AT: I know how you can be thinking rationally and you’ll be doing something completely contrary. 14, 17 Knowing as I’m doing it that I don’t want to do it but I’m doing it anyways. 14, 17 “Oh my God that feels good. 6, 13, 18, 19 What an asshole now I did it again.” 17 AS: That consciousness is always there. 10 AT: The other part is like somebody else is holding the steering wheel and driving you. 8, 16, 18 It’s a profound thing and I think it’s kind of unique for the opiates. 11, 17, 19 They have such an intricate way of interacting with the receptors in your brain and so specific in the way they interact with your brain. 5, 7 They quickly are after a relatively short time can change the way that your brain is functioning and the way of steering your thoughts and your behavior. 5, 7, 10, 16, 19 AS: Do you feel like you got that back? 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 AT: Yes, but I am very respectful of it. 7 I will never have that in my practice or close to me because I couldn’t resist. 6, 7, 13 AS: What about your friend the anesthesiologist? 13 AT: He didn’t get into that. 20 Maybe he was less vulnerable than me. 18 Maybe he never had attention deficit disorder or something like that. 5, 6, 13 I never identified with my patients. 13, 15 I started to understand them better but I never felt, “You’re the same as me.” 6, 7, 13, 15, 17 It’s not like I chummed up to them. 9, 14 AS: You understood more about what they were going through.  You had not previously had an experience where you couldn’t control— AT: I was pretty understanding before but you can’t really know what it is. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17 It’s not something that you should have to know. 17 You shouldn’t have to have that experience. 15 The price is just way too high. 11 In that sense it’s very humiliating. 9 I never feel ever even this much superiority over my patients. 13, 15, 18 I know why they lie. 17 I know that works. 8, 17 I know how much they hate themselves for lying. 12, 17 The whole shame thing and everything is just mind blowing. 6, 19 AS: That’s powerful.  What I wanted to ask is what’s changed in your practice besides you? 5, 6, 14 What changes have you seen? 5, 13 Beck was talking about the substantial decrease of the numbers and the increase in age because heroin’s not in. 6, 7, 10, 14, 15 How has your practice changed? 5, 6 What have you noticed around opioids? 5 AT: Hard to say what has changed around me or what I have changed myself. 5, 6, 14 I used to work a lot more, see patients five or five and a half days a week. 5, 9, 16, 18, 19 I was insane.  A few years back really started to realize how morphine was helping me to work more. 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: How long ago did you stop? 7, 16 AT: A couple years was the last time I used it. 7, 9, 16, 19 There were gaps.  AS: But it was over a period of ten.  AT: I was very worried about myself.  AS: What made you not take methadone? 13, 20 AT: I took methadone or oral morphine just to bridge over a certain gap of time before I knew I could take two or three weeks off to detox. 6, 7, 12, 16, 19, 20 AS: You know what you’re doing. 7, 17 Take two or three weeks off of work to detox because that’s how long it would take? 7, 16, 20 AT: It would take me four or five days to get over the worst but then you’re shaking depending on how long you’ve used. 7, 9, 18, 19, 20 You’re going to have post-acute withdrawal symptoms for up to a year or two. 7, 14, 16 AS: Those are serious.  Back to your patients. 15 How did it change? 5 AT: I reduced the number of addict patients I treat. 7, 14, 15 Most of the patients that are being treated by me I’ve been treating for years. 7, 15, 16 I haven’t taken on many new ones. 6, 12, 18, 20 AS: Just addict patients? 15 AT: Beck mentioned, I can confirm that. 12 Most people I see are… 5 AS: In their forties or fifties.  AT: I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a teenaged user. 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19 AS: But when you started your practice? 6, 15 AT: I had sixteen, seventeen year olds. 16 My youngest patients were sixteen and already heavy heroin users. 6, 7, 9, 15, 18 It was a long battle on methadone and this and that. 7 There’s still cocaine there. 7 We’ll prescribe methylphenidate, Ritalin. 7, 10, 12 AS: Does that help with cocaine addiction? 8, 15, 18 AT: Sort of.  It’s a stimulant. 19 It’s not like they’d totally not crave it.  In some way or another it helps them maintain a certain stability. 18 I’ll go along with it. 7, 15 As long as it works it works. 7, 8 The pragmatic approach.  It’s a difficult thing when you treat addicts. 7, 10, 13, 15, 19 It’s not a quick thing. 19 You’re in for a long haul always. 7, 10 AS: Your medical model is set up to accommodate that? 11 AT: To a degree. 7, 19 I work together with pharmacies. 9, 11, 16, 20 I work with federal practitioners. 12 I actually am one of the very, very few, I don’t know another psychiatrist except for Arud in Zurich which is a huge practice there, I take blood and there’s a central lab in Baden that I bring it over to and do lab work there. 6, 8, 17, 18, 20 I do maintain a very, very small amount of physical contact with my patients. 12, 15 I measure their blood pressure or listen to their heart. 6, 7, 14 AS: We were talking about your patients, the age of your patients and how its changed. 5, 6, 15 It’s rare that I get somebody below twenty for anything anymore which is okay. 7, 14, 20 I’m older myself. 15, 16 I think it might have to do with the fact that when I started my practice I was much younger and probably projected a much more dynamic, youngish me which younger patients could identify with more. 6, 12, 13, 15, 16 AS: How are people referred to you in private practice? 5, 6, 7, 20 AT: I’d say about a fifth of them just hear about me and call me up. 14, 17 The rest, half of the rest get referred by practitioners and the other half by the psychiatric institute. 7, 12, 16, 20 Most of my patients are not addicts. 13, 15 AS: It seemed like you said this earlier, did you purposely reduce the number of addict patients or have they naturally declined? 5, 7, 13, 14, 15 AT: It’s hard to say. 6, 14 I purposely sort of withdrew a little bit from that because it’s really taxing. 6, 7, 8, 20 In private practice if you don’t have an infrastructure and a lot of personnel and social workers and stuff like that to help additionally it’s a lot of work. 5, 6, 7, 10, 17, 18 Because of the lifestyle that Beck was talking about. 6, 7, 8 AT: The different aspects. 7, 18 AS: All the stigma and the problems. 7 AT: Their whole living situation, who they’re living with, their economic situation, their job. 6, 7 All this stuff.  How are they buying food? 12, 20 Who’s paying for it? 6, 18 Where’s it coming from? 7 Do they have social services of the municipality there to help them? 18 AS: When you take on an addict patient you’re taking on all that. 7, 15, 20 AT: The whole thing. 19 Which I don’t do myself but I have to be in phone contact with the social services of the municipality or their primary care physician or with their employer or with their landlord or whatever. 7, 12, 14, 18, 20 AS: That stuff typically doesn’t happen with your other patients. 5, 14, 15, 17 AT: Not as much.  It’s a lot of work and a lot of work that I can’t charge for.  AS: Because it’s not the one on one time. 7, 16, 19 AT: I have a petition for work in absence of the patient but you can’t overdo it.  The insurance will just refuse to pay it. 7, 9, 18 AS: I have a question here about best practices for the future of addiction treatment. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18 If you could predict something that would happen regarding addiction treatment what would it be? 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18 If you could change something for the better in the current system here? 5, 7, 17 Best practices, something that will happen or that you see coming up ahead or something that you could change. 5, 6, 7, 12 AT: I think education of health professionals needs to start early and with a bigger emphasis on it. 6, 15 It’s a huge part of our society, of the health system, of what we have to deal with, it’s underrepresented. 7, 8 AS: And underfunded.  AT: Yes.  The whole understanding of addiction, like tobacco addiction is completely under dealt with. 8, 14, 15, 17 It’s addiction that’s about as bad as heroin addiction. 8, 10, 15 People who are hooked on cigarettes have a hard time stopping. 6, 7, 16, 19 AS: There’s not much here for that.  AT: They talk about the amount of deaths from heroin, there’s ten times as much death from tobacco. 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 19 AS: Still today. 5, 19 That’s a good point. 6, 10, 19 AT: It’s legal.  You can buy it every place. 8, 20 You go outside and smoke. 9 Alcohol is more noticed but still that’s very accepted. 7 It takes a long time for acquaintances or relatives of an addict to admit that the one close to them is having a problem with alcohol. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 It will be overlooked and denied and sort of rationalized. 8, 13 Then for the person who is consuming it themselves, they accept that themselves because it’s part of society. 8, 10, 17 Almost everybody drinks. 13, 19 Ninety-five percent of the drinkers can handle that and five percent consume seventy-five percent of what’s consumed. 13, 19 AT: I think that’s probably universal. 12, 13 AS: Five percent consume seventy-five percent.  More education.  AT: More education, more knowledge about it, more understanding, and you need a lot of experience. 15, 17 AS: Would you say even by education it’s just with health professionals? 14 How is your school system? 11 Does your school system here offer drugs education? 10, 11 AT: More than they used to but I’m not sure how useful that is because the educational system is dealing with kids. 5, 7, 9, 15 There’s a degree you can educate them about addiction and substances and stuff like that. 7, 8, 9, 15, 19 It’s something that, “Okay I see my parents drinking wine. 5, 7, 12, 15, 19 I’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about.” 6, 7 AS: More medical professionals. 11 AT: I think in higher levels of public education you could probably introduce this topic. 9, 11, 12, 13 For teenagers, make them aware that this is something that you have to be aware of and careful of. 7, 14, 15, 18, 20 They need to know some facts about drugs that can easily become available at a party or on the street, heroin or cocaine, before they try it. 7, 8, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20 So that they have an idea of what they might be risking and getting into just by touching the stuff. 5, 15, 20 AS: Would you talk a little bit about, you were talking the other day about why you’re not in favor of legalization of everything. 6, 7, 19, 20 AT: I’m just not sure. 7 AS: Is marijuana legal here?  It should be more legal.  When I talk about legalization often people think about it as this black and white thing. 6, 15, 18, 19 Tobacco is regulated legally, so is alcohol. 5, 7, 10 There’re rules and you can get in trouble. 7, 13, 20 AS: They have different rules. 7, 13, 18 AT: It’s a question of how we regulate it legally not whether it’s just illegal or legal. 5, 7, 15 I think you have to take into account the different risks of these different substances. 7, 9, 18, 20 Opiates is kind of in a way different from the other things. 5, 7, 18, 19 Cocaine is different but it also has similarities with other stimulants and stuff. 7, 18, 19 Opiates are very distinct idiosyncratic effect.  Alcohol is just a cell poison. 17 You bathe yourself in it and they sort go “Ugh” and release their dopamine. 7, 8 Opiate, that docks onto a very specific point and tricks the nerves into thinking something else. 8, 10 AS: It’s very quickly lethal if you use too much of it. 5, 9 AT: If you use too much of it you’ll stop breathing. 9 AS: Anything else? 8 AT: Not that I can think of at the moment. 15, 17 I’ve been babbling away. 20 AS: What about the future? 7 Is there something if you could offer some idea for public policy or something for the future? 5, 7, 11 Maybe it’s education as you already said but is there any other care or treatment for people? 6, 7, 13, 14, 18, 20 AT: Make it available I think. 10, 18 Public acceptance that this is an aspect that should not be so stigmatized that needs to be accepted as something that you can become addicted just the same way as you can suffer from high blood pressure. 7, 11, 15, 17, 18 If you have high blood pressure you always have to take a medication that keeps it in the low range. 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 20 Countless other, like diabetes.  Okay there might be some different ways of looking at it and understanding it but in certain aspects why should you think of it differently? 6, 7, 17, 18 It’s a health problem. 7 AS: It’s what Beck was talking about earlier today. 5, 6, 19 It’s the way that it’s stigmatized that marginalizes the people that do have a problem. 7 Their life becomes complex and difficult because of their marginalization, because of the stigma. 7, 8, 10, 17, 18 Right?  AT: The only thing that makes heroin so dangerous is it enters your brain about ten times more easily than morphine. 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 If you inject it this huge wall of heroin is immediately entering your brain. 5, 10, 12 The sharp rise in the concentration might be a temporal overdose.  Your brain doesn’t have enough time to adjust to this amount of effect. 5, 7, 12, 16, 19, 20 Your breathing just shuts down, your heart stops. 6, 7, 14, 19 That’s an overdose.  Apart from that it’s not particularly dangerous. 8 If you take an amount of heroin that you can tolerate your health isn’t going to be impaired. 7, 10, 12, 20 You’re just going to be dependent on it. 7 AS: That can turn out to be a problem. 7 AT: It can be a problem. 7 I like being able to move freely. 7, 14, 18 I want to go to the states for a few weeks and not have to worry about having something with me that maintains me. 14, 16, 17 These are the motivational factors that Beck was talking about. 6 I have lots of reasons that I don’t want to. 7, 10, 14, 15, 17 AS: With the motivational thinking or interviewing.  Those are powerful.  I think my son-in-law had a counselor who used that. 9, 16, 17, 20 I remember he was talking about that he really liked it. 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 He liked a therapist using that model. 9, 10, 14 AT: The whole politics towards this needs to change. 5, 15 It’s just so tiresome because there are experts who have a lot of knowledge and experience about it but their hands are tied by the greater way that it’s being seen by society and by the health department and by the politics. 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17 And the different administrations that come in and the ruling parties and how quickly you can backtrack and lose ground on something. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19 AT: How flexible are you as a therapist?  How flexible can you use substitution agents or other treatment modalities that you can offer? 7, 9, 13, 15, 18 Talk therapy, group therapy, institutionalization, whatever works or is desired or is acceptable or makes sense. 7, 8, 9, 18 This whole thing about, “You have to not take it and you’re only a wonderful person if you’re not addicted or dependent on anything at all.” 7, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20 It doesn’t work that way, it can’t.  You can argue, “You made a bad decision.” 7, 13 It’s not like that. 9, 14 You have peer pressure; you have all sorts of things coming into play. 5, 7, 8, 19 You have a teenager who’s heard all this stuff and they think, “Yeah, yeah that’s what all the adults are saying. 7, 8, 14, 15 Here my friend is offering me something and he’s taking it. 13 He looks okay. 14 I’m going to see what it’s like myself.” 5 You can’t just say this is a bad decision. 7, 14 It’s the way things go. 5, 19 AS: We need to create supports for someone to pull back from it that are consistent and non-judgmental. 7, 9, 11, 17, 19 AT: Yes.  This needs to be very readily available. 7, 10, 15, 18 To catch it.  AT: And easily available. 10, 18 Somebody at ten o’clock in the morning could be like, “God I can’t continue this way.” 9, 14, 19 And at one in the afternoon walks into a place like Arud it’s good that something happens right then. 5, 6, 8, 14, 19 AS: Thank you.  AT: Sure. 7 AS: [Speaking to cat].  Thanks kitty.  [End of Recording] "

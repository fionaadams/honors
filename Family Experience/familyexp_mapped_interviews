Could you start with you childhood? 9, 11 Where you grew up?  What your childhood was like? 10, 11 LB: I was born in Chicago, Illinois and my mother was a nursing student at the time. 9 Single, wasn’t sure who my father was, I was put up for adoption, she went off secretly and had me in Chicago. 5, 10, 15 Nobody knew about it. 6, 12 I was there for about a month and she decided she wanted to take me home after all. 6, 8, 12, 13, 19 She traveled to Chicago and brought me home to Minneapolis and kept me in her little apartment. 9, 18, 19, 20 Finally, my aunt and uncle found out about it because they came to visit her and it was a bar downstairs and she had me down there at the bar that she worked at. 5, 9, 12, 13, 19 They didn’t feel it was a fit environment for a child. 14, 16 Eventually, within a few weeks, she agreed for them to take me temporarily until she got her life together. 6, 11 AS: What year was this? 20 They took me home and took care of me and agreed that they would give me back eventually. 6, 7, 15, 19 That never really happened. 12, 13, 15 I just grew up with my aunt and uncle. 9, 12 It was my mother’s sister and her husband. 5, 9, 15 It was a great childhood, I can’t complain about it. 11 It was good.  I had a cousin that was three years younger than me. 5, 14, 20 He was born when I was five.  We are three years apart. 20 We grew up as brother and sister. 5, 9 AS: Did you see your mom much as a child? 15, 18 LB: Once in awhile.  She was my aunt.  I didn’t know she was my mom until I was in my thirties. 13, 14, 15 They told me I was adopted. 8, 20 Well, when I was in my thirties I decided I wanted to try and find my biological mother. 12, 13, 16 I asked them if I could get a copy of my birth certificate. 10 They said they had one and they would help me. 13 They said I was adopted through Lutheran Social Service. 7, 8 They didn’t have any record when I talked to them. 6, 10, 11 I said, “I don’t know what is going on.” 13, 14, 15 Eventually they came down and gave me my birth certificate and on that was the name of my aunt Georgina. 6, 10, 19 I was thinking, “Ok, so she is my mother.”  That kind of threw me for a loop. 15, 16, 17 It was kind of exciting in a way, and yet kind of puzzling. 16, 17 Anyway, eventually I wrote her a letter because I didn’t see her often. 12, 15, 16, 19 She was the aunt with the sports cars and she was just kind of a cool aunt. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 I grew up with her kind of in my teens. 16, 17 I would stay with her sometimes. 5, 9, 18 She would let me smoke and have a drink when I was in my teens. 6, 14, 19 She was cool. 17 Very successful as a nurse.  She helped start a program that used to be HCMC now, the dialysis unit. 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 She worked with some real famous doctors.  She really did well in her life. 11 AS: Did she stay single? 9, 15 LB: No, I was a teenager when she married.  I went on to find out though that they didn’t stay married long. 9 She had two other children and gave them up for adoption. 14 One with him and one right after me. 14 Two boys. 8 She was an alcoholic. 5 She told me this when she was drinking one time. 6, 14, 20 I never knew for sure if that was the truth because I think she had a kind of personality disorder when I think back on it now. 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 Very kind, but she could turn around and be horrible. 8, 16, 17, 19 I found out she was my mom when I was in my thirties. 15 I did write her a letter and told her I knew. 6, 12, 19, 20 She took a while to connect with me after that.  I went down to her home, she lived in Brooklyn Center, went down to her home and talked to her about it. 10, 11, 19 I acted like I was really happy. 10, 17 Inside I was a little confused to be honest. 9 She admitted that yes, I’m your mom and talked about how things were back then. 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 19 She had hoped to get me back but it just didn’t work out. 9, 10, 12, 19 As it turned out she didn’t visit that often. 12, 13, 15, 19 She just kind of let them have me. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 She just didn’t seem to have the time or something. 9, 12, 19 She really wasn’t happy about being my mother even as an adult. 15, 17 AS: No motherly instinct. 9 LB: No motherly instinct really. 9 Really independent and a narcissist almost. 9, 12, 15 That is how my childhood started out. 9, 11 That’s how, as an adult, I found out she was my mother.  We didn’t have a close relationship really.  Cancer and she died of cancer, I don’t know, it has probably been ten years ago now or more. 13, 14, 15, 20 She had a living boyfriend that was my age. 6, 12 He somehow changed her will I think, unless she lied to me, but I got nothing from her. 16 She didn’t leave me anything. 6 She said she would.  I was the only child that had any contact with her. 10 He took everything and we always wondered if the will was changed somehow because she had said, “You’ll get…” 12, 16, 17 She was very bad before she died.  She didn’t know what was going on. 13, 14, 15 He took care of her. 7 He was a terrible alcoholic too. 5, 15 Very chronic.  Who knows. 13, 14, 15 AS: What a story. 9 Let’s see, where do I go from there.  I got married when I was very young. 14 Right out of high school. 8 I was pregnant my last month of high school I remember. 8, 9 We moved out of Minneapolis to Brainerd my last year of school. 8, 9, 20 I went to Brainerd high school, graduated in 1969 and my boyfriend at the time moved up there to go to college as well. 8, 12 I found out I was pregnant in May right before I graduated. 8, 14 We planned a wedding, told my parents, and went through this whole thing. 10, 16, 20 They didn’t care for the guy I was going with, Bob. 7 Not at all because he had long hair and my dad was a barber and she was a hairdresser [laughter]. 5, 12, 14 And he had very long hair and dad didn’t like it. 10, 12 We got married in September then.  I had my first son, Jason, the next February. 9 That was ok I guess, it went ok. 10 I was so young that I think it went ok because I was so young. 14 Both Bob and I partied a lot, drank a lot. 7, 14, 17 That was kind of our focus then was having fun and partying. 6, 15, 16, 17 Within a year I had another little boy [laughter]. 20 His name was Gabriel. 6 It was very hard because my husband by that time was really a full-blown alcoholic and was never home and going out with other women and girls in high school. 5, 8, 11, 15, 18, 19 We weren’t very old. 20 I was only 18 or 19 when I had Gabriel.  My aunt and uncle that raised me helped me a lot with that. 5, 13, 16, 17 We ended up going up there and staying a while because he was really abusive, my husband was abusive. 9, 11, 12, 15, 19 AS: Was he your age?  LB: A year older. 5, 20 Physically and mentally, you name it. 6, 7, 14 I tried to kind of still stick with that lifestyle of going out a lot, drinking, finding baby sitters. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 We had his mom and dad living in town. 6, 15, 19 They were great and took them a lot, the kids. 11, 17 Things straightened out a little bit. 6, 9, 15 We lived in a little town west central Minnesota called Cosmos. 7, 9, 19 I was a big town girl. 8, 19 I wasn’t into small towns at all. 19 The only thing we had there was the Legion.  We would look forward to the Wednesday night steak fries. 9, 19 I wanted more for my life than that. 11, 12, 13 My family was more well-rounded and really encouraged me to do something. 8, 18 They wanted me to go to college, but I didn’t of course because I had kids. 8, 12, 13 It was ingrained in my mind that wasn’t enough living in a small town and going to the Legion on Wednesday nights. 6, 19, 20 I wanted more. 12, 13 I wanted to go to college and I wanted to do somethings in my life. 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16 In fact, we built a new house. 6, 9, 10 He worked with his dad they had a Ready Mix company and were doing fairly well with it.  We weren’t hard up for money at all. 11 We built a new house and back then of course it didn’t cost very much. 6, 9, 18, 19 I got into that and things settled down and straightened out. 6, 9, 15, 16, 17 We had a pretty good time for a while there. 18 It was still partying and then I got pregnant with my daughter. 5, 6, 9 She was born in ‘76.  That was really awesome to have a girl.  I really focused on the kids. 9, 15 Sewing and I made everything for them. 16 I was really into homemaking at that time. 19 Things seemed good for a while. 19 As time progressed, Bob was really an alcoholic and was very physically abusive. 5, 7, 9, 11 I started going out with other people thinking I would find somebody better. 9, 11 He was going out with other people and eventually I didn’t want to be with him anymore and I didn’t want to be in that town. 13, 15, 19 I went out with a guy that I thought could get me out of there. 11, 12 He was just totally not the right kind of person. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 That didn’t work.  I moved to the Twin Cities for a while. 8 Left my boys behind and took my daughter with me. 5, 8 Got a job at Simer Pump Company.  I will never forget that. 15 It was just a no life job. 9, 11, 12 It was just to make some money to live. 9, 12, 16 I was so lonely down there.  I had friends, but it was just my daughter and I. 5, 9, 12, 18 One day my husband and his friend came down and took my daughter away from me and brought her back [with them]. 5, 9, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 It was horrible. 17 AS: How did they manage that?  LB: I was staying with a friend, they came to the apartment, my friend let him in because my friend wasn’t really concerned. 9, 12, 19, 20 She knew him. 6, 12 They just took her. 9, 12 They grabbed her out of my arms and took her and brought her back to Cosmos. 9, 18, 19 Within a few weeks I moved back and went back to him because I couldn’t handle not having my kids. 8, 19 I felt so guilty about my boys and then not having her. 8, 17 He put her with a friend of his to take care of her every day. 6, 7, 10, 12, 19 I just couldn’t deal with that. 9, 12, 13 I went back. 19 I tried to make things work with him but I was over him. 10, 16 We even went on a vacation and took all kinds of things but it wasn’t… 10, 15, 16, 17 Eventually the abuse got so bad I ended up calling county social worker. 7, 9, 12 I didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 My parents weren’t really standing behind me because they thought, they were kind of old fashioned. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 20 I will never forget a statement my brother made: “Maybe if you stopped making frozen pizzas he would leave.” 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 20 I called the social worker, I told her I couldn’t live with him anymore, and she brought me to the women’s shelter in Willmar with my kids. 7, 9, 13, 18, 20 We were there for probably a couple of months. 8 I moved out of the house and petitioned for a divorce. 6, 8, 9 They helped me with a lot of things there. 13, 16, 17 We got an apartment and back then there was a lot of help. 13, 17, 19, 20 There was a lot of financial help available through the county that there isn’t now. 7, 13, 14, 17 They helped me pay for an apartment, they helped me get furniture, they helped pay my tuition while I went to the college in Willmar. 8, 13, 16, 20 My life was evolving. 11 I missed Bob in a way because I missed the companionship. 16 He could be nice sometimes, but overall it wasn’t good. 5, 18 The kids had also been somewhat…  the boys were physically abused and mentally abused. 7, 8, 9, 14 Kristin wasn’t. 9 She was only three and doesn’t remember it.  We lived in an apartment then and the life was kind of, I don’t know, it was ok. 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 I was trying to find another guy right away rather than be by myself. 13, 14, 16 I had a series of nothing really.  I would see some people a few times and then leave. 6, 18 I had kids and…  I was a lot of baggage with all that. 17 Then, I met my current husband, and that was in ‘78 when I met him at a bar. 5, 15, 16 He was into racing, star car racing and I really liked that. 7, 9, 10, 18 I don’t know why even. 13, 14, 15 My girlfriend and I would go to races. 12 They had a race track not too far.  I knew he raced but I thought he was married but I really didn’t care [laughter]. 6, 7, 11, 12 My morals weren’t too on spot back then. 19 I started seeing him out at the bars and eventually he left his wife and asked if he could move in with me. 5, 9, 10, 11, 15 This has been a matter of months. 8, 20 And, “Of course you can move in with me.”  He brought his suitcase and he kept seeing other women and I would let him use my car. 7, 9, 18, 19 I was totally desperate for this guy. 17 He had a really nice family that lived out on the farm out there. 18 They were super people. 12 Very Christian oriented, kind of like my family was. 8, 9, 16, 17, 18 I felt comfortable. 17 I joined their church and I became very involved in trying to find a family and … in their activities. 5, 10, 16, 18, 19 For the next two or three years he still continued to see other women that he knew. 6, 9, 12, 18, 20 I put up with it because I was so desperate. 10 He was very good with my kids and was like a real dad to them.  They would go visit their dad but he was so bad with his alcoholism that he would leave them with his parents and if he did bring them with him they would end up at some party or a bar. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 16 One time the county sheriff brought them home from their home visit. 7, 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 He had been put in jail because he had a bunch of trouble in a bar he was at and the kids were with him. 5, 9, 10 They came home and the boys didn’t seem phased a whole lot they just kind of dismissed it. 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 My daughter was kind of scared. 5, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17 She was about five or six I think.  They were also diagnosed, the oldest boys, were diagnosed with borderline, back then, retardation. 5, 6, 8, 9, 19, 20 That’s what they called it back then. 7, 19 It wasn’t disability.  I kind of always assumed it was because I drank when I was pregnant. 7, 14, 16, 17 I thought it was fetal alcohol syndrome. 11, 12, 14 I don’t know if that was the cause. 9, 13, 14, 15 They didn’t look like that, but they had some of the issues that went along with that because I went to a lot of seminars later in life. 11, 14, 15, 17 We got divorced then, Bob and I were divorced finally. 5 Craig is his name, my husband’s name. 6, 15 He got divorced a couple of years later. 5, 20 He was really down and out, too, because he had lost a business and wasn’t really sure what he was doing. 9, 15 We were broke.  He was living with me and I got welfare. 6 That was what we lived on and I didn’t record that he was living with me. 6 He started working some jobs and was starting to make some money. 9, 11, 16 I was in college then. 8 I started college at the community college in human services. 8, 9, 11, 14 I did really well in college. 8 I was surprised I remember because I hated high school. 8, 12, 18 Things just evolved. 9, 12 We moved into another subsidized townhome and his brother was a very successful farmer. 5, 8, 19 He purchased some land and a house right outside of Willmar. 6, 8, 9, 14 He bought it for us and we took over the payments eventually, but he enabled us to get it. 7, 15, 16 We went into that together.  The kids loved it. 13 I felt like at peace out there. 17 It was a lot of work and the house was rickety but his dad helped us with a lot of the work on the house. 6, 9, 13, 16, 17 It was exciting.  The only thing was  Craig would not commit to me and I felt used. 9, 17 Eventually I left him for a while.  For a period of time I moved to Willmar. 8 I tried to go out with some other people. 10 I was like this is it he won’t commit to me.  He was still seeing other people I believe. 9 The guy I was dating was one of his friends and he decided to go back to his old girlfriend. 12, 18, 19, 20 He left me and then I had to go back to Craig I felt. 17, 19 I cared about him but I didn’t like his lifestyle. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 I demanded that he married me if he was going to live with him.  I wasn’t just going to live with him anymore. 9, 12, 13 We had lived together for ten years. 20 AS: By this point it is like ‘88?  LB: It is about, yeah, It was actually ‘87 when we got married. 10 Right before our wedding, three months before, I found out I was pregnant. 8 I thought, “Oh my god. 10, 11, 12 This is not going to look good to his family at all.” 18 I considered an abortion. 12 I had had two before that, earlier.  Which makes me sick to this day, but anyway. 16, 19 Three days before the wedding I miscarried twins. 7, 14, 19 What happened was I lost one at home and still was in a lot of pain and went into the hospital and they were going to do a DNC and they did and there was another fetus they said. 9, 12, 13, 17, 19 They didn’t tell me right away. 14, 16 They aborted the second twin. 14, 20 They didn’t own up to it at the clinic.  The doctor didn’t.  They didn’t tell me they just said there was some fetal material. 9, 12 In the records, there was a gal at work there, and she saw in the records that it… 6, 7 AS: Why would they keep that from you? 12 LB: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I suppose they were worried about a lawsuit.  This woman, because she talked to me about it, she was going to lose her job. 10, 11 She was the girlfriend of the guy I had dated before and she hated me. 12 There was a lot of animosity there and I was scared of her because she had tried to come in my house while he was there and she pushed me down the steps. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 She was going to kill me. 7 Threatening me all the time. 15 I was afraid of her and I told Craig, “I can’t deal with this. 13, 20 We are getting married in a few days.” 19 This went on for weeks after we were married.  I said, “I can’t do this anymore let’s just forget about it and not do anything.” 9, 12, 13, 19 I found out later the clinic was gearing up for a big lawsuit with this doctor because he didn’t do an ultrasound or something beforehand. 8, 10 That took a while to get through.  I was really depressed and we got married a few days later. 12, 19 That was nice, and we got through it.  Got married outside under our pine trees.  We still live there. 9 Marriage was fairly ok.  A year later I had Seth. 20 He is 27 now and that was in ‘89 I had Seth. 14 We were just delighted. 9, 12 It was his first child, he didn’t have any kids. 9 Seth was everything to us.  He couldn’t have been spoiled anymore than he was [laughter]. 13 Five years later we had Jordan. 20 Jordan is our youngest, he’s 22. 9, 14 We just did everything with those kids. 9, 12 Craig was one of them to raise.  We got them involved when they were really young into snocross racing. 14 They raced snowmobiles. 14 We spent a ton of money. 19 At that time Craig had started his own business again and was doing fairly well. 9, 11 Between that we had milked cows, we had taken over his dad’s farm. 6 We had done a lot of things together. 16, 17 We had quite a history at that point. 9 He was starting a new business and that was going fairly well. 6, 9, 11 We were financially doing a lot better. 17 Fixed up our house. 6, 9 Did a lot of things. 16, 17 Things seemed to be going well. 19 The kids loved snocross. 13 We took off every weekend and went to where the races were and traveled all over with them. 12, 19 Seth got to be very good.  He was with Arctic Cat with their team.  Jordan, he raced, but he was a real big kid. 8 He was really big for his age and that wasn’t good in snocross because you had to be lightweight like his brother was. 5, 8, 18 His anxiety would come out… 13, 19 his boots were this or that.  He would just go nuts every time. 9, 12 That was Jordan.  That was my first taste of his anxiety was when he was a little kid. 9 He was the one who eventually had the most problems. 15 We ended up having to quit that because my husband Craig wanted to get Seth into car racing. 7, 12, 13, 15 It was either that or snocross we couldn’t afford to do both.  We had a team of racecars that we had other people drive. 7, 14 Two dirt car models. 7, 15 We had some friends of Craigs’ drive them for us. 7, 12, 14, 18 It was time, he thought, to quit that and get our own kids involved. 11, 12 We got Seth involved and that was 2009.  It wasn’t all that long ago.  We got him involved and he took off.  He was just a gifted racer and just excelled at that. 7, 9, 12 I’m going to step back a little bit. 9, 12 When they were in school, because we traveled with the snocross and it was really hard to do school, I started homeschooling them. 8, 9, 11, 19 We were gone on weekends and every Friday and school didn’t like it. 8, 10, 12, 19 We homeschooled and that was not successful at all. 8, 19 Seth did it for a little bit and then he wouldn’t do it.  I just let it go and I started with Jordan. 9, 11, 12, 19 Jordan begged me, “Please, I hate school, I hate my teachers.” 8 And he didn’t get along with his teachers at all.  Both the boys were horrible in school. 8, 17 They were nice people but they just couldn’t stand authority. 9, 12 Neither one of them.  I don’t know if that came from us. 13, 14, 15, 19 I don’t know, I don’t think so. 13, 14, 15 They both had a real problem with authority.  I tried homeschooling and that didn’t work for either one of them. 8, 10, 19 Eventually I just gave up and they just quit school. 8, 9, 12 They just didn’t go to school. 8, 9, 12 I feel guilty about that to this day that I didn’t push it more. 16, 19 In the meantime we took in a foster son. 9, 16 Like I needed anything more, but we knew this little boy. 6, 12, 13 He was a friend of Seth’s, my older one. 5, 12, 20 We took him along with our family because I had a job I ended up as an independent living coordinator. 6, 12, 18 His parents were in my program. 10, 16 I knew them and they had two babies that were both mentally handicapped and it just wasn’t a good situation so we took him on. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 At first it was so fine because he got to race and we got him a snowmobile. 9, 14 He was with us all the time.  Later on that turned out to be a disaster. 9, 19, 20 For a while it was good and we felt like we were doing something good. 17 AS: Was he the same age as your kids?  LB: He was Seth’s age, yes. 14 The 27 year old. 20 They were the same age.  It turned out they were horrible together. 17, 19 It didn’t go well.  AS: They didn’t get along?  LB: They were just wild together. 9, 12, 17 I think they both had ADHD.  I know he did but I think my son must have had it too. 13, 14, 15 We couldn’t go anywhere with them.  They would make a scene, wreck things in the hallways of hotels. 16, 17 We couldn’t take them out to eat for dinner anymore because the two of them together we would have to separate them or something. 6, 13 Anyway, I’m probably missing some things. 16 AS: I am wondering if we should go outside.  It is getting louder in here.  [pause] 9 AS: How old are your kids? 20 You have a foster son, John… 9 LB: That was when my second youngest, Seth, was probably 11 or 12. 9, 14, 20 I think they were in fifth grade. 20 AS: So they were big. 8 They could make some real trouble. 16 LB: Oh yes. 14 Together it didn’t work very well for those two.  My youngest son didn’t like him really. 9, 10, 14 They later became very close once, I don’t know, Seth kind of broke away from them and had his own friends. 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 My youngest son Jordan started getting closer to John. 9, 11, 14 Little did I know that was when the drug use started. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 Jordan started drinking when he was like 15 because he went with Seth to a race and Seth called me and said, “Mom, you got to come and get this kid. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 I’m not watching him.  He’s drunk, he’s running around the campground here causing trouble, fighting with people. 7, 8, 11, 14, 15 You have to come.” 13, 19 We got up in the middle of the night and drove up to Huron, South Dakota to pick him up. 7, 8, 14, 19 We were going to go the next day to watch Seth race. 19 Seth was racing.  We picked him up to the police station because they had brought him in and charged him with underage drinking. 6, 7, 9, 14, 17, 18 I was on the phone with the police the whole way down there. 7, 16 They were picking him up and bringing him in.  We were just sick. 9, 12 We had had some problems with Seth, too.  Not with drinking or drugs but some mental stuff where he would just go off. 6, 9, 12, 14 We kind of had our fill with that and now we thought, “Jordan! 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 Not Jordan.”  He seems like such a good kid, doesn’t seem to be influenced by that kind of stuff, you would hope. 9, 10, 16, 17, 19, 20 We went out, picked him up, and brought him home. 9, 18, 19 He was still drunk and it was just terrible seeing him like that. 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 I couldn’t handle it.  The next day we told him he couldn’t go back out but we took him back out the next day. 19, 20 That was the beginning that we knew he was using. 6, 12 We thought, oh, he is just experimenting like kids that age do and he just drank too much. 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 “Oh I’m never going to do that again!” 15 Of course.  That was the beginning.  Him and John I think then started smoking some weed because I would kind of smell it when I would go out. 9, 11, 16, 17 We had a shop with a kind of office in it that was separate from our house. 6, 9, 16, 17 That is where they hung out a lot because they were working on different things and they would fix bikes out there and they were always doing things and I thought that was good. 11, 12, 16, 17 They were out of my hair a little bit, and yet they were doing good things. 12, 16 One time I remember thinking, “It smells like weed out here or something.”  I started suspecting things little by little. 9, 11, 16 Seth had kind of moved out. 8, 16, 17 When he got to be 18 he moved out and got his own place if I remember right. 8, 11, 14 I didn’t think he would do anything either because he wasn’t into drinking at that point really. 6, 14 He was obnoxious but he wasn’t into using I didn’t think.  That changed too in a short hurry. 16 We found out he had gotten an underage consumption [charge] and that is when it all started basically. 7, 9, 11, 15, 17 We went through that with Seth the older one and then the younger ones started picking it up more and more. 5, 9, 11, 14, 20 I think probably at about 18, when Jordan was 18, he’s 22 now, we noticed things started getting more out of hand. 9, 11, 14, 16 He started acting strange. 7, 9, 10, 11 All him and John did was play video games. 10 We had a house in New Ulm as well. 6, 9 My husband worked in a big piping project when the butter plant burned down. 8, 15 They rebuilt it.  My husband and his company. 15 We stayed there and rented a house there. 5, 6, 9, 16 Video games non-stop. 9, 10 I’m thinking, “This is too much, video games are going to ruin them for life.” 10, 11, 18 After that I think was when they started doing more and more weed. 9, 11 Jordan fell down and broke his leg. 15 He had many broken bones over the years. 5, 20 That is when he started on pain medication. 9, 10, 11 Percocet, they gave them out pretty readily then. 18 AS: This is how long ago??  LB: This was when he was about 18, yeah, 17 or 18. 10 He had a girlfriend then that he had had for a couple of years. 12, 20 She wasn’t really into using but she noticed too that he was just so awful. 9, 10, 12 Demanding, he started going downhill. 9, 11 We noticed his behavior changing. 16, 18 I thought it was the medication. 10, 11, 12 I said, “Maybe you need to get off this stuff and take some Tylenol.” 6, 9, 13 He has never been able to withstand pain. 9, 12, 15 Even when he was a little kid, everything was horrible if he was in pain. 17 Everybody had to cater to him. 10 He had to have this pain medication. 10 I thought, well, I suppose if he needs it. 11, 12, 13 The doctor kept refilling it.  He was on different ones. 16, 17 I’m sure he was hooked on it. 15 Then he broke his shoulder, or he had to have surgery on his shoulder.  That was about a year later and he was on more pain meds, of course, because he probably needed them at the time. 13, 20 I don’t think he ever got off of them.  Then he started finding more ways to get them. 9, 11, 16, 17 I am finding out now that he started snorting them. 9, 11, 14 Because I found a pill crusher out in the shop.  I started looking for things. 9, 11, 16 Sure enough there was stuff out there. 9, 20 That was a real red flag but when I questioned them they said, “We tried it once.” 6, 9, 10, 12 You know. 13, 14, 15 It just progressed and eventually I found out through the grapevine that John was selling drugs. 7, 9, 12, 14, 15 Our foster son. 9 He had gotten on probation for something else. 10, 15 An assault or something.  He was on probation because he assaulted someone and got in trouble. 10 He didn’t go see his PO and they had a warrant out for him. 7 I kept saying, “You need to turn yourself in I’m not going to let you stay here. 9, 11, 13, 19 I could get in trouble for this as well.  You need to go talk to your PO.” 10, 13 I called the sheriff and I said, “He is out here and I can’t have him here anymore. 7, 13 I understand he is possibly selling drugs.” 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 They said, “Yeah, we have been watching him and we pretty much know he is.” 13, 14, 15, 18 They picked him up, ransacked my shop and all my things up there. 7, 16 “Could we search?”  They totally wrecked half my possession up there looking for drugs. 14, 17 They didn’t find any.  I’m sure they were hidden well. 15 They did find a little bit of marijuana on him but they did find a gun and he had a felony against him, the assault.  That sent him to jail and eventually a prison sentence. 7, 15 LB: First he went to St. Cloud of course and then they sent him up to Moose Lake. 7, 9 He was very upset with me because I had turned him in. 17, 19 LB: Probably a year. 20 In the meantime my son was getting out of hand. 16 He was hanging out with some of the guys. 18 I don’t want to be prejudiced but there are a lot of Mexicans and Spanish up in Willmar. 13, 17 AS: Did they work at the Jenny-O plant?  LB: Yes, that was a lot of it. 17 A lot of them have become professionals and there are a lot of good ones. 13, 17, 19, 20 But there are also a lot of drug dealers that moved there from Chicago. 8, 13, 14, 17 Jordan started befriending a lot of John’s old friends. 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 20 I believe that is when Jordan started selling drugs as well. 7, 9, 11, 14 It was like, “You need to get a job.” 10, 13 There is of course a little bit of guilt because maybe we should have… 9 and he wouldn’t have sold drugs. 14, 20 Eventually, John was in prison, he got out, and he came and worked with us in our business. 9, 19 He was a great worker. 11 Him and Jordan hung out together all the time.  That is when I suspected no good.  They were up to selling, using, they were goofy all the time. 7 We couldn’t count on them to come to work. 13, 19 Jordan would sleep all day. 7, 19 He then moved in with his girlfriend, they got a place, a couple of different places together. 8, 11, 12, 16, 17 Moved out, got evicted, things just weren’t going well. 9, 12, 16 I suspected…  [pause] 9 I’m trying to think of what order this all took place. 11, 16 Shortly after I discovered Jordan was selling drugs and using pills, I suspected anyway, he got caught selling weed. 7, 12, 14, 16 An informant made a purchase from it. 16, 17 It was one of his friend that had turned into an informant. 12, 17, 19 It was only 60 dollars but it was still a drug charge. 9, 14, 17 He got put on probation. 10 No jail time at that time.  He was put on probation with his probation to be removed once he did well and followed all his recommendations with the CD Bell and all the things they put him through. 8, 10, 12, 16 They recommended that he go to outpatient treatment. 9, 12, 16 My older son had also gone to outpatient because he had a DUI so I did go to treatment with him. 5, 9, 16, 20 AS: One of your oldest? 5, 9, 20 LB: The 27 year old. 20 I had also gone through treatment with my two oldest boys [laughs]. 5, 8, 9, 16, 20 I forgot about that.  I had gone through treatment with Jason, Gabriel three times, Jason once, Kristin no. 9, 16, 18 She was into drugs but she pulled out of it on her own. 14 I don’t know how. 13, 14, 15 Seth was in outpatient treatment one time for a DUI. 9, 16 AS: Were any of these inpatient? 9 LB: Yes.  This one [unclear].  That was more recent though. 11 Gabriel.  Jason was a long time ago though when he was younger. 5, 11, 14 I am back tracking just a little. 9, 12, 19 AS: They are now recommending inpatient for Jordan? 9, 12, 14 LB: Yes.  Then he got an assault on his record next because his girlfriend had a new boyfriend and he was upset. 6, 12, 17, 19 He punched him because she brought him to their house. 6, 9, 18 He wasn’t going to let him in and the guy wasn’t going to let him in and he punched him in the car. 7, 19 They filed charged and he got a fourth degree assault. 17, 20 Second degree assault I should say. 20 Eventually, that gave him more problems.  He didn’t meet with his PO and he wasn’t doing what he needed to do so he did some jail time. 13 Then he got out and he was back to using and selling. 7, 19 I talked to his PO and I said, “He needs treatment. 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 Putting him in jail isn’t going to help. 13 He needs treatment.” 9, 13, 16 They recommended treatment, he went through a CD .. again and they recommended treatment. 9, 12, 16 This was about two years ago and he went to Project Turnabout. 20 It was horrible. 17 He called me and begged me to take him out. 6, 7 AS: They are all horrible. 17 They hate everybody.  LB: Treating him like crap.  “If you don’t come and get me I am leaving here and I don’t care if they pick me up.” 7, 13, 19 “Jordan, just calm down” trying to calm him down over the phone. 7, 9, 12, 16 Finally, he settled in a little bit. 17 He actually did fairly well there. 10 This Julie was a counselor that he hated at first and she was very good. 9, 10, 12 She was there when my other son was there, my other two sons were there.  I thought, “Ok good this is good.” 11, 12 Started going to meetings, was really good for the first two weeks. 9, 13 I even got one of his friends involved and he got sober. 6, 12, 15, 18 He was going to start taking charge in group. 9, 11, 17 It was more than two weeks.  It was probably a month. 8 And then it fell apart again. 15, 20 I could tell his behavior was different again. 16, 17 He was sleeping all day, wouldn’t come to work with my husband, he just wasn’t himself. 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 I suspected he was right back into it again. 14, 19 He wasn’t doing his probation stuff again. 9, 10 He got called in again and he ended up having to go to court again for not following probation. 7, 10, 12 No, we didn’t go to court again.  Back up a little bit here.  We didn’t go to court.  He was at our house because him and his girlfriend were split up then. 6, 9, 12 While he was in jail she moved out. 8 We helped her move out in fact because we were still kind of helping her and we pretty much raised her. 5, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18 She was so young when they started dating. 9, 11, 14 15. He was at our house one night and this was about a year ago. 6, 9, 19, 20 He was just out of it. 9, 12 Craig called me and said, “What is going on with Jordan? 7 He is crazy out here. 16 I am burning brush and he fell in the fire. 15 I had to pull him out.”  He told Craig, “Yeah, I just want to die.” 9, 12, 13, 20 I thought, “Oh my god.” 10, 11, 12 Then, he came in the house and I tried to calm him down but I was pissed. 6, 9, 10, 19 I was like, “What are you taking? 10 Did you drink? 6, 14 Did you take drugs?” 6, 14 Because he acted like he was overdosing or something. 10 He was like, “Oh, nothing.” 10 His younger brother was in the living room. 5, 6, 7, 14 His older brother Jason, Jason is an alcoholic. 5, 20 He is just kind of a half-way functioning one. 9, 12, 16, 17, 20 We gave up on him kind of. 16, 17 He is 40-something years old. 20 And he is telling Jordan, “You can’t have any more of my cigarettes I gave you half of them.” 20 and Jordan said, “I just want a cigarette.” 9, 12, 13 And Jason said, “You are such a spoiled little brat” and got him going.  Aggravated him to the point where he got up, went to the kitchen, got a poker from the fire place, and came in there after him. 11, 15, 19 He hit him once.  He was going to attack him.  I went and grabbed the thing out of his hand.  My dog came up and bit him, bit me because I am trying to get him away. 10, 16, 19 Then, he went outside crazy, crazy, and he had done this before. 16 Gone through these episodes when he was younger, but not when he was on anything. 5, 14 I don’t know what he was on, if he was on K2 because he talked about that. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 He went out in the shop and Craig called me within a few minutes and said, “You have to call somebody he is trying to kill me.” 7, 16 And he is standing over his dad with his big, huge… 8, 9, 12 knocked him down on the floor and was going to hit him and said he hated him and wanted to see him dead. 12, 13 I called the sheriff. 7 I said, “I don’t know what is wrong with him. 13, 14, 15 I think he is drinking on top of it. 6, 14 We don’t know what to do here. 13, 14, 15 He needs some help.” 13 They came out and he ran off. 7, 19 This had happened one other time too and we turned him in and he would run away in the yard and hide. 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 I was scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 I locked myself in the bathroom because I didn’t know what he was going to do. 7, 13, 14, 15 He probably had a gun somewhere.  I didn’t know where they were. 13, 14, 15 The dispatcher stayed on the phone with me and I heard him come in the house and go upstairs. 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19 That is where he was when we found him.  The deputies followed me upstairs and he finally surrendered. 9, 10, 12 “You promise you won’t charge me for fleeing?” 17 [laughter]  It’s like that is the least of your problems! 9 I felt bad because he is laying on this bed and I thought, “We kind of got this going. 11, 12, 16, 17 Maybe we should have been calmer and not got him riled up like this.”  Anyway, they took him out, arrested him, and put him in the car and got him in jail. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 I knew it was court the next morning. 6, 12 I went into the courtroom and I was met by a lady from the women’s shelter. 5, 7, 18 I was a victim.  They charged him with domestic abuse, they charged him with terroristic threats. 9, 17 We didn’t want him charged. 13, 17 We just wanted them to help him. 9, 12, 13 He was charged with two felonies. 17 It ended up being two felonies. 12 The deadly weapon…  it was big. 8 It was big. 8 He was in court the next morning balling his head off. 8 “I don’t remember it.  I don’t remember doing any of that.  I can’t imagine. 14 That’s my mom I wouldn’t hurt her. 15 I would never hurt my mom. 15 I love my mom I love my dad. 13, 15 I don’t know what I am doing here.” 13, 14, 15 He couldn’t remember any of it.  My heart was breaking. 18 He is in jail, he doesn’t remember it, and if he does he would have said something I think.  I was just devastated. 9, 12 There is my, what do you call it… 7 AS: Your disaster. 9, 20 My disaster. 9, 20 The biggest disaster I had ever faced. 8, 9, 11, 20 We could have maybe prevented it by not overreacting the way we did. 9, 10, 15, 16 Although, we were scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 We just wanted them to take him and bring him somewhere. 6, 9, 12, 13 To the mental health unit or something. 14 That is what I am thinking.  I am thinking mental health here. 14 Maybe detox at the most, but mental health mostly. 9, 10, 14 AS: Is there any kind of facility out here like that? 16, 17 Or is there just the jail? 9, 12 LB: Well, they have the HMU and they have a crisis center. 9 I am thinking “Help.”  This isn’t on my mind.  AS: Right.  When you say help that is different than what they… 13, 16, 17 LB: they came in and interviewed us that night and I said, “I am not charging him. 6, 19 I am not saying anything.” 11 They said, “We have to.  This is the state.” 9 I knew that but I didn’t think of it at the time. 6, 12 Craig said, “Oh yeah, he said he wanted to kill me and all this stuff.” 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 And oh my god it just mushroomed into this horrible, horrible thing that we had been involved in and kind of felt like we had caused. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 We didn’t really, but we did.  We got him going.  We were yelling at him instead of calming him down. 9 AS: Right, but you were also at a point by then where you’re frustration with his drug use. 9, 14 Your own reaction seems understandable, but you didn’t know what he was on. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 LB: I didn’t know at that time. 13, 14, 15 AS: He wouldn’t tell you.  LB: No. I had no idea what was going on. 11 I thought he was going to die. 11, 12 AS: Right because you had asked him what he was on. 10 LB: He said he wasn’t on anything.  AS: He had fallen on the fire. 15 Is this the same night? 19 LB: He just kept saying he wanted to be dead. 9, 11, 12, 13 He had said that many times before but we didn’t take it serious because he kind of always said that. 6, 16, 17, 18 You know how you get immune to it almost? 9, 13, 14, 15 Anyway, they did drop his charges somewhat. 14, 16, 17 They did a plea bargain and this went on for months. 5, 8 He was in jail for months. 8 We couldn’t see him.  We were victims so we couldn’t see him.  We did at first because they screwed up. 9 Once they realized we were the victims we couldn’t go see him at the jail. 14 His ex-girlfriend went there everyday and I think was a poor influence. 12, 19, 20 He would call her and then I would talk to him, which wasn’t legal but I didn’t care. 7, 10 I’m talking to him. 10 Throw me in jail.  He was just so depressed. 9, 12 They took him off adavan.  He was on adavan for anxiety before that because he had panic attacks real bad since he was young. 14 It probably wasn’t the best drug to put him on because it is very addictive. 9, 10, 14 They took him cold turkey in jail, took him off that. 20 That is part of why he went so berserk in jail and got thrown in the hole umpteen times. 18 He was in there Candyhow County has DOC people out there they take from prisons. 6 They mixed the whole population he was in.  His cellmate was a sexual offender plus he had committed a murder. 7, 12 This is what he was dealing with. 13 AS: And he is an addict.  LB: He’s not really a criminal.  He ended up a criminal because of it but no, he hadn’t committed a murder. 12 He didn’t do a crime against people, really, it was himself.  I was just beside myself the whole time he was in there. 9, 12 I shut it out of my mind because I had to go to work.  I was just distraught. 9, 12 Everyday I was just sick. 9, 12, 19 I would go to bed and ball myself to sleep. 7, 8 My husband was feeling a lot of guilt and then sometimes I would just get angry and “Well maybe he deserves to be sitting in there and maybe we should have been …” 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 You know, you just go back and forth with it. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Maybe I should have been tougher.  Maybe I had made him finish school and then we wouldn’t be in this situation. 8, 13, 16 I went over that so much in my mind. 18 I guess I just talk openly about it to people because I didn’t care. 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 I was like, “Yeah, my son has an addiction problem.” 10 That is when I joined Moms of Addiction.  AS: The Addict’s Mom?  LB: Yes.  AS: The Addict’s Mom on Facebook?  LB: Yes.  I saw it on somebody else’s website, or on their Facebook. 13 I thought, “Ok I am going to look into this” and it was very helpful. 11, 12, 13 I put quite a bit of things up there about what I was fighting. 10, 16 LB: This was last fall. 9 In October.  LB: Beginning of November, yes. 14 AS: What other support did you get?  LB: Well, his probation officer is really a pretty good guy. 10, 18 I talked to him about the fact that he needed help, that jail and prison wasn’t going to do him any good. 10, 11, 13 He would probably just reoffend and he needed help. 9, 12, 13 He was a really good person.  I believed in him.  Then, this advocate from the attorney county attorney’s office. 7, 10 She was very helpful too, honestly. 9, 13, 16 And the advocate from the women’s shelter, which I had worked at at one point. 10, 18 They were both helpful to me. 13 I kept saying, “I really don’t feel a victim in this whole situation.” 11, 13, 16 I just kept trying to push that. 9, 12, 16 Eventually I met with a prosecuting attorney. 5 I said, “I want a meeting with him because I want to explain this whole thing to him.” 13 I just jumped in there and fought for this kid. 9, 12 “He needs help. 13 Prison is not going to do him any good.  Can’t you see this?  You can save yourself some money by doing something different with him. 16, 17 He needs treatment. 9, 13, 16 Yes, he has been through treatment once but one time probably isn’t good. 9, 16 He needs more.” 13 They did do a plea bargain then.  I got to be pretty, you know, the prosecuting attorney was actually pretty caring after all. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: You think that was probably due to your influence? 20 LB: Definitely.  They were going to throw the boat at him. 7 He is 22 years old. 20 I’m thinking, well he wasn’t even 22 yet then. 15 I did everything and it consumed my life outside of my job. 11 I had to go do my job working with mentally ill people. 14 That was stressful. 9 I was just wound tight. 9, 12 I was running from place to place on the phone constantly trying to find a treatment center that didn’t do the 12-step. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16 I didn’t think that was real successful for him.  Then they did a CD evaluation and recommended inpatient treatment again. 9, 12, 16 I wanted to find a good treatment center this time. 9, 12, 13, 16 I found Villa National in …  I called his PO and said I found this treatment center. 7, 9, 16 The lady that did the CD eval, I played phone tag with her I don’t know how many times. 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 I couldn’t get a hold of her. 20 She wouldn’t call me back. 7, 19 Finally I went in there and I said, “Look, I found a treatment center I really want him to go to.” 9, 13, 16 “Well, we usually do this. 10 We usually recommend…” 10, 12 I said, “That’s not going to work for him.  He needs something other than 12-step.” 9, 12, 13 He was getting out of jail soon and I wanted to get this situated so he could go right from jail to treatment. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 I thought if he comes home it’s not going to work. 11, 12, 13, 19 It didn’t happen. 12 He got out of jail.  AS: Why didn’t it happen? 12 LB: Because we couldn’t get it set up fast enough. 9, 17, 20 People weren’t…  AS: People were too slow?  LB: The process was too slow.  Villan was good but they couldn’t get his MA to go through.  He got MA, they couldn’t get it to go through, call them up, “No, he doesn’t have it.” 7 Call the county. 7 I went through that whole process.  This went on for three weeks.  He is at home and I’m thinking any minute he is just going to say, “Screw this.” 9, 12, 19 AS: He is going to bolt.  LB: Right.  He is going to leave or just start using and say, “I don’t care.” 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 Because he had been sober. 6 He was in jail for five months. 8 Four months. 8 He just went into treatment this spring. 9, 12, 16 Early spring.  Late February, early March.  November, December, January, February.  He was in about four and a half months in jail. 8, 20 Then, another three weeks before he got into Vinland. 8 They came and got him, brought him down there, and eventually it worked. 9, 15, 18, 19 He did very well there.  He actually kind of liked it there because it was a different approach. 10, 16, 17, 18 It was just a nightmare trying to get it set up. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 I couldn’t think of anything else.  It came between my husband and I. 15, 19 My husband had an affair during this time. 15 We’ve been married for 30 some years. 20 Suddenly, my older son came and told me he said, “Dad is seeing somebody.” 5, 19, 20 I feel apart. 16, 20 I totally fell apart. 15, 17, 20 I couldn’t take it. 6 I was like, “Are you kidding me?” 10 I had no inkling.  AS: You were kind of distracted. 9, 10, 16, 17 I think he just… 9, 12 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know what happened. 12, 13, 14, 15 Then he told me, “Yeah, I don’t really, I think we have been married a long time and sometimes don’t you feel like you need a change?” 5, 13, 16, 18, 20 And this was all during this time.  My world fell apart. 15, 20 We were best friends. 9, 12, 18 He was my best friend. 9, 12 We did everything together.  We went through thick and thin with all the kids.  It was horrible. 17 I had to go to work and pretend like it was ok. 12, 15 Finally, one day my supervisor came to my job site for a staffing or whatever and I just fell apart to her [laughter]. 9, 12, 13, 15, 19, 20 Totally fell apart. 15, 20 I said, “I’m a mess.  I don’t know if I can even do this job.” 13, 14, 15 She said, “You are doing fine.” 14 She was very supportive, which I didn’t expect.  I would burst into tears at the dumbest places. 9, 11, 17 I just couldn’t do it. 9, 12 AS: I cannot imagine. 14 LB: I kept thinking, “Other people go through worse things than this. 16 Get it together.  Hold it together. 20 Some people their kids kill themselves and they have to deal with that. 7, 13 My kid is alive.”  I kind of felt guilt like “Oh god, pull it together.” 10, 16, 17 And I would see all these other people and their kids had committed suicide or overdosed and I just felt for them. 9, 12, 15, 17 I just thought I don’t know how I can even do this anymore. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I was close to giving everything up and saying, “I can’t do this anymore.” 11, 13 You get to that point but something keeps you going. 12 It kept me going, I don’t know what. 13, 14, 15 I guess I had hope. 10 I would pray and pray and pray.  I was a Christian but I wasn’t real sold on the whole idea totally. 8, 9, 11, 17, 20 I thought what is my other option? 11, 12 I don’t have any other option.  That is what people say.  It has got to be god. 10 I had nothing to lose here.  I prayed and prayed and prayed.  Jordan did well in treatment. 9, 16 He got into lifting weights, he got into meditation and yoga because that was part of their activities there. 10, 18 It was more realistic. 9 They had groups all the time where he could talk and talk and talk. 10 He really liked his counselor. 10, 18 It was a beautiful place. 6, 11 I went down there every weekend to visit him and eventually came on home passes and I would bring him home and bring him back and bring him back. 12, 13, 15, 19 I didn’t care what it took. 7 It was awesome because I felt like he really connected with himself. 17, 18 We would go down by the lake and have long talks down there. 10, 14 It was the first time in years that we had really connected. 9, 18, 20 Anyway, they wouldn’t do longer than 30 days because he had already been in treatment once and the county didn’t pay for longer. 7, 9, 16, 19 I’m thinking 60 days at least. 9, 19 Once he caught wind of that, “Nope, I’m getting out in 30 days. 19 I’m ready, I’m good.  I’m good.”  He got out and he came home and he was very motivated to get a job. 19 I got to get a regular schedule in my life like I had there. 11 I need to get a membership at an exercise place to work out. 11, 13 I love that. 13 Everyday I do it. 19 I couldn’t afford to sign him up right away. 14, 16 We had lost our business last summer that kind of went downhill. 9, 16, 17 We didn’t have hardly any income other than mine. 11, 13, 19 My husband get social security but that wasn’t enough. 15, 20 Then Jordan needed all this stuff all the time. 9, 13 Cigarettes and clothes. 17 It was just constant. 9, 12 Treats and, “Bring me this, bring me that.  We didn’t have much income so I couldn’t get him his gym membership and he was like “Oh, whatever.” 13, 18, 19 It was so stressful trying to… 9, 16 I was nervous about him being home. 16, 19 His girlfriend had just totally done him in. 9, 12, 17 She turned into an I don’t know what. 13, 14, 15, 19 She had mental illness issues big time. 8, 14, 15 Her and I were close and she just turned on you. 9, 12, 19 Just turned on you. 9, 19 She wanted him back but she was living with a new guy. 6, 12, 13, 19 “I’m not coming back to you if you are living with him” “Well we’ll just hang out then.” 6, 9, 12, 19 I said, “Jordan, don’t go for that.  I know you love…” 13, 14, 15 “I love her! 13 I love her and I love my dog.” 10, 13 After he got out he realized that wasn't good for him. 14 She’s a bitch anyway. 16 Just get rid of her. 9 I said, “Well, it’s probably a good choice. 17 If she’s not doing you any good.  She’s messing you up.  Telling you she cares but she’s with somebody else. 7 I took him all over to apply for jobs.  First of all, he called and asked this girl out that worked at the jail when he was in jail. 7, 9, 10 And I thought, “Oh good, here we go, another relationship.” 11, 12 I said, “What did they recommend in treatment? 9, 12, 16 Don’t get involved and work on yourself for a while here.”  “I know mom, but you aren’t me.” 13, 14, 15 He starts going out with the girl from the jail and he moved in with her after a week. 8, 9, 11 He moved in with her. 8 He has been out of treatment for two weeks. 9, 16 She had a little boy and I know she had tons of problems. 13, 14, 15 Nice gal, but just… 9, 12 AS: Is this just this spring? 9, 12 LB: It has been a couple of months. 8 He got out in May.  I could see some of the patterns starting with him again. 9, 11 He wasn’t handling his anxiety and he was on all these different meds and they changed them all around and they put him on not suboxone but a different one with the opiates that would keep him from craving it. 8, 10, 12, 16, 17 AS: Methadone?  LB: No, a different one. 16, 17 AS: Vivitrol?  Epinephrine?  LB: Yeah the vivitrol I think.  AS: A shot? 15 LB: No, he takes a pill. 6 I can’t think of the name of it now but it was one I recommended and he started on it there and he said it really helped because he wasn’t thinking about using. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 He wasn’t thinking about drinking. 6, 14 He said I am just focused now. 9, 12, 14, 15 I feel better. 16 I got on a different antidepressant and that seems to be working better for him. 16, 17, 19 His anxiety was still there. 9 They took him off the ativan and wouldn’t want to go back on it. 13, 19 He wished for that because he felt better on it. 17 He is living with Taylor and her little boy and he loves the little boy. 6, 13 He loves kids. 13 He stayed there and then he decided he had to get a job because we didn’t have work for him in our business because our business… 5, 9, 12 we were forced out of our business in town. 9, 19 We got evicted and we couldn’t pay the rent there. 16 We moved everything out to our farm which was unorganized and we couldn’t do what we were doing because we didn’t have any sales. 8 Everything was downhill.  He said, “I need to get a job somewhere and keep myself busy.” 9, 12, 13 He got a job, went to about 20 places interviewing and got a job eventually with Jesse Trouble doing basement foundations which was a horrible, hard job to do but he stuck in it. 6, 9, 11, 15, 17 I kept feeling sorry for him thinking, “I got to pull him out of this. 10, 16 It is too hard for him. 11 He has to get up at 5 in the morning and drive to Litchfield.” 7, 14 AS: Poor baby! 5 LB: I feel so bad! 16 He doesn’t have any money.  I would scrape up a little for cigarettes for him thinking I want you to quit but whatever. 13 At least you’re not drinking and using drugs. 6, 9, 14 I can’t take everything away from him. 6, 16 He worked and he was very reliable.  He talked about maybe being a supervisor eventually but he only got 11 dollars an hour. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 I mean oh god, that is terrible for the work you do. 10, 15, 16 Then Craig got into this thing recently where they repair semi trailers out at our place. 11 At first it was slow but now it really picked up. 9, 14 Now they have a chance to make some pretty good money doing it. 16, 18 This guy also sponsored my son in racing. 12 Everything kind of looked up. 16, 17 In the meantime we were losing our home. 16, 19 It was in foreclosure. 15 The sale was set for June 7th. 17 It has passed now. 14 We did come up with the money. 13, 19 We didn’t know how. 13, 14, 15 It was like some people came forward that we didn’t hardly know and they helped us. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 It was like an angel stepped into our life. 9, 11, 12 We weren’t planning.  We’ve got six months to move out and we have been there for 30 something years. 8, 20 It was a total disaster. 9, 20 This spring was a total, in some ways, he went to treatment, did good, then he got out and things were just stressful. 9, 12, 16, 17 We were losing our house. 6, 9 He was in limbo I felt with his use. 9, 17 Now, we did get the house saved. 6, 9 We owe tons of money to people to pay them back. 16, 19 I don’t know how we are going to do that. 13, 14, 15 Anyway, Jordan… 16 him and Taylor were not doing well.  The new girlfriend. 6, 12 She went out with some old boyfriend. 12, 20 He found out about it.  She thought he was seeing Caitlin again, the first girlfriend and he really wasn’t. 9, 11, 12 Anyway, he didn’t have any income because he quit his job. 13, 16, 19 He finally couldn’t take the job anymore. 6, 13 My husband talked him into coming back to work for him. 10, 11, 15, 19 I was leery, I thought, “There’s not a lot of order around here. 8, 11, 12, 17 They’re kind of unorganized and it is dad and it is easy to say I’m sleeping in today.” 7, 16, 17, 19 That’s exactly what happened. 10, 12, 13 He just started sleeping all day. 7, 9, 11, 12, 19 He wouldn’t get up.  I’m thinking, “Oh god. 10 Don’t tell me he is back into pills or something again.” 19 I thought, “He can’t because he is testing randomly for his probation requirements.” 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 I would look up warrants everyday because I don’t really know at this point what is going on with him. 7, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: He is still living with…? 6, 9 LB: He is living with us now. 6, 14 He moved out. 8 She kicked him out and said he is crazy, she can’t live with him. 16 He did come out a couple weeks ago on a Sunday and I said, “Jordan, what is wrong?” 13, 19 He came in the house. 6, 9, 19 “I don’t have any effing money.  I’m sick of living like this. 6 I drive a piece of crap car. 7, 14 I had everything at one time.  I sold drugs and I had money. 14, 20 I am so tempted to go back to selling drugs again.” 7, 14, 19 I said, “Jordan, you have that choice. 17 But do you want to sit in prison? 13 You say I’ll just do my prison term and get it over with. 9, 12 Do you realize that once you got in there it is worse than jail and you would regret your decision?” 14, 16 “I know I would but I don’t care at this point. 7, 13, 14, 15 I’m so sick of everything.  I don’t want to be sober all my life. 6, 11, 13 I would rather be drinking and using drugs because I felt a lot better. 6, 13, 14, 17 This is crap.  I’m not living like this for five years I’m on probation. 6, 10, 20 They almost set him up to fail. 9, 17 They give him five months probation but it seems like eternity at that age. 6, 8, 10, 16, 19 It is a long time.  I am living in limbo now with him. 6, 14 He is at our house, Taylor won’t let him come back even though he’s got half his stuff there she won’t let him come back and get it. 6, 9, 13, 15, 19 He is going to have to figure that out he is trying to be nice so he can get his stuff back. 9, 13, 16, 19 He wants to see the little boy again because he misses him. 11, 13 In the meantime his ex-girlfriend took his dog. 10, 12, 16 She came out one night when she had found out he had a girlfriend and she came out one night and just took the dog from me. 9, 10, 12, 19 Just came to our house and grabbed this big german shepherd that we loved. 6, 8, 9, 13, 19 We took care of her all these years because they couldn’t have her in town and took her. 7, 19, 20 Jordan was just upset. 9, 12, 17, 19 He loved that dog so much. 10, 13, 18 Now he is starting to see her a little bit again so he can see the dog. 9, 10, 11 A couple nights ago Craig came in and said, “He’s got to be using again because he is acting so strange. 7, 9, 10, 19 He sleeps all day and he is talking stupid and he is getting all anxious and worked up and mad like he used to and I don’t know where it is headed. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 That is basically where we are at right now with it. 7, 11, 14 We don’t know really. 13, 14, 15 I had a talk with him yesterday and I tried to stay calm and not question him constantly because sometimes he will give information if I don’t ask him. 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19 AS: If you just surround… 8, 9, 12 He did say Taylor doesn’t want him back. 13, 19 I heard him call her and she said, “No, you can’t come back. 7, 13, 15, 19 You are crazy.” 16 He had some outburst with her crying. 9, 11 He was at our house one day because they were going to cook out because she is kind of demanding. 6, 9, 16, 17, 19 “We need to do fun things on the weekends. 12, 13, 16, 19 You can’t work every weekend.” 12, 19 Well, sometimes that’s what you have to do. 5, 18 She didn’t, of course, she is kinda idealistic. 9, 11, 13, 16, 17 She wanted him to pay the rent. 12, 13, 16 I think she kind of took him in because she thought he had some money coming in. 11, 12, 16, 17 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 He is living… 6 he sleeps pretty much everyday. 7, 18, 19 He wants money and I say, “Jordan, you need to work. 11, 13 You only out in a couple hours all week. 11 We can’t pay you for what you haven’t worked. 16 We want to help you but you need to help yourself somewhat here. 13 You need to start going to meetings again. 9, 11, 13 Don’t you want to…” 13 I’m through all that crap.  I’m not doing any of that stuff. 9 As soon as I am off probation I am going to start using again. 9, 10, 11 I like my life better like that. 10, 11 AS: In five years he is going to do that? 20 LB: He thinks he might get off sooner although I don’t think so.  Because they already took that away from him. 16 Whatever that is called. 7 He is walking the fence right now. 14, 15 Some days I think, well, I read some of the stuff people post: 9, 19 Let them go, you can’t…  And I understand that part of it but it is my kid. 9, 12, 16 I love him to death, he’s got so much potential. 13, 15, 18 He is a loving, sweet person inside.  He is the closest to me. 9 He was my baby. 5 He was sweet.  He had episodes but, you know? 13, 14, 15 I can’t imagine seeing him in prison. 14 I keep thinking that in my mind. 12 I want to … 13 his PO and his dad…  I better try to stay out of it. 9, 16 Everybody has got their own opinions.  I saw this thing the other day. 19 “Give your child what they need, not what they deserve.” 13 It is like yeah, that is where I am at. 10 I am a terrible caretaker. 6, 7, 15 I know I am. 13, 14, 15 AS: You mean you are terrible in that you care take and you’re saying that that is terrible? 6, 7, 11, 15, 16 LB: People tell me it is terrible. 15 My daughter yelled at me the other day. 5, 19 She is almost an RN now. 9, 14 She has turned her life way around. 8, 11, 16, 19 She is very successful.  She knows all the answers. 13, 14, 15 “Mom, you’ve always been like this.” 16, 17 More or less saying that I wasn’t a very good mom because I took care of everybody too much. 7, 11, 15, 18 She fails to remember what I had to go through with her and if I hadn’t hung in there with her I don’t know what would have been. 13, 14, 15 She got into drugs too when she was young. 14 Somehow overcame them on her own. 19 I pulled her out of a drug house one night after work. 6, 9, 14, 19 I have been there for all the kids like that.  AS: You have been there for all your kids but now you’re thinking of yourself as not a good mother? 14 LB: I feel like I have been, not that I have failed, but I feel like I should have this, I should have done that. 16 I don’t dwell on that because I know I can’t change it. 13, 14, 15, 16 I have to move forward and do what is good for me. 9 But then again see my husband is not like he used to be. 9, 10, 15 He’s not a caring… 7 we don’t have a very good relationship ever since he has had this affair.  It just took something out of it. 9, 12 I tried to overcome it. 10, 13, 19 I got into therapy.  He keeps telling me how strong I am and that I can get through all of this without falling apart, but I feel like sometimes I am falling apart inside because I can’t remember things. 5, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20 I can’t focus like I used to. 9, 15 I just have this in the back of my mind all the time. 9, 12, 19 I am worried with Jordan now. 14 I am worried about everybody.  I am worried about all the kids.  I have a 46 year old living in my apartment above the shop that is a chronic alcoholic. 5, 6, 20 AS: That is your oldest? 5, 9, 20 LB: He is my oldest. 5, 9, 20 People say kick him out.  Tell him to get out of there.  We would have to foot the bill if we kicked him out.  It’s not an option.  I can’t stand it. 9, 12 I’m getting so I can’t stand him. 9, 12 He’s my kid and I can’t stand him. 9, 12 I love him and I feel bad for him but I can’t stand his behaviors. 9, 12, 13, 16 Taking care of everybody. 7 I don’t see an end to it really. 12 I don’t know where the end is ever going to… 12, 13, 14, 15 until I die probably.  I’m going to be 65 soon.  I think, “Geez!  This isn’t what I had planned for at 65.  I just thought things would be more settled or something. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 I don’t know why I thought that.” 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: What is Seth doing?  LB: Seth was working for a company.  He was working with my husband in this business. 9, 15 Seth kind of took over the financial end of it. 12, 16, 17 He is very good with that.  Although, some of the decisions… 11, 16 he made my husband and him… 15, 16 this business kind of tore the family apart. 9, 16, 17, 18, 20 AS: What was the business? 9 LB: At first they did work in food processing plants. 9 They traveled all over putting piping and machines in and equipment. 10 It traveled all over the country doing that. 11, 16 We sold out and then we started a local business in Willmar called Candy Coatings. 7, 9, 11, 20 They did sandblasting, painting, and powder coating and that kind of stuff. 9, 16, 17 That led into…  my husband has been in and out of many businesses. 9, 15 He is very good coming up with something.  But he is not good at keeping records, following through. 6, 7, 11, 12 Anyway, Seth took that over and I think he is good at it but he would spend money on things he thought was important and Craig didn’t agree. 11, 12, 16, 19 AS: It pulled them apart. 20 Is Seth sober that you know? 6, 13, 14, 15 LB: No. He is a social drinker. 6, 14 I don’t know really. 13, 14, 15 One time I thought he was more than that but I think he is straightening out. 6, 9, 11, 12, 15 He has seemed to identify what is good for him and what isn’t. 19 He is growing up a little bit. 17 He is 27 and his adult brain is starting to function and his frontal lobe or whatever is kicking in! 9, 11 [laughter]  He has tried to help us figure out what to do financially. 10, 13 He races stock cars and he’s very good. 7, 9 He has won some huge races.  He is famous out in west central Minnesota. 9 I am just so proud of him with that. 9, 12 Jordan has always felt second to Seth. 16, 17, 20 He has always felt he is not as good, he is big, he should have been in football. 8, 16, 17 He is like a football player. 8 He is huge.  That kept him from snocross racing.  AS: He didn’t find his own way. 16 Then, my husband always told him, “We want to get you into racing too. 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 We will build a car for you.” 7 We have never been able to afford it. 15 Jordan has had to work for things more so than Seth. 16 Seth kinda got things handed to him. 16, 17 He was older and he got spoiled. 5, 20 He is a real achiever.  Jordan isn’t as much. 18 He’s very intelligent but he just doesn’t have that spark to… 9, 12 plus he has some mental health issues that Seth doesn’t have. 14, 15 AS: Have you ever had him diagnosed?  LB: Yes.  We sent him to St. Cloud. 7 When he was in treatment he went up to St. Cloud, I can’t think of the name of the place now, where they diagnosed him. 6, 9, 11, 14, 16 He went and did a lot of testing. 9, 17 Yes.  It came back with him having defiance disorder, which doesn’t mean a whole heck of a lot. 8, 16, 17, 19 I have a little bit of background in psychology, not that I remember all of it. 8, 19 It was like a blanket coverage, typical things that I kind of already knew. 6, 12, 16, 17 We didn’t find anything alarming or…  Yes.  He has anxiety and depression and he has always had that. 16, 17 As a kid even. 15 He just wasn’t diagnosed back then. 9, 12, 19 He has always had a lot of anxiety even as a little kid he did. 15, 16, 17 Seth will just brush things off and go think by himself. 9, 12, 16 Jordan will act out and scream and holler. 10 AS: Do you have any good mother friends? 12, 18 LB: Just through work. 9 A couple ladies that I work with.  One has gone through a little of this stuff. 9 I think she has a real mental disorder too. 14 It is hard. 11 I have to overlook that a little bit to share with her.  I mean, she knows what is going on. 13, 14, 15, 16 She is nice.  She is very nice.  I don’t put her down for that. 10 Not really.  I have lost contact with some of my friends partly because I feel like for one thing I had kids later. 9, 10, 12, 16, 18 People my age their kids are all grown and gone. 17, 19 I have six grandkids with my older kids. 5, 7, 20 The younger ones, I was the old mom in school. 5, 8, 14, 15, 20 [laughs]  With Jordan, I was 42 when I had him.  It seems like people my age or people that I was friends with have moved on in their life. 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19 They are retired, they are going on trips. 12, 19 They aren’t mothering anymore. 13 If they did have problems they are off dealing with them on their own. 13 I am still dealing with my youngest. 9, 13, 14 My therapist says 6, 9 I am the one that always feels like I have to take care of everything. 6, 7, 16, 17 What is going on with this today? 19 Are you getting that trailer done today? 19 I am constantly having to be on top of everything. 9 I think that comes from the jobs I have done too. 13, 19 I have always been at the top trying to lead everybody. 16, 17 I try and do that with my family and that doesn’t work. 16, 18 It drives me crazy. 7, 14, 16 I have to let go of some of that. 19 I think that was part of the reason I wanted to do this. 12, 13 “Oh, I get a chance to talk about my problems.” 10 Nobody wants to hear them! 11, 13 AS: Hopefully your therapist does. 6, 9, 11 LB: Well, he does, yes. 14 He is good.  He is old. 20 He is like in his late 70s.  I have known him for a long time and he kind of runs this whole place. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 He had a lot of therapists and stuff. 6, 9, 17 I think he is getting Alzheimer's.  He forgets what we have talked about. 10, 11 He will start something… 9, 11 AS: You might need to find someone else. 13 LB: That is where things are at. 16 I may have missed a few things along the way. 16 AS: How is Gabriel?  He was the one who was three times… 18 LB: Yes.  He had a kidney disease we discovered when he was 14. 12 He started drinking probably in his early 20s. 6, 9, 11, 14 My oldest didn't do that when they were young. 5, 9, 14, 20 They started doing it when they were later. 9, 11 Their dad is a chronic alcoholic. 5 He turned himself around eventually. 8, 15, 19 Their grandpa was. 7 Gabriel has a lot of health issues. 14, 15, 17 He had two heart attacks already.  He turned 45 in May. 19 Like I said, they were borderline.  Both the oldest boys went through special ed back when they didn’t mainstream kids. 5, 8, 9, 19, 20 They kept them in a room all day no matter how bad they were. 7, 19, 20 They didn’t really get what they needed in school I don’t think. 8, 13 AS: For the IEP.  LB: Yes.  I think that really affected them a lot in thinking that we aren’t really good enough. 17, 20 We aren’t very smart. 20 Yet, they are, they are very intelligent.  They just have a hard time applying themselves to things. 9, 11, 12, 16 Gabe was married and got divorced. 5 He has three kids.  That was terrible. 15 They had money, they had fitness centers, and they went broke and lost everything. 9, 14 He just went through all kinds of stuff too. 9, 12, 16, 17 He has all these health issues. 14, 15 His hips are collapsing.  He weighs almost 400 pounds now. 9, 14 He used to be real fit. 9, 14 His whole life has collapsed around in. 8, 11 I stepped in and took care of that because I had to. 7, 9, 12 He needed help. 13 Nobody was really there for him.  It is so hard to get anything from the community anymore. 11, 13 As far as social services. 14 We fought and fought for disability.  Finally got him disability.  He worked at a job for many years, … 20 Manufacturing. 10 They got rid of him because of his health issues. 14, 15 It wasn’t really even legal I don’t think. 15 We just didn’t have the money to fight it. 9, 12 We didn’t have the money to get an attorney.  We didn’t call for assistance with it. 7, 9 Just had to let go of it and say, “Let’s get disability then so you have something to live on.” 9, 19 AS: You have been through some stuff. 9 You really have.  LB: Well, yeah, you kind of wonder why some people don’t go through all of this. 10, 16, 17 Then you kinda start thinking maybe I brought a lot of it on myself because of the way I am so caretaking. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 Ignore it when it is your kid?  It doesn’t matter how old they are. 20 I still, now I am taking him down. 9, 14 He went through treatment like three times. 9, 16, 18 He almost died twice from alcohol. 9 I was with him detoxing in the hospital. 10 They had to detox him in the hospital because his heart and his liver and everything was bad. 10 He wasn’t functioning well at all.  They had to really watch him.  AS: How old was he then? 20 LB: That was two years ago. 20 AS: So that was recent?  He is not drinking now. 6, 14 He went through treatment three times like I said. 9, 16, 18 I think he is still sober. 6, 9 We hope he is. 10 He seems to be. 16, 19 Now, he was going to get a weight loss surgery because they can’t operate on his hips until he loses some weight. 18 They thought it was going to be too hard on his body. 11, 12 They recommended weight loss surgery. 12, 18 We went down to Abbott.  Got that all set up and then he started drinking again so he couldn’t go through with it. 6, 9, 11, 14, 17 He was so bad he would just lay on the ground. 8, 9, 12 We would try to get him up. 16 His son starting racing. 9, 11 My grandson. 7 He had a first race. 9 He was laying out in the yard.  We should have brought him to the hospital. 9, 18 He was probably near death.  I don’t know how many times we have gone through that with him. 13, 14, 15, 18 I think he is sover.  We are going on the 8th again to redo all the stuff for the weight loss surgery. 9, 12, 18 I am taking him down there on the 8th.  We had an appointment the other day and then his car quit. 7, 19 I didn’t have tabs on my car and I had forgotten about it so I didn’t want to take a chance of driving a car down there so we will take his car. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 His son had taken it and didn’t tell him the battery was dead. 6 It was a big mess. 8 We had to cancel and reschedule.  AS: Do you think he will do this surgery then?  He wants to. 11, 13 He just hates himself the way he is. 9, 12, 16 He is self conscious.  He doesn’t feel well. 16 He can’t get around. 8 He can’t climb steps. 9, 12 It has just taken so much away from him. 6, 9, 12, 16, 18 AS: Where does he live?  LB: He lives in Hutchinson.  He lives in an apartment that I got him. 20 I had to get him housing and get him assistance because he just couldn’t do it on his own. 9, 12 There was nobody to help him really. 13 My daughter has taken over some of it. 5, 6 She is a nurse.  She took over his medication and stuff because I said I can’t do all this. 9, 10 I am trying to work. 16 I am trying to deal with my own family. 13, 16, 18 Put out my own fires. 15 I can’t physically or mentally do all this. 7, 14 She took that over.  Still helping him with his meds. 13 Then she did end up having to take over his finances too because he wasn’t doing a good job of it. 6, 12 He was just giving money away. 9, 11, 12, 16 He is real vulnerable too in some sense. 17 AS: Is there anything else?  LB: No, I can’t really…  I feel like ever since I had… 16 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I feel like my life has been kind of a disaster ever since I was in high school. 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 20 [laughter]  It is just one thing after another. 9, 12 I keep thinking, “Do I bring this on or are these things that just happen to me?” 9, 12, 16 Being a parent has been a chronic… 10, 16 something thrown at me everyday it seems like. 16, 19 AS: Which is interesting thinking about your mother. 9, 19 LB: We are almost the same probably. 9 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: I don’t know, no, I just mean she just gave her children away. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 LB: I am going to do a DNA test to see if I have any matches anywhere. 9 If anything would show up.  If anybody has tried that. 10 AS: To see if your father? 5 LB: It is like 100 bucks but I am going to save up and do it.  Try to find my father. 5 He is probably not alive but maybe my brothers. 5, 9 She said I have two brothers. 5 One would be 10 years younger than me and one would be a year younger. 5, 14, 20 I don’t know if she made that up because she was a storyteller too. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: I don’t know why you would make that up. 13, 14, 15, 16 No one else in the family ever heard that from her. 15, 18 She never said that to anybody else. 15 Nobody knew she was pregnant. 6, 12 AS: They wouldn’t have found you if she hadn’t brought you back. 9, 18, 19 She had hidden that from everybody.  AS: So she has a record of being able to do that. 6 LB: Yes.  Yes.  And she tried to play grandma to my kids but I was just like no. 7, 9, 10, 12 Yeah she was real frugal.  She had a lot of money but she was real frugal. 17 She would give them all a pair of socks for christmas and I got those at Goodwill and I only got them for 50 cents. 6, 9, 19 AS: Oh great grandma! 7, 11 LB: Thanks!  Just what we wanted. 9, 12, 13 A pair of argyle socks or something.  Just goofy. 9 Yet, there are so many similarities we have.  She loved collecting and antiques and I am so into that. 13 We have some similarities.  And art.  She was an artist and I kind of took that up when I was younger. 5, 9, 14, 16, 17 I don’t do it now. 14 Funny how life can… 11 Then my cousin who I grew up with as a brother, all the parents have passed away now. 5, 10, 14, 16 They are all gone it is just my brother and I and we have a couple cousins in the family. 5, 9, 12, 18, 19 Not many left.  We have a strange relationship too. 7, 9 He never married, never had kids. 15 He bought my parent’s home. 7, 10, 16, 19 He is still there. 9 Has a dog and a cat and he had retired when he was really young. 10, 12, 14, 19 He was living in Miami for many years. 6, 20 He worked at immigration and had a very powerful job with that and made a lot of money. 15, 16, 17 He moved up here and worked for Todd County for a while in the court system. 8, 9 Now he retired for good. 12, 19 He decided he wanted to go back for a while and he did. 12, 13, 19 He was real tight.  He didn’t want to help with the house thing. 6, 9, 13 It is like, “Really? 10 I would if I had the money.  I would help you.” 13 I didn’t say that to him because I can’t talk to him like that. 10 I’m not real close to him.  AS: Right.  But you asked. 10 Which takes a lot of courage. 6, 17 LB: Yes.  He did help us one time a while back. 13, 19 We never paid him back a thousand bucks. 15, 19 Because we just never could do it. 9, 12, 15 I was like I can’t ask him again.  It is just one of those things. 9, 12, 16 You just have to... 9, 12 AS: You just keep on. 9, 12 LB: It’s like, well, it’s kinda sad but you move on. 10, 12, 16, 17 We aren’t going to be real close probably ever.  Because I was the warrior in the family. 18 I was the one that did smoke and drink and he read books and sat in his room. 6, 7, 14 Didn’t go anywhere.  Went to college and I pumped out kids left and right and drank and partied. 7, 8, 14 Good grief.  I didn’t fit in that family very well. 14, 18 [laughter]  My dad was a politician. 8 A barber and a hairdresser then he was the mayor of our city. 5, 9, 12, 14, 20 We lived in a suburb of the cities. 14 LB: Lexington.  He was on the metropolitan council. 5, 11 He was very political and it drove me nuts. 7, 14 I was never into that. 15 I was a hippie back in the 60s. 19 Hung out at love ins at Powderhorn Park. 13 It was fun.  AS: Thank you.  This has been really interesting. 9, 19 LB: I hope there is something that will be helpful. 10, 13 It was fun to get together with you anyway. 16 This was kind of a treat for me to get away and do some … sometimes. 5, 16, 17, 18 It feels that way anyway. 16 There probably are people out there that can help but you don’t really know how to find them sometimes. 5, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: My question is why do we continue to critique and judge our mothering? 6, 9 We are either mothering too much, as you think you are, or not mothering enough. 18, 20 What do you think about that?  LB: I think it is women in general. 18 I think we are raised that way. 5, 16 I think it is put into our mind from an early age that the mom is the feeling part of the family and the caring part of the family. 7, 10, 15, 16, 18 The dad is more the breadwinner.  They don’t talk as much. 10, 18 They aren’t quite as feel-y as the moms. 15, 16, 18 AS: But why wouldn’t they be the ones responsible for all the troubles?  Why isn’t there that sense of how “Oh I failed my son.” 17 LB: My husband does feel that way. 15, 16 He does a lot. 17 He knows that he probably spoiled him and gave him too much and didn’t tend to the issues as they arose and instead was just waiting. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 He doesn’t like confrontation. 10 I think he does feel bad about some of that. 16 AS: Maybe they just might not want to speak about it very often. 9, 12, 13, 15 There is not the cultural expectation of caregiving. 7, 11 LB: Right.  I agree that is a big part of it. 8 AS: I wonder if that is going to change a little bit. 16 LB: I wonder.  AS: I see dads doing more.  LB: Oh, yes. 14 Much more than when I was a kid.  Dad would come home and mom would have the table set, mom would clean up. 13, 15, 17, 19 That is ok if that is what you want to do. 13 It’s not bad but things have changed. 16 In some ways I think it was good because I think the family dynamics were a little bit closer back then than they are now in some ways. 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 I don’t agree with everything.  But I think families are really not together like they used to be. 9 At least I have experienced that myself. 9 We are encouraging kids to be so independent and involved in this and involved in that and do this. 12 They’ve got to go to college. 8 I don’t agree with that either.  Kids have different interests. 9, 16, 17, 19 In that respect I think I did ok.  Even trying to homeschool. 8, 16, 19 Even if it failed.  Seth went on to get his GED and he is fine. 14 He went to college for a little bit and didn’t like it. 8, 10 They hate school. 8 They like to have hands on jobs. 10 That’s fine. 14 Whatever works. 14 I feel like I wish I had done a little more with myself. 16 I mean I got a degree in psychology and communication. 10, 16, 20 I worked in jobs and it helped but… 13, 16 I never really made any money doing anything with that. 15, 16 AS: What is it that you do exactly? 10 LB: Right now I work at… 14 I took this just as part time because I wasn’t working at all when our business was succeeding. 9, 12 It is called Chyrsalis in Willmar. 7 It is a friend of mine owns it. 12 It is mentally ill, mentally handicapped adults. 14 Right now I am just working with two women part time in their own apartment. 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 I go there a couple hours a day. 11, 19 It is some money.  It is a job.  At lesat I am doing something.  AS: And it is part time?  she would like me to do more. 10 AS: You have a lot on your plate. 17 LB: There is a lot going on. 17 Defintiely.  AS: At least for that kind of work. 9, 16, 17 IF you were to do other work maybe it shouldn’t be caretaking. 7, 9 LB: And I had a si… program.  I worked at the women’s shelter as an advocate. 10, 18 I went to court with a lot of women. 17, 18 I worked at a facility for teenage girls for 12 years. 8, 20 Just a lot. 9, 17 I worked at the crisis center. 9 I worked with a boys group. 8 Sexually abused boys. 8, 9 I had that group for a long time.  I guess that is what I felt comfortable doing. 10, 17 I loved doing that. 13 But it does take a toll after a while. 6 You know that I am sure. 13, 14, 15 You kinda just get where you lose yourself in it almost. 9, 12, 16, 17 I can do this sure. 15 I can help them yup. 13 I can help them yup. 13 What is your problem.  AS: Thank you. "
"2","Beck_Thilo","Janie Bining Colford Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 29, 2016  At the Narrator’s Home Chanhassen, Minnesota Janie Bining Colford-JC Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I’m with Janie Bining Colford at her home in Chanhassen. 19 It is June 29, I think.  JC: Yes.  AS: Janie would you state your name and say that you give me permission to record this interview? 6, 9 JC: Sure.  Janie Bining Colford and I give permission for you to record this. 6 AS: Thank you.  Can you just start by talking a little bit about your childhood and where you grew up and where you went to college? 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Just to kind of give us a little life background. 6, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 JC: Sure.  I grew up in a suburb of, in the country outside of Cincinnati, Ohio on a farm. 11, 16 It was mostly a grain farm but we had cows and pigs and chickens. 9 I was one of three girls. 8 Although I do have a half-brother from an affair my father had. 5, 20 A pretty normal farm girl childhood. 11, 18 I went to Claremont Northeastern School, high school. 8, 9 I have a horticulture degree and worked in the horticulture field for a number of years. 20 Then moved to Minnesota and worked, I think I was twenty-one maybe, when I moved to Minnesota. 8, 9 I worked for a landscape, lawn care company in Roseville. 7, 8 Albrecht Landscaping, actually. 10 Just did that for the summer. 9 Decided that horticulture wasn’t really a good year round thing in Minnesota. 8, 20 So I started working for Prudential. 9, 11 I came here, actually this is maybe key to the story. 9, 10, 19 I came to be in Minnesota because a guy that I met while in college that I was sort of engaged to, although I think it was more kind of a fling. 5, 8, 16, 17, 19 He came here for chemical dependency training. 9, 12, 19 After he got out of treatment he stayed here. 5, 9, 16 I moved here and we lasted maybe a month. 8, 9 Another guy that he lived with, that also had been in treatment, he and I started dating. 9, 11, 16 We ended up getting married and having two kids. 12 My ex-husband, is the father of my two older boys. 5, 8, 15, 20 He was in recovery for a number of years, although now he drinks and smokes. 6, 14, 20 As far as I know that’s all. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know what else you want to know. 13, 14, 15 I was twenty five or twenty six when I had my oldest son. 5, 9, 20 Then two years later had Chance. 20 Now I have three other children with my second husband. 14, 15, 20 AS: So how long were you married to your older boy’s father? 5, 20 JC: I think I got married in 1989.  We got divorced in 1997. 5 We split up in 1983.  AS: ‘93 do you mean? 16 Yes, ’93, so not very long.  [Laughs].  AS: Were you single parenting the boys for a while? 8, 10, 15, 16 JC: No, I had for probably a year and a half, I had them during the week and every other weekend he had them. 12, 19, 20 Then we switched to I had them for a week and he had them for a week.  He moved to the same town that I was in. 8, 19 So we were able to make that work, same school district and everything. 8, 9, 16 [Side conversation]. 12 [Recording resumes after break] 18 So we did week to week for the boys which worked out well for the most part. 8 Although different parenting styles in each house I’m sure was one of our biggest challenges. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17 The fact that the boys stepmother, who was very controlling and very much wanted to be their real mom, made it a little bit difficult. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 Anyways we did that pretty much up until they were out of high school. 8, 16, 17, 18 Probably at least until the older one was. 5, 9, 20 When Chance, he’s the one with substance abuse disorder, when he was in high school he started using. 8, 9, 11 Maybe even before then. 15 When we started to become aware of that that was when he was in high school. 8, 9, 11, 13, 19 I think it was his senior year that my husband, my current husband, did a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. 15, 16, 20 We had to move down there.  We moved to Jacksonville Beach for a year. 8, 20 Chance was going to stay here with his dad and finish high school. 8, 9 Then he never quite made it to his senior year because he had a DUI. 15, 16, 20 I shouldn’t say he didn’t make it to his senior year. 16, 20 He didn’t make it back to Champlin Park High for his senior year. 16, 19, 20 He went to some alternative sober high school. 6, 8 In January of his senior year, which would have been 2008, he moved to Jacksonville Beach to live with me and my husband. 8, 15, 20 At the time it was just Emma. 9, 12 So he went down there and he got into the public school down there and finished high school. 8 AS: How was it when you first started noticing problems with him in high school? 8, 9, 11 What was your approach as a mother towards his problems?  JC: What I knew was that he was smoking weed. 6, 12 I did not know that he was drinking alcohol and doing other drugs, which apparently he was. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 I didn’t really think it was a big deal. 8, 13 [Side conversation with kid]. 12 [Recording resumes after break] 18 AS: You were saying that you weren’t concerned about his pot smoking. 11 It seemed kind of within normal teen parameters? 5, 16, 17, 19 JC: It did, except there were a couple times when he was in trouble with the police. 7, 18 He was smoking weed in a public park and he got picked up.  We did what we thought was the right thing at the time, which was send him to do an assessment and then just an outpatient treatment. 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 He went to Anthony Louis Center.  We just kind of monitored him. 9, 12, 16, 17 Probably didn’t have my eyes wide open at the time because according to him he was doing many other things besides marijuana that was not obvious to me. 14, 16, 17 I earlier said that he came down to Florida to live with us. 19 That really came about because right before senior year started he was picked up for a DUI. 9, 11, 14, 19, 20 He went back to treatment at that time, back to Anthony Louis this time as an inpatient. 9, 16, 19 That was when I was in Florida.  AS: Where is Anthony Louis?  Is it around here? 8 JC: It’s in Anoka I think.  AS: Okay, I’ve never heard of it. 15 JC: They have On-Belay  House which is in Plymouth, so it’s part of that whole group. 9 Anyway, he did that and he went to Anthony Louis Center. 16 Then he went into sober school. 6, 8 I forget which one.  He’s been to like three of them around here. 8 That may or may not be in existence now. 9, 14, 15 Then he started using again. 9, 11 He went back to Anthony Louis Center for a third time probably within like a year and half period. 19, 20 Went right from there to On-Belay House which is a halfway house, or transitional house, in Plymouth. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 He was going to a sober high school and got kicked out of there. 6, 8 Not for using but for attitude.  Imagine that, an addict with an attitude.  AS: Yes or a teenager with an attitude.  Imagine.  JC: He got kicked out of there.  He was hanging out with kind of… 16, 17, 18 his dad would not let him back in his house. 6, 9, 19 AS: You were in Florida.  JC: I was in Florida and this was winter.  His dad took him around all the homeless centers one night. 8, 9, 19 They were full. 11 This is a seventeen year old boy. 20 I guess he was playing the tough love card. 7, 10, 13, 18 Nobody had any room at the inn. 7 [Laughs].  So he ended up couch surfing for a few days. 12, 19 Then we bought him a ticket to come down to Florida, which was an experience because he got down there and we immediately got him enrolled in the high school. 7, 8, 13, 19 I’d come to find out he needed like one class. 13, 19, 20 This was January into his senior year and he’d been to school maybe a cumulatively three weeks out of that whole senior year so far. 8, 9, 20 He only needed one class to finish up school in Florida. 8, 13, 20 We made him take a full load and he got a job at the local, little pizza shop down there. 6, 11, 16 Again, kind of eyes half closed, he got into drugs down there and was drinking. 6, 10, 14, 16, 17 Keeping it relatively secret not so bad that it became obvious. 5, 19 Until a couple months before we moved back here. 8, 19 His boss caught him sneaking beer while at work from the tap.  Confronted him about it and addressed it and then he kept his job. 14 He was better at sneaking the beer I guess. 10 Am I rambling too much? 18 At what point does it start to get worse? 9, 11 JC: So we came back here, this was 2008. 19 He graduated from Neptune Fletcher High School, or something, down there. 8, 19 It was in Jacksonville Beach.  That was like in May.  In July of that year we moved back up here to Minnesota. 8, 19, 20 At the time we lived in Champlin.  He got a job and he started community college. 8, 9, 11 Things were going okay.  AS: Was he living with you? 6 JC: Yes, he was living with me and my husband. 6, 15 By now I was pregnant with the twins. 14 That went on and I’m sure he was using and drinking a little bit. 6, 14, 15 It didn’t seem out of control. 17, 19 He was, like I said, working.  He was going to school. 8 He was getting good grades. 20 Then it was August in 2001 when he went out to New York with his dad and stepmom and brother to his cousin’s wedding. 5, 9, 12, 15 While he was there he was talking to his cousins. 5, 10 Apparently he told one of his cousins that he was using heroin. 5, 10, 16, 20 The uncle, the cousin’s dad, overheard this and told my ex-husband. 5, 15, 20 Then John, the dad of the cousin, my ex-husband’s brother, called me to tell me. 5, 7, 15 We just weren’t sure how to address this. 9, 12, 14, 15 We didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 We had never in our wildest dreams thought he would be using heroin. 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17 Apparently he was unique in that he never used prescription drugs. 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 AS: Oh, he just went straight to it. 6, 9, 12 JC: He just went straight to heroin. 6, 9, 12 I want to say probably went straight to injecting. 6, 9, 13 We decided that he was such a good negotiator and such a good liar that if we just tried to talk to him without support we wouldn’t be successful. 9, 10, 12 We hired an interventionist from somewhere in Ohio. 9, 12 Her name was Jane Metts. 6 She came out and we did some planning. 19 We decided on Promises Rehab Center out in California. 12 We had this big thing worked out. 8 The morning of it my husband and I kind of made up some, “We’re going somewhere” you know and got Chance. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 It was at his dad’s house. 6, 9 We had someone watching the little kids at my house. 6, 9 We got him over there.  I’d already had a bag packed assuming this would all go his way. 16 We do this intervention and then Jane said, “You’ve heard from your mom and dad. 15 We’ve got this treatment center.” 9, 16 The director the treatment center had flown out. 9, 14, 16 This cost us a lot of money. 9, 17 [Laughs].  “You’ve heard all this and we’ve got this treatment center, Promises is all picked out for you, they’re ready for you.” 9, 15, 16 I can’t remember her name now. 6, 14 “She’s going to fly back with you.” 19 Patricia.  Patricia Meyers. 16 “So what do you think?”  He goes, “Well what are my other options?” 7 Jane said to him, “You don’t have any other options.” 7 He said, “Okay, well then I guess I’ll go.” 10 So he went, did ninety days at Promises. 19 AS: Did you confront, is that the first time you talked to him about his heroin use? 9, 10, 11 Did he admit to it at that point?  JC: Yes.  He was always, and always has been, and still is very forthcoming once you confront him. 9, 16, 17, 19 Once you get him to start talking about it. 9, 10, 11 He’ll do the whole denial thing like, “What are you talking about?” 10 [Yelling kids].  [Resumes after break in recording] 6, 18 He’s always, once you kind of get past the bullshit, then pretty open about his use. 9, 16, 17, 18 Has generally, when push comes to shove and it’s time to go to treatment, he goes. 9, 13, 16, 19 He’s been in inpatient treatment eleven times. 9, 16, 18 AS: Eleven. 15 JC: Eleven times. 18 Some of those times was us saying, “This is your only option.” 11, 18 A couple times he’s asked to go back. 10, 18, 19 So he went to Promises.  Is this the kind of stuff you want to hear? 9, 13, 16, 17 AS: Yes, yes. 14 JC: He went to Promises.  He was in Promises for ninety days and then went to a very structured sober living house in Venice. 6, 9, 12, 19 He was at the West LA Promises, not the Malibu. 9 West LA is more for his age group. 9 Then he did, I think it was about five months, of sober living at a place called Casa del Oeste which is a great place. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 Then he and another boy from there moved out into an apartment on their own. 8, 20 I say boy, I think he was twenty nine at the time.  They both relapsed. 18 We didn’t know that for a little while. 13, 14, 15 The other boy died, not of a drug overdose, but of septic shock. 14, 15 JC: From intravenous needles. 13 Yes.  It was definitely drug related. 14 Chance initiated going back at that point to the sober living house. 6, 9, 19 AS: Just back to the house? 6, 9, 19 JC: Not back to treatment at this point. 9, 16, 19 AS: They let him? 19 JC: Yes, they let him which seemed to work out just fine for a while. 9, 12, 14, 19 He stayed there for another four months. 5, 8, 9 He got a job and he was working at a golf shop and playing golf when he wasn’t working, doing the whole recovery thing.  Then he met this girl at work. 5 Summer was her name. 6 I don’t know if she was ever in recovery but at the time that he met her she was using. 5, 13, 14, 15 So he relapsed. 18 By the time he relapsed he had moved out of the sober living house and was living with two other people in recovery that had long term recovery under their belt, still in Venice. 6, 8, 9, 18 They found out he was using and they called me to let me know that they would be asking him to move out. 7, 13, 14, 15, 19 He moved in with this girlfriend. 8, 12 He was on the street for a few days and then he went back to Promises. 9, 19 He didn’t stay the whole ninety days. 9, 19 He stayed maybe a month and a half. 5, 8, 9, 20 Then he moved in with this girlfriend. 8, 12 Then it got really bad and he and his girlfriend became so, I don’t know what the right word is, they were both using so much. 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 Things were getting out of control. 17 They were scaring each other. 7 She finally called me. 7 I’m trying to remember when this was. 16 It was like 2012 I think.  He came back here. 19 I convinced him that morning to get on a plane. 13 He came back here and did a detox, went straight from the airport to detox then to treatment. 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 19 Then relapsed and just kind of over and over. 9, 12, 16, 17, 18 He went to a couple more treatment places. 9, 11, 16, 17 He wasn’t living here, he was renting rooms. 6, 7, 16 Did a sober living house for a little bit. 6, 9 Then he ended up going out to Utah for treatment. 9, 12, 16 He came back here, went back out to Utah again. 19 [Talks to child].  There’s just treatment, after treatment, after treatment. 9, 12, 16 Relapsed.  Some of those treatments, ninety days, a few of them were ninety days. 6, 9, 16, 19 He went to Hazelden somewhere in between there.  He went to a couple different places here. 11, 16, 17 One was Lake Place Retreat. 16 He’s been in different sober living homes. 6, 16, 17, 19 AS: How are you managing at this point?  JC: At this point?  AS: I mean during all these treatments, are you involved in finding them all the time? 6, 9, 16 JC: Most of the time.  AS: Are you coordinating?  What’s your role as his mother at this point?  JC: Yes, doing all that, almost always looking for the place, finding it, arranging for him to do the intake, to do the assessment. 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17 He’s always had private insurance. 7, 14, 16, 17 So he’s never had to do a Rule 25 kind of thing. 15, 16, 17 Part of me wonders if some of that was a disadvantage, me always doing all this for him. 12, 16, 17 I mean I would be the one making the phone calls. 7, 16 I talked to more treatment centers over my lifetime than I ever thought I would. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 I was just trying to find one that’s different. 9, 12, 16, 17 AS: That would actually work. 10 JC: One of the treatment centers he went to in Utah, he was there for thirteen months. 8, 9, 16 It was really comprehensive, they had a great transitional program, and he did great while he was there, which is his story. 7, 9, 11, 13 He does great when he’s in treatment. 9, 11, 16 He’s cooperative, he’s probably manipulative.  He does great and then he gets out and he relapses. 11, 18 Yes, I just managed the crisis. 9, 12 [Talks to kids].  [Resumes after break in recording] 6, 18 AS: So do you feel, is there a kind of a breaking point for you? 16, 17, 18 JC: There hasn’t been yet.  [Laughs].  Maybe I need to have a breaking point. 13, 18 AS: I’m not suggesting that. 9 I’m wondering how you’re managing with three small children and this constant. 9, 14 JC: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I mean I’m sure somewhere someone is suffering in terms of not enough attention. 15, 16, 20 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Everybody seems to be holding together right now and has. 14, 16, 19, 20 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I just do what needs to be done and get extremely overwhelmed and extremely stressed but somehow manage it. 9, 12, 13 I’ve never been a person that believes that hitting rock bottom is what’s needed. 13, 15 I believe that rock bottom is death and why would you wait until that happened. 12, 13 I know that that’s not what other people believe and that’s fine. 13, 14, 15 To me, I’ll do what I need to do to convince him to get treatment if I think things are out of control or when things get out of control. 9, 13, 16, 17 It’s stressful having him here right now. 9, 14 I know he doesn’t always want to be here. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 It’s also a peace of mind because I’m not wondering, when he doesn’t answer his phone, where he is, is he alive. 7 There’s been too many times when that’s happened. 12, 13, 18 I don’t know if you want to hear stories. 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: Of those times? 18 Yes.  The whole thing I’m thinking about is the disaster of addiction and what that’s like for a mother of an addict child. 9, 20 JC: It was, I’m not sure I’m going to get these years right. 14, 15, 20 AS: It’s okay.  JC: There was a point, a couple years ago, when he had been to New Roads Treatment Center in Utah. 20 That was the place that I was mentioning that’s long term. 11 The first time he was there he just really did their inpatient. 9, 12 He didn’t do their transitional living. 6, 7, 13 He chose to leave before that, lived with a girl that he met there. 5, 6 That ended up being a disaster. 9, 12, 20 He overdosed while living with her. 6, 15 She called 911. 7 Fortunately, he was saved with naloxone.  They lived together for about eight or so months. 8 Then they broke up, he really didn’t have anything keeping him in Utah and he came back here. 11, 12, 19 He was living with us for a couple of months. 6, 8 He got a job but quickly went back to hanging with his friends in Champlin that were still using. 9, 12, 18, 19 Quickly he got back into heroin. 19 Quit his job, started doing odd jobs with this guy that he… 9, 11 He, I knew when he started using because he stopped coming home. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20 He knew that if he was actively using he couldn’t live here at the time. 6, 10, 12 He got pretty deep down in the hole very quickly. 9, 18 Which I know happens. 12, 13, 14, 15 That would have been around May when he moved back here. 8, 19 It was mid-July when he finally asked; he called me one day and said, “Can I go back to treatment?” 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 I’m like, “Yep. 10 He wanted to go back to New Roads. 12, 13, 19 I made the phone calls, I got him an airline ticket, and he went out there. 6, 7, 13, 16 I knew that he was going to hook back up with this girlfriend. 6, 12, 19 They had been communicating. 10 She did not have any insurance. 7 Or no, I take that back. 6, 19 She had insurance, but a really high deductible. 7, 8 I knew that if he went there and she wasn’t going to go to treatment or get well it would end up being a disaster. 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 So I even made tons of phone calls for her. 7, 15, 16 Worked out an arrangement where I found a treatment center that would take her and waive her deductible. 6, 7, 9, 16 Made all the arrangements for her, made all the arrangements for him. 7, 16 She was going to meet him at the airport and they were going to then go to their respective treatment centers. 8, 9, 13, 16 Well they didn’t.  They went to a hotel and used that whole night but called me to let me know. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: That they weren’t going to treatment? 9, 16 JC: They weren’t going to treatment right away. 9, 14, 16 AS: The one more night thing. 19 JC: Yes.  It was like two more nights. 19 They were going to spend that, he didn’t get in there until like nine, they were going to spend that night, the whole day and then go that following morning which would have been a Wednesday. 12, 19 As it turned out, he was not only using heroin but using Benzodiazepine. 19 That next day, I had been in communication with them both all day. 10, 19 He was so out of it he couldn’t understand me when I talked to him. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 I had, unbeknownst to them, it was like four or something in the afternoon our time.  I called both of their treatment centers and I said, “I know you guys are scheduled to pick them up, respectively, at this time tomorrow morning. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 Can you go pick them up right now? 14 They’re both at this hotel.  Here’s the address, go get them.” 14 Well, her treatment couldn’t. 9, 16 His treatment said, “Yep. 9, 16 This was in Salt Lake City; they were like two hours outside of Salt Lake City in Provo. 11 They said, “We’ll be there in a couple hours.” 11 Well I then called a girlfriend that I knew of hers and said, “She’s going to be there overnight by herself because her treatment center can’t. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19 Can you go stay with her? 9 So she’s not alone.”  So this girlfriend was going to go stay with Jerrica. 9, 12 Chance’s treatment center was going to come. 9, 13, 16, 19 In the meantime, I get a call from Jerrica saying, “Chance just took off and I don’t know where he went. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 He told me he was going to go mow his neighbor’s lawn.” 20 She goes, “I’ve been trying to call his cell phone, and he’s not answering. 7, 16 He just took off without shoes. 9, 12 He had his jeans on and his t-shirt but no shoes and just took off saying he was going to go mow his neighbor’s yard.” 9, 11, 12 I’m like, “Jerrica what is he using?” 10 She tells me.  I’m like, “He’ll be back.” 10, 19 AS: That’s the benzos?  JC: That’s the benzos.  I’m like, “He likes his things. 10, 16 He’s not going to sleep on the street.” 7, 9 He didn’t come back that evening. 13, 15, 19 By like seven or eight I’m getting worried.  She’s already worried.  I’m calling the police. 7 They said, “Well he hasn’t been missing that long, we can’t really do anything.” 16 By ten o’clock that night I’m calling the three area hospitals every hour, all throughout the entire night. 7, 19 I’m calling the jails. 7 I’m looking at the jail roster. 9 I’m calling the police pretty much every hour. 7, 18 They’re getting sick of me.  Finally, the next day at around ten thirty I manage to go into work somehow. 8, 19 AS: Where were you working at this time?  JC: I was working at Prudential.  We had a nanny.  The nanny was with the kids.  I went to Prudential, I went to work.  One of my girlfriends said, “Call the police one more time. 7, 12, 18 Tell them it’s been almost twenty four hours. 9, 11 You need to file a missing persons report.” 13, 16 They finally said to me, “Was he a Utah resident?”  I’m like, “No, he’s a Minnesota resident.” 10 “Well you can’t file a missing persons report anyways. 16, 17 You have to file that in Minnesota.”  “Well what the fuck good is that going to do?  AS: He’s not in Minnesota.  JC: “Well you could file an intent to locate report. 10, 15 You could have done that last night.” 9, 19 I’m like, “Thanks. 10 Okay.  Anyways, that got the ball rolling. 8, 16, 17 AS: Do the police at this point know that he’s an addict? 7, 13, 14, 15 JC: Yes, I’ve told them. 20 AS: All that stuff and they don’t say you could file an intent to locate? 9, 10, 15 JC: No. My friend Belinda Stockman, who is the one that I mentioned to you that may be interested in doing an interview. 6, 9, 11, 12, 19 Her son, who’s also an addict, at the time not a heroin addict but a meth addict, not meth, like synthetic drugs I think maybe meth too. 5, 9, 14 Anyways that’s beside the point. 16, 17 She happened to be out there because he was in Utah in Drug Court and all caught up in that because he had a few felonies. 12, 13 He had gone out there because he was on the Olympic Team.  He was supposed to go to Sochi. 6 Then he got messed up in drugs, ended up in jail. 12, 14 Anyways, she was out there. 16, 17 I called her. 7 I said, “Chance is missing. 16 Here’s the area he was last seen in. 9 Can you and AJ go drive around and see if you can find him?” 7, 8, 14 She picked up Jerrica and they drove around. 7, 8, 14 Of course they couldn’t find him.  They did stop and talk to the police, gave him a description. 7, 9, 10 He’s like, “Oh yes. 10, 14 I’ve gotten a few phone calls about him.” 7, 15 They knew everything. 6, 12 They knew the story. 6, 9, 12 I file the intent to locate report, I fax them a picture of him, tell them where Jerrica is, and tell Jerrica here’s what I’ve done. 10, 15 About fifteen minutes later I get a phone call from her all panicky. 7, 8 She goes, “The police are at my hotel door, they’re knocking, and they want to come in.” 7, 13, 19 “So let them in.” 19 She goes, “Well there’s drugs here.” 14 I say, “Stuff them under the mattress.  I don’t care Jerrica. 7 The police need to talk to you.” 7, 10, 13 AS: I don’t really care what you do with the drugs. 7, 14 JC: The police are knocking on the door saying, “Jerrica if you’re trying to hide your drugs we don’t really care about your drugs. 7, 11, 14, 16 We’re here to talk to you about Chance. 10 Just let us in.” 9, 19 So they come in, they had my picture, the picture I faxed. 13, 19 They talked to her and got some information and then they leave. 6, 10, 11, 17 About five minutes later she said they came back and pulled up a photo on an iPad and said, “Is this him?” 7, 19 They had him in holding. 20 They had had him in holding since three in the morning. 20 They didn’t know because he didn’t know who he was. 13, 14, 15 He was in his boxer shorts. 16 We don’t know where his wallet went, we don’t know where his clothes went, and we don’t know where his phone went. 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 All of that was gone. 19 AS: Oh my Gosh.  And he didn’t know his name? 6, 13, 14, 15 JC: He didn’t know his name. 6, 13, 14, 15 He didn’t even know where he was. 13, 14, 15 He thought he was in Minnesota. 11, 12 He didn’t know his name or was unable to say it. 6, 13, 14, 15 He was in the holding tank. 20 He was charged with public intoxication and indecent exposure because he was in his boxers. 10, 15, 17 I bail him out but I don’t just bail him out. 7, 9, 12 I bail him out with the understanding that they’re only going to release him to the treatment center. 7, 9, 12, 16 The treatment center was going to pick him up. 9, 16 By the time all this got processed it was like eleven o’clock Wednesday night, Utah time. 19 The treatment center goes to the jail to pick him up, he’s not there. 9, 16 They had released him earlier.  He was waiting for them.  They just couldn’t find them, sitting outside the jail. 9, 12, 13 They get him, they start driving back to Provo, and they get to Provo. 9, 11, 14, 19 The other thing that when I arranged for Chance to go back to treatment, and I had told Chance this but he was high pretty much all the time while this was all being processed, that when he went back into New Roads that he would do the full program, that he would, after he got through the withdrawals, he would start on Vivitrol. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 When the guy, the director who picked him up from the jail, told him that Chance flipped out. 14, 20 He said, “I’m not doing Vivitrol.”  AS: So he knew what it was? 6, 12 JC: Yes, because he had been on it before.  Okay.  JC: One o’clock in the morning my time I get a phone call from Chance saying, “Mom you’ve got to find me another place.” 7, 11 I’m like, “What?” 10 He’s like, “They’re not going to take me.” 6, 10 I said, “What do you mean they’re not going to take you?” 6, 16 “Well they’re not going to take me because I don’t want to do Vivitrol and I already told them that. 6, 13, 20 So they’re not going to take me.” 6 I said, “Put Brandon on the phone.” 7 I’m like, “What’s going on?” 10 He goes, “Well I told Chance about the Vivitrol and he doesn’t want to do it.” 13, 20 I said, “Really?  You’re having this conversation with him? 12 First of all he knew that. 6, 9, 12 He was high. 8 Second, you’re having this conversation with a guy who is on so many benzodiazepines and heroin. 12 You pick him up from the holding cell.” 7, 20 AS: This is the conversation you’re going to have? 12 JC: I said, “Can you just wait? 9, 12 Put Chance back on the phone. 7, 19 Chance, here’s the deal. 13 This is where you’re going.  You don’t have a wallet, you don’t have any ID, and I can’t get you into another treatment center without that stuff. 9, 16, 19 This is where you’re going.  You need to just get your head straight and then we can figure out what’s going on.” 6, 9, 12, 13 This all happens. 12 He gets there, well then he calls back to tell me, “Well we’re not going to detox him at New Roads. 7, 10, 19 We didn’t realize how much benzos he had been taking.” 14, 18 Like sixteen a day, sixteen milligrams a day. 19 The average dose is two to four.  Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be quite dangerous so they wanted to put him in a medical facility, a hospital, to detox. 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 They took him to a hospital to detox. 10 The next day I’m in a number of conversations with the people at New Roads about him being, I can’t think of the right words, belligerent and not grateful. 12, 14, 16, 19 All the things you would expect. 16 AS: They’re telling you that he’s being that way? 16 Like they haven’t seen that before?  JC: Right.  “We’re not sure this is going to work out.” 15 So I’m in the meantime trying to find another treatment center and telling them, “Here’s the deal. 9, 13, 16 Here’s our insurance. 7 He’s in Utah now but we may need to move him.” 13, 14 I find a couple other places just in case. 9, 11, 12, 17 I think it was a week after.  They weaned him off of the Suboxone really quickly because they wanted to get him on Vivitrol. 9, 12, 13 AS: When was he taking Suboxone?  JC: He used Suboxone in the withdrawal. 9, 14 AS: Oh, sorry, sorry. 10 Okay.  JC: To help with the detox. 10, 13 He wasn’t really on Suboxone as a maintenance drug. 14, 15 AS: It was just during that detox. 9, 10, 12 JC: This is probably the worst story. 9 That’s why I’m focusing on it. 15 One Friday I’d been out on the boat almost all day and I didn’t take my phone. 6, 7, 9, 19 When I got back I have like six missed calls from New Roads and messages that, “Chance is trying to leave and the only reason that he hasn’t left is because we won’t give him the money that’s in his commissary account.” 6, 7, 16, 19 Or whatever you call it. 7 I put $90 in there for miscellaneous expenses. 7, 10 “The only reason we’re able to keep him here is because we won’t give him that money.” 6, 12 I finally talk to Chance. 10 I talk to Chance and he’s like, “Mom I’m leaving. 10, 19 Tell them that they can give me my $90.” 6 I said, “First of all you’re not leaving. 9, 19 He’s like, “Well then I guess I’ll just sleep on the street.” 7, 9, 10, 12 I’m like, “No, I think you’ll stay there.” 9, 10 He goes, “No, it’s already done.  I already signed myself out.  I’m leaving. 19 They’re not going to take me back.” 6, 19 I’m like, “Yes, they are. 10 I already talked to them. 10, 11 They’re going to let you stay.” 9, 19 He’s like, “No, I’m not staying.” 9, 10, 19 I’m like, “Well, you’re not getting your $90. 10 I hope you decide that you’re going to stay.” 9, 10 That was the hardest thing I ever did. 9, 11 I did not know if he was going to stay. 9, 13, 14, 15 I kept calling them to say, “Is he still there? 7, 9 Is he still there?” 9 AS: So he hadn’t really signed himself out?  He had actually signed himself out. 10 He just thought I would tell them, “Give him the $90.” 9, 11, 12 I’m sure he was going to buy drugs with it. 7, 14, 15 His thing was he was going to get a hotel room. 7 AS: For one night if even. 15, 19 JC: His girlfriend was in treatment. 9, 12, 16 Her treatment center picked her up. 9, 16 A few days later he did get the Vivitrol shot. 15, 19 Things calmed down, he stayed for thirteen months. 5, 8, 9 It was the probably the scariest week in half of my life. 7, 9, 11, 20 I just didn’t know, especially the day, the twenty four hours that he was missing. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 That just made things maybe not so intense but they just keep happening. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 AS: Right, they just pile on. 9, 12 JC: His last relapse was also in Utah. 9, 18 He was there for thirteen months. 8 He got out and lived with a couple other guys in recovery, about a year’s worth of recovery all three of them had. 20 He and another guy there relapsed. 18 The only reason I knew was because, there should have been red flags in talking to him and as I look back there were. 6, 10, 12, 19 He was working so he had some money.  When he’d ask for a little bit of money here and there it didn’t seem so out of the ordinary. 15, 19 He was paying rent and utilities and all this stuff. 9, 11, 16 He had a car and gas. 7 He was going to college. 8 He called me that he had had an accident, a car accident. 7 That he had walked away from the scene. 16, 17 I said, “Well what happened?” 12, 13 “I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 All I know is that I couldn’t stay there.” 9, 13, 14, 15 I said, “Did you hit someone else?”  He goes, “I don’t know.” 13, 14, 15 “You don’t know if you hit someone else? 13, 14, 15 You don’t know if you hit a pedestrian? 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 You don’t know if you hit another car?” 7, 13, 14, 15 He’s crying. 11 I’m like, “Chance you need to go back to the scene of the accident. 7, 10, 13, 19 You need to find out if you hit someone else.” 13 He’s like, “I can’t.” 10 I’m like, “You can. 10 I’ll stay on the phone while you do that.” 7, 9 So he does and he walks back to the scene. 19 He doesn’t get all the way to the scene because the police are looking for him. 7, 16 He sees the police, he waves them down. 7 Fortunately he had not hit anyone.  He had hit a concrete barrier going about eighty miles an hour. 5 His car was totaled. 7 AS: And he was okay?  AS: In shock but…  JC: Yes.  So because of the adrenaline he was pretty coherent at that point. 6, 14, 16, 18 I’m talking to him thinking he doesn’t sound out of control. 10, 17 AS: Right, he’s kind of in the shock. 16, 17 JC: He had blacked out and I’m sure the adrenaline, but he had two black eyes. 6, 14, 15, 16 He had a huge knot on his head.  He had trauma to his chest. 9 Which was minor compared to what the car looked like. 7, 12 I don’t know how he walked away. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I’m assuming he had his seatbelt on or something.  They took him to the hospital.  They did not take his driver’s license right then and there. 6, 7, 14 They didn’t smell any alcohol.  He was drinking alcohol, he was using heroin, and he was taking benzos. 6, 14 I know this because the police made him hang up. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 I didn’t hear anything for a number of hours. 11 Finally I get a call from him, from the hospital. 7 I could barely understand him. 5, 9, 12, 16 They hadn’t sedated him or anything but by now the adrenaline’s gone and the drugs are there. 6, 14, 19 I asked him, “What’s going on?” 10 “I don’t really know.” 13, 14, 15 “Well can I talk to a nurse?” 10 He’s like, “I don’t know how to get a nurse.” 10, 13, 14, 15 Finally I call back and I get the nurse’s station and they’re like, “Well I can’t tell you what’s going on.” 7, 9, 10, 19 “Can you go to his room and get his permission to tell me? 6, 7 He’ll give it.” 6 They did and they’re telling me, “Physically he’s probably okay. 7 We did a CT and everything looks okay.  We’ll probably be releasing him tonight.” 19 I said, “What’s the tox screen say?”  That’s how I knew alcohol, heroin, benzodiazepines, or opioids and benzodiazepines. 6, 10, 12 I said, “Can you have him talk to a social worker or something? 10 Don’t just like release him and call me before you release him.” 7, 9, 12 None of that happened. 12, 13 They released him.  He tells me, he calls me later after he had been out and one of his buddies picked him up. 7 He calls me to say, “It was just a slip, I hadn’t been using very long. 7, 9, 12 I’m kind of glad that this happened because I didn’t know what else to do. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I was going to kill myself.” 7 I’m like, “Oh my God.” 10 He tells me this over the phone. 7 I’m thinking, “Okay.  Well that’s really scary but you’ve only been using for like a week.” 7 He’s like, “I’m just going to stop. 9, 10, 12 I’m going to stay in school and I’m going to get back on track.” 8, 9, 19 Within the course of a couple days it became really obvious it wasn’t just a slip and it wasn’t just a couple weeks. 5, 9, 12, 19 He wasn’t managing to stay sober. 6, 9 This all happened on a Tuesday evening, Friday I flew out there. 7, 12, 13, 15, 19 I got him to my hotel room and the next morning went back to my apartment to get his friend who was also using. 7, 12, 19, 20 I tried to help manage those two. 10, 13 I convinced him to come back here. 13, 19 That was in November.  He came back here kind of under the pretense that he would detox for a week. 10, 15, 16, 17, 19 He was so concerned that he didn’t want to drop out of school. 8, 13, 14 I’m like, “Okay. 10 We’ll detox for a week and then you can fly back.” 10, 19 No intention of really helping that happen from me. 12, 13, 15 AS: No intention for you getting him back there to finish a semester? 9, 15, 19 JC: Right.  He was really pissed off at me.  He was like, “I’m just going to get a ticket and fly myself.” 9, 10, 12, 13 I said, “Good luck.  I don’t know how you’re going to do that. 13, 14, 15 I’ve got your ID; I’ve got your bank account card. 7 You don’t have a job.  Your dad’s not going to be helping.” 13 His trust fund was paying for his rent. 9, 11, 16 AS: Oh his dad, he has a trust fund? 9 JC: He has a trust fund he does not have access to unless he’s in school. 6, 8, 9 Then he still doesn’t have access to. 6, 9 The trust pays directly to school; the trust pays directly to his rent. 8, 9, 16 He stayed here, got on Suboxone. 5, 9 AS: Has that helped him? 13, 16 Have any of those medicines…  JC: The Suboxone, I think, helped keep him off heroin. 12, 13, 16 There needs to be more for him and probably everyone. 13 He wasn’t and hasn’t been willing to do 12-step meetings. 9, 12, 13 He’s not a 12 Stepper whether or not he’s really given it a chance. 6 I’ve got to think he has because I mean he’s been in treatment, pretty much every treatment place he had to spend some time in 12-steps. 9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19 While he’s on it, if he’s taking it he’s not taking heroin.  AS: But he’s had trouble giving up other substances? 9, 11 JC: Yes.  Like weed and alcohol.  Again, I don’t care about the weed. 7 I really don’t but the alcohol.  AS: That’s a real problem for him.  JC: I think the weed really helps his anxiety. 13 Any other thing that he does he does to excess.  AS: And he’s twenty six now and he’s relapsed again recently? 14, 18 How long has he been living at home? 6, 19 JC: Since November.  AS: Oh so this was that, the November you were talking about or is that a different November? 10, 16, 17 JC: Yes, a couple weeks ago he relapsed again. 18 This time it was a very short period of time, he went through all of his money. 16 It didn’t last very long. 9 He is now back on Suboxone. 14, 19 AS: Does he want to stay sober? 6, 9, 13 JC: He says he does.  I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 His actions haven’t really supported that. 10, 16 When we met with Charlie yesterday he told Charlie, “I want to get off heroin but I don’t want to give up weed.” 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 19, 20 Charlie’s like, “I don’t have a problem with that. 10 If you want to use weed, if you use Suboxone daily and you want to keep using weed and you don’t use alcohol and you don’t use benzos or any other substance besides weed and Suboxone I’ll support that.” 9, 12, 13 He asked me if I was in support of that. 10 I said, “Yes, I’ll support that but if other substances start being used then we need to revisit this.” 9, 11, 12, 13 We’ll see.  That was just yesterday. 9, 12, 14, 19 AS: Could you talk about how you got involved with Steve Rummler? 10 JC: Sure.  So my nephew in 2013, I believe it was, died of a heroin overdose. 15 My sister’s oldest son, Drew. 5, 9, 20 [Long pause]. 9 He died of a heroin overdose. 15 JC: That was in May, March or May.  I think it was May of 2013.  No, it was March of 2013.  He had been using, he and his wife.  He has a daughter that’s the same age as my twins. 5, 14 He had been in and out of trouble, with possession and intent to sell. 7, 15 Not that he really was selling but he had enough on him to qualify for that. 7, 20 He had been a drinker. 6, 14 He had some DUIs.  He and his wife were both using.  A few years prior to him dying my sister and Ashley, that was his wife’s mother, got physical and legal custody of the daughter and shared custody. 5, 9, 12, 19, 20 Rory, the granddaughter, had already been in my sister’s and the other grandma’s care. 5, 7, 9 Drew and Ashley, they lost their house that Drew had bought. 6, 7, 9 He lost his job. 9 They didn’t really have anywhere to live.  They were living with Jackie for a little while but things got crazy. 6, 16 So Jackie said, “Drew you can stay here. 9 Ashley you cannot.”  Ashley went to live with her mother.  Drew’s living with Jackie. 6 Jackie’s husband who really, they weren’t really together but he was still living there. 6, 9, 15 She couldn’t just get him to go. 9, 12 He is an alcoholic; he was an alcoholic he recently passed. 5 Drew was living with Jackie; Ashley was living with her mom. 6, 15 They would still see each other. 9 Drew was taking Suboxone or Subutex, whichever he could get.  He got a prescription for Suboxone but he was sharing it with Ashley because Ashley couldn’t get in to see a doctor or wouldn’t get in to see a doctor.  So he would inevitably run out every month towards the end of the month of his Suboxone because he was sharing it. 8, 11, 12 He would go buy Subutex because it was easier to buy Subutex than Suboxone. 7 One time, it was a Friday, he and Ashley went to buy Subutex and they also bought heroin. 7, 19 Nobody but he and Ashley knew that they each had heroin. 6, 12 They each went back to their respective parent’s house and they used that Friday night and Saturday. 6, 9, 10, 16, 19 Then it was on a Sunday when he was at home in the basement of his mom’s house. 6, 9, 15, 19 Jackie had just talked to him. 9, 10, 11, 12 He’d gone downstairs and she was doing some laundry. 9, 14 The laundry room is downstairs. 7, 9, 14 It’d been ten, fifteen minutes. 7, 15 She went down to switch out some laundry and she heard a noise, kind of a gurgling noise. 14, 15, 16, 17 She’s like, “Drew! 10 Drew!”  She found him on the floor, needle in his arm. 13 He was still warm. 9 They figured out between text messages that it couldn’t have been more than ten minutes because he had just texted Ashley and Ashley had texted him back. 7, 9, 12, 13, 19 Then by the time she got down there it had been about ten minutes. 7 She doesn’t know if he used right after the text message. 9, 13, 14, 15 Long story short they live in the country so it took the EMTs a long time to get there. 9, 11, 16 The sheriff got there fairly quickly. 9 Jackie in the meantime had been giving him CPR. 11, 16 He had aspirated or had vomited and had aspirated they think.  By the time the EMTs got there, they had naloxone because the sheriff didn’t.  He had been down at least twenty minutes. 7, 9 They weren’t getting a pulse.  They got him to a hospital.  By the time they got him to the hospital it’d been about forty five minutes after Jackie had found him. 7 They had been working on him.  They finally came out and said they had a pulse. 19 My niece said, “You have a pulse because he’s living or because of what you’re doing?” 6 They said, “Well we have a pulse.”  So he was on life support for a few days but no brain activity. 10, 11, 19 They pulled the plug on; I think it was Wednesday of that week. 19 What got me involved was that my sister was just kind of beating herself up that she didn’t have naloxone. 5, 9, 12, 16, 17 I had never heard of it at this point. 15 AS: She knew what it was? 6, 12 I hadn’t heard of it. 15 In Ohio you couldn’t get it.  AS: This was in Ohio?  JC: This was in Ohio.  I had flown out there that Sunday evening. 15, 19 I was like, “Well what is that?” 10 She told me and I’m like, “Oh yes. 10, 14, 20 I’ve seen something on Facebook about that.”  I’m like, “Jackie even if, you couldn’t have had it. 10, 15 You can’t get that as an average citizen in Ohio.”  When I got back to Minnesota I started thinking, “Why can’t they get it?” 9, 11, 19 I called the Drug Policy Alliance to find out. 7, 8 How can we get this in Ohio and how can we get it in Minnesota?  I found out that someone in Ohio was working on it and that someone in Minnesota was working on it.  They gave me Lexi’s and Judy’s, I think I had called Cathy King Willis, I don’t know if you know who she is. 7, 13, 14, 15 She’s in Illinois and she works for Roosevelt University. 13, 14 She works for the Illinois Drug Consortium as well as Roosevelt University. 13, 14, 17 I had called her because I’d seen stuff from her on Facebook about naloxone laws in other states. 7, 9, 19 She put me in touch with the Drug Policy Alliance in New York who then put me in touch with Lexi and Judy. 8, 10, 15 AS: Right, here.  JC: I called to say, “I heard you guys are working on this. 7, 15 I want to help.” 13 I started meeting with her, at the time it was Lexi, Sarah Gordon, Julia Pownell, Julie Hooker. 9, 11, 13 AS: Was that the opioid…  JC: No, this was just working on the Good Samaritan Law. 9, 12 They had already worked with Senator Eaton to get it drafted and were just starting to find a co-author. 9, 11, 12, 14 They were starting to get in touch with Dan Schoen. 9, 11, 15 He co-authored it. 12 When I got involved the bill had already been drafted. 14 They were trying to work on how it was going to get introduced in the next session for 2014, getting public awareness prior to that. 16, 19 That’s when I got involved.  We would meet weekly at the Recovery Church in St. Paul which is where MRC was housed at the time. 6, 9, 13 That’s really how I became involved. 5, 19 Then I started, by then my son had been Hazelden earlier in 2013. 9, 11 He went right from Hazelden to New Roads down in Utah. 14 It was kind of a door to door thing. 16, 17 Hazelden was recommending long-term programs. 12 Chance found this place in Utah which looked more appealing to him I guess. 10, 11 They had outdoor activities and stuff. 9, 10 Then I started thinking, “Is Utah doing anything?” 9, 11 They were as well.  I kind of kept up with what Utah was doing and what Ohio was doing, really more actively working on what we were doing here in Minnesota. 10, 16, 17 The Utah thing, it got passed right around the same time ours did. 14 By this time Jerrica and Chance were living together. 6 I kept keeping them informed. 11, 12, 17 “It passed so if something happens don’t be afraid to call.” 7, 12 Which when it did happen she wasn’t. 12 She did call. 7 That was good.  AS: When he relapsed? 18 JC: When he overdosed in Utah. 15 He says he’s been revived with Narcan three times. 18 I was only aware of the one time.  Apparently there have been a couple other ones. 10, 16 AS: Yes, it’s a familiar story. 9 What do you do now with…? 14 JC: So now I’m on the board of directors. 5, 14 I’m also the vice chair of the board which really doesn’t mean anything unless the chair leaves. 5, 6, 12, 16 I’m a volunteer.  Right now I’m more involved in the overdose prevention program which was one of the three programs of the foundation. 14, 15 The other ones being prescriber education, and advocacy. 10 I’m mostly doing community training. 9 Most of my training has been one on one with other parents, training and distributing naloxone. 9, 10, 16 Right now though we’re at kind of a stand still because we have very few vials of naloxone left in our source for getting naloxone has dried up. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 We were getting free product, the auto injector product from Kaleo.  They’ve stopped our last application to get some they denied and said that they would be reconsidering applications. 9, 10, 20 It wasn’t just ours that they denied, they didn’t approve any. 9, 12 They’re not doing their charitable piece right now which is a whole different story. 9, 14, 16, 17 This is the company that raised the price from $750 to $3,500. 5 AS: For two doses?  JC: Now it’s $3,500 for two doses.  AS: They just did this because the demand rose. 9, 12 JC: The cynical part of me says that they give all these free doses away because who would want an auto injector instead of a vial and needle? 6, 9, 13, 16 AS: Have those gone up too, the price of those?  JC: Yes, those have gone up as well.  AS: What’s the name of the company again? 6 JC: Kaleo.  How do you spell that?  Is it with a “C?”  This is the auto injector.  They were giving all this away. 11, 16 Now they’re not.  I’m sure hoping that the organizations they were giving it to will say, “Well we can’t afford that.” 11, 15 AS: No, how could anybody afford that?  JC: Right.  If you get a prescription of it your insurance will cover it. 7 AS: But you have to be given a prescription. 6 JC: Right.  You can go to any doctor and they’ll more than likely write you a prescription but most people aren’t going to do that. 10 AS: Not those users of heroin. 9 JC: A lot of moms who have shame aren’t going to do that either. 15, 17, 18 They’re not going to go and get it.  When we give it out we do training. 6 We give you a kit, not just the medication. 6, 9, 10, 12 We give the training that has the instruction card. 6, 7, 9 It has stuff in it. 9 Then we were also getting IM from the Harm Reduction Coalition.  JC: The needle, vial. 13 So we’ve had that as well.  We were getting that for sixty nine cents a vial.  Through the Harm Reduction Coalition which was getting it from Hospera which is the manufacturer, who’s now been bought by Pfizer. 7, 10, 14 They had a program where they were giving it to Harm Reduction Coalitions and other charitable people who their requirement was that whoever they’re selling it to for sixty nine cents a vial, now it’s like $18 a vial, but that’s the charitable price. 7, 11, 14 AS: The eighteen is now their charitable price? 14 JC: The retail price is $45 for one.  So sixty nine cents for one was totally reasonable and that’s what we were paying. 11, 16, 17 We were getting it through the Harm Reduction group which had this arrangement with Hospera. 7 Now the Harm Reduction group doesn’t think we’re grassroots enough. 20 There’s a perception that our program with the hospitals is that we’re giving this to the hospitals. 11 We’re supplying it to the hospitals to give to the people who have ODed, who come in to get revived. 6, 13, 19 AS: When they leave, because they’re just letting them back out. 6, 9, 12, 19 They’re not like taking them to treatment. 9, 16 JC: Right.  The hospitals weren’t going to do this.  The hospitals weren’t going to pay for this. 16 So we’re having it stored at the hospitals so the hospitals can get it to people. 5, 9, 12 AS: Just for distribution, that point of contact. 9, 10 JC: Right.  We have it at Methadone clinics for the same exact reason. 10 We have it at sober living houses so that when someone decides to fly out the door because they’ve had enough they can throw a kit at them. 6, 9, 20 When they’re leaving as overdose prevention they can give them a kit. 6, 15, 19 AS: Because so many people are dying after they leave sober houses. 6, 9 JC: Or even while they’re in sober houses. 6, 9, 15 Now all the sober houses that are a member of MASH, we’ve trained all the staff. 6, 9 AS: What is MASH?  JC: MASH is the Minnesota Association of Sober Houses. 9 If you’re a member of MASH they require that all their houses have our kit, not necessarily our kit, but have naloxone and that the house managers all know how to administer it. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 They’ve all moved to a second tier now which is that when a person leaves their sober living, whether they leave because they’ve progressed far enough to where they’re ready to be on their own or they just leave, that they give them a kit when they leave. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 20 That’s because we’ve been able to supply that.  We’re getting it to the people on the street but the Harm Reduction Coalition thinks because we’re not a needle exchange that we’re not getting it to the people who need it. 9, 13, 16 We’ve got that perception to change. 16 So right now we have like a hundred… 14 AS: Which is again a stigma that comes from the Harm Reduction people about who the users are. 9, 13, 19 About who the addicts are.  Even when all the evidence shows us a whole new group of users. 6, 9 JC: Yes, yes. 14 Very true.  We have about a hundred vials left right now. 14 We’ve got so many requests for training. 9 AS: That’s so upsetting. 17, 19 JC: It’s crazy and we have no money because we’re such a small organization. 16 We don’t have any expertise in fundraising. 14 We’ve got some hurdles that we’re trying to… 16 AS: The kind of sick thing, in my opinion, is your having to fundraise to pay this huge markup on a product that actually saves a life immediately. 10, 11, 14, 16, 17 JC: I’ll tell you what.  Even if we had enough money to buy this now I wouldn’t because why the heck would they charge $3,500. 7, 14, 17, 20 AS: Right.  That’s just obscene. 9, 12 JC: The needle and the vial is just fine. 9, 12, 13, 14 Their markup was not anywhere near.  AS: Right and most heroin users are not going to be afraid of a needle and a vial to save a friend. 9, 12, 13 JC: And a parent that finds their kid, they’re not going to hesitate either. 10, 13, 16 I get why law enforcement wants to have the nasal. 11, 13 Those are like $75 through the charitable program.  You can get the nasal.  AS: This is just on the arm. 9, 12 JC: Or the thigh. 8 This is the auto.  Like an epi pen kind of application thing. 10, 16, 17 That’s just my bias. 9, 12 That’s what I do for the foundation.  Right now we’re trying to figure out how to get naloxone, what source we have. 13, 14, 16 We’ve tapped into a few resources but aren’t having any luck.  Now we’ve got to focus on how to get more money. 15 Even the $18 a vial is out of reach. 13 We ask for a $25 donation for our kits.  If we had to put two doses, which is what we put in a kit, that’s $36 right there. 10, 14 If someone doesn’t have the $25 to donate we give them a kit anyway. 6, 16 I’ve given a ton away. 6, 16 It’s crazy. 16 It’s crazy. 16 AS: What would you say, just changing the topic a little bit, did you have a two thirty? 9, 12, 16, 18 JC: I thought my daughter’s friend was coming around that time but I guess she’s not here. 5, 10, 11, 12 AS: Are you okay to keep going for a minute then? 12 I’m wondering what the most shocking or alarming thing, or out of character thing you’ve done as the mother of an addict? 10 That you would have never, ever done in another circumstance. 9, 15 JC: Giving my son money knowing full well he was going to buy heroin because he was in such pain that I couldn’t watch him. 7, 11, 13, 14, 15 AS: Because he was in withdrawal? 14 Yes, basically buying heroin for him. 7, 11 And not being truthful with my spouse just because I didn’t want to deal with that right then. 9, 12, 13, 14 It was more important for me to focus on getting Chance stable. 9, 15, 18 And worry about this other stuff later. 9, 11 I never thought I would be as deceitful as I have been. 11, 12, 15 AS: In what way? 16 Just with your spouse? 9 JC: Yes, keeping secrets mostly with my spouse. 9, 11, 12 Keeping secrets to protect my son, in theory, whether it really was protecting him or not.  Who knows? 13, 14, 15 AS: You don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to. 13 How has your marriage been through this?  Has he been a support?  Have been you been able to parent Chance together at all? 10, 16 JC: Oh not much, no. 18 Really that was never even when he wasn’t using. 15 When he was young John would participate in things but he was never felt like it was his job to be the dad. 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: So most of this, would it be fair to say, most of Chance’s addiction has been yours to deal with? 13 JC: To some extent his dad and his stepmother have been involved but it’s always been, when it’s convenient for them or when I pull them in. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 It’s not generally, they don’t generally make it a point to call him and talk to him and find out how he’s doing and really listen. 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 That always comes back on me. 13, 16, 17, 19 Why didn’t I tell them?  Why didn’t you ask?  When this stuff happened in November, I never give my husband enough credit because when this was happening in November. 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 20 AS: Remind me what was happening in November? 12, 13 JC: That was when he relapsed in Utah. 18 Sometimes I’m so afraid to even tell my husband because I don’t know, he might say, “Well he’s never coming back here.” 5, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 I just don’t know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I told him and he’s like, “Why don’t you just go out there? 9, 10, 12, 20 Why doesn’t Chance just move back here where we can see him?” 9, 12, 19 It just amazes me, sometimes, that that’s his reaction. 5, 9, 10, 12, 18 I expect this, “I don’t really care.” 7 I didn’t tell his dad right away. 14, 16 I didn’t really know exactly what was going on. 10, 13, 14, 15 I figured, “His dad can talk to him. 10, 12, 13 Or Chance can talk to his dad. 10 It’s really not my place.” 11 Part of me thinks if it had been on the other shoe, I would want his dad to tell me. 13 There’s this whole struggle. 9 Part of me is trying to protect Chance. 16 I know that if his dad knows there’s no chance of him going back to school right away, if this really is just a little slip. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 In my mind I try and manipulate things too. 16 AS: Right, because you’re trying to affect the outcome. 13, 16, 19 JC: I am which is not healthy for anyone. 14, 18 AS: Well it makes you feel crazy. 16 JC: Right, it does.  I’ve learned that and I keep relearning that but when in crisis. 12, 17 AS: And when you’re in crisis continuously, episodically, it just keeps happening. 7, 9, 12, 13 Having a time when you can try to learn to change your behavior without a crisis happening. 12, 13, 16 It’s really hard if you’re constantly in crisis. 9, 11 JC: Thank you.  AS: You’re welcome. 13, 19 This is something I’m just learning with my daughter now coming up on two years. 5, 9, 12, 14, 20 My old patterns they still want to be there but there’s not a crisis for them. 9, 13, 20 I’m kind of having to learn what it’s like to live not in crisis with her. 12, 16, 17 It’s awkward.  At least in an inner way, it’s awkward kind of in my own psyche. 9, 16, 17 JC: When this all happened, like you said, trying to affect the outcome. 12, 13, 16, 19 Trying to figure out when do I tell? 13 What do I tell?  I went out there on a Friday; I got in back here on a Sunday. 19 Sunday, night I sent a big long email to his dad and stepmom. 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19 The next morning I got reamed by the stepmom for not having told them last Wednesday when Chance called me. 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20 I’m like, “Okay. 10 Here’s the deal.” 13 AS: He’s twenty six years old first of all. 9, 20 JC: Right.  There’s many things but the one thing that kept popping into my mind that I just kept throwing back was one of the times when I helped get him back from another state, to get him into detox, when I called his dad to tell his dad. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 “I’ve got Chance on a flight this morning from California to here.  He’s going right from here to detox and right from detox to treatment.” 9, 10, 14, 16 His dad response was, “Good luck with that.”  I said, “If you don’t want updates from me on your son then just let me know because I won’t waste my time giving them to you.” 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 He said, “The next update I want is when he’s sixty days sober and has a job or he’s in a box.” 6, 13, 19 I said, “The next update you get on your son will be from your son not me.”  I got over that anger and of course have given him updates since then. 6 I said to Linda, the stepmom, I’m like, “You guys want to be involved, and you want to hear all this.” 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 She’s like, “He’s telling me that you’re drug testing him and you’re telling me you’re not.” 9, 10, 14 I said, “If he’s telling you that I’m drug testing him and he’s telling me that you’re drug testing him shame on me for not following up with you and asking you if you were and shame on you for not following up with me. 9, 12, 13, 14 If we don’t believe and the history has been that this continues to happen. 9, 12 It’s not just me not asking the questions. 6, 9, 12, 13 It’s you guys too.”  AS: At some point, Chance has to live with what he’s doing.  JC: Right, right. 14 AS: And how he talks to his family. 10, 14, 18 JC: Right.  AS: His parents. 10, 16 JC: I don’t know why I brought that up. 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: I think it’s related to how we try to navigate what are already complex, blended family situations with an addict child. 12, 13, 16, 18 From your ex-husband’s perspective it’s either he’s sober or he’s dead, don’t tell me about it. 6, 15 That’s such a common response among some parents. 10, 16 They get to their threshold, they get to their point where they just can’t. 9, 12, 20 If you’ve always been there doing what you’re doing then you’re an easy target. 16, 17 JC: I know you had asked me also what the thing that I did that I never ever thought I would do. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I’ve not just done that once. 9, 12 It’s that whole, when you know he’s in lots of pain and you’re not going to be able to get into detox for a couple days. 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 AS: That was the situation? 13 It wasn’t just… 9, 12 JC: It wasn’t just he’s out of money and I know he needs to use. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 It’s always your waiting for a detox. 10, 16, 17 JC: Or you’re waiting to get on Suboxone.  AS: Access to care is a huge barrier and makes you do things that you would never, ever consider doing. 5, 7, 15, 16 JC: We’re one of the lucky ones because I hear from other parents that are on wait lists for weeks. 9, 10, 16 We’ve really never had to be on a waitlist for more than a couple days for a treatment center. 9, 15, 16, 19 I don’t know if it’s because we have private insurance, I don’t know if it’s because it’s the type of insurance that we have, I don’t know if it’s because I’m so aggressive, making so many different calls. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 We’ve had; fortunately, the opportunity to send him out of state if that’s what’s needed. 9, 12, 13 Or send him out of state if that’s the only place that’s available. 9, 11, 12 AS: He’s really, in some ways, alive potentially because of your ability to do what you do. 15, 16, 17 JC: Probably.  That and his willingness to finally say, “Yes, I’ll take help.” 6, 13 AS: When he slips up.  JC: The fact that he’s not stuck with state insurance. 7, 9, 10 Not that they’re bad because they work for other people, but you hear more horror stories and people that can’t get in because their on state and so there’s a big long waitlist. 8, 9, 18 I think people who have private insurance get better treatment which is not fair. 7, 9, 14, 16 I’m glad he’s been in that position. 13 Sometimes I feel guilty. 5, 16, 18 AS: It’s the system. 8, 9 It’s a bigger issue. 8, 15 JC: Our insurance has always been so good that… 7, 16, 17 you hear those stories where they get fourteen days and their insurance stops paying, that’s never been our case. 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19 I mean even with Hazelden, they were going to approve him to stay in the long term plan there. 9, 15, 16 That was probably the facility we waited the longest to get in. 9 It was three days. 19 That wasn’t very long but that was the longest he ever had to wait, when he was ready. 9 AS: He’d be detoxing at home or? 10, 19 JC: That time I think he was at Fairview.  He detoxed at Fairview and then went to, no he didn’t. 10 He didn’t detox at all. 10 He went right there using to Hazelden. 14 When I found out he had relapsed, I thought he was in recovery, when I found out he had relapsed I was in Hawaii. 11, 12, 18 His friend, who actually has since died of an overdose in January of this year out on Park Avenue Treatment Center, he had called me and said, “Don’t tell Chance I’m telling you this but he is using with my brother.” 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20 I called Chance right after that and said, “Do you have anything you need to tell me.” 7, 13, 14 He’s like, “No.” 10 I said, “Think about that.  I probably won’t be asking if I didn’t know something.” 13, 14, 15 He said, “I’m using.”  I said, “Here’s the deal. 13 You need to come up with a plan. 13, 19 Why don’t you call me back when you have one?” 7, 19 About five hours later he called me and said he had talked to Hazelden and he had initiated an assessment. 7, 10, 11 By the time I got back, this was towards the end of our trip there, by the time I got back here I had to do a couple things with insurance and the next day I think I took him in. 7, 12, 16, 19 He was, I’m sure, high when I got him there. 8, 15 AS: This is good.  Thank you so much. 18 JC: You’re welcome, a lot of stuff. 9, 13, 17, 19 AS: Yes, it’s a crazy road we’re on. 9, 16 JC: Yes it is. "
"3","Berry-Brede_Linda","Bill Cole Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer April 2, 2017  At the Home of Amy Sullivan Minneapolis, Minnesota Bill Cole -BC Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I’m at my home in Minneapolis with William Cole. 19 Bill Cole.  It is April 2, 2017.  Bill do you give me permission to record this interview? 6 AS: Thank you.  Let’s go back to what you were going to say about birds and childhood. 11, 19 BC: We were just talking about; Amy has a stack of bird books here. 9, 10, 12 I like birds, nature. 10 We were talking about pets. 10 Growing up I had all kinds of pets but never had a single dog which is kind of funny. 10, 15, 16, 17 I grew up in East Africa where my parents were missionaries. 9, 10, 15, 16 The mission forbade missionaries to have dogs because they were afraid of rabies. 10, 12, 15 We had everything else under the sun.  Different kinds of monkeys and baboons and antelopes and wild pigs and birds. 16, 17 AS: Where in East Africa did you grow up? 9, 17 BC: I was born in Ethiopia.  I live there until I was fourteen.  Then I moved to Southern Sudan. 8 I was going to a boarding school in Kenya when my parents worked in Sudan. 5, 8, 10, 16 Different way of growing up. 16, 17 AS: Do you want to talk about that a little more? 10, 13 When were you born?  How old are you? 20 BC: I was born in 1962.  That makes me fifty five. 16 I was born in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa.  My parents worked in many cases in very remote areas. 10, 16 We never owned a vehicle in Ethiopia. 15 There weren’t roads; the only way in and out was by airplane or by foot or mule. 9, 13, 16 No electricity, no running water. 6, 7, 11, 20 A very full life. 11 A lot of adventure. 17 I went to boarding school in the capital. 5, 8 AS: At what age?  BC: I started when I was seven. 9, 11 My brothers started when they were six or maybe even five. 5, 9, 11, 15 We would spend four or five years in Africa and then come back to the states for a year or to Ireland. 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 My dad is from Ireland. 8 Then we’d come back and be on furlough. 13, 19 We’d go back and forth. 19 Boarding school was an interesting experience. 8, 9, 19 Not all bad, not all good.  AS: You were in boarding school in Kenya or in Ethiopia? 5, 8 BC: When we lived in Ethiopia I went to boarding school in Ethiopia in the capital. 5, 8 We would travel back and forth on vacations to see my folks. 10, 19 AS: But your parents would be kind of out in the bush? 9, 10, 16, 17 BC: Yes.  AS: Did you have a home? 19 BC: In the bush, yes. 9, 14 My dad was a builder.  He would go into a place and he’d build a clinic. 11 My mom was a nurse and she ran the clinic. 7, 15 My dad would build school buildings and houses. 6, 8, 9 He would hire Ethiopian teachers to teach and he’d administer the school and they’d move on to another place. 8, 9, 11 AS: What was the church affiliation?  BC: It’s an interdenominational Protestant organization. 9 We had all denominations.  AS: What was it called? 7 BC: It was called Sudan Interior Mission. 7 At the time now it’s called Serving in Mission. 7, 14 AS: So it’s still going? 9 BC: It’s a pretty large organization, well known. 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 They do a lot of development work as well as evangelical work. 16, 17 AS: Where are your parents now? 10, 14, 16 BC: They’ve both passed.  AS: Did they continue to do this even into your adulthood? 15 BC: Oh yes. 14 I lost my mom when I was sixteen. 9, 15 Then my dad remarried another missionary out there. 15 The only reason why they came back was because of his health issues. 14, 15, 19 He loved being there. 13 That was his life. 11 He loved wild places and wild people that lived in them. 11, 13, 17 AS: People kind of untouched by… 15, 16, 17 BC: He never really felt that comfortable. 15, 17 I don’t know how to put it. 10, 13, 14, 15 In formal urban settings. 17 He’d freak out if he got into an elevator.  He just didn’t like it. 9, 10, 12 AS: He was from Ireland? 8 Tell me about him a little bit and your mom? 15 BC: He grew up in Northern Ireland. 8 Went to school until about eighth grade equivalent. 8, 20 He did an apprenticeship under my grandfather. 5, 7, 16 Then had a conversion experience and decided that he wanted to be a missionary in Africa. 12, 13, 15 His father, my grandfather, said, “You’re out of here. 5, 7 I don’t want to see you again.” 13 That stayed. 5, 9 My grandfather died a very bitter man unfortunately. 5, 7 AS: Was it because of the religion that your dad professed?  Was it all Protestant? 9 BC: It was Protestant. 9 But my dad’s taking it seriously. 15 I think my grandfather was upset that my dad wasn’t carrying on the family business. 5, 7, 9, 17, 18, 19 He was a joiner or carpenter. 7 That was upsetting to him. 17, 19 My mom came from New England, from Boston. 8, 9, 15, 19 Her family was really from Nova Scotia. 18 They moved down and she went out unmarried. 8 AS: She went into missionary work unmarried? 15 BC: Yes.  They met later? 5 BC: Yes.  So for my dad he was very adventurous and I could see him doing that.  For a single young woman from a proper Boston upbringing to go and do this thing was just amazing to me. 9, 12, 14, 15 They met and married out there and had four kids. 5 I’m the youngest of four boys. 8, 9, 14 The things that my mom put up with. 10, 15, 16 Before they were married my dad would take off. 6 The mission would want to learn about places in Ethiopia, remote places. 11, 12, 13, 17 They said, his name was also Bill, “We’ll send Bill out and find out what’s going on out there.” 6, 12 My dad, he’d have a schedule.  He’d say, “I’ll be back in January.” 19 March would come around and he still wouldn’t be back. 8, 9, 13, 19 There’s no contact at all. 10 You’re out there.  Crazy, crazy experiences. 16 Once they got married that settled down. 17 BC: Yes and they were established in one place. 9, 11 She would run a clinic. 11 I have a lot of admiration for my mom. 15, 17 She was an amazing person. 15 Some of the things that she would do is just crazy. 9, 12, 16 Sometimes there’d be tribal warfare going on. 5, 18 She would have to take care of people sometimes with no anesthetics. 5, 6, 7, 9, 18 AS: She’d basically be the only medical person. 7, 11, 14 BC: Right.  My dad would help out where he could. 13 The level of commitment that they had was amazing. 15, 20 Just incredible. 9, 12 The love they had for each other and this common purpose is just astounding. 9, 12, 13 There’s one time where there was a tribal skirmish going on.  Our station was neutral. 9 No fighting at the station because all the wounded would be coming in. 9 The fighting would flare up and the women and children would all come to our station. 9, 13, 14, 18, 19 They would stay there and then the wounded would start coming in. 9, 11 And the tension. 15 AS: Because it would be women from both sides? 18 BC: Both sides, right. 14 The wounded from both sides.  Anytime that my dad wanted to leave the station, the home tribe, they were one of the warring tribes. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 They really respected and appreciated my parents being there but if we wanted to leave the station the chief said, “You can’t leave unless you have seven or eight young men around you, armed men, to make sure that you’re protected.” 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 It was really touch and go sometimes. 5, 15, 18 AS: You said you moved to Sudan? 8 BC: We went from the kettle to the frying pan or something.  That was a dangerous place too. 11, 18 It’s an interesting upbringing. 9, 19 In a lot ways I sensed a lot of freedom, being able to move around. 8, 16, 17 But there’s also a lot of danger too. 17 There’s a certain element of danger.  I kind of like that. 16, 17 Everything’s an adventure there.  AS: You don’t have to go find out.  BC: Exactly. 10 AS: They exist simultaneously. 9 What about high school? 8 Your brothers, did you all go? 5 How long were you educated in Africa? 10 BC: Almost all of us through high school. 8, 9 Then we all came back to the states for college. 8, 9, 19 AS: Is there a big range in your ages? 7, 8 BC: Ten years. 20 I came back when I was eighteen. 19 I took a year off in high school and spent part of the time in Sudan with my dad. 8, 19, 20 Then I came back and spent the rest of the time working to get enough money for college. 8, 9, 19, 20 When I was in eighth grade I was in the states and I had a paper route. 9, 19, 20 I saved up five hundred dollars in eighth grade. 20 That was a lot of money. 17 I put it in a bank account in New York because I knew that I would need it someday. 6, 10, 12, 13, 19 I came back to New York and picked up my five hundred bucks and I was on my way. 16, 19 I grabbed my Greyhound ticket and I was going. 13 AS: Back up and tell me how did your mom pass? 15 BC: It was a car accident in Sudan. 7 We were both in the same car accident. 7 It was a pretty rough experience but a pretty amazing experience too. 15, 18 We were in the back of a heavy pickup and it flipped over. 19 My mom and I were in the back. 15, 19 She got thrown out.  We both got thrown up.  It landed on top of me. 8 AS: The truck?  BC: Yes.  They tried to lift it off of me and they couldn’t. 10 I was conscious the whole time which was even worse. 15 I was in shock.  There happened to be a bulldozer down the way. 12, 13, 16 This was in a part of Sudan where there are no paved roads within hundreds of miles and maybe ten working bulldozers. 9, 12, 14, 15 It was just amazing this thing was there. 9, 12, 15 It was able to lift it off of me.  This is kind of an awful story. 9, 10, 16, 17 They pulled me out and they took me to this nearest village where there was a medical, what they called a dresser, a paraprofessional who happened to be drunk at the time. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 I didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 My mom seemed to be doing okay at the time. 15, 19 She’s hurting and her side was injured. 12 From my waist down I had been crushed. 9 He had grabbed my legs and was moving my legs around. 8 Just then these two Europeans came into this hut. 9, 19 Big, kind of balding but young European guy grabbed the dresser and just decked him. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 Just knocked him on his butt. 9 He saw what he was doing.  This guy was a doctor.  He was working on a startup sugar cane plantation down there. 9, 11 He grabbed us and hauled us out to his facility.  I had injured my hands and he was stitching it up and stitching up my head and stuff. 9, 12 Then the next day we flew up to Khartoum. 7, 19 AS: Were your legs broken? 5 BC: My pelvis was crushed in four places. 11, 17 That’s what we knew at the time. 6, 12 We were in this place in Khartoum that wasn’t very good. 11 That’s where my mom, I think she had a blood clot or something. 11, 15, 17 It really was kind of awful. 10, 16, 17 We’re both in the same room. 7 I can’t move.  I’m paralyzed essentially from the waist down. 7, 9 She expired right there. 12, 14 It was kind of brutal. 16, 17 It was tough. 18 They flew me back to the states after that. 7, 9, 19 My mom was buried in Khartoum. 15 They flew me back to the states and they found out one of my vertebrae was cracked too. 7, 9, 19 At that point I was able to start moving my legs around a little more. 9, 11 I didn’t have very much feeling in my left leg. 16, 18 The doctor was saying, “You’ll be very fortunate to walk unaided again. 11 You’ll be here for at least a year.” 9, 20 BC: I was able to leave in a couple of months. 6, 8 I was fortunate.  I had a killer physical therapist, Patty. 6, 7, 9 She was great. 11 Then we moved back. 8, 19 AS: I was just interested. 9, 11, 12, 19 Thanks for sharing that.  That must have been hard though on everybody. 11 BC: It was hard. 11 It was really hard for my dad. 11 AS: They were a team.  BC: It was hard on his and my relationship. 11 I was coming home from school, from boarding school, and it would just be he and I. 5, 8, 9, 12, 19 Maybe sometimes some other people. 5, 18 You’re dealing with those teenager years to begin with and there is all this tension. 13, 15, 20 It was hard. 11 AS: Where did you go to college? 8 BC: I went to a small Christian school in Arkansas called the John Brown University. 7, 8, 9, 13 Have you heard of John Brown? 15 AS: I grew up in Tulsa.  We’re close to Tulsa.  AS: John Brown University is in what town? 13, 19 BC: Siloam Springs.  AS: I was going to guess somewhere around there. 8, 10 BC: I chose that school because I knew people that I grew up with there. 6, 8, 12 I had one cousin in the U.S. and all the rest of them were in Ireland. 5, 8, 9, 19 I had no connections here.  It was a great experience. 11 That’s where I met Laurie, my wife. 5 BC: She’s from Minnesota.  AS: Wow, and she ended up down in Arkansas. 12 BC: She wanted to head south and get warm. 7, 12, 13 AS: You guys met and then tell me about that and how you ended up here. 5, 12 I was smitten I guess. 10, 15 We met; we were friends for a long time. 5, 12, 18 We did a lot of fun stuff together. 9, 17 We used to run together a lot. 9, 11, 17 We’d go out and just have fun. 9, 12 Then we started dating. 9, 11 That was a great way to go about doing things. 11, 16 We got married on graduation day. 19 AS: You’re like twenty two, twenty three?  BC: Yes.  All of our friends were there. 12, 18 Why go someplace else? 11 We knew we wanted to get married. 6, 12, 13 Why get married and have everybody come to us? 13, 19 We planned everything and it was so low-key.  It was so fun.  It was a really simple thing.  Our families were all coming anyways. 16, 17 It was such a small school too. 8 At graduation they call your name and you walk across the aisle. 6, 7 “Bill Cole is getting married this afternoon.”  It was a great school experience. 8, 11 AS: What did you major in? 18 BC: Biology.  I love nature. 13 AS: When did you guys get married?  BC: We got married in ‘86.  From there we went to Florida, Fort Meyers, and lived there for a year. 16, 20 I did an internship for a non-profit called the Educational Concerns for Hunger organization. 7, 10, 14 They provide technical assistance to agriculture workers overseas. 9 They have a seed bank.  They redistribute seeds and collect information. 9, 12, 17 We lived in a small trailer in Fort Meyers, it was great. 11, 16 From there we moved to the Bahamas and lived in the Bahamas for a year, a small island. 8, 20 There were like twelve people on the entire island, it was a research facility. 8 From there we moved back up to Minnesota for the summer and then down to Alabama for graduate school. 8, 19 I did my graduate work in fisheries and aquaculture.  Laurie did hers in library and information sciences. 17 I went to school at Auburn. 8 She did her coursework at the University of Alabama. 13 If you know anything about those two schools people could not believe that we were married because there’s such a focus on football. 8, 13, 14, 15 AS: As if that dictates all relationships.  It’s crazy. 16 We finished up graduate school. 8 We got to California for a year. 20 I worked on a commercial fish farm out there, a tilapia farm.  Then from there we moved to the Virgin Islands for seven years. 8, 20 Will, our son, our one and only son was born down there.  He’s actually born here but then we moved. 8, 10 Then we left there when he was one and a half maybe. 9, 20 At that point we totally enjoyed living down there. 6, 17 It was a great place to be at that time. 11 We wanted Will to have some roots someplace. 11, 12, 13 We thought that was important. 11, 12 We moved back to the States, back to Alabama for a year. 8, 19, 20 I was working for Auburn in the fisheries program.  We moved up to Minnesota when Will was like two and a half. 8, 20 Then we’ve been here for nineteen years. 20 Hopefully the math adds up. 11 AS: How does that feel after moving around? 8, 16 You moved a lot as a kid too. 8, 17 BC: I have a hard time being in one place for too long. 11 I’ve gotten more used to it. 9, 15 That said, we’ve always told Will that once he’s out of college that all bets are off. 8, 16, 17, 20 Once he’s out of high school all bets are off. 8 We’ll go wherever we want to go. 13 I’ve no qualms about picking up and moving at all.  I love experiencing other places and other cultures and other people. 11, 13, 17 That’s the spice of life for me. 11 AS: Talk about Will.  Was his childhood pretty steady, pretty stable? 9, 11, 18 BC: Yes, I would think it pretty typical. 18 AS: I’m just guessing, I don’t mean to put words in your mouth. 9, 10, 12, 16 BC: I think you’re right. 14 A pretty typical suburban, middle class upbringing. 8, 18, 20 Both parents working. 10, 16 He went to a daycare fairly early on. 7, 18, 19 Developed friends from that daycare at an early school experience that he still has today. 7, 8, 9, 12, 18, 19 Really good friends. 12, 18 It’s really good that he still stays in touch with them. 9, 15 They really have a very close bond.  That’s a really fun thing.  That’s good.  He went through the Minnetonka school system? 8, 9 He was very social, very active, and athletic. 10, 19 He loved sports; he loved running around and games. 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 He was an avid reader.  I remember him reading the Harry Potter books, he was really young. 11, 14 I remember reading to him when he was at a certain age. 11 I remember him reading to me and me falling asleep. 7, 11 It was great. 11 It was a lot of fun. 17 BC: Yes.  We did a lot of stuff together. 9, 17 We did martial arts together which was fun.  It was a great father-son activity. 5, 10, 11 We’d both get into it.  We got our black belts.  He continued on and I ended up teaching for quite awhile. 12, 18 He dropped out after his black belt. 14 I don’t blame him. 17 He achieved something that was really good.  He said, “I just want to try other things.” 9, 12, 13, 16 “Fine, that’s great.” 11 It was a great experience. 11 He played football, basketball. 8 He got into lacrosse.  He was a very good lacrosse player up into high school. 8 When he started using then he totally dropped out. 9, 11, 14, 17 It was sad. 12 One of those things you give up. 6, 16 AS: Do you want to talk about that? 10, 13 When you first started noticing stuff? 9, 11 BC: I think Will being as social as he was and always wanting to be around people and be doing the “in” kind of thing. 13, 16, 17 I think he started smoking weed when he was around fourteen. 8, 9, 11 I think it started out occasional. 9, 11 It just fully progressed. 9, 11, 12 It got to the point where in high school I think he was smoking almost daily, at least numerous times a week. 8, 9, 18 He started using other drugs, opioids at around seventeen. 9, 10, 11, 14 From what he tells me the first time he ever tried them was one of his friends gave him some pills. 9, 10, 12, 18 His friends had this sports injury and had some extra pills that he gave to Will. 12, 18 Will took some and Will knew right then that was his drug of choice. 6, 12, 14, 17 That was what he was looking for.  Other drugs, primarily benzos and Xanax. 14 Those kinds of things. 16, 17 He started out with Vicodin and oxycodone and then I learned this a little bit later but he got into fentanyl. 9, 11, 12, 17 He was doing IV fentanyl a couple times in high school and then much more later on. 8, 9, 18 It was kind of a downhill slide through high school. 8, 16, 17 We tried to get him into outpatient up at Hazelden. 9, 10 I think at the time we just thought it was pot but it was heavy use. 9, 11, 12 How old was he? 20 BC: He was a junior. 8 He continued to use and he got kicked out of the program. 9, 18 He tried some other counseling. 10 He does have a history of anxiety issues. 9, 14, 15 I will back up a little bit. 19 When he was fourteen he was inpatient for anxiety at Riverview. 9 AS: Fairview?  BC: Fairview Riverside for a week.  I don’t know if that was the best experience for him. 9, 13, 14, 15 I think he was introduced to the drug culture there. 14 I think it was kind of traumatic on him too. 16, 17 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: The institutional part? 9 BC: Yes, the institutional part and being away from home and being stuck in this place where he couldn’t leave. 6, 9, 11, 16, 19 I think that’s definitely influenced his story. 9, 20 Fast forwarding into high school, he entered his senior year using pot. 8, 9, 12, 20 I think that’s what we knew what he was doing at that time. 6, 12 His grades were always pretty good. 16, 17, 18, 20 He was always a good student. 9, 16, 17 Then his behavior was starting to change more and more. 9, 11, 16 I didn’t know I really didn’t know what was going on. 13, 14, 15 The signs of opioid use, the nodding, the pinpoint pupils. 9 I didn’t know at first. 9, 13, 14, 15 I knew he was doing something, some kind of drug. 6, 12, 14, 16, 17 It was so insane to me.  I remember telling him this, “Will, if I knew that you weren’t doing drugs I would take you to the hospital right now because of the way you’re acting. 6, 10, 12, 14, 16 I know you’re doing drugs, I know the reason.” 13, 14, 15 It’s so irrational, why don’t I take him to the hospital right now? 6, 14 It’s insane.  It doesn’t make any sense. 16, 17 Somehow I justified it in my mind. 9, 12 We definitely sought treatment for him. 9, 16 Once we understood what it was then we sought care. 7, 9 AS: You’re saying that the fact that you knew he was using drugs didn’t prompt you to take him to the hospital. 6, 10, 11, 12, 14 BC: To rush him to the hospital.  AS: Because you knew it was drugs. 6, 12, 14 If it had been anything else you would have seen how crazy, what bad shape he was in. 16 BC: Yes, somehow it made it not okay but I thought I understood what was going on. 9, 11, 12, 16 It’s at that point, I didn’t rush him to the hospital but we said we’ve got to get really serious about it.  AS: Did he ever admit what he was using?  At that point if you had said, “What are you doing?”  BC: I don’t recall when I first found out that he was doing opioids. 7, 9, 10 It was sometimes later in his senior year. 5, 18, 20 At that point he was crashing pretty hard. 11, 18 He was all set to start school at University of North Dakota. 8, 9, 11, 13, 17 I’m trying to recall the treatment he had done. 7, 9, 16 I think he’d done some other outpatient. 9 AS: He first went to treatment at Fairview when he was fourteen. 9, 16 Did he go into other outpatient? 9 AS: Did it interrupt his schooling or was he able to go after school? 8 BC: It didn’t interrupt his schooling. 8 AS: Then the first inpatient after Fairview? 9 BC: It was after his graduation from high school. 8 AS: He got all the way through high school. 8, 16 BC: He was almost through senior year and it got so bad we told him, “You’re not going to college. 8, 9, 20 We can’t support you in the state you’re in. 9 You cannot survive there.  You need to get into treatment.” 9, 13, 16 That’s when we first started battling insurance companies. 7, 9, 11 Getting his initial inpatient was really difficult. 9, 20 BC: We really felt like his life was in danger. 11, 17 AS: I thought you were talking about insurance companies. 7, 10, 11, 12 That was difficult? 20 This dealing with a situation and knowing how severe his addiction was and trying to get help for him and trying for Laurie and I to be on the same page was really challenging. 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 AS: Talk about that a little bit?  BC: I feel very fortunate to be married to Laurie. 16 We both see things pretty eye to eye, most of the time. 16, 18 Dealing with a difficult issue like Will’s addiction can definitely put strain on one. 9, 10, 15, 20 Having the both of us has been really helpful. 13 When I’ve felt strong and rooted and confident in a direction she might feel low. 9, 16, 17 I can bring her up and vice versa.  I’ll feel low and weak where she feels confident. 16 I don’t know how single parents do it. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 It’s got to be extremely difficult. 20 We do see things for the most part eye to eye. 16 There’s been some tension for sure. 15 AS: Based on decisions about what to do or how to influence him or get him to do things? 16, 20 BC: Exactly. 10 AS: When did you first learn that he was using opioids? 9, 10, 12 BC: The first shocker I guess, what was most memorable was finding Will passed out in his bathroom. 7, 9, 10 He was out and had been smoking opiates, what we found out was fentanyl off of foil. 9 His friends happened to be coming over around that time. 12, 13, 18 His friends didn’t use opioids but they did use other drugs. 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 They saw what was going on and they said, “Get him to the hospital.”  We found some packets.  One of the guys knew, “This is fentanyl. 6, 9, 12 He’s been smoking it.  He’s really messed up.”  AS: Was he using the patches?  Fentanyl patches?  AS: Where was he getting this?  BC: It was a synthetic powder.  I don’t know if I can talk about that. 10, 13, 14, 15 There’s an ongoing court case.  AS: That Will is involved in?  BC: Tangentially.  I took him to the Mission detox and brought him there. 9, 10, 18 They go, “We don’t want him here. 13 He needs to go to the emergency room to get stabilized.” 7, 9, 13 They thought he was overdosing. 11, 12 I guess he was. 10 Were you able to revive him.  BC: Yes, and keep him awake. 12 I was driving and kind of shaking him. 14, 16, 17 I didn’t have a Narcan kit with me.  We got him to; I forget what hospital in the emergency room. 7 I don’t know if that’s the first time I found out about opioid use but that was a very memorable time when I found out that he was using fentanyl. 9, 13, 14, 15 We had just recently completed a Rule 25. 9, 12, 19 To do that I chronicled everything in Will’s history. 9 I should have brought that. 9, 18 AS: You can share it with me later.  BC: It’s all kind of a blur. 16, 17 His first inpatient… 9 AS: He’s only nineteen right now. 14 Right now you are in the middle of it. 8, 14 This is just since 2015? 9, 12 Would he have graduated high school then? 8 BC: Yes, 2015.  AS: There’s been no clearing in your brain for any kind of normal, I just feel like things are really jumbled in your brain right now because you’re still in the thick of it. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 Would you say that’s fair?  BC: Yes.  We did have one three month stint where he was out in college in Southern California. 8, 9 He did stay clean, he said he did. 9 I believe him otherwise I don’t think he could have been out there and been able to do what he did.  Then he relapsed. 18 He came back from college for Christmas. 8, 9, 19 AS: It was just last fall? 9, 12 BC: Yes.  I don’t know if you want to attempt to do it chronologically or just go with like when he came back from college. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Let’s go from there.  The other thing is how are you functioning as a dad at this point?  That intrigues me.  What are you facing that you hadn’t faced before as a parent? 10, 16 You were just describing driving to the hospital with him trying to keep him awake. 9, 12, 14, 16 Laurie wasn’t around? 8 BC: At that particular time she was on a little vacation with her friends. 10, 12, 18 They were in Wisconsin.  It was just me which was scary. 7, 9, 12 I’ll describe what happened when he got back from college and I can tell you about how I was feeling. 8, 12, 13, 16, 19 He came from college and both Laurie and I could sense that he wasn’t going back. 8, 17, 19 I even asked, “Are you going back?” 10, 15, 19 “We’ll see.”  That’s strange he should be saying, “Yes, I’m going back.” 7, 9, 11, 19 He was definitely prelapsing.  He was on Suboxone since 2014 I think.  But he cheats.  He doesn’t take it when he wants to get high. 6, 8, 11, 13 Then he saves it up and there’s value to it and you can sell it and get drugs. 7, 14 He had a really good Suboxone provider here in Minnesota, very responsible.  He another one out in California which not very responsible at all.  He was stocking up on the Suboxone and not using it but some point right before coming back for Christmas break. 9, 14, 18, 19 He came back and he started using pretty heavy. 9, 11, 18, 19 Then I found him again in his bathroom passed out. 7 That’s when I realized that he was IV fentanyl. 9, 14 I grabbed him and had my Narcan kit with me.  I didn’t administer it at the time. 9 I took him up to the emergency room. 7 The put him right on a Narcan drip. 10, 14 What they said was for heroin users they give them one shot. 6, 9, 15 They had him on a drip for four hours or something. 11, 14 Just to keep him awake. 9, 12 He was not happy about this situation at all. 13, 17 Then he went into treatment again. 9, 16 I had a hard time getting him into treatment even after overdosing in January. 9, 11, 15, 16 He went to Beauterre to treatment there. 9, 16 He came back, relapsed and now he’s in Hazelden. 14, 18, 19 AS: Where’s Beauterre?  BC: It’s in Owatonna.  It’s a good place. 11 He’d been there twice.  How I’m feeling, right now it’s just now that I’ve come to the really true realization that I can’t do anything for Will. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 As much as I try to get him into treatment that’s not helping him. 9, 13, 16, 18 It’s great that he’s there, don’t get me wrong. 11 He’s there and he’s not using.  Any day that he’s not using is a victory. 19 I don’t think he can live at home. 19 That’s a sad thing. 12 It’s not my choice. 17 AS: You haven’t had really a break since he got home in December from the chaos of addiction? 18, 19 BC: Right.  He was in Beauterre for thirty days. 19 You’re still not away from it. 9, 16 AS: You’re on because you’re visiting and you’re checking in. 12, 13 This is his sixth time in inpatient? 9 BC: Yes.  AS: Did he go willingly?  Do you want to talk about what you said early when you first got here about what you had to say? 9, 10, 13 BC: A few times, probably three out of the sixth times, we’ve told him, “It’s either treatment or you’re out on your own.” 9, 16, 18, 20 That’s what it came down to this time too. 19 AS: Has he ever left?  BC: I think he maybe spent one night out. 9, 19 “I don’t want to do this.” 13 It was really hard to get him to treatment this last time. 9, 11, 16 I think it gets more and more difficult as I get older. 5, 20 I told him, “I’m either going to take you to treatment or I’m calling the Eden Prairie police to tell them you’re unwelcome here and you’re trespassing and I’ll press charges.” 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 That’s ultimately what got him out.  He was high at the time. 8 BC: When I took him to treatment. 9, 16 Then it was hard. 11 I think that he felt like he was being abandoned. 15, 17 He said as much. 18 That we didn’t care for him. 7 I explained from my point of view that we cared deeply for him and that’s what we’re doing what we’re doing. 7, 11, 12 He really needs to start caring for himself. 7, 9, 11, 13 We haven’t abandoned him. 15 There’s nothing further from the truth.  He’s really abandoned us, his family and everything that’s been good in his life. 11, 15, 18 He’s abandoned it because of his love for this drug. 13, 14, 15 It’s just all consuming. 9, 12 One way to describe it is a love affair. 13, 16 You can’t get enough of it. 20 Your whole being centers around it. 9 AS: Do you have any history of addiction in your family? 9, 18 BC: Yes.  My brother, one of my brothers, is a recovering alcoholic. 5 He’s doing really well.  He had some really dark times. 18 We had to do an intervention.  He got his life turned around. 8, 11, 19 He suffered some losses that resulted in his addiction. 12 On Laurie’s side there’s some addiction issues there and anxiety issues as well. 14, 15 I think there is a genetic component to it for Will.  AS: But it wasn’t something you and Laurie battled on your own?  BC: No. AS: There was no problem in his childhood. 11 It was his social group and access. 6 You said none of his other friends were using opioids? 10, 12, 18 I found out later.  It’s really funny.  Some of his closer friends, they smoked quite a bit of weed. 12, 17, 18 They did an intervention for Will.  AS: Unknown to you guys? 10, 13, 14, 15 BC: Yes.  Just an informal, ad hoc kind of a spur of the moment thing. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17 They sat him down and said, “What the hell are you doing?”  His senior year? 20 BC: Yes, I think so.  They were worried about him.  AS: That’s impressive.  BC: These kids that I thought were way out there. 11, 12, 16 AS: You couldn’t imagine them ever doing that? 14 BC: Right.  AS: We judge them.  BC: Exactly. 10 AS: We judge those bad friends right? 12, 14, 18 And then it’s our own kid.  What’s this been like for you as a parent and as a dad? 10, 16 His adolescence has been clouded by addiction.  How about your friendships or being a parent in public spaces? 10, 12, 16, 18 Has that had an impact on you? 10 BC: Absolutely.  There’s been times when I don’t want to see people that I know, that know Will. 13, 14, 15, 18 I don’t want to have to explain. 13 I don’t want to have to hear about how their kids are doing so well in college. 8, 13 I’ve gotten over that. 15 I feel like I can really be happy for people and what their kids are doing, Will’s peers. 16, 17 I think that’s great. 11 For the most part I’ve gotten over being able to talk about Will’s situation. 10, 13, 15 I don’t go on necessarily broadcasting it but if somebody asks me, “What’s Will up to?” 9 I’ll say, “He’s in treatment. 9, 16 What’s the proper term now? 14 AS: Substance use disorder. 9 BC: Yes.  I’ll talk about that. 10 I think it’s important to talk about that. 10 If we’re not open about it then as a society we’re not going to get on the solution side of it if we’re just closed up. 9, 10, 12, 17 I think it’s important.  At work there’s some people that know just because all of a sudden I’ll have to take a day because something is going on. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 It’s important that some of them know. 13, 14, 15 It was really hard. 11 I mentioned that he was a good lacrosse player.  In junior high he had a lot of potential going into high school. 8, 15, 17 He made the varsity team. 13, 16 He was a starter when he was a sophomore. 8, 9, 11 That’s when he started really getting into pot and other drugs. 9, 11, 14 I remember in his senior year he still made the team, barely. 5, 9, 16, 20 I remember going to games and just hated going to games. 9, 10, 12 I hated it because they never played him. 8, 12, 15 These other parents, there was this parent sport culture. 10, 16 It gives me the willies. 6 They’re talking about their kids’ stats and stuff. 9, 10 They’re all up there and Will’s on the sidelines. 6 Whereas a couple years before he’d been starting. 9, 11, 20 He never got played. 8, 15 I remember getting really mad, and I usually not like this, I approached the coach and said, “What is up? 10 Why aren’t you playing Will?”  I thought the coach was being a jerk. 11, 12 I wasn’t one of those parents. 10, 16 He just said that Will wasn’t doing anything in practice or anything. 9, 10, 12 AS: You didn’t know that. 13, 14, 15 Eventually it became obvious. 5, 19 I wanted to support him and wanted to be there but I just hated being there. 9, 12, 13 AS: It’s kind of right in your face. 14, 16, 17 BC: Exactly. 10 It’s just a silly thing. 9, 12 AS: It’s just an example of what it feels like to be in public. 6, 9, 12, 16 Did he ever have any issues with the law? 14, 15 One of his friends overdosed and died. 12, 15, 18 There’s a pending lawsuit around that. 12 Will’s caught up in that.  AS: Was  Will with him when he purchased it?  BC: Yes.  AS: How did that death play out in your family? 18 Can you talk about that? 10 This is a young man from Minnetonka? 14 BC: From the area.  AS: If I recall, nineteen or twenty. 7 BC: What was shocking to me, what was so disheartening was that you would think that this would be a wakeup call. 7, 15 This was a good friend of Will’s. 12 They had a strong friendship and he cared deeply about this person. 7, 9, 11, 12, 18 I thought it would be a wakeup call for Will and it wasn’t. 7, 11, 12 He and I went to the funeral.  AS: Was this like a year ago? 20 A year and a half ago? 20 BC: A couple years ago. 20 I don’t remember.  It was just crazy. 9, 12, 16 That he still didn’t want to seek help for himself. 9, 13 He stayed in touch with the family, with the mom which was really cool. 5, 9, 15, 17, 18 He went to visit her when he was on break. 12, 13, 18 I can’t imagine what they’re feeling, what she’s feeling. 14, 16 Especially towards  Will because Will was a part of this thing.  To let Will into their house and to accept him that’s pretty amazing. 6, 9, 15, 18, 19 I think addicts think they’re immune to death and overdose. 15 It’s so crazy what’s happening all around. 8, 12, 13, 16 AS: It’s that part that I have trouble bridging.  No matter how many times I hear stories and how much I try to empathize that fearlessness around death. 9, 14, 16, 18, 20 To me it has to be that, it has to be fearlessness or something.  They can’t be thinking they’re immune to dying when they’ve known so many people who have died. 10, 13, 14, 15 That’s the part I don’t understand. 9, 12, 16 BC: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Maybe it’s something that the draw of getting high is worth the risk. 8, 14 It’s not rational.  It’s irrational.  AS: It reminds me of when Bob Levy was talking to our group about the nurse who stuck her hand in the sharps container and was risking every known human pathogen just to get to a little bit of dilaudid. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 That’s an example of the power. 6, 15 So what about death?  BC: There’s got to be something else that motivates them besides dying.  That’s kind of what he was saying about pilots and doctors. 5, 11, 16, 17 They’re more worried about their license.  One thing that’s been driving Will is college. 8, 14 AS: He does want to? 13 BC: Absolutely.  That’s what’s driving him. 14 He’s all mad at us.  “What about college? 8 I’m supposed to start summer classes at Normandale.” 6, 8, 9, 11, 20 That’s a good thing.  It is something to work towards.  It tears me up as a father, how do you not squelch that drive, take away that drive and get him to a length of sobriety that he needs in order to sustain going to school for a longer period of time. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14 I don’t know if I have the answer for that. 13, 14, 15 That’s one of the tensions I feel. 15, 16 Another tension that I feel, I’ve heard other parents of addicts talk about you eventually come to a point where you accept the fact that you could lose your child. 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 To be brutally honest, I don’t know if I’ve come to that point yet. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I can see that maybe, I don’t know if that’s a goal. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: If it’s a goal to realize that your kid might die? 14 BC: Yes.  I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 That sounds stupid. 9, 10, 16 AS: No, it doesn’t sound stupid. 9, 10 BC: This is crazy to think about. 16 In reality I’ve been losing Will since he was sixteen, seventeen slowly. 15 I’ve been losing him.  I feel extremely ripped off in this whole thing. 16 Other people have got to experience  Will when he’s been on a sustained period of sobriety. 9 Even if it’s for a thirty day treatment, he’s been sober and his old self is starting to reemerge. 6, 9, 11, 16, 19, 20 When he was at college for three or four months other people got to experience that. 8 I’m just ripped off. 9, 12 I don’t get to experience that.  It’s a drag. 14 I’ve watched another sad thing is watching his friends slowly drop away too. 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 AS: You mean losing his old friends because of his addiction? 12, 16, 18, 20 BC: Yes.  I’ve mentioned that he had some really good friends from when he was very young. 12, 14, 18 A couple of them have really stuck with him which is really fun. 9 Otherwise people just kind of drift away and do other things. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 AS: You said earlier when we were talking before we started the recording that you thought you’d be a good bad example of a dad. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 Can you talk a little bit about that? 10 BC: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: What do you think you did that was bad?  BC: I guess really in a very general way not realizing the seriousness of where he was at. 10, 16 AS: Two years ago or before? 20 BC: Maybe even a little bit before that. 15 Not being a little bit harder on him, making him more accountable for his decisions. 11, 16 He got high and had been using whatever vehicles in order to enable him to be high. 8 Not saying he can’t use the vehicle for another month. 8, 9, 11 We did some of that but I think I would have been a little bit harder on him. 11 AS: Do you think that would have changed anything? 16 BC: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: I’m just being the devil’s advocate right now. 9, 10, 12, 14 BC: Right now I just know it’s not very good. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Maybe if I would have done something like that it could have been worse.  I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: What you’re really talking about is how we judge ourselves as parents and how we grade ourselves as if we are somehow implicated in the addiction or that it started. 9, 10, 11, 16, 20 That we somehow had some control over it. 17 BC: That’s step one. 9, 12 I still struggle with step one to be quite honest with you. 9, 12 I didn’t cause it; I don’t think I was a primary cause of it. 9 I don’t know how all of that plays out. 13, 14, 15 I definitely contributed to it.  AS: In what way? 16 BC: Not having good enough boundaries for him. 20 The thing is I think you can’t raise kids in isolation.  They’re going to gravitate towards certain activities. 10 AS: Do you think him being an only child had any impact on what you see as being a boundaries issue? 10, 15 Because he was the only child did you have in your family dynamic what was his role? 18 You don’t have other kids so you don’t know what that is like but you were a sibling. 10, 13, 14, 15 BC: It could very well have.  I think that families that have more than one kid have to split their time up between those kids.  As a result you’ve got four kids running around the house the parents go, “This is your boundary. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 You better understand it.” 9, 12, 16 With one kid it’s a little bit softer.  If that makes sense. 16, 17 AS: I think that’s a good way to put it. 10, 16 You don’t have to be as strict. 9 You can do more negotiating and coming to terms and dealing with each other. 13 BC: I think that’s right. 14 I think my own upbringing kind of influences my approach as a father. 5, 16, 17, 20 Growing up in boarding school, very restrictive, especially the first boarding school I went to. 5, 8, 9, 19, 20 Not only physically restrictive, there was a fence all the way around with barbed wire on top. 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 19 Mostly for our protection. 9 We’d sneak out and stuff. 9 Also, all your time was occupied.  There’s very little freedom.  We were up early in the morning for Bible study, breakfast, school and we had rest hour right after lunch. 6, 8, 9, 14, 18, 19 We had to be in the dorm and lying on the bed and be quiet.  Back to school and then sports and then supper and then study hall and then to bed. 8, 9 Saturday was glorious. 19 Saturday was your day. 19 One of the punishments was they’d take away your Saturday and make you stay in the dorm room on your bed and you had to be quiet all day. 6, 7, 9, 16, 19 Besides they whipped you too.  AS: Did you get in trouble?  BC: Yes, I got into trouble a lot. 17 There was this real restriction and control. 9, 17, 19 I resent to this day. 7, 19 Critical thinking was not encouraged.  Being able to explore things was not encouraged. 16 This is the way you think and that’s it. 16 Now as a parent I push away from that. 10, 16 Maybe I give Will more freedom than he really needed. 6, 13 I’m not judging myself this is just what I’m perceiving. 9, 12 I want Will to know why he believes what he believes. 13, 14, 15 I want him to be his own person and be able to think critically. 7, 13 Maybe I drove him way too far the other way. 7, 14, 16 We had boundaries.  We were relatively strict with things. 9, 16 The thing about negotiating was interesting because there was some of that too. 9, 19 Will actually benefitted from that because he’s a real good negotiator. 10, 14 AS: He’s been interacting with two adults which can be a really great way to be raised. 5, 10, 11, 16 BC: He had friends. 12, 18 AS: Right, I meant in his kind of formative relationships. 16, 17 Anything else?  We didn’t talk about your struggles with insurance companies. 7, 9, 10 BC: I don’t know if I should name the insurance company. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 AS: Go right ahead. 14 I can strike it if I want to later. 9, 13 BC: Blue Cross  Blue Shield Minnesota.  When we were dealing with Will’s treatment initially, that was tough. 9, 13, 16, 18 Even after overdosing.  Trying to get in inpatient. 9 I don’t know if it was the insurance or Hazelden. 7, 13, 14, 15 With Hazelden you don’t need to do all the insurance. 7, 13 We had a heck of a time trying to get him in inpatient. 9, 16 AS: This time?  BC: No, his first time. 9 That was a real struggle with the insurance. 7, 9 I remember we had to wait like two weeks or something. 10 That seems like forever. 10, 16, 19 AS: It’s a horrible travesty. 9, 17 To me it’s one of the cruelest parts of our treatment system and the most dangerous. 8, 9, 16, 18 BC: Your kids at risk.  AS: When they know they’re going to treatment they start using as much as they possibly can. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 BC: Absolutely.  To be fair since then we’ve had a good experience with them.  They’ve been pretty quick. 18 They do initial ten day coverage and then a little bit more. 19 That we’ve found.  AS: Not at Hazelden?  BC: No, Will was at one place Fountain Center in Albert Lea. 11 It’s a Mayo Clinic place. 11 He was there thirty days and the counselor down there was great. 10, 11, 19 He said, “He needs more time. 13 He needs to go into extended care. 7, 12, 13, 15 Your insurance won’t cover it so kick him out of the house, Rule 25.” 6, 7, 9 Will got into extended care through that. 7, 12, 15 There was another sixty days. 19 He didn’t quite make it. 16 Almost but then he bailed. 7, 9 The insurance has been good. 7 They were fighting tooth and nail initially but they get on board pretty quick but it never lasts more than thirty days. 5, 9, 15, 18, 19 Thirty days is not a long time. 19 AS: Did you do Rule 25 for him this time?  AS: This is coming out of your employer’s?  BC: Yes, I don’t know how it is with insurance. 7, 13, 14, 15 Do insurance companies get to a point where they say, “This is untreatable?” 7, 16 AS: I don’t think they can anymore. 13 I thought that was part of the ACA. 11, 12 BC: Have you heard of insurance companies carrying more than thirty days? 7, 15, 19 AS: They will through Medicaid.  Minnesota Care.  They’ll do ninety.  That’s if he was independent and on his own. 12 That’s the state and they take opiate addiction really seriously as far as I know. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 That’s been my experience; it’s more than thirty days. 19 BC: We need to start thinking about that right now. 9, 11, 13, 14 His after care. 7 Have you had any experience with Hazelden?  AS: I’m just going to stop this recording. 6, 9, 10, 12 Thank you Bill.  [End of Recording] "
"4","Bining_Colford_Janie","Brandon Coleman Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer October 26, 2016 St. Paul, Minnesota Brandon Coleman-BC Amy Sullivan-AS Unidentified Student 1-US1 Unidentified Student 2-US2 B: ...I don’t know how long it was, but I remember spending a lot of time trying to hold my head up. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 My head just kept going like this. 9, 12 Later on, I found out I had gotten into some drugs that my mom had laying around. 8, 14, 15 That was before I could see over the table.  I remember being really low and being eye level with the handles of the cabinets. 16, 20 I also remember that at a very young age I learned that if you see one of those needle things on the ground you have to walk around it. 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 You can’t step on one of those. 9, 12 I don’t remember if I ever did or not.  My mom is a meth addict. 5, 15 She didn’t want to grow up and be a mom right away. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I don’t know if there was a catalyst to this happening, but I was sent to live with my grandmother. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 She is the only person in my family that never gave up on me. 15, 18 She always knew there was a good person inside of me. 6, 12, 16, 17 She raised me; I sat in her lap all the time. 5 I guess I used to play with her ear a lot. 9, 10, 17 I kind of remember that. 16, 17 That was just the kind of relationship me and my grandmother had. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 I called her ‘nanny,’ she was my nanny. 7 I stayed there for a while. 5, 9 She got me out of the situation I was in because nothing good would have come out of that at all. 13, 19 Except, I think it planted a seed in my head that that kind of shit was normal. 16, 17 The drugs, the bad behavior, and being afraid of adults. 14 That was all normal.  I stayed with my grandmother; a lot happened in between. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 17 I don’t think I developed a self. 16 I don’t think I actually developed a person that I was. 10, 16 I don’t know how to explain it any better than that. 13, 14, 15 It always felt like I had this empty hole there where, now that I think about it, it’s that warm feeling that people had for their parents and for being at home. 10, 14, 16, 17, 19 I never had that. 15 That was just an empty hole. 9, 12 It was filled up by my grandmother but I couldn’t always be around her. 7, 16, 17 My mother decided to somewhat get her shit together. 12 My dad got into some big shootout in Laughlin, Nevada. 8 I can’t remember how old I was, but I think it was around ‘88 or ‘89. 20 My mom left my dad and hooked up with this Jewish guy with a hard core work ethic. 11, 15 He would provide for her.  Being a little kid, I just wanted to be a little kid. 9, 12, 13 I didn’t want to pay attention to if my mom was still doing that same stuff that she did that scared me. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 I remember having a fear that someone was going to put that white powder shit on my lip while I was asleep and I would breathe it in. 7, 10 That was a legitimate fear that I had.  I don’t think any kid should have that kind of fear. 16, 17 I’m not trying to break your guys’ hearts or anything, but that was the reality of being an eight year old for me. 16, 18, 20 Howard tried. 10 He really tried to turn things around for me and my mom. 8, 10, 15, 16, 19 AS: Your stepdad? 9, 12 BC: Yeah, my stepdad. 9, 12 He had a really weird, strange way about it. 7, 9, 16 I was bad at this point in time.  I couldn’t listen to what people told me to do. 9, 15, 17, 20 It wasn’t because didn’t want to. 13 I don’t know why but I just could never follow rules at this time. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I liked to be alone a lot at this time and I developed a passion for reading. 10, 11, 16, 17, 18 I was reading big, thick novels about whatever when I was a youngster. 8, 9, 11, 14 At this point in time I’m living in Denver [Colorado]. 6 We moved from Denver to Arkansas and back to Denver, then to Texas, and then to Arizona. 8, 19 He worked for a chain of restaurants, but he worked for the corporation that owned the chain of restaurants. 7, 9, 19 I think they owned Chili’s and all those mall-type restaurants. 7, 9, 19 He moved us out to Arizona. 8 When I got to Arizona I met another kid that was just like me. 5, 9, 12 His dad was a big, mean, abusive alcoholic. 5, 8, 9, 11, 16 We just had this kinship. 9, 12 We were just good friends. 9, 12, 18 We came to be like brothers. 5, 19 Absolutely.  My mom took him in, as much as she could. 15, 18 His mom took me in. 15 Our addictions started together and flourished together. 9, 11 My mom is the one who turned me onto meth. 5, 15, 19 Right at the beginning of high school, maybe I was even in junior high at this point, I was having trouble with my homework; I just didn’t want to do it. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 She told me, “This will help you concentrate on your homework.” 13, 19, 20 I don’t blame her. 17 She still uses to this day. 9, 19 She has never had to face the consequences of her use because of her privileged place in society. 9, 11, 15 She stands behind her rich, white male. 9, 12 He gives her a safe place to do everything in. 6, 11 I’m not sure if he knows that’s what she does, but I don’t understand how he couldn’t. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Some days when I would go over and see my mom I’m just like Jesus, it’s bad. 9, 12, 15, 19 I always thought I was bad and that’s how I know I could do more drugs was I wasn’t as bad as my mom, you know. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I’m trying to make light of it. 16 It’s just a serious thing in my life. 9, 11, 12 This is the third or fourth time that I’ve told my story. 9, 20 By the end of it I can see people on the edge of their seats sometimes. 5, 12, 18 It kind of makes me feel -- I just hope this is helping. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 Me and Nick started shooting meth. 5, 9, 11 AS: How old were you? 20 BC: Fifteen.  I skipped the whole pipe thing.  I wanted to be high right away. 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 I honestly don’t know how I made it so long. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 Two years straight of doing that. 6, 9, 20 This is over countless broken relationships. 5 I’m just giving a summary. 9, 11, 12 Just think of everything that is possibly shitty that could happen and it happened to me. 9, 12, 13 I don’t want to say it happened to me because I did it to myself. 12, 13 The whole time I saw exactly what was happening to me. 10, 12, 13 I just didn’t care because I was so good at manipulation and so good at talking that I would just talk myself out of something. 7, 9, 10, 12 When I was about seventeen -- it took me about two years of not sleeping to want to sleep. 7, 13, 15, 20 Another friend of mine said, “You can do some heroin and go to sleep.” 7, 12 Right away again, at seventeen, I didn’t smoke it; I dove in head first into that addiction along with my meth addiction. 5, 9, 16 You can imagine what happens from there. 12, 14 ‘97 I started shooting heroin. 9, 11 In ‘98 it was my first offense and I went to prison for four years in Arizona. 9, 20 It’s not the kind of place you want to get locked up in. 11, 13, 16, 17 I probably would have taken any Minnesota prison over an Arizona prison any day. 6, 19 [laughs]  I still wasn’t grown up yet. 9, 17 I still had to grow up; I’m talking like physically. 7, 9, 10, 17 Like knowing that it’s better just to keep your mouth shut; it’s just better to keep your eyes forward. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I learned that pretty quickly when I went to prison. 9, 12, 17, 18 There were a lot of really traumatic experiences that happened in there. 12, 13, 17 I’m not going to go into detail, but it was pretty bad. 18 I got out and just went right back. 9, 12, 14, 19 I couldn’t seem to conform and it was just an easier way. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 I could inject a chemical in my blood and run around and not care about anything at all; knowing that life is building up and reality is going to come crashing in. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 At this point in time I learned that you really could just pick a direction and go that way. 9, 12, 16, 17 I learned to sneak on trains and ride them to the next state. 6, 9, 12, 17 I would hop off and immerse myself into whatever drug culture they had wherever I got off. 14 That’s where I really learned how to not give a shit and hide from myself. 6, 12, 17 You call it traveling but I just call it running. 7, 9, 11, 12 It sounds cool but there’s no word for how lonely I was. 10, 16, 17 And how scary it was that I could just come to and be somewhere that I had never been before and not even realize how I had gotten there. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I’m not talking about at some new house in St. Paul [Minnesota]. 6, 9, 10 I’m talking about Bourbon Street in New Orleans and being on the street with people going through my pockets trying to take my stuff. 6, 9, 10, 16 St. Louis [Missouri], man.  I almost want to tell you the story about St. Louis. 9, 13 I really think I’m traumatized.  I’ve tried to tell that story a couple of times -- yeah, I’m not going to tell that one. 9, 10, 18 I just can’t. 9, 12 I think it was 2006 when I tried to get clean. 10 I had had enough. 20 I had gotten jumped so many times. 15, 18 I had been beaten up and left for dead because I didn’t care who I ripped off. 7, 15 I didn’t care what they did to me when they found me. 7 I would rip off the Mexican mafia and sleep on a guy’s couch. 7 He would want that free bag of dope he would get if he called the guys I had ripped off and said, “Hey, he’s sleeping here on my couch right now. 7, 13, 14 Come on over.  But you’ve got to give me half a gram.” 6 I would get woken up by being pistol whipped by crazy Mexican dudes speaking Spanish really loudly. 9, 16 That was the scariest thing. 7, 9 I thought I was going to die and I really didn’t care. 7, 11, 12 My eyes were already swollen shut from a fight the day before. 14, 16, 19 Once you get bloody and beaten to a certain point it doesn’t matter anymore. 11, 13, 15, 20 I don’t even remember who but somebody cared enough to stick me into detox and get me clean. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20 I stayed clean for a little bit and I met this girl. 5, 9 We stayed together for a little bit and I had a boy, his name is Dorian and I had another little boy and his name was Deven. 5, 6, 8, 9, 15 I was still using, but somehow I was providing for them. 9 I wasn’t providing them a safe father to be around. 5, 8 I saw the exact same thing happening to these little boys that had happened to me. 8, 10, 12, 13 I saw it right in front of me but I couldn’t stop. 9, 10, 14 The one part I remember over everything -- you’ve heard this before -- there really isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about this. 15, 19 During that time I was doing a lot of speed balls, which is coke and heroin. 8, 17 For some reason, I liked how the shower sounded when the rush hit me. 10, 18 It was like a tunnel sound. 10 I was at home with the boys and I just went into the bathroom and shut the door and did my thing. 7, 8, 9, 12, 19 Before I knew it, this had never happened before, my eyes started going like this [shakes hands quickly] and the whole world started going. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I remember laying back on the toilet and waking up. 19 I go to go out of the bathroom and I can’t open the door. 7, 17 I pushed it open a little bit and looked out. 17 Both of my boys had their pillows and blankets and they were sleeping outside the bathroom door waiting for their dad to come out. 7, 8, 13, 19 That is burned into my memory; that will never go away. 15, 16 At that point, like I said, I didn’t care. 7 I didn’t even see that while it was going on. 15 My mom, the insane person that she is, decided that I wasn’t fit to have the boys. 8, 12, 14, 15 She takes them, I don’t know how she does it but she does it. 6, 13, 14, 15 That just gives me an out: 6, 9, 12 my boys are safe and I’m hitting the road again. 8, 9 Just when I was getting my stuff ready to go, I hadn’t quite left yet, Nick, the guy I told you guys about -- we had this ritual. 9, 20 At the time I had a ‘63 Lincoln Continental and there was an eight track player in it.  The only eight track we had was Al Green.  On Fridays our dealer wouldn’t drive into Tempe [Arizona] to give us dope. 6, 7, 13, 14, 19 We would have to drive out to Glendale [Arizona] to get it. 7, 12, 14 There’s this freeway there called the Loop 202 that just goes around the whole valley. 7, 8, 9, 12, 16 That car pretty much drives itself so I would put my arm over there and he would hit me up and then he would shoot himself up. 7, 10, 14, 18 We would just drive in circles listening to Al Green. 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17 We played this game where whoever was driving, if the other person nodded off we would whack their heads against the window. 8, 14 It was just this stupid game that we played. 8, 9, 12 He didn’t come to when I did it. 13, 19 I’ve only seen it in movies where people overdose and they have foam coming out of their mouth but that actually happened this time. 10, 12, 13, 15 No other time has that ever happened. 12, 13 I guess his heart exploded because the cocaine was really good and it made his heart explode. 10, 16 First, it brought him down -- it was just all wrong. 9, 12, 18 I was high too, really high. 8 I missed the exit to the hospital three times trying to get him there. 16, 18 Finally, I got him there and I ran around to his side of the car, but for some reason his door wouldn’t open. 7, 8, 17 It had never happened before. 12, 13, 15 So, I ran back to my side, drug him over the seat, and put him in a wheelchair and wheeled him into the emergency room. 7, 10, 12, 14, 19 I ran back outside, grabbed my keys, started the car, and drove around the block. 7, 9, 11, 14, 19 I stashed the dope and everything in the bushes, turned around, and came back. 8, 9, 19 When I came back the cops were there. 19 They put handcuffs on me and told me I was going to jail for, I don’t remember what he called it, but it was accessory to something. 6, 7, 10, 20 It still hadn’t dawned on me what had happened. 9, 12, 13 We had both overdosed tons of times, but this time got him. 15, 18 The cops told me, “He’s dead. 20 You’re going to have to call his mom.” 7, 15 I called his mom. 7, 15 It still hadn’t really hit me until I was cleaning out his apartment. 9, 20 His mom called and she said, “I can’t do it. 7, 15 I need you to go over there and do it.” 13 That’s when it really hit me.  After that it just seemed like my mom was blaming me for it, my baby’s mom was blaming me for it, his mom was blaming me for it, and I was blaming myself for it. 5, 9, 12, 15, 19 I just left town and I stayed gone. 5, 9, 12, 19 I can’t even tell you all the places I went that time. 11, 15, 17 I was just drifting, floating. 9, 12, 14 My friend Matt, a kid that I grew up with, got a hold of my mom and said, “Have you heard from Brandon?” 7, 12, 15, 20 She said, “No, but when I do can I get him on an airplane and send him to Minneapolis? 12, 13 Or else he’s going to die.”  That’s pretty much what happened. 12, 13, 18 AS: Was Matt here?  BC: Matt was here.  He had an uncle or something that lived in Isanti, Minnesota.  He came here to get clean. 19 He got cleaner; he wasn’t shoving needles in his arm every day until I showed up in Minnesota to get clean. 7, 13, 19 I think part of his motivation to get me here was because he’s not the kind of guy that can just go out into a city and find dope. 9, 12, 16, 17, 20 I just have that resource, or something. 9, 12 I can just find it wherever that it. 9, 12 I came out here and learned what Rule 25 is. 12, 17, 19 Rule 25 is the first step. 9, 12 I don’t know what about me made people want to help me. 13, 14, 15, 16 I was really more interested in what people had in their pockets that I could get. 9, 11, 19 That’s really what I’m more interested in at this point. 9, 11, 19 I was the worst kind of person. 9, 16, 17 I hated myself. 12 I couldn’t even pinpoint when I started hating myself. 9, 11, 15 As long as I can remember there was just something that I didn’t like when I looked in the mirror. 9, 10, 12 When I was a kid I always lied about myself. 16, 17 I didn’t want people to know who I really was. 13, 14, 15 If I saw somebody that I thought was cool I would take some of their story and take that on. 6, 9, 11, 12, 17 I was ashamed of what I had: my mom, my dad. 15 I came here and did a Rule 25. 19 I went to this place called Dellwood [Recovery Center, Cambridge, Minnesota]. 7, 11 They were like, “Well, you can’t get clean on your own. 10 You’re going to have to do Suboxone.”  I was like, “Okay, I’ll do whatever it is.” 10 This was when Suboxone was pretty new because I didn’t really know about it. 6, 13, 14, 15, 18 Suboxone didn’t work.  What it did was give me a way to make money. 6, 16 At this time you could get twenty to forty dollars for a little pill.  I got one hundred and twenty a month. 8 That became the hustle. 5, 9, 19 I didn’t have to go out and rob and steal. 9 All I had to do was sell my Suboxone. 7 Then I found dealers that would take the Suboxone and give me anything for it. 6, 13 I still lived out of my backpack. 9, 19 I slept by the river, slept in squats, slept wherever I could if I slept.  I went to treatment again. 9, 16 I went to the Pride Institute [Minneapolis, Minnesota]. 6, 9 That’s where I met Maddie. 5 We actually stayed clean together for five months. 5, 8, 9, 10 Then head first, right away. 9, 14, 16 We hit the road again and she had a habit of overdosing. 9 She overdosed so much. 15, 18 Luckily in Minnesota, Valhalla has it, [Valhalla Place, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota] you can get a little bottle of Narcan. 17 You don’t have to hit a vein you can just go for it right in the shoulder if somebody is overdosing and it will bring them right back in five minutes. 7, 9, 12, 14, 19 Over and over again this is how it would happen. 12 She wouldn’t overdose for a couple of months and then she would overdose. 8, 15 I overdosed a couple of times between there. 15, 18 I think what really made my decision was I had watched everyone around me die: the kids I grew up with, people I considered my brother, people I knew. 5, 6, 12, 16, 17 I didn’t die.  I stayed alive through gutters and shit and everything; I stayed alive. 5, 9 I didn’t want for her to die and me to still be alive. 9, 13 I just knew that was what was going to happen. 6, 9, 12 I love Maddie so much. 13, 18 I was to the point of leaving: 19 “I’m just going to disappear and you’re never going to see me again. 9, 12, 15 I am going to go to treatment and I hope you are going to go to treatment.” 9, 10, 16 I actually went to treatment and wanted to get clean. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 Twenty years of being homeless, not knowing what home feels like. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 Just the looks I had gotten for twenty years. 9, 15, 20 I’m lucky to even look the way I do after twenty years of this. 15, 16, 20 I don’t have the greatest self esteem in the world but I don’t have shitty self esteem anymore. 9, 11, 13, 15 I don’t know what it was. 13, 14, 15 I was lucky to have a spiritual awakening; not everybody does.  I was awake for it.  It happens every day, all day; it’s just whether people choose to see it for what it is. 9, 12, 19 Every day something like that happens for me just to let me know that I’m doing the right thing. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 If you guys had seen my daughter -- that right there just overwhelms me with that feeling that I never had my whole life. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 Now my little boys come here on breaks and stay with me and I have an extra room to provide them a room. 7, 8, 9, 13, 18, 19 I have fucked those little boys out of something that I have given to my daughter. 5, 6, 8 My daughter has never had to know me the way I was. 5, 13, 14, 15, 16 I have been an excellent father to my daughter and she will never know anything different. 5, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 It rips my guts apart to know that my boys could have had that had I just woken up a little bit sooner. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I try not to keep myself in that thought but all I can do now is go from here. 11, 12, 14, 16 I wake up every morning and I don’t stick a needle in my arm, I don’t fuck people over, I don’t lie to people. 9, 13 When I look at a person now I smile at them no matter who it is. 14, 20 All these different things that I always wanted to tell myself that I was I actually am now. 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 I’m actually happy and I actually care about things. 7, 10, 16, 17 I care about myself and I want to help people. 7, 13 I know that it is an uphill battle but all I can do is the next right thing. 13, 14, 15 That’s how I live my life: from one right choice to the next. 11, 14, 17 If I lose sight of that in an instant it will strip me right back to where I was. 9, 14, 19 I think that’s about the skinny of it.  That’s the best way I can do it. 9, 16 I make amends to people that I have hurt in the past. 9, 12, 16 That’s really hard to do. 11 AS: You’re using the twelve steps? 9, 12 BC: Yeah, I’m using the twelve steps. 9, 12 For me personally I don’t see any other way. 16 If I don’t make my whole life about it in one way or another. 11, 16 My body does this thing where it will try to convince me that I can control it [my addiction]. 16, 17 My body actually tries to fuck me over. 10 My head actually tries to convince me that I’m so uncomfortable that I need to get high. 8, 10, 13 I know it will make me feel better, but you just have to do the harder thing which is to not do it. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I just have to not do it one time. 9, 12 I just have to stay clean for today; right now. 9, 12, 14, 19 I’m not worrying about tomorrow until tomorrow. 11 That’s the only way that I can do it and I have tried every way possible. 10, 16 Because I have lived as long as I have -- that’s why I’m clean.  Twenty years of misery is enough. 20 AS: And that you survived through all of that.  BC: I survived.  I can still articulate sentences. 7, 9, 15 [laughs]  AS: You can still read, you are about to finish your GED [General Education Development], and you have a full-time job. 9, 10, 11 BC: I can still read. 9 I can do all kinds of stuff. 9, 16, 17 I’m actually doing the kinds of stuff that I should have learned to do in life already. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 Now I do it and I’m really nervous about it. 16 A lot of the stuff I’m doing today people learn to do when they are eighteen years old. 9, 12, 17, 19, 20 Just now I’m starting to live my life. 9, 11, 14 I’ve done everything and been everywhere and none of it means anything because I wasn’t really there. 16 I was just a husk of a person until I decided to look around and saw that there is life around me and I can participate in it in a positive way. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 I try to sit there and think -- I don’t know if this is just the way my mind is -- but there’s no way, looking at my daughter, that there is any way I can do the things I did when I was around my sons around her. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 The way that I am now it just isn’t possible. 9, 12, 14, 16 I can’t fathom it.  That’s a big shift. 8 That’s a huge shift. 8 Never would I have thought that I wasn’t a piece of shit. 11, 12 AS: There is a lot of really judgmental language about how stupid meth heads are. 5, 9, 13, 14, 17 We were talking about how it comes from people in communities that have been particularly ravaged by meth. 5, 10, 13, 18, 19 As a class, we’ve struggled with all the stigma. 9, 20 We think,  Why does everyone write about it this way, perpetuating these myths about addicts? 16 How can we change this whole problem if we still think about people as bad and morally bankrupt? 9, 16 It goes along with all these vivid descriptions of what meth does to your body, that it makes you do crazy things. 5, 16 Do you think that these portrayals are honest? 9 Do you think that they are fair?  Because you just talked about yourself in a lot of derogatory terms. 9, 10, 11, 12, 17 BC: Yeah, and there’s no way to even get the way that I felt across to you guys. 15, 16, 17 AS: Do the stereotypes have a use? 9 It doesn’t deserve to be fluffed.  It doesn’t deserve to be -- AS: What doesn’t?  BC: Meth.  The way some people act. 10, 16 I think that when people do crazy shit when they’re on meth they have a dual diagnosis. 5, 16 They might have prior mental conditions and then they put meth on top of it. 5, 10, 14, 19 Schizophrenia does two things that I’ve seen happen directly in front of me. 12, 16 Some Schizophrenics, when they get completely high, their voices get completely quiet and they don’t hear anything and they can concentrate. 8, 14, 19 Some Schizophrenics it’s the opposite. 13 The way that this guy described it to me was that his personalities took on different personalities. 16, 17 He had gotten used to his mind the way it was. 9, 15, 16 A lot of it is preconditioned. 17 It depends on the way they are before they start doing it. 9, 11, 12, 16 US1: You talk a little bit about the personal stigma that you’ve faced and how people have looked down on you, or look at you a certain way. 9, 10, 16 Do you feel like people still look at you and behave at you the same way? 9, 16 If so, how do you deal with that based just on the way that you look? 9, 12, 13, 16 BC: When they do it now, it’s interesting to me now. 9, 14, 19 It’s funny at first I would think, “I know what that guy thinks of me. 9, 13, 14, 15 If he only knew.” 6, 12 That’s my ego kicking in, though: “You’re so much better than that now, and he just needs to know that.” 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 It just depends on the day. 9, 12, 19 Now, I can be sad about it. 12 At the same time I deserve that.  I have twenty years to make up for. 16, 20 I do it in whatever way I can. 16 There is this lady that cleans the apartments that I paint sometimes and she has a hell of a time getting around to all these places so I get her bus cards and give them to her. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18, 20 Just little things like that that I do to try to make up for the things I’ve done. 9, 10, 16 There’s no way to make up for all the shit that I’ve done to this world; this negative imprint that I’ve left on people’s lives that I don’t even realize. 14, 15, 16 I just try to be of service as much as I can. 9, 12, 16, 18 That’s how I deal with the stigma. 9, 13 I make it a priority to go just a little bit further for a person even if I don’t know them. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Especially if I don’t know them because nobody expects a person that looks like me to do it and be smiling the whole time. 13, 14, 15 [laughs]  That’s the only way that I can make it okay with myself and think that I am trying to fix the wreckage. 16 There’s stuff that I’ve done that I can’t even fix but it wouldn’t even be healthy to try to fix because it would do way more damage. 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 That’s like the amends. 12 We try to make amends to people wherever possible except when that would do harm to them or others. 12, 16 I really try to think about things more now. 14, 16 I’m more quiet; my voice isn’t as loud as it was.  My head doesn’t get held up as high. 8 US2: Earlier you said Minnesota was probably the best place to get treatment. 9, 11, 16 Why is Minnesota different than other states? 9, 16, 17, 19 How do other states do it? 9, 19 BC: It’s their resources.  AS: Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota], Willmar [Minnesota].  It was the beginning of the recovery scene.  BC: I’ve been on the streets in a lot of the states. 9, 17, 19 I’ve hit a bottom in every state and tried to reach for help there. 9, 10, 13 Never have I found it except for in Minnesota.  Minnesota really picked my ass up and dusted me off. 9 It is still helping me. 9, 13 I’m help-able I guess; I try. 10, 13, 16 I hope I enlightened you guys. 10, 15 Next time will be easier than this time.  [laughs]  There are some days when I think the cravings are going to get me. 19 The meth cravings -- heroin not so much -- but the meth cravings are out of this world. 5, 15, 18 They have my hands sweating sometimes. 5, 18 Maybe even a song will trigger it. 15 Any time I go into a public bathroom I get them because of being on the streets. 7, 9 That’s where you have to use when you’re on the streets. 9 I’m just a survivor I guess; I’m just one of those people that can survive. 9, 10, 12"
"5","Brunner_Emily","Gloria Englund Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 28, 2016  At the Narrator’s Home Richfield, Minnesota AS: This is Amy Sullivan it is June 28, 2016.  I’m with Gloria Englund in her home in Edina? 19 Minneapolis?  GE: Richfield.  AS: Richfield, Minnesota.  The awesome Richfield, Minnesota.  Gloria could you just state your name and tell me that you give permission for me to record? 6, 9, 12 GE: I’m Gloria Englund and I give permission for this interview. 6 AS: Okay.  Thanks.  If you could just start by talking about your, just for a little bit, about your childhood, your education and move in to early motherhood, career, things like that. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 GE: So I was born and raised in Hastings, Nebraska which is a town of 25,000. 5, 9, 19 It was a very safe, wonderful place to be. 11 I had a father who travelled five days out of the week. 5, 19 I had three other brothers, two older and one younger. 5, 14, 20 My mom had her hands full, all the time. 11, 15 I was a tomboy because there wasn’t time for me to be a girl until they left.  Finally in high school she started caring that my hair was combed. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 AS: That’s great [Laughs]. 11 GE: My mother was pretty much an introvert, very dedicated to her family, didn’t have a high school education. 8, 10, 18 Her job was mother and homemaker. 16, 19 I thought she did a pretty good job of taking care of four kids without my dad around much. 7, 8, 11, 12, 18 You never really knew. 6, 12, 15 I have more of my father’s personality; he’s more of an extrovert. 5, 16 You kind of know just where you stood with him all the time. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 When something would happen to one of us kids my mother was like a lion. 12 She was, nobody was going to do anything to her kids.  I write about this in the book.  I just learned that is was really important to stand up for your kids, let them take their share of what they dish out but there comes a point when the parent steps in. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 You protect your kids no matter what. 20 I never doubted, I just had a pretty good, I had a good childhood. 9, 11, 12, 15, 18 Except for one thing.  I don’t know whether I want you to include this in the interview. 6, 13, 14, 15 AS: Okay.  GE: In the written interview. 6, 15 AS: Oh okay.  That’s fine. 14 GE: I’d be lying if I didn’t tell you about it.  There was incest. 9 One of my brothers and I. 5 I did not remember, and he’s still alive that’s why I don’t want it to get out. 9, 13 Although I have dealt with it with him but he didn’t remember it. 13 I was twenty and it was a writing class. 20 It was a suppressed memory.  I did remember asking my mother, when the memory came back to me. 13, 19 When I got up that next day I said, “Did Gale come into my bedroom last night and try to do things to me? 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 Or was I dreaming?” 14 My mother said, “Oh it was just a bad dream.” 9, 12, 14 It was hid until I was in this writing class and I was asked to think of a time in your life when you feel the safest and secure, in your childhood. 9, 10, 11, 16, 20 For me it was taking a bath on a summer night and my mom had put clean sheets on my bed. 10, 15, 19 I’d always sleep at the end of the bed, next to the window, so the breeze would come in those hot summer nights. 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 Sixty five years ago we didn’t have air conditioning, sixty five years ago. 20 It was one of those times when my brother raped me.So in the class it was kind of a meditative experience. 5, 16, 17, 18, 20 I had never meditated, never been in an altered state. 9, 12, 15 I was in my early twenties.  This memory was just like right there. 9, 12, 14 I just didn’t know what to do. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I just started writing as fast as I could. 9, 11, 12 AS: How old were you? 20 GE: Early twenties.  AS: No, I mean when it happened. 12, 13, 16 GE: I think eight, seven, eight, nine.  My brother was twelve or thirteen, just beginning puberty. 5, 9, 12 When I went back then at twenty and asked my mom, that’s when she said, “I thought it was just better to remember it as a bad dream.” 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19 You got to understand. 9, 12, 16 My mother had no high school education. 8, 10 AS: I know. 13, 14, 15 I know. 13, 14, 15 GE: She was trying to protect everybody, never told my father. 5, 15, 16, 20 If my father would have found out my brothers, he would never have dealt with it properly; he would have beat my brother. 5, 13, 15 I know he would have. 13, 14, 15 Not beat him but there would have been, nobody would have got counseling.  You didn’t do that back then, you just beat them up. 9, 12, 19 AS: Right, exactly. 10 GE: My older brother who also came in because I made noise and my mother and my older brother came in. 5, 16, 19, 20 So he knew it was going on. 6, 12 So I went to him and said, “Remember this happened.” 12, 13 “Yes, Mom said don’t tell Dad.”  So I went to therapy.  I thought I had dealt with all of it. 11, 12, 13 Then flash forward another twenty years. 9, 20 I am divorced and remarried to Bob who is the kindest, most loving, understanding person there is. 5, 9, 12, 16, 17 Probably the first time in my life [Dog Barks] that I ever felt safe. 9, 11, 17 I do go back and I have this conversation with my brother because we were always very close. 5, 12, 16, 17, 19 [Whispers to Dog].  That’s right, the recorders going I’m sorry. 6, 10, 14 AS: It’s okay [Laughs].  I’ll warn my students. 9, 14 They’ll jump in their chair. 12 GE: So I make a trip back to Nebraska to confront my brother. 5, 16, 19 AS: Wait so this is in your twenties or your forties?  GE: This is twenties after therapy.  AS: Okay.  You were just talking about your husband. 9, 10, 12, 15 GE: I’m sorry. 10 First time I went back, I confronted my brother and he lived back in Grand Island, Nebraska still. 5, 7, 8, 9, 19 He said, “I know why you want to meet. 13, 14, 15 I know why you called me now. 7, 13, 14, 15 You’re right it happened. 12, 13, 14 I don’t ever think about it.”  I said, “I just want you to know I forgive you. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I hope you’ve gotten help.” 10, 13, 15 He said “I’ve talked to many ministers.” 9, 10, 11 And blah blah.  Then he said, “Nothing’s going to change between us. 16 If you lived across the street from me I wouldn’t be any closer than I am to you now.” 9, 14 I mean he just wanted to stay up on the cross. 9, 12, 13, 16 I wanted to forgive him and get my brother back because he and I were like this as kids until that happened. 5, 6, 12, 13, 19 I came back to Minnesota and lived another twenty years. 19, 20 I divorced my…you know it was just kind of gone. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I didn’t really have any huge emotional, the memory came without a lot of emotion. 13, 17, 19 It was a very mental experience. 14 The therapy was very mental. 14 Twenty more years of my life goes by, I get divorced, I get remarried, I have two stepsons, Aaron started acting out before my husband and I got divorced. 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20 A lot of trauma going on. 17 AS: So Aaron is your biological son?  GE: Aaron is my biological son.  Jeff is my biological son.  Marty and Matt are my two stepsons. 9, 12 Matt and Jeff are just six months apart. 8, 9, 12, 20 Marty is the youngest, he’s three years younger. 5, 9, 14, 20 Aaron was four years older than Jeff. 5, 20 When Bob and I got married Aaron was running away from home a lot. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 Aaron never lived with us when Bob and I got married. 15 Aaron was on the streets from the time he was fifteen. 9 AS: Okay.  So sorry. 10 Twenty years… 20 GE: Twenty years later my brother who raped me gets rectal cancer. 5, 20 That was the way that I was raped. 16 My mother calls to tell me, “I want you to know Gale’s been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 7, 13, 14, 15 I thought you’d want to know.” 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m finally in a relationship and a family where I have, I guess, total trust. 9, 10, 18 Then I start reliving. 6, 9, 11 I have PTSD and all the stuff that comes along with being raped and incest. 9, 13, 19 What I did after I got my Master’s degree, I got a Master’s degree after I got divorced, was going to work as a psychotherapist so I could make enough money to support my kids. 5, 6, 9, 16, 20 AS: What was your undergraduate degree in? 20 GE: English.  AS: Okay.  GE: Writing.  English teaching.  Never had a teaching job either.  I couldn’t find one in 1970.  AS: You’re going to get your Master’s. 9 So you did get it?  GE: I did get my Master’s degree but I couldn’t earn enough money. 9, 20 I found out about this company, Sunrider International because I was looking for an alternative to Ritalin for Aaron. 6 He’d been diagnosed with ADHD.  They had a product called Ease that really worked well for him. 7 I did all my homework, I talked to other parents. 10, 11, 16, 19 I didn’t know about all these. 13, 14, 15 Ritalin kind of calmed him down but it stunted his growth, he lost fifteen pounds. 9, 16, 17 It was not a good solution for him.  When this worked for him I started…to make a long story short I had a twenty year career in a multi-level marketing company. 7, 9, 11, 16, 20 I supported our family doing that. 16, 18 All that marketing degree, all that marketing experience, all that experience in entrepreneurship was why I had no problems stepping into this other entrepreneurial thing as a recovery coach. 9, 12, 20 All this public speaking training, all this personal development training in this business. 9, 16 I think that’s why, I think all that prepared me for what I’m doing now. 12, 14 I think there was a bigger plan. 8 I started experiencing all this trauma and I go back to my mom and my oldest brother. 5, 9, 11, 15, 19, 20 They deny that it ever happened. 12, 13 AS: Oh my goodness.  Even after those conversations twenty years ago? 12, 20 GE: Yes.  AS: They’d never heard you. 15 GE: My mom said, “I just can’t do that to Gale.” 9, 12, 15 I said, “I’m not asking you to do anything to Gale.  I’m just asking you for some support here.” 9, 12, 13 I couldn’t even think about seeing him. 15 I don’t know when I’ll be able to go to a family event again. 13, 14, 15, 18 I don’t know what I’m going to be capable of. 13, 14, 15 I was in full blown PTSD. 11 I couldn’t work.  AS: It was only then that you truly remembered physically what had happened to you? 7, 12, 13 None of the emotional trauma… 13 AS: Had emerged.  Oh yes. 14 GE: I couldn’t sleep with Bob. 7 We couldn’t have sex for a long time.  I couldn’t have people come up behind me and tap me on the shoulder. 13, 19 I just was hyper vigilant about everything. 9, 12 I just told my mom and my brother. 5, 9, 12, 15, 20 I said, “I don’t want to have anything to do with you. 13 You are not being supportive.  I don’t know why you’re lying.” 13, 14, 15 AS: So it was your, which brother is it? 5 GE: My oldest brother. 5, 9, 20 AS: But not the one who…  I never re-contacted my other brother. 5, 10, 15 AS: Did he survive?  GE: What do you mean? 16 AS: Did he live through the cancer?  GE: Oh yes. 14 AS: Okay.  GE: Yes, he did.  I’m sorry. 10 Yes he did.  That’s the non-support that I got from my mom. 15 Then I realized after about nine months of that that I was losing all these other connections to my nieces. 8, 14 I had grand-nieces and nephews that were being born. 7 I called my mother and brother and said, “You know what? 5, 7, 13, 14, 15 I want to start coming back to family things. 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19 But between the two of us we can never speak about this again. 15 I don’t ever want you to bring this up to me and talk to me about it again. 10, 13 It’s a dead subject between the two of us.”  They both agreed.  That’s how I managed to get back to my family. 18, 19 AS: Wow.  GE: My mother did give me; I did go to my mother and ask for a thousand dollars for EMDR treatment. 6, 9, 16 Which in the early nineties, there was one therapist here in town that I heard of. 6, 9, 15, 19 I had all this therapy, all this talk therapy wasn’t working. 10 I thought I’m tired of this; I want to get him out of my head. 11, 12, 13 AS: Did it work for you?  GE: Yes it did.  AS: It worked for me.  It was a miracle.  GE: I just recommend it so highly to everybody. 8, 9, 12 Aaron had some success with EMDR.  My mother, I had that treatment in February, March, April, May of ’96. 9, 16 My mother died in January of ’97.  My brother who raped me was the executor of the estate. 5, 9 I was able to go back to Nebraska and give him a big hug, thank him for everything, no trigger. 6, 8, 13, 19 He is not a triggering person to me in any way, shape, or form. 16, 17 When Aaron died he showed up. 7 I’m very close to both of his daughters. 5 It’s all come full circle. 11, 13, 19 There’s just some things you can’t talk out or change. 9, 10, 12, 16 As long as they didn’t keep rejecting me, we didn’t keep talking about it. 10, 12 AS: They didn’t keep denying your truth. 12 GE: Right.  It worked out.  As a psychotherapist you’ve got to get the answer, you’ve got to get closure on everything. 6, 9, 15 Guess what?  [Laughs].  Other than that I had a very lovely childhood. 11, 13 [Laughs].  I don’t know how we would talk about that. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: In relation to what we’re going to talk about? 10 GE: I mean, yes. 14, 16 AS: Well what it says to me.  All I can do is say that I relate completely. 14, 19 My mother was raped repeatedly from very, very young into her teenage years when her brother took over. 5, 14, 20 She didn’t remember any of it until she was forty-one.  She remembered the part with her brother. 5, 12 She was diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder.  She had gone through a suicidal phase, when I was seventeen, and the psychiatrist in the psych ward wouldn’t let her talk about her childhood. 9, 10, 11, 15, 19 He only wanted to focus on her marriage. 12, 13, 15 GE: It takes all kinds. 6, 16, 17 By ‘92 things had changed in terms of talking about it. 10, 16 Then there’s also the False Memory Syndrome which set her back a lot. 14, 17 She confronted her father and she lost all of her siblings. 5, 9 She now talks to two of them. 10, 14 AS: They disowned her.  They didn’t even tell her when their dad died. 15 GE: He’s the one that raped.  AS: Oh yes, her dad. 14 So I understand very deeply the consequences of what incest does to a family. 9, 12, 16, 18 What my brother asked me with our initial conversation when I said I forgive you and I want to go on. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13 He said, “Are you going to tell Linda and my daughters?” 5 I said, “Gale that’s between you and your wife and your daughters.” 5 AS: Yes.  I said, “I love Linda and I love your daughters.” 5, 13 [Dog Barks].  AS: I jump when the dogs bark. 5, 10, 12 [Laughs].  If I’m standing up I’m fine. 9, 12, 14 GE: It’s the UPS drivers. 7, 14 She thinks she has control over it because she barks and then it goes away. 5, 16, 17 AS: Oh yes. 14 I don’t know Gloria maybe at some point later as we’re talking. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 I mean to me, the things that you experienced, that incident as a child prepared you. 12, 16 Your attempt at healing from it is what gave you the training and the insight into the kind of havoc and trauma that addiction can reap. 16, 17 Right?  GE: Aaron was abused by a babysitter. 5, 9, 13 He remembered it. 12 Of course people thought it’s just a drug. 9, 11, 12, 14 It came up after smoking pot. 19 I begged him and begged him and begged him.  He knew, my kids knew what had happened. 6, 12, 13 I said, “You have to get help now.” 13, 14 I think that part of the therapy, after he came back here and tried to recover. 10, 19 When he was in the height of his using he wouldn’t deal with it. 13 I tried and tried. 10 How do you make somebody do something? 16 How do you make your kid do? 16 I mean if I had the answer to that. 16 AS: I mean you don’t. 16 You couldn’t send them away. 12, 16 GE: “I can’t believe after what you went through you didn’t just make him.” 9, 12, 16 I said, “How am I going to make him do that?” 16 That’s all part of my story. 9 You can’t make anybody do anything. 16 You got to love them where they’re at. 13 Remind them.  Part of one of the reasons why you may not sleep at night is because of this. 7, 19 They need some help. 13 AS: So he was using…maybe we should back up and talk about Aaron. 9, 10, 19 GE: Aaron.  AS: First born. 9 GE: First born. 9 Very ugly baby, very beautiful person. 5, 6 AS: [Laughs].  GE: Very pointed head, erratic labor and delivery.  I had two miscarriages before him. 7 He would often say, “I don’t know why I wasn’t just one of those miscarriages and just died.” 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He hated his life, just so much. 9, 11, 12, 18 “Why couldn’t I have been one of those miscarriages?” 7 AS: When did he start saying that? 9, 11 GE: Pretty deep in his addiction when he was trying to recover. 16 He was a miracle baby. 5 One of those vivacious, incredibly demanding, insightful, intuitive kids. 12 Like all people with substance disorders are. 9 AS: It seems that way. 16, 19 Almost everyone describes their child like that. 9 GE: Extremely sensitive and very bright and picked up on, I’m sure, the marital discord. 13, 14, 15 His younger brother when I told him we were getting divorced, Aaron said, “Well I wondered when.” 5, 12, 14, 20 And Jeff said, “What are you talking about?” 10 Totally not aware that there was any problems in there.  Probably I told Aaron too much. 18, 20 My former husband travelled all the time. 15, 17 Aaron was kind of my surrogate partner; inappropriately I’m sure at some point. 13, 15, 16, 17 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 He was pretty aware of the discord. 18 There was always dragging into family therapy, trying to save the marriage. 14, 16, 17, 18 My former husband became the bad guy because he was an alcoholic and wouldn’t give any time to family. 5, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19 Based upon what you know about me I of course had abandonment issues that I think came out that way. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 He didn’t have a particularly easy childhood until we divorced. 5, 11, 18 He just wasn’t going to follow any custody arrangements. 7, 9, 12 So he started running away from home. 7, 9, 11, 16, 19 That actually happened, I’m trying to remember. 10, 12, 13, 16 I don’t know how much of the running away from home had to do with drug use. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 I really don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I never talked to him about that. 10, 11, 15 If he ran away from home so he could use drugs or if that became part of… 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 19 As he got older and with the ADHD school became more of a challenge, he couldn’t coast. 5, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20 The less he could coast the more disruptive he would become. 9, 13, 19 AS: Where did he go to school? 8 GE: Bloomington.  Bloomington Public Schools.  Finally we put him in Minnehaha Academy his seventh grade year hoping that a more structured environment would help. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 20 He found the element there.  His best friend’s name was Aaron also. 6, 9, 12 They started smoking pot and messing around. 8, 9, 11 It didn’t seem to help. 13, 19 AS: Is that when he first started smoking pot, in seventh grade? 9, 11, 15, 20 Do you think it was before that?  GE: I would say.  Well Aaron, and I have this in the book, Aaron’s first experience with euphoria was accidentally sniffing gas when he was mowing the lawn. 7, 9 He never forgot how that felt. 15, 17 [Long Pause]. 9 I never found that out until he was in treatment. 9, 15, 16 He was in his twenties before I ever heard that story. 9, 15 I think he stole alcohol when he was eleven, twelve and then we started locking it all up. 9, 11, 15, 18 I imagine he was smoking pot then. 14 I know for sure by the time he was thirteen and fourteen it was a pretty regular thing. 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 I think he was doing mushrooms, I think he was drinking. 6, 7, 14 It all started in his early teen years. 9, 11, 20 I was divorced by then, I was in graduate school, Bob and I had connected. 5, 8, 18 I was madly in love. 13 He was madly hating the whole thing.  The divorce, not that he knew the divorce wasn’t justified for me, but he hated, he was mad at the world. 6, 9, 12, 15 I guess the way he chose to act. 10, 16 I don’t know if Ed and I would have stayed married if he wouldn’t have done the same thing. 5, 9, 13, 14, 15 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I get really mad when people talk about broken homes. 5, 10, 19 AS: Yes me too because I made one too. 16 I broke one.  GE: I broke one too.  AS: I’m not making light of it but there’s a stigma around that as well. 9 If you do have a child who has an addiction that is always the reason. 16, 17 We never talk about the children of the parents who are still together; it must be because the parents are still together. 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 I mean we don’t. 16 We never want to talk about what the actual issue is, it’s blaming the mother who… 10, 13, 15 GE: Or the parents, or the divorce. 10, 16 AS: Right.  GE: We were always very close. 16, 17 He had probably had a hate-love relationship with me. 13 I tried all the tough love stuff. 9, 10, 13, 18 I was getting child support.  He was living away from me and he said, “You’re getting child support for me. 6, 16 That money belongs to me.”  I said, “That money is for you if you’re living at home. 6, 19 So if you want to come home and live at home and not use drugs you can have access to the money. 6, 9, 13, 14, 19 Because you’ll be living here right? 6, 14 You’ll have access to everything that you want. 6, 13 You’ll have a life, you’ll have a family.” 11, 18 AS: Where would he stay during all these times? 9, 18 GE: He was living, he was couch hopping, living on the street. 6, 9 I mean he never lived on the street. 9, 15, 16 One of the first places he lived was a block house off of 30th or 31st and Stevens I think. 6, 9, 11, 15, 17 How could I ever forget that?  That’s when he got the dog. 10 At one point, I don’t know if you read the book or not. 13, 14, 15 AS: No, I would like to. 10 GE: He wanted to come home and bring the dog. 10, 12, 13, 19 I told him not to get the dog because I said, “I am not taking care of that dog when you decide you’re tired of it and can’t handle it on the street anymore.” 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 And blah blah blah.  Well he did it anyway. 16 So guess who ended up with the dog eventually? 10, 12, 15 That’s kind of my amends many years later when he couldn’t take care of the dog. 6, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 20 That’s one of the first chapters in the book. 9 It was about how you learn that the hard and fast rules don’t make any sense. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 Or the black and white rules don’t make any sense. 12, 16, 17 I had a chance to have Aaron come back home when he was fourteen or fifteen if I would have let him bring his dog home. 10, 13, 19 I told him he couldn’t because of the dog. 10, 20 AS: Oh he was fourteen or fifteen?  Oh wow. 14 GE: That’s what you’re supposed to do, the hard and fast line. 6, 9, 11 AS: Right.  Be tough, be in charge. 17, 18 GE: In charge of what? 17 AS: Right.  Well that’s what you’re told or we’re told. 20 GE: Many years later he called me from Portland, Oregon and the dog had fleas. 7, 8, 10, 20 I think he was into heroin addiction then, I didn’t know it. 13, 14, 15 He said, “Mom I can’t get rid of the fleas.”  We have become, there are many times when he would come over to the house and bring the dog. 6, 9, 10, 13, 18, 19 We all got attached to the dog, it was a Rottweiler. 10 A beautiful Rottweiler that he had trained magnificently. 6 He fed her, took her to a holistic vet. 9 He wouldn’t feed himself or take care of himself but he took care of the dog. 6, 7, 10 He called me and said. 7 You know it isn’t cold enough for fleas to die in Portland. 8, 13, 14, 15, 20 He said, “I can’t get rid of the fleas.  Maeve is really sick, she’s lost weight. 9, 18 If I pay money to send her home and give you money for the vet can I send her home to you? 6, 12, 16, 19 Will you take care of her and get her back on her feet? 6, 7, 19 I’ll be home in the spring and I’ll take her.” 6, 19 He paid for everything, he always paid. 16, 17 He sent the crates and paid for it. 7 He gave me money for the vet.  I got the dog well but when he came home that spring he was never able to take her back on a full time basis. 6, 10, 11, 15, 19 That was kind of my amends. 12, 16, 17 AS: How old was he at that point? 20 GE: I’d have to go in the book and look.  That was hard. 11 AS: I didn’t realize your book was his story. 9, 14 GE: Yes.  The book is a lot of his story and not just my story but what I saw him going through trying to recover. 9, 12, 16, 17 AS: That’ll be useful. 9 I’ll have to buy a copy from you. 7 GE: I think it would be very useful. 9 Early twenties.  Let’s see.  He was twenty five when he went to Wilmer and that happened after he came back here. 12, 13, 19 I can’t remember.  I’ll have to look in the book.  AS: That’s alright. 14 GE: That felt like the next best thing to do, to take that dog back. 6, 9, 10, 17, 19 AS: Was this the same dog? 10 GE: The same dog, yes. 10, 14 There was a part of me that it was like if I had her I knew he’d stay in touch with me. 6, 9, 12, 15 All this went on with him before there were cell phones. 7 So Aaron would be gone for weeks at a time.  One time months at a time and I wouldn’t hear from him. 8 I wouldn’t know if he was alive or dead. 13, 14, 15 There’d be many times, weeks when I wouldn’t hear from him. 18 He did carry a pager because he dealt drugs to support his habit. 7, 13, 14, 20 Not like the drugs that are available now. 10, 14 Oh my God.  I think he did cook meth for a short period of time. 5, 16 Mostly it was mushrooms and pot and I suppose he was dealing heroin too. 7, 9, 13 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 There’s a part of me that knew if I had the dog he’d stay in touch with me. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 So I had kind of an ulterior motive. 16, 17 It felt kind of like I had a part of him with me when I had the dog. 10, 16, 17 It all sounds kind of stupid. 9, 10, 16, 17 AS: No it makes perfect sense. 16, 17 GE: Maeve was just such a wonderful dog. 9, 10, 12 We all loved her. 13 I ended up with his cat too. 10, 12 The cat, the dog. 10 The cat died, I had to put the cat down a couple of days after Aaron died. 10, 19 I came home after doing funeral pre-preps and the cat was laying here on the couch, a different couch, in her own urine. 10, 16, 17, 19 Just laying there. 9 I thought I’m getting ready to bury my son; I’m going to have a houseful. 6, 9, 11, 12 The only room where I could contain this cat was the utility room next to the downstairs bedroom, where my youngest brother was going to stay. 5, 7, 9, 10, 14 The cat would be going “Meow, meow, meow, meow.” 10 So I packed her up, took her to the vet.  She was seventeen years old. 20 She’d been missing the litterbox and those kinds of things anyways. 16, 17 I said, “I’ve got to put this cat down.” 10 They said, “It sounds like she could have kidney problems.” 10, 16 I said, “Listen. 9, 15 This cat is seventeen years old. 10, 20 She’s been missing, pooping outside the litterbox. 16 Sometimes she has poop dragging behind her because she doesn’t know.” 5, 13, 14, 15, 18 I said, “My son just died. 9, 12 I want to put this cat down. 10, 13 I can’t deal with a sick cat right now.” 10, 13, 14 “Well, this is not the time to make a decision.” 16 “Well are you going to put my cat down or am I going to have to go someplace else?” 10, 11 It was horrible. 17 She finally euthanized the cat. 10 I never regretted it. 15 The cat was ready to go. 10 It was laying in its own urine. 19 Right?  When you just said my son just died and I can’t deal with this. 9, 12, 13 GE: Well then she said, “Well this isn’t the time.”  Well really it makes logical sense. 16, 17 AS: It makes sense in a textbook kind of way. 16, 17 GE: I said, “I’m going to have a houseful of company. 6, 9 I’m going to put the cat down anyways. 10, 16, 17 I’m going to tell you that.  Why do I want to listen to a cat whine for five days? 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19 And worry about it.” 11 Yet, I digress.  AS: Let’s backup. 19 So Aaron.  When does he finally move out?  Tell me more about his teenage years. 20 Does he never live at home after age fourteen? 15, 19 GE: When Bob and I got married.  AS: Does he finish high school? 8 GE: He got a GED finally at a Bethlehem Alternative School.  Great experience for him.  He met a girl, a very bright woman who was six years older than he was. 5, 14, 20 They fell desperately in love. 13, 15 She wanted to go to acupuncture school and I think she already had one college degree. 8, 12, 13, 20 I can’t remember.  She wanted to go to New Mexico. 12, 13 Aaron was going too, they were going to move to New Mexico.  I finally had some pictures taken of Aaron when he was eighteen, I didn’t have any high school graduation pictures. 6, 8 When he went to New Mexico with her we had this kind of ceremony, a family ceremony where we all said goodbye to him. 16, 17, 18 I bought one of these big round candles that had five wicks and then a wick in the middle. 7, 8 We each said something.  He cried through the whole thing.  We all said something we loved about him and we were going to miss him, that he’d always take the candle so he’d know he’d always be part of us. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 We each had a candle that we saved then.  I was afraid I was going to be really emotional. 13 It was really fun because it was nice to see him be emotional instead of me. 9, 13 I often wondered if he got emotional because I didn’t. 12, 13, 15 He did do some Junior College.  His father bought him another car. 5, 7 He totaled one car, never got a driver’s license until he was twenty. 7, 14, 15 His father bought him a little pickup truck. 5, 7 Which of course was great because he could do drug running with it. 7, 11, 14 But he was under our insurance until he totaled it. 7 Then my insurance was cancelled because he was under twenty five. 7 I said, “If you ever buy him another car, you’re going to have to figure out the insurance. 7, 13 I’m done.  I’m done giving him money. 11 I’m done giving him anything. 11 I think you’re enabling him.  You gave him a car. 7 At least don’t give him another car.” 6, 7, 9 That’s how Aaron got to New Mexico.  He took some Junior College classes down there. 8, 20 I’d hear from his girlfriend, “Aaron just won’t get a job.” 9, 12 Well he was smoking a lot of pot. 17 It’s kind of hard to work and smoke pot daily right? 11, 14, 16, 17 Then she wanted to finish acupuncture school in Portland. 8, 12, 13 That’s when I think he got into the heroin.  AS: Around what year is this? 8, 20 The early 2000s?  AS: Oh okay.  GE: I got married in ‘91.  So this all happened early 90s. 12, 13 Twenty years ago. 20 Twenty five years ago. 20 It was one of those times when we were in Portland when he sent the dog home, after they got up there. 7, 8, 10, 18, 19 She’d call and complain, “Aaron won’t get a job.” 7 She knew he was using heroin. 6, 12 She never told me. 15, 20 Here’s the power of Aaron and relationships. 15 They ended up, long story short; they ended up hating each other’s guts, he and this first woman. 9, 12, 16 When Aaron died she took planes, trains, and automobiles to get back for his service. 13, 19 The woman that found Sophie was his last girlfriend. 9, 12 He had three really long term relationships.  They loved him desperately. 13 Of course they were all co-dependent relationships. 12 There was something about him that you just couldn’t resist. 9, 12 The picture of him is very handsome, charming, witty.  He was very caring. 7 He could be very emotionally present for women. 7, 13, 18 Which is always a big draw right? 8, 14, 16, 17 AS: What year was Aaron born? 20 He would be forty three this October.  Finally, he came back and he and Marla broke up. 19 Or did he come back with her? 13, 19 Oh I shouldn’t have said her name. 6 AS: It’s okay.  We can take it out. 6 GE: I can’t remember.  How can I forget this?  He finally said he was coming back. 19 She was staying out there and finishing. 9, 19 I guess he wanted to come back or something. 10, 12, 13, 19 Or they broke up.  I can’t remember.  He came back. 19 He said, “I found somebody.  I’ve got a roommate but they won’t let me have the dog.” 7, 10, 19 It was all very mysterious. 9 Finally one day he showed up with another woman that he said was his roommate. 7, 19 I think they were just friends for a while. 9, 12, 18 He just looked like hell. 9, 12 He’d always come to visit me. 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 So he’s back in Minneapolis but I didn’t see very much of him. 18, 19 He’d always come to visit me during the day. 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 The kids were at school. 8 You know, I was still doing this business out of my home. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 He just looked like hell. 9, 12 Finally this kind of went on I think for about six months, for a while. 8, 16, 17 He’d come to see the dog and talk with me and then he’d vanish for days. 10, 13, 19 I get this call. 7 We’re doing this big seminar for my business and Bob’s father had just died. 5, 8, 9, 12, 15 I get this call from him. 7 He says, “Mom I’m really sick and I’ve got to get to the clinic.  Can you give me a ride? 6 I’m up in Northeast.” 9 I just, it’s seven thirty in the morning, and I’ve just gotten out of the shower. 9, 12, 15 I’m putting on this big thing; Bob’s brothers are in town because his father just died. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19 I’m saying, “Honey if you’re really sick but I just got out of the shower.” 9, 11, 12 “The clinic closes at nine o’clock.  I’ve got to get to the clinic to get my medicine before.”  I don’t know nothing about Methadone. 13, 14, 15 I don’t even know he’s a heroin addict. 13, 14, 15 AS: At this point.  GE: So this is before GPS or anything.  I say, “Give me the address.” 14 I put it into MapQuest, I print my directions. 9, 10 “You be standing out there on the corner, out in front of the house so I can get you.” 6, 9, 12 It’s up in Northeast. 9 I get in the car, I go pick him up and he gets in the car. 7 He looks like somebody who’s had the flu.  He’s in withdrawal right. 14 He’s got on somebody else’s holey sweater.  I said, “When is the last time you bathed?” 9 He said, “Mom just don’t talk to me. 9, 10, 12 Can you just get me there?” 9, 12 I said, “Where’s the clinic?”  He says, “Burnsville.”  I said, “What are you doing going to a health clinic in Burnsville?” 14 “Just get me to the clinic.” 9 So your kids sick, you haven’t seen him for days. 19 The last time you saw him he looks like death warmed over. 9 Now he looks like three deaths warmed over. 10 So are you going to take him to where he wants to go? 6, 11, 13 Sure.  I get him out there and there’s this non-descript clinic.  There’s no name on it or nothing. 6 He said, “I need five dollars for the co-pay. 13, 16 Can I borrow five bucks from you?”  I said, “Sure.  Don’t worry about paying me back.” 11, 16, 19 So I get out of the car he says, “No, no, no. 7 You don’t need to come in.” 13, 19 So he goes in, he comes back. 13, 19 He gets in the car and about twenty minutes later and it’s like he’s in a stupor. 7, 9 He gets in the car and kind of slumps down in the edge of the corner and I said, “What is going on?” 7, 16, 17 He said, “Just drive. 7, 9, 14 Can I come home and cleanup? 13, 19 Can I just come back to the house and just cleanup? 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 Just drive.” 7, 9, 14 So I start driving down Cliff Road from this. 9, 11, 14 It’s clear he’s nodding off and on.  I’m thinking I took him somewhere to get high, right? 8, 14 I don’t know what’s going on. 13, 14, 15 I stop at this park, I pull over and I said, “Tell me what the hell is going on. 9, 10 You’re high!” 8 He said, “I went to a Methadone clinic.”  I said, “Meth-o-what?”  He said, “Methadone.  It’s something they give people when they’re trying to get off of heroin.” 6, 16 That was the first time I knew he was a heroin addict. 6, 9, 12 I just went nuts. 9, 12 AS: Do you remember what year this is? 20 GE: It’s in my book.  AS: Is it long before he dies?  GE: Oh yes, yes. 14 Long time before he dies.  This is ten years before he dies. 20 AS: Oh okay.  That helps. 13 GE: I just start pommeling him with questions. 6, 9, 11, 12 He said, “I’ll tell you everything.  I know I’ve got to get off of heroin. 13, 14, 15 I’ve been trying. 16 I’m hoping this is going to help. 13 Can we talk later?” 10 It was always can we talk later. 10, 16, 17 I drove home. 7, 14, 19 He said, “Can I just go to bed? 9, 12 I haven’t slept for days.” 19 I tucked him into his bed upstairs and just held him, hoping. 9, 12 You know how you hold your kid and you think it’s going to make it all better? 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 That was the beginning of my journey with heroin and opiates and watching him go through treatment time and time again. 9, 16 And try to make Methadone work and abuse Methadone and sell Methadone and not be on Methadone and use pot when he was on Methadone. 7, 9, 16 Until his last gallant effort with Dr. French. 9 Tell me that.  GE: He went to Wilmer and went through treatment. 9, 16 Back then it was all, complete abstinence when you were in treatment. 9, 16, 19 When he went to Wilmer, he was court ordered to Wilmer. 12 He went into a pizza place high and they found opiates on him. 8, 11 AS: There were like cops in there or something? 10 GE: Yes.  He was probably visibly high and the cops happened to drive by and they caught him. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 There were a lot of times he would be thrown in jail. 17, 18 He wouldn’t have any on him but because he was publicly intoxicated. 10 He’d call us for bail and I would bail him out. 7 One time afterwards, he told me this years afterwards, he was thrown in jail for public intoxication and he was on opiates so he was in withdrawal by that time. 10, 14, 20 He had, at times he had large amounts of cash because he was dealing. 13, 18 He hired this feisty lawyer to bail him out. 7, 9, 12 He had no car and his girlfriend didn’t have a car. 7, 12 It took him five hours to crawl home because he was in withdrawal. 11, 14, 19 AS: Oh my Gosh.  GE: Because I wouldn’t come pick him up. 13, 19 AS: Had you picked him up before?  What was your process like as a mother with this?  GE: I never when he was jailed. 15 I was all wrapped up in it being about…it was not declared a brain illness until 2011. 12, 14 Aaron died in 2007.  All of my training as a psychotherapist was this is a behavior or a personality disorder. 6, 9, 16 Although the American Medical Association declared it an illness in 1956 so you could get reimbursed for it as a disease. 12, 14 Treatment centers still treated it as a behavior disorder or personality disorder. 9, 16 They didn’t treat it as a brain illness. 14, 16 AS: It was a personality flaw. 16 GE: It was all cognitive behavior therapy.  We’ve got to learn to change your behavior, there’s something wrong with your behavior. 12, 16 You’re broken. 5 AS: So would you say that when he’s called to get out of jail you’ve already been dealing with him since he was thirteen, fourteen. 7, 13, 20 You’re still in your kind of tough love thing? 9, 13, 16, 17, 18 GE: He broke the law I figured he needed to… 12, 13 AS: Right.  Live with the consequences of what he was doing.  Right.  He was using illegal drugs. 14 GE: Right.  So I went to Wilmer.  AS: What is Wilmer?  GE: Wilmer Regional Treatment Center.  He was court ordered there. 12 He spent a month there and then he went to Prodigal House which had a pretty good reputation for repeat opiate offenders of being the right place to be. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19 Unfortunately, Aaron teamed up with four guys in treatment and they all went to Prodigal House together. 9, 16 They were the band of brothers. 5, 15 He got out of Prodigal House and got a job driving cab but started using. 9, 11, 14 As long as he was working I said he could live at home. 19 So he did come back home. 13, 19 He lived in our basement.  I had other kids at home but he was driving cab. 14, 19 Well then I found vodka in there, I found vodka in his room. 7 He smashed up cars and couldn’t drive cab anymore because he was using. 7, 13, 14 Where are we in the story? 9 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Then he hooked up with this last girlfriend, the one that found Sophie. 9, 12 She supported him for a long, long time. 16 So he didn’t live at home. 19 She would constantly call me, “Aaron this, Aaron that.” 7, 9 AS: How many years were they together? 20 GE: A long time.  I’d have to call her and ask her. 7 AS: That’s okay.  Ten years? 20 GE: Maybe not that long.  She finally broke up with him before he made this last gallant effort. 9, 16 She couldn’t take it anymore. 6, 13 They were maybe together five or six years. 9, 20 She was not around the last three years of his life. 9, 11, 20 He wrote her letters to let her know that he was really trying. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Not to try to get her back but, “I just want to let you know… 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Mom’s even let me drive the car. 7, 14, 15, 19 I’m starting to get my parents trust back.” 9, 10, 11, 16, 19 When he died she just hated it that she never got in touch with him. 9, 12, 15 It’s her biggest regret. 8, 9, 11 She still loved him. 9, 13 She was in another relationship but nobody ever loved her the way that Aaron did. 13, 16 When I finally grasped…after he died, I didn’t really grasp this whole idea of addiction as a brain illness until after he died. 11, 14 AS: Yes, that’s what I’m thinking.  GE: It was through my continued training through MRC as a recovery coach and all my continued investigation. 9, 18 There were just so many things about Aaron that didn’t add up. 9, 12, 16 There wasn’t anything that kid couldn’t do when he set his mind to it. 17 When he wanted to recover and couldn’t. 12, 13 I’d see him try treatment after treatment after treatment after treatment and be so self-deprecating and not get it. 9, 10, 16 Why can’t you get this?  Then when I started reading it’s a brain illness characterized by compulsive drug seeking despite harmful consequences. 9, 10, 11, 14 I thought that’s what’s wrong with him, it’s his brain. 11, 12 It’s not Aaron.  It’s not his personality, it’s not his character. 10, 16 I’m telling you there was not a more loyal.  Yet he’d lie to me, he was deceptive in his illness and all that. 14 I’m talking about loyal to the core to his family, to his siblings, to me. 5, 10, 18 He had an incredible relationship with his stepdaughter. 5, 9, 12 He just idolized Bob. 9, 12 He finally saw what a marriage was supposed to be. 6 He saw somebody that loved his mother the way that he wanted his mother to be loved and respected. 12, 13, 16 That’s what really made me really want to write the book and tell other parents. 10, 13, 16 There was somewhere along the line before he died. 6 Like about five years before when I got the lightbulb that I’m not going to fix this. 16, 20 AS: Five years before. 20 GE: About five years before. 20 AS: What was that moment? 13, 15 GE: I don’t remember what did that.  [Long Pause]. 9 It was this realization that I wanted a relationship with him no matter what, whether he was sober, whether he was using. 6, 12, 13, 20 I couldn’t stand it when we were at odds. 9, 12 How could I take care of myself in the relationship and still maintain a relationship with him? 6, 7, 9 But make the boundaries about what I needed in the relationship not about trying to control his use. 9, 13, 16, 17 That wasn’t going to work.  When Bob and I made that whole switch about, no you can’t be in the house when you’re using we’ll still see you, we want to stay in touch with you, blah blah blah. 6, 9, 13, 15, 16 When you’re in recovery and you come to any family event but you come high I’m going to take you home. 6, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19 All these things. 16 What I needed to feel safe. 13, 16 You can’t stay in the house when you’re using because I don’t know who’s going to show up at the door. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 I don’t sleep when you’re using in the house. 6, 7, 9 It’s not a good thing for me.  It’s not about trying to control you, this isn’t good for me. 16, 17 AS: How did you come to that? 13, 19 Did you go to any meetings? 13 GE: No, it was like Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. 9 It was like God finding.  My higher power finally sent me a message: you are not going to change him. 7, 8, 15, 16 What do you want to do if he dies, how do you want to remember your relationship with him? 13 It really Amy, it was like… 10 I write about this in the book.  It was the reading. 11 It was the July 5th reading in the Al-Anon Blue Book. 11 AS: The Nar-Anon Blue Book?  GE: No the Al-Anon Book.  I never went to Nar-Anon meetings. 13, 15 AS: Oh okay.  There probably wasn’t one.  GE: One day at a time. 19 Oh yes, there was Nar-Anon. 14 GE: It said, here it is this was the turning point for me. 19 I’d read this a million times right. 14, 18 “The non-alcoholic in the family doesn’t seem to realize that the alcoholic is in a terribly vulnerable position, he must be constantly be on guard because he knows, deep down inside how much trouble he’s bringing to the family. 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 He knows he’s wide open to criticism but did it ever occur to you that your tantrums and harsh words are like whipping a sick dog. 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 Remember he’s lashing himself all the time.  If you apply more lashes you’re inviting him to transfer some of his guilt to you. 7 This can keep him from reaching his bottom and realizing how much he needs help to find sobriety. 12, 13, 18 Today’s reminder: 19 I will try to understand how desperately the alcoholic suffers from guilt. 5, 9, 12, 16 I will not yield to impulse to kick him when he’s down.  We both suffer in different ways from the alcoholism. 12, 16, 17 I who have God’s gift of sobriety must be the one to realize his dissatisfaction with himself no matter how defiant and defensive he may appear. 8, 10, 14, 20 If I were unfortunate enough to be an alcoholic how would I hope to be treated by the person I live with? 5, 10, 16, 20 The golden rule is a useful tool in all our personal relationships.” 9, 12, 16, 20 I realized I would treat a street person better than I was treating my own son. 9, 14, 16 I just said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here but I’m going to start having a little compassion for the fact that he is sick.” 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The whole illness concept hadn’t even come into being yet. 13, 14, 15, 19 But you saw it as a mom? 15 GE: I was picking it up on some kind of collective unconscious self. 16, 17 AS: Well you’re also just watching it. 9, 12 GE: Yes over and over.  Right.  AS: You saw him trying and failing and trying. 16 GE: He never tried and failed at anything else in his life. 10, 11, 15 He was a very resourceful drug dealer. 13, 14 He honestly never carried a gun Amy. 7, 9, 15, 16 I want you to know that my son was an honest drug dealer. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: That’s great. 11 [Laughs].  GE: You’ll have to read the book.  AS: Oh I’m going to, tonight. 19 GE: Bob and I just started changing. 9, 11, 12, 16, 18 We started being compassionate and it was all about where we were and what we needed, when we can help support your recovery. 9, 11, 13 Aaron would call and ask me for help and the question was: is this going to support his recovery or is it going to enable his using? 6, 7, 9, 13 Those were my questions. 6, 9 That’s all in the book.  “Oh God Mom I missed a doctor’s appointment.  It’s too late to catch the bus; can you give me a ride?” 6, 9, 10 Well, doctor’s appointment, I’ve got to get him to the doctor.  “Well what’s this appointment for?”  Was it going to interfere with my work schedule and destruct the rest of the family? 9, 18, 19 I had to decide was helping him going to be as good for all of us as it was for him? 13 Now if it was a matter of life and death with him that’s a different matter. 11, 16, 17, 20 I also started basing every circumstance on what was going on now not all the shit that went before. 9, 11, 14 That’s where a lot of parents, well I’m not going to trust him now because… 9, 10, 14, 16, 17 GE: You know what? 13, 14, 15 If he was going to make me untrustworthy I would know and then I couldn’t trust him again. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 Nobody was going to lose a life or if my property wasn’t going to be damaged. 11 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 You’ve got to start building trust again somewhere. 9, 11 Start it and see what happens. 12 The more we trusted him the more trustworthy he became. 5, 9, 19 AS: Even in his addiction.  GE: Even in his addiction, yes. 14 Then he started talking about, “You know Mom I’d read about these ultra-rapid detox.” 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 That sounded a horrible, horrible, horrible experience. 10, 17 Except for the fact that I didn’t go with him, his father, his birth father stepped up and went with him and paid for it. 5, 9, 10, 12 It was the only time Ed was ever completely responsibly for Aaron’s emotional and physical well-being. 13, 14, 19 He told me it was the best time he’d ever had with Aaron, it was the best $10,000 he ever spent in his life. 9, 11, 19, 20 They finally connected emotionally before Aaron died. 13, 18 I said to Aaron, I said, “If you want to do this you can come over to the house, you can use the computer to look at websites, use the phone to make long-distance phone calls. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 19 I watched him withdraw from heroin, opiates so many times. 14, 17, 18 I heard the vomiting and the constant dry heaving. 9, 14, 15 I was in Post-Traumatic Stress watching him withdraw from heroin so many times, and opiates, trying to go down on his Methadone. 9, 14, 16, 18 I said, “I can’t do it Aaron.  So then Jeff thinks that he’s going to go.  You’ve got to drive to Chicago, you spend a night in the hospital, and they do a physical. 7, 12, 14, 19 This was a reputable place. 10, 11 Then the procedure is this, the Naloxone I think it’s now Naloxone, but it’s an opiate antagonist that is intravenously run through your body while you’re sedated, intubated. 9, 11, 14 AS: Oh I’ve heard of this. 15 GE: It’s supposed to make the withdrawal shorter. 6, 14, 16 Then you get in the hospital the day afterwards and supposedly stabilize and then you get in the car and then you drive home from Chicago. 6, 7, 9, 14, 19 So Jeff thinks,  Aaron’s brother, thinks he’ll do it. 5 I said, “So when Aaron is vomiting and having diarrhea all the way home from Chicago what are you going to do?” 16, 19 “Well I’ll pull off at a rest stop.” 9, 10, 19 “How long are you going to be able to stay there? 9 How many days you going to take off work?” 6, 19 I said, “Jeffery he’s going to be violently ill.”  “Well this is supposed to not…” 6 “Trust me.” 9 So finally Ed stepped up to the plate and said, he was retired, and said, “I’ll take him.” 6, 9, 12, 19 I just had to ask Jeff all kinds of… 9, 12, 16, 17 I said this is really valiant of you to do this but I don’t think you have any idea. 8, 11 You’ve never seen anybody in opiate withdrawal. 14, 15 You have no idea what you’re getting yourself into. 11 AS: So what was going on with Jeff this whole time?  GE: That’s a whole chapter in the book.  AS: That’s another story. 9 [Laughs].  GE: Jeff and I finally have made amends. 12, 16 It took a long time, and he still doesn’t trust me when I say I’m going to show up for him. 9 It’s just that the sibling fallout. 9, 12 You’ve got to understand Aaron abandoned Jeff. 9, 12, 15, 16 AS: Oh yes, at the divorce. 14 GE: So there was such a love-hate relationship and all the addiction. 13 Jeff had his own issues. 14, 15 Aaron was never there for him. 15 It just took a long, long time for us to heal. 9, 12 I just kept saying to him because of that last five years with Aaron and the positive experience I had, instead of trying to fix him I just kept saying, “Jeff I know that you’re not yourself.” 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 He was just angry after Aaron died. 9, 12 You couldn’t even talk to him. 10, 15 Oh my God just angry, angry. 9, 12 I don’t know if you’re using drugs. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know what it is. 13, 14, 15 I love you, I care about you. 7, 13 I can’t help you. 13 You need help. 13 When you’re ready to get help I’ll support you. 13 I’m not going anywhere in between.  I can’t help you with this issue. 13, 15 When you are screaming and yelling you’re going to have to leave the house or I’m going to call the police. 6, 7, 9 I’m not going to take that kind of behavior in my home.” 6, 16, 17, 19 AS: Was he screaming and yelling at you?  GE: Oh yes, everything. 14 He just totally… 9, 12, 17 Jeff was the most easy-going, lovable, teddy-bear.  Everybody loved Jeff. 13 Man it totally changed. 16, 17 AS: What were the circumstances of Aaron’s death? 9 GE: Well he got back from that ultra-rapid detox process and my former husband was supposed to leave him at his apartment. 6, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20 He was still violently ill but he had medical marijuana stashed. 9, 14 He thought he was going to smoke his way out of the after effects of the thing. 11, 12, 16 Ed left him off at about seven o’clock and Aaron called me at nine thirty or ten and said, “Mom I can’t stop vomiting. 7, 9, 10 I’m really worried.  I don’t think I should be alone.  I think I need to go to the hospital.” 13 I picked him up and took him to Fairview South and so there I am watching him in opiate withdrawal anyway. 14, 16 I got him admitted to the hospital and he proceeded, and this is all in the book, he proceeded to continue to vomit for ten days. 19 Even rectal suppositories, he was on the IVs, he had this terrible taste in his mouth from the Naloxone or whatever that antagonist was they did intravenously. 9, 13, 15 He couldn’t keep anything down. 12 He was continually swishing his mouth with sodas.  The hospital complained so I had to bring in soda.  AS: Oh because he was drinking too much of their soda. 6, 14, 18 GE: Yes, right. 14 Get this.  He called an AA and asked for a sponsor, asked for somebody to come to the hospital to talk to him. 7, 10, 13, 19 They said, “Do you have a sponsor.”  He said, “No.”  “Well we can’t help you unless you have a sponsor.” 13 He reached out. 13 He was so sick and I had a lot of friends in the program. 12, 17, 18 I don’t know why I didn’t think about just calling. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 It’s like well they said that no one can talk to him unless he has a sponsor, must be true. 10 Finally the doctor up at Fairview, at the hospital, said, “I’m going to put him…” 10 You know he was just aghast that we ever did this ultra-rapid detox thing. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 He said, “The only way we’re going to get any homeostasis is to put him back on a small amount of Methadone.” 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 Ed was supposed to fly back home. 6, 19 When Aaron was so ill and I put him back in the hospital I called him and said, “I don’t think you should go home.” 7, 10, 19 So Ed and I and Bob took turns being up in the hospital with him.  Finally the doctor had a meeting with all three of us and said, “I’m going to put him back on Methadone.” 10, 13, 19 We just like jumped out of the chair because in order to get him to detox they had to switch him from Methadone to Dilaudid. 9, 10, 12 The ultra-rapid detox center said, “Well we can’t detox him directly off of Methadone. 9, 10 He’ll have to be on Dilaudid for ten days.” 19 Aaron knew it would work. 6, 12 He was wondering if it would work.  He’d used Dilaudid on the street enough. 9, 20 So it kept him stable, kept him in withdrawal enough. 9, 14, 18, 20 He just wanted to be off of Methadone. 9, 12, 13 He just couldn’t stand going to the clinic. 9, 12 He was becoming very black and white, again no education. 10 “You know what Aaron? 13, 14, 15 It would be ok to be on a small amount of Methadone for the rest of your life.” 9, 11, 18, 19 AS: Right, nobody said that?  GE: He knew some guys that were but I had my own stigma about it Amy. 6, 9, 12 The only thing I got was this pamphlet and I write about this in the book, called “About Methadone.” 7, 19 It explained.  He said, “Mom I want you to read this.” 13 He was trying his best to get me. 9, 16 All I saw was how he abused Methadone not how useful it was. 9 I’d see him kind of get stable and then they’d take him down. 6, 9, 16, 17, 18 Then he’d start using pot or heroin along with it. 9, 11 AS: He needed to stay stable. 9, 13, 18 GE: For a long, long, long time.  Right?  He could never get his life in order. 11, 15 He was always either in withdrawal or using on the street. 9, 14, 16, 17 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 There was never a period of stability on Methadone. 9, 15 AS: That was allowed to happen. 12 GE: There were a few times but every time he’d get there, he’d want to start tapering again. 9, 11, 13, 18 He’d say, “I can’t be on this anymore.” 13 AS: There’s jitteriness and an anxiety.  All the stigma and lack of education about medication, treatment is. 9, 10, 16 Now I know that Aaron’s disease had progressed to the point where he could not recover. 13, 14, 15 It wasn’t available to him in the way that it should have been. 16 I kept trying to make it about he was dishonest, I write about this all in the book. 9, 16 I stigmatized him for even years after he died. 9, 15, 20 Big book says he can recover if you keep him being honest. 9, 12 Aaron was always a little liar as a kid. 16, 17 AS: Wow, Gloria that’s tough. 18 GE: I’ve got a whole chapter in there.  I mean when somebody dies there’s got to be a reason. 16 he just couldn’t work a recovery program. 9, 12 He just wasn’t honest enough to work a recovery program. 9, 12, 20 When in fact his disease had progressed to the point where he couldn’t recover with what was being offered him. 10, 12 It was somebody; I went to speak at St. Joe’s, which was the last treatment center he was in. 9, 16 Anyways, I digress. 16, 17 So he goes to ultra-rapid detox. 10 They put him back, finally we agreed, puts him on five milligrams or twenty milligrams of Methadone and “Bam” he is well. 10, 19 He hasn’t eaten or kept anything down for two weeks. 15 The guy says, “I got a bed for you at Fairview Riverside, now. 14 Do you want to go?” 13 Aaron said, “How can I possibly go through treatment? 9, 16 I haven’t eaten for days.” 15, 19 He wasn’t hardly stable. 9, 11, 18 He said, “Hey Mom could I just come home and just get some good nutrition in my body and get stable? 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 I truly believed this was the truth.  I said, “Fine you’ve got two weeks.”  Then I knew he would be put on the proverbial waiting list. 6, 9, 10, 12 He didn’t take the bed then. 6 He came home and I kind of nursed him back. 16, 17, 19 The longer he was on Methadone the craving, you know he went to recovery meetings to begin with and then the cravings would increase. 13, 14, 15 He didn’t get into treatment in two weeks. 9, 16 I said, “You’ve got to go back to your apartment.” 19, 20 I’d given him the two weeks. 6 He went back to his apartment. 19, 20 He finally got into Fairview Riverside.  They started taking him off the Methadone and the step down was too fast. 9, 11, 12 He got sick all over again.  Riverside was abstinence based no Naloxone. 9 So he couldn’t go from Methadone to Naloxone.  That’s usually what they do now. 10, 14 If you’re trying to get off Methadone you get on to fifty milligrams of Methadone and then you go on Naloxone. 16 They tried to step him down too quick and he got sick and couldn’t finish treatment. 9, 10, 12, 16 So he went back to his apartment and started doing research. 9, 11, 19, 20 He found David French at St. Joe’s.  He was one of the first doctors to use Clonidine. 9 Which helps with, it’s a blood pressure medication that helps with. 10, 11, 13, 15 My daughter used that. 5, 9 He read about French and didn’t really like the program at St. Joe’s because he’d been through one before but he liked French. 10, 18 His insurance was so short. 7, 16 You left treatment there’s no way you’re going to get back in treatment again. 9, 16, 19 AS: Even though he was sick?  GE: If I go score some heroin, shoot up, go into the emergency room, and say I’m suicidal and that I’m drug addict they’ll have to admit me. 7, 14 So he got back into treatment at a hospital. 9, 16, 19 It’s in the book.  That’s how desperate he was.  So he gets into St. Joe’s.  AS: He totally understood the system by this point. 8, 9, 17 GE: Oh yes. 14 He gets into St. Joe’s.  He loves Dr. French. 13 He is only supposed to get three weeks of treatment. 6, 9, 16 He gets a social worker to petition.  He gets another week of treatment but he is told, “You will not get any more money. 9, 16, 20 You won’t be able to go to treatment for another two years if this doesn’t work.” 9, 16, 20 This has got to work.  He tells them when he goes in, “I do not want to be on any medication at all. 10, 13 When I leave here, Mom I can’t be a controlled addict. 6, 17 I want to be off of all medications. 10, 13 I don’t want to be on any anti-anxiety medications. 10, 13 I don’t want to be on any antidepressants. 13 I want to be off of everything when I leave here. 6, 13 I said, “Aaron let’s just deal with the Methadone. 9, 12, 13, 19 Let’s just go through treatment.” 9, 12, 16 He’s an adult, right? 14 So they do what he wants. 11, 13 By the end of the third week he is going nuts. 12, 20 He can’t sleep. 7 So all these emotions that have been suppressed for all these years by the anti-anxiety medications and the heroin and the pot are coming to the surface. 10, 20 We’ve got the angry addict back again. 19 He said, “If I don’t get out of this place I’m going to kill myself or somebody else.” 7, 11 I said, “Aaron this is the time you need to stay. 9, 13 I really implore you do not go off all your medications. 10 Just worry about the Methadone.” 9, 11 We used the term opiates then. 9 “Let’s just worry about treatment of opiates.” 9, 11, 12, 16 “I’ve got to get out of here.  I’m going to see how soon I can get out.”  I called the nurse and said, “He is threatening himself or other people. 7, 15 He threatened that he was going to kill himself or other people. 7, 15 You cannot let him out.” 19 “Well he hasn’t said that to us.”  Right?  See he knows. 13, 14, 15 He’s agreed to an out-patient day program. 19 “Since he’s been in treatment so long, so many days we feel that.” 9, 16, 19 I said, “He needs to be up on the psych ward. 13 Put him on a seventy two hour hold.” 20 “We have no basis to do that.  You can commit him.  I’ll give you the paperwork. 6 You can commit him to the psych ward for five days.” 19 AS: As his mom. 15 GE: The one thing that Aaron has always said to me, he signed release after release. 16, 17 I was always privy to any information. 16, 17 He said with one caveat, “Never ever commit me.  I don’t know if I could ever forgive you.” 6, 13, 14, 15 My codependency bought into that. 7, 12 I saw him committed by another doctor one other time.  I saw him on a seventy two hour hold in the psych ward. 20 He talked his way to the social worker, the psychiatrist, and the psychologist. 9, 10, 11, 16 I knew that if Aaron didn’t want the help he wasn’t going to get it. 6, 12, 13 Was it worth damaging my relationship, our relationship?  In the end, when he went through this last effort I promised him I would support him in whatever he wanted to do treatment his way. 9, 12, 13, 16 I was going to let him do it. 19 I was the support person not the mastermind. 9, 20 I had always been the mastermind. 9, 16, 17, 20 It was the one regret I have, that I didn’t commit him.  Maybe something could have been different for him. 16, 17 AS: So he gets out?  GE: He gets out.  I pick him up on Tuesday and I take him back to his apartment. 6, 19, 20 He’s really agitated.  I say, “Can I get you some groceries?”  I know he wants to go back to his apartment because he’s going to smoke pot. 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 Do you need food?” 13 He said, “No, get me home.” 19 I said, “Okay.”  I had a meeting at the Woman’s Club the next day which is right down the street. 9, 13, 14, 19 His father was furnishing him an apartment. 5, 20 It was a nice one-bedroom apartment. 7, 14, 20 I helped him; I was with him when he signed the rental papers. 13, 16 He was in school at the time. 8 He got it and his father kept it up. 5 Anyways, I said, “I’ll be back on Wednesday.” 16, 17, 19 So I come back on Wednesday. 13, 19 He said, “Hey Mom, I want to change everything around in the apartment. 8, 13, 16, 20 I don’t want anything to be like what it was when I was using here. 13 I don’t want it to look or feel the same. 13, 16 When can you and Bob…”  He was on the last part of his medications. 9, 10 He’d gone to outpatient treatment. 9, 16 He really liked it. 10, 18 He could get on the train and get there and get home. 19 He had it all figured out. 12, 13 He was happy with the arrangement. 7, 17 He was in a very good mood when I saw him on that day. 19 His brother Jeff was going to come over and watch movies with him that night. 5, 13, 19 I had this big event I was putting on for my business on Thursday night. 8, 9, 10, 15, 19 I said, “I can’t do anything until the weekend.” 12, 19 Then his stepbrother’s birthday party was Friday night. 5, 6, 9, 12, 19 I said, “Saturday we’ll come over. 13, 19 We’ll help you move everything around.” 8, 13 He said, “Great.”  “You need anything?” 13 “No, I’m fine.” 14 So Jeff came over and watched movies with him that night and he gave Jeff a copy of William Burroughs book. 17, 18, 19 AS: Junkies  GE: No not Junkies.  AS: Chronicle something.  Yes.  GE: He said, “Here, I think you’ll find this good reading.” 11 Aaron and I, I got him a cell phone. 7 Put him on our cell phone plan a long time before that, when he came back to the cities. 7, 14, 19 The deal was that he got four hundred minutes and he had to pay the ten dollars that it cost me to add another phone. 7, 9, 13, 16 I said, “You go beyond the minutes I’m cutting off your phone and I want that ten dollars every month.” 7, 8, 13 Never missed a payment. 16 He called me and said, “I’m going over minutes. 7 I understand my phone’s going to be turned off.” 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 Never did he ever abuse it. 9 People say, “You’re giving a drug addict a phone?” 7, 11, 14 I said, “He’s going to make drug deals anyways. 13, 14, 16, 17 I have access to him this way.” 6, 16 The other deal was that he call me every morning at seven thirty and let me know he was okay. 7, 13, 14, 15, 19 Every day, seldom if he was late, and he always ended it with, “Goodbye Mom. 12, 16, 17, 19 I love you.” 13 He called me Thursday morning to check in after this great experience on Wednesday. 7, 11, 19 “I’m not doing well.  But I don’t want to focus on me. 13, 15 Let’s talk about Matt’s birthday party. 6, 10, 19 Should I ride the bus out to your house and go out there? 6, 9 Or should Bob pick me up?”  I said, “How about we figure that out on Friday. 13, 19 I’ve got this big thing.” 8 I was very preoccupied with this event. 15 I said, “Are you sure there isn’t anything you want to talk about?” 10, 13, 15 The day I picked him up from the hospital on Tuesday, I called to make arrangements to pick him up. 7, 16, 19 He said, “I had this dream, the strangest dream. 7, 9, 14 I dreamed I was a Tibetan monk and I was coming out of a cave. 14 I said in a language that I don’t know but I understood what I said to the guy next to me. 9, 13, 14, 15 ‘It’s been twenty years and it’s time for me to go home.’ 19, 20 Don’t you think that’s odd?”  I said, “Wow Aaron.  Maybe its twenty years it’s time for you to recover. 20 Maybe that’s what it’s all about.”  I think he had a premonition of his own death.  I said, “Let’s be in touch on Friday.” 15, 19 I kept trying to call him on Friday. 7, 16, 19 He didn’t call Matt and say he wasn’t coming to the birthday party. 6, 7, 19 His sister-in-law had had surgery. 5, 9 Very close to his aunt, very close to Bob’s sister-in-law. 5, 9 Didn’t call and check with her. 7 There were times when Aaron decided at the last minute, “I can’t do a family event.” 9, 12, 15, 18 So he just wouldn’t communicate with me. 9, 10, 12 I didn’t think that much about it. 18 We got to the birthday party. 6, 19 “Where’s Aaron?”  “Well he must have decided not to come. 12, 13, 19 Matt did you talk to him? 10 Did he call you?” 7 Another really weird thing.  On the way home Bob and I are having this silent thing. 16, 19 I just had this odd feeling, this premonition. 9, 12, 16 We were both just exhausted because we’d gone to this big business thing and I just kept trying to call Aaron. 7, 8, 9, 12, 16 No answer, no answer.  I woke up at one o’clock.  Came home, went to bed. 19 I said, “We’re going to go down there Saturday morning if I can’t get ahold of him.” 19, 20 I woke up at one o’clock in the morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. 7, 19 For some reason when we had rented the apartment I kept the super’s, the caretaker’s card. 6, 7, 12, 16, 20 I threw it in my desk somewhere. 15 I spent a couple hours finding that card. 7, 11, 19 It was in a secure building.  I started calling her at seven AM. 7, 9, 11 I finally got ahold of her. 20 She was showing apartments other places. 11, 17, 20 I said, “I’ve got to go check on my son.  I’m afraid something’s happened to him.” 12, 13 We found him at one o’clock.  It was clear that he was dead; I think he overdosed on Thursday night sometime. 5, 15, 19 That was the last time anybody had contacted him. 9, 10 Now they confiscate cell phones and all that trying to find out who they got the drugs from. 7, 10, 14, 16 Bob and I took his phone and started calling people. 7, 9, 11 We couldn’t find out.  Nobody cared that he died of a heroin overdose, in 2007. 7, 11, 12, 15 He was a junkie.  AS: I’m sorry. 10 GE: I know you are. 13, 14, 15 I know you understand. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 GE: We did have a great relationship the last five years. 9, 11, 20 He came over here. 19 He was on Methadone take-outs once a week. 6 He got his Methadone on Tuesday morning and he’d come over here and spend Monday night. 12, 13, 19 He’d take my car to the clinic. 6, 7 He was gone with the car just for exactly the right amount of time. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19 He was supposed to come back and then he made me breakfast on Tuesday mornings. 6, 9, 13, 16, 18, 19 That was our time together.  AS: At what point did you start on the journey that Aaron, you said that for a while you stigmatized him, you did things to try to explain it to yourself. 9, 11, 16 Then what was your turning point? 19 GE: I needed a reason for him to die so I could go on I think. 13 I needed to blame something. 13, 17 I’ve been a writer all my life. 11 I just have tons and tons of journal stuff. 9, 12 He died in May; I went to grief groups in the fall.  They were just horrendous experiences. 9, 12 There weren’t very many people that were dying of opiates back then. 19 It was just starting to come about. 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 Nobody understood, like the majority of people now, that addiction is an illness. 9, 14, 18 The underlying thing was, number one: my son was a drug addict but what did I expect? 14 Of course he’s going to die.  His life doesn’t have the value of my son who was a college athlete. 8, 11, 19 That died of something else or you know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 Almost seventy five percent of the parents I was in with, whose children died of accidental deaths were drug or alcohol related. 7, 9, 10, 14, 16 Right?  One girl stepped off a platform and went through to the tracks because she was drunk, on a platform in New York City, and got hit by the subway. 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 It was because she was drunk, she was high. 8, 11, 14, 15 It was because that platform was not made correctly and he sued the city of New York. 16, 17, 20 Which is probably, anybody probably could have stepped off. 9, 12 I just found myself educating them about addiction and trying to defend my son. 9, 10, 12, 16 I thought I am here for support. 11, 12 AS: This is not working.  GE: This is not working.  I went back to my Al-Anon group and got support there. 19 They understood addiction at least. 9 They could understand the double loss, the ambiguous loss. 8, 9, 12, 16 They got that.  That was just killing me. 7, 9, 12 You’ve got to understand, I was a person who did motivational seminars. 9, 12, 15, 16 I was the person that taught people you can do or be anything you want. 13 I was the symbol of hope eternal. 10 When he died it died.  I didn’t know, I had no idea who I really was. 11, 13, 14, 15 I felt like I lost my own identity. 9, 17 I couldn’t practice what I preached. 10, 13 That you can do anything you really want. 13 AS: You must be a fake then.  GE: Right.  That shit doesn’t work.  A friend gave me a book. 12 I can’t remember exactly. 10 It was about a kid that committed suicide.  Her son committed suicide because he had mental illness. 14 He purposely drove, created an accident. 7, 14 She was a person like me.  She’s in a coffee shop and she’s hearing two people talk about, “You know, I drove around the block and I just envisioned that a parking place was going to appear and it did.” 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 What her experience was after losing her son and listening to a conversation like that. 9, 12, 15, 17 Boy could I relate to that.  I wrote a poem about it.  I just started all this journaling about grief. 9, 11, 12 I just have reams and reams. 9, 12 What this was like for the last twenty years. 9, 20 I got out of the car one day. 7, 19 In network marketing you can continue to earn income, I mean if it’s a real buyable company, without continuing to build. 7, 13, 16, 19 I was just living off of residual income. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 I just couldn’t do anything after he died. 9, 12 I just didn’t have that. 9, 12 My soul was gone. 19 I got out of the car at Zumba one day. 7, 19 I was praying, “God show me where I’m supposed to go and what I’m supposed to do now.” 6, 14 I get out of the car one day and God said, “You need to write. 7, 13, 19 You need to write a grief book about this. 13 You need to put all this stuff into a book.” 9, 10, 13 So I started that whole process and kind of got this huge conglomeration of stuff together. 9, 11, 16, 17 Part of it was sort of like; the first part was sort of like the first part of the book that you’re going to see. 9, 10, 17 The rest of it, the middle was about a different kind of grief about the addiction. 8, 9, 16, 17, 19 The rest was these meditations that were connected to quotes that I found. 9, 18, 19 My editor, God bless her, said, “You know there’s two different books here, two different audiences.” 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By now the opiate epidemic is in full swing. 11, 14 She said, “People need to know what you learned in twenty years. 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 So they don’t make the same mistakes.” 6, 9, 16 I’d had an editor, who worked also for Hazelton as a freelancer, do a lot of editing of my books. 17 So I could get the languaging down and all the medical terminology. 14 She helped me with some of the medical research. 13, 14, 16 I have a lot of research in my book to back up my own personal theories. 16, 17, 19 So then I had this editor look at my book once the one editor said, “You have two books.”  The opiate epidemic is going on, people need this. 13 I chopped off this other part about grief and put this together and then this other editor, my final editor looks at it. 10 She said, “I can’t keep track of this stuff. 9, 12 Are you going to just market this in the recovery community or do you want the general public to be able to understand this?” 9, 12, 13, 16 I said, “I want everybody to read this.” 13 “You’ve got to have a glossary.  You’ve got to do pull outs with lessons.  I can’t remember all this important stuff. 9 You’ve got to do little pull outs.  You’ve got to list them on the back. 9, 19 You’ve got to have a glossary of terms.  You’ve got to have resources.  This is what people need now. 13, 14 Do it this way.” 16 God bless her.  My book ended up being much more. 12, 18 It’s not a memoir.  It’s kind of a handbook of resources. 16, 17 Don’t do what I did, do what I learned. 12, 17 The grief book is waiting.  The first support groups I did were the grief groups. 9 Once I went through Minnesota Recovery Connection and got a website up. 13 I did that before I started really working seriously on this book. 9, 11, 15 Then I just got really involved in advocacy. 9, 12 I work with Minnesota Recovery Connection and still toy with the idea of becoming a non-profit. 9, 11, 14 I don’t know if I want to do that. 13, 14, 15 Probably would look better.  That involves a board, all this other stuff. 5, 9 I think I just want to focus on my speaking and my advocacy and another book. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 Maybe.  I’m doing a lot of partnering with Rose McKinney. 13, 17 God bless Rummler Foundation.  They gave me a little seed money to get my groups off the ground. 8 I got a little bit of a grant. 7 I got a thousand dollars and managed to start that. 9, 11 Other people said, “Well do you have groups for people that are still in active addictions?” 9, 10 So I started my Courageous Caregivers group. 6, 9, 11 AS: You mean for families of people who are still? 9, 16 GE: Or significant others.  I had my Courageous Caregivers group. 6 Did you ever hear of the Opiate Coalition that started? 9, 11 She helped me do a pilot. 13, 16, 17 She and I piloted the first Courageous Caregivers group to see if people would show up. 6, 9, 17 They showed up. 7 She didn’t want to have any more to do with it. 13 What was her name? 6 GE: Mary Kay Forstrum. 9 She and I piloted that. 17 Once there was an interest she said, “You just take them and run them out of your house.” 6, 9, 11, 12, 19 I did that so I can keep the cost down. 9, 12 I had my first few groups at my church. 9 But then I had to charge more. 17 I moved them back here. 8, 19 People like coming to a home, more relaxing. 19 This is in the book; I kind of became a follower of Chuck Hilger. 5, 12, 16, 17, 19 He would come and say, “You need to write a book.” 13, 19 AS: He told me that too. 20 AS: There’s a thing about how you feel… 16 Sometimes I think that isn’t there enough out there. 5, 18, 20 I said that to Chuck Hilger who I met through the Steve’s Law lobbying day. 5, 19 I told him about this project. 20 He was really excited.  Two years later when I’m finally able to get to it. 20 I was like, “Chuck do you really think I should go forward with this?” 9, 10 He was like, “Are you kidding? 10 We need this. 13 Please keep going.” 12 GE: I think you ought to get ahold of the Minnesota Historical Society. 9, 20 AS: I talked to them. 10, 11 GE: They’re not interested? 9, 11, 19 AS: When I’m all finished they might look at it and they might decide to house it. 6, 9 I couldn’t believe it.  GE: There’s stigma for you right there. 9, 14 This is a major health crisis. 14, 18 This is a health epidemic. 14 AS: Of historic proportions. 9 The way I think about it is like AIDS. 16 History of medicine is one of my fields. 9 That’s how I’m starting to realize it. 9, 11, 14 It’s following the same trajectory. 12 GE: The effect it’s having on doctors and the way they prescribe. 16 Absolutely, positively and the backlash of people who are on pain medication, using it responsibly and need it because they’re on MA. 10, 13, 14, 19 They can’t afford acupuncture or meditation or any of the other stuff, massage. 9 They want to stop prescribing it. 9, 10, 13 AS: To people on MA only.  GE: Yes.  AS: Thank you very much right? 14, 18 So there’s a racial component to it and economic.  It’s a class issue. 15, 20 GE: Right.  She’s my best friend. 9, 12 One of my best friends is scared to death that she’s going to get her opiates taken away from her. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 18 She has angioedema which are extremely painful.  They never found out why she has those. 15 AS: That’s the backlash that you talked about. 10, 11, 19 GE: There’s a lot of backlash. 17, 19 AS: Where you go to the extreme instead of the more balanced approach. 9 GE: That’s kind of the way the United States does things. 16, 17 Maybe that’s just the way life is. 9, 11, 12, 16 I mean, that’s the way I did with Aaron, from one extreme to another. 16 AS: I did that with my daughter. 5 I didn’t understand it. 9, 12, 16 She was using heroin for two years before I ever knew. 6, 12, 20 I only knew when she nearly died. 6, 12 I found her.  GE: I didn’t know until I took Aaron to the Methadone clinic. 13, 14, 15 AS: What would you say about your…can  you talk a little bit about mothering? 10 I know you already are talking about it. 10, 13, 14, 15 Is there any last things you’d want to say? 9, 13, 16 GE: Aaron had some good friends in Oakland during one of his more sober periods. 6, 8, 12, 18 Though I think he was using medical marijuana when he was out there. 14 I had to call them all when he died. 7 Thank God  I had their phone numbers. 7 He was in contact with them. 10 The young woman, he’d tried desperately to go out to her wedding but had so much anxiety about carrying Methadone on the plane, even though it was a legal prescription. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 Was so sure something was going to go wrong that he didn’t go. 15 He hated that about himself. 12 That he never went to her wedding. 15 When I called her and I said, “Mary I don’t know. 7, 13, 14, 15 I tried.” 10 She said, “Don’t you ever doubt that Aaron ever loved you. 13 Or that he didn’t know that you did everything that you could to help him. 13, 14, 15 You were his angel.”  That’s what I would say to parents. 10, 16 That sometimes the person you’re trying to help can’t relay to you how much you do. 5, 13, 16, 18 Or how much they appreciate or maybe they are very self-absorbed in their own illness. 9, 14, 18 They could never had as many chances, had the quality of life while they were alive if they did, could never have had as many chances to recover. 11, 15 It just comes all back to parenting; it’s just a fucking thankless job. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19 [Laughs].  You have to remember that whether you have an addict or not.  I think that’s the other thing.  So many things that I made huge issues about I always made out because Aaron was an addict. 14, 15, 16, 17 There were a lot of things, issues that go on with teenagers and young adults with parents in their lives. 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 It’s all part of growing up. 17 Issues happen. 12 AS: It’s not always about the addiction. 16, 17 GE: It’s not always about addiction. 16, 17 AS: Unless your child is an addict.  GE: Then parents get blamed and then there’s a lot of thanklessness that goes on. 10, 13, 16, 17 I think they’re all angels.  No matter how many mistakes they made. 6, 9, 16, 20 They did it because they loved their child. 13 I do a lot of coaching my Courageous Caregivers group and they’ll say, “What do you think I should do?” 6, 17 I ask them, “What’s going to support their recovery?  Or is it going to support their illness? 14 You know what if you’re not ready to drop the gauntlet on this particular issue that’s your choice.” 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 AS: Right, maybe don’t. 9 GE: “I don’t want you saying, ‘Gloria said.’ 11, 13 You need to make up your mind about this.” 13, 16 AS: You have opened yourself up to, and put yourself in a place where you can be supportive of other parents who are going through what you went through, with the benefit of hindsight. 10, 11, 14, 16, 17 The things that worked and the things that didn’t. 16 That is a way to continue mothering in a bigger picture. 8, 16 GE: Yes, it is.  I have my own supervisor as an unlicensed healthcare professional. 7, 12, 14, 20 I’m not a licensed psychologist or therapist. 6, 9 I’m only a certified recovery coach.  But I belong; I’m registered with the board of unlicensed healthcare professionals. 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 20 I do have a supervisor that I check in with if I feel like I’m getting hooked by my parents or some of my clients or my grief clients. 10, 12, 16 It brings up my own grief issues. 14, 15 Like you said, you’re never over it. 15 There’s no closure. 15 It’s all good for me until it’s not.  There was a thing in the paper, an editorial in the paper about mental illness, a whole story in the paper about how we’re not taking care of those who are mentally ill. 7, 9, 14 It could have been about addiction.  I wanted to write a letter to the editor so bad Sunday morning. 12, 13, 19 I just couldn’t do one more thing about it that day. 9, 12, 19 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 GE: That’s why I’m going up North.  AS: To take a break. 6, 18 GE: It’s really my whole life, in a lot of ways. 11, 16, 17 AS: Do you think you’ll stick with it? 9 What’s your energy like for it?  What do you want to achieve? 13 GE: I really want to put this grief book out. 10, 13 I would love it if some other publisher would pick up Living in the Wake of Addiction. 13 There needs to be a second edition, I already have some updates. 13, 20 Like this whole thing about implied consent which is in the chapter but it’s mostly all around Dr. French. 7, 9 You’ll read it.  That needs to be driven home. 7, 13, 14, 19 I have a whole chapter on alternatives to twelve steps because Aaron never... 9, 12, 15 It was a long time until I accepted that he’s not going to recover in twelve step recovery, start supporting him in something that he wants. 9, 11, 12, 13 He loved health realization. 13, 14 AS: Oh right. 14 My son-in-law, Brandon that totally connected for him. 7, 17, 18 GE: Right.  One meeting in 2007. 13 One meeting in the Twin Cities, no car, they didn’t have the light rail. 7, 13 We were living in Chanhassen so how was he going to get to meetings? 6, 13 AS: There’s so much about access that I just find astonishing. 6, 9, 12, 18 In that way it does remind me of the AIDS crisis. 16 There’s certain people who have access to the treatment modalities, or happen to be at the right place at the right time for it. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 Then there’s always people who are on the fringe and they could be from middle class families, educated middle class families or they could be out in Dassel where I talked to another mother this week. 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 20 They’re so isolated and alienated just because of the lack of access to resources. 6, 9, 12 Then you add stigma. 9 GE: And then you think about the lack of Methadone clinics in the outer suburbs.  Not just the outer suburbs, out state. 9, 12 The opiate crisis is live, and living in rural communities. 6 No access. 6 AS: It’s criminal.  GE: I mean I’m sure you’ve seen the anonymous people right? 14, 15, 16 You remember the breast cancer survivor? 9 What can we do to help you recover? 13 There’s a whole recovery program that’s free for you.  AS: Just because you have breast cancer. 9 You walk in and it’s beautiful, you go into these Methadone clinics and they’re just, they’re not welcoming places. 6, 9, 11, 12, 17 My daughter won’t bring her infant to them. 5 She’s like no way. 16 I’m not going anywhere near those places with her. 11, 17 What does that do to a young mother? 14 Who doesn’t have the option to have someone stay with the baby? 5, 9 GE: When you’re standing in line at the Methadone clinic with the same people you stood on the street corner with. 6, 9, 12 AS: And there’s people dealing, twenty feet away I saw so many drug deals. 13, 14, 16 Twenty feet away in Brooklyn Center. 16 GE: Aaron told me. 20 It was really funny.  I believe one of the treatment centers when he found out about health realization was Cedar Ridge, was one of his most positive experiences. 9, 13, 14, 16 That was the first time I ever got any kind of amends letter from him was after there. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 He really wanted to get off the Methadone. 12, 13 They wanted to keep him on a small amount. 12, 13, 18 When he was leaving Cedar Ridge he said, “Mom I think the same people that own Cedar Ridge own the Methadone clinic. 19 What do you think about that?  I think you and Bob should invest in a Methadone clinic.” 9 Then he got into, “You ought to buy a sober house. 6, 7, 9 Do you know what the state is paying me to have this crappy little room, with a crappy little roommate? 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 You guys ought to run sober houses.” 6, 9, 11 I was thinking all the shit that goes on.  For me to be advocating and writing blogs. 10 He’s just laughing out of the other side of his mouth and saying, “Oh I wish we could have done this better together. 5, 9, 11, 12 Oh Mom I wish we could have done this better together.”  I do a lot of nurturing. 17 It’s totally changed my relationship with my other kids. 16, 17 I could be a pretty harsh, you follow the rules or you’re not okay with me. 12, 18 I’m just not like that anymore. 9, 12, 13 Whoever you are, as long as you’re kind to me, you’re kind to other people in the family, kind to your own children you are okay by me. 14, 16, 17, 18 AS: That’s a pretty big transformation. 7, 8, 17, 18 GE: It happened because of Aaron. 12, 13 I could never have supported Jeff’s recovery through his death the way that I had if I hadn’t gone through that experience with Aaron. 15, 16 I could never have been as patient. 15 AS: You mean Jeff recovering from his brother’s death? 5, 16 GE: Yes.  His anger and drawing the boundaries what I wasn’t going to take from his anger. 6, 14 I don’t know the answer for it. 13, 14, 15 I could never have taken that approach with him if I wouldn’t have. 6, 15 He and I would have been like this the whole time.  Like, “What the hell’s wrong with you?  You need help. 13 Go get help. 13 You’re broken.” 5 I think it’s mostly about me. 9 Shoving aside what happened to him because I was trying to save Aaron. 12, 13, 16 AS: Well thank you. 13 That’s powerful, a very powerful story. 9, 15 GE: You know what’s really sad? 12, 13, 14, 15 There’s a million stories like mine out there. 9, 18 That’s when that first book review, the editor what’s her name? 6, 9 AS: Julianne. 8 GE: I wrote a book review for her.  She said, “Do you want Aaron’s picture?” 13 I said, “This isn’t about Aaron or about me.  This is about all the other people.  It’s about us and Aaron.  I don’t want to make Aaron’s death the star.” 9, 13, 16 AS: Right, the star sad story. 9, 12 That’s the part that’s not being communicated very effectively. 10 GE: That’s what I try, that’s what happened in two or three interviews. 6, 12, 13, 16 AS: That’s what I’m trying to counteract. 10, 16 We need to get Rose on our PR committee. 13 GE: We’re valiant; Aaron was a valiant hero, all those people that tried so hard to recover. 8, 10, 11 The ones that make it, they’re valiant. 8, 16 Aaron isn’t any less valiant then they because he died. 8 The parents that stick by them, valiant, valiant, valiant. 8, 9, 10, 16 Talking about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder various things will trigger and I will just lose it. 9, 12, 16 AS: Mine has been for a couple years the people with the signs. 20 GE: On the street corners? 9 That are showing up everywhere because it’s what my daughter was doing the summer that I just knew she was going to die. 5, 6, 9, 12 Here in Minneapolis she was doing it on 94.  GE: Did she ever want to come home? 13, 19 AS: She did, I let her and then she overdosed in the house again. 6, 9, 15, 19 With her little sister right there, the foaming mouth. 5, 9, 14 We had to call the EMT. 7 GE: You didn’t have Naloxone?  AS: I had just lobbied for it two months before but I didn’t, there was no access yet. 6, 8, 9, 12 It was in that period between March and the middle of May. 8 It was available as of June or July.  She came to before they, we made them take her to the hospital. 6, 16, 19 GE: How did she come to? 13, 19 AS: We moved her and then there was a lot of noise. 8, 17 GE: She came around. 8, 19 AS: Yes.  I’m going to stop this. 9, 10 GE: I didn’t know any of that. 13, 14, 15"
"6","Cole_Bill","Nancy Espuche Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 20, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Nancy Espuche-NE Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan with Nancy  Espuche at her home in St. Paul. 19 It is March 20, 2017.  We are back together for part two, as Nancy called it, to discuss what happened in the last few months of Lucas’s life and what Nancy is doing now. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19 We will just take this as a conversation. 6, 9, 12 Can you say you give me permission? 6 NE: I give you permission, Amy. 6 AS: Where would you like to start? 9, 10, 11 NE: Well, honestly I don’t know where I am right now because I feel so lost. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 I feel very lost. 9, 16 I think what is starting to happen is the shock is wearing and the reality of the finality is really in my face. 9, 11, 12 Not that I ever thought Lucas would come back, but I guess I did. 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 There was so much action and sorrow that I didn’t make room or allow myself to really think about Lucas. 7, 10, 16, 18 Now I want to think about him all the time and I want to push it away all the time because I am afraid to think about him. 13, 16 I think one of the big challenges for me -- actually, I’ll tell you the challenges my grief therapist told me on Saturday. 6, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20 My situation is a little different in that I had so much trauma for so long. 13, 16, 17, 18 I’m also solo flying.  I’m single; I don’t have a partner to really go through this mourning with and Lucas is my only child. 13, 15 I say ‘is,’ I don’t know what to do with that ‘is’ versus ‘was.’ 13, 14, 15 That’s a big one. 8 I felt left. 17 I really feel left. 16 I fought so hard. 11 I’ve never worked so hard on anything in my life. 11, 15 AS: To keep him sober and safe. 6, 12 NE: To keep him alive. 12 I can’t do anything else.  Lucas had a hard life and a life filled with a lot of suffering and that feels really horrible. 11, 16, 17 That’s where I am, sort of. 17 Every morning when I wake up and often when I go to sleep there is a new song in my head every day. 6, 7, 12, 15, 19 Last night it was John Legend’s “They got nothing on you, babe.” 9, 12, 19 Lucas and I listened to that music a lot. 9, 15, 17 I think maybe that’s a message somewhere. 9 The lack of form of Lucas, of his body, evaporating -- I don’t know. 13, 14, 15, 17 It is so hard to digest. 9, 11 For three months I cried. 8 Who knew you could cry so much? 6, 12, 18 The other piece is the confrontation of the part of me that says you’ve got to go on and the part of me that says I don’t want to. 13 That battle.  There is a part of me that doesn’t give a hoot. 6 About anything including my future.  The healthier, higher vibrational part goes, “Come on Nancy, you’re still part of the living. 6, 8, 9, 14, 15 You’ve got to find a way to live.” 16 That snake rears it’s ugly head and goes, “Really?  That’s scary. 7 That lack of desire for anything is scary because all I have been living with for the last number of years was the desire to keep Lucas alive. 6, 7, 9, 12, 20 He consumed all of my thinking, my finances, my activity, my sleep. 7, 10 AS: The last interview was the beginning of June of last summer. 6, 9 Some things happened since then. 12, 13, 16 I thought fall was pretty rocky. 11, 12, 18 Are you able to back in time a little bit? 19 NE: I think in July it was rocky.  His acceleration of sadness really started in the summer. 9, 11, 12 He was calling me constantly crying, “I’m scared, I’m scared.” 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 AS: What do you know about what he was doing? 13, 14, 15 NE: I did not know in July. 13, 14, 15 In August Lucas called me to tell me that he had been arrested. 7, 9, 19 I don’t know if he called me or his father called me. 5, 7, 13, 14, 15 Evidently he was driving on something. 14 He told me he had a wobbly tire and there was a problem with the tire. 20 All the same stupid stories he made up his whole life. 9, 11, 16, 18 He was in jail.  He called his father, not me, knowing I wouldn’t bail him out. 5, 7, 13, 14, 15 His father said to me that they gave him a breathalyzer that came up clean, but they hired a lawyer. 5, 12, 19 I was thinking, Hold on a second. 20 If his breathalyzer was clean and it was just his tire they don’t put you in jail. 9, 10, 12 What was he doing in jail?  Well, then Lucas proceeds to tell me he had a scale in the car and it was his friend’s scale. 7, 12 Somewhere Lucas must have really thought I was stupid. 9, 11, 12 He really thought I was going to believe this garbage. 11, 12 I called Michael Knoth, one of my contacts in New York who Lucas loved. 7, 10, 13 We had a session and he said, “You need to get to California.” 13 I said, “When?”  And he said, “Today.” 19 I flew out that afternoon. 7 AS: Was this a therapist you had worked with? 6, 9 NE: He was the man that I mentioned at Lucas’s service.  I called Lucas from the plane and said, “I’ll see you in four hours. 7, 11, 13 I’m on a plane.” 13 I learned at that time that Lucas was doing Xanax which he had a grand mal seizure from in college. 7, 8, 12, 17 Supposedly he got Suboxone.  I don’t even honestly remember what it was. 9, 15, 16 He was withdrawing and I had to take him to the hospital one night. 6, 14, 19 AS: You got him out of jail?  NE: No, he was already out.  His father hired a lawyer. 5, 12 Lucas and I really lay in bed for two days and watched television and slept and ate. 17, 19 I knew we were in trouble when I left, but I didn’t realize how much trouble. 6, 12, 14, 18 In September Lucas came in for the state fair. 9, 19 Lucas won me that giant bear in the corner. 8 The day that he was leaving he really didn’t feel well. 16, 19 I didn’t connect this because he wasn’t high. 8 I said, “You need to go to a doctor.” 13 By the time he got to California his legs and feet were so swollen -- he sent the pictures to his father -- but I told him he had to go to the hospital. 5, 7, 20 He had a really horrific infection.  Almost deadly. 9 If it would have kept spreading it would have killed him. 7, 11 AS: Like sepsis or something?  NE: Yes.  But I didn’t know people shot in their feet. 13, 14, 15 He was walking around in his underwear in front of me and there’s not a mark on him. 8, 15 That was September.  The beginning of October he called me one night screaming at me that he needed my help and he was vomiting profusely. 7, 9, 13, 19 He couldn’t stop. 9, 10 I said, “Lucas, I’m in Minnesota.  You’ve got to call an ambulance.” 7 I didn’t ask him what drug he had took, although that was the turning point for me. 14, 19 That’s when I knew we were in serious trouble. 6, 12 AS: You knew he was using heroin? 6, 12 AS: But you knew he was using drugs again? 6, 12, 14 NE: I thought it was Xanax. 11, 12 I ended up calling the Santa Monica police, but they told me he had already called and they were already on their way there. 7, 12, 16, 20 He made up some cock and bull story that he had a kidney stone or appendicitis. 9, 12, 16 I said, “Really?  I don’t think so.”  It just accelerated from the beginning of October -- crying, screaming, “I’m scared.” 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 I went to see my friends for the party in October -- for Monica’s sixtieth -- and he was high as a kite. 6, 8, 12, 18 I still didn’t know it was heroin, and I had a breakdown. 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: Had he not used heroin before, Nancy? 9 NE: He had, but he had never shot before. 15 AS: Was he using pain pills?  NE: He was an OxyContin guy.  AS: But now he was shooting up. 14 When he would say he was scared would he ever explain what he was scared of? 5, 7, 11, 12 NE: “What are you frightened of?” 14, 15 “My future, my life.” 11 I said, “Lucas, you need help and I’m here to support that. 13 Tell me what is happening.” 12, 13 He just called me everyday, “Don’t stop talking to me. 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 Please keep talking. 10, 12 I need you, mom.” 13, 15 I said, “Lucas, I’m here.”  But when I wouldn’t give him money he would say, “You’re abandoning me.” 6, 15 I said, “I think you are confusing money with abandonment. 15 I’m right here. 14 I haven’t gone anywhere.  My bank is closed. 10 It doesn’t exist anymore.” 9, 13 AS: Plus, you didn’t have a job at this point.  NE: He didn’t care. 7 AS: Right.  But you actually had reached a hard place. 10, 11, 13 NE: Correct.  It was all about money.  He was getting jobs and losing jobs.  When I was there at the end of October I was down on my hands and knees. 12 I thought I was having a nervous breakdown. 11, 12, 16, 18 So did Kim and my friends Sierra and Jane. 12, 18 They thought I was having a nervous breakdown. 11, 12, 16, 18 I was pounding on the floor in the garage: “Stop.  What’s happening? 12, 13 You have to tell me.  He just stood and watched me. 9, 12, 17 He was void of emotion.  He didn’t come to the party with me. 6, 13, 19 He lost his wallet, he lost his phone, and his computer was gone. 7, 9, 10, 19 He was aimlessly walking. 15 It was horrendous. 12 I called the psychiatrist and said, “How did you give him Xanax without knowing his medical history?” 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 He was referred by his therapist. 6, 9, 12 I went berserk on him.  I said, “Don’t talk to me about HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act], I know all about HIPAA. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 Everyone has always called me. 7, 16, 17 Lucas has always signed a release. 16, 17 Xanax?”  Anyway. 16 It just accelerated. 9, 12 The sobbing, the tears, the fear, the pain.  I talked for hours, Amy. 10, 11 AS: How long did you stay in California with him at that point? 9 NE: In October?  A few days. 19 AS: Didn’t he come back for a meeting? 13, 19 When did he visit our meeting? 12, 13 NE: Was that before you interviewed me the first time? 6, 9 AS: I thought when he was trying to get clean after he crashed his car. 7, 11, 12, 16 NE: July.  AS: That was in the summer?  He came and visited and he came to a meeting. 12, 13, 19 AS: That’s when he told us that it wasn’t about us. 20 That must have been the summer, I think.  He came in September for the State Fair. 19 That’s what it was, it was September.  AS: He came with you to the meeting even though he was using. 13, 15, 19 NE: That’s right. 14 AS: He hid it well.  NE: He hid it well.  But he didn’t want to do the recovery walk. 13 AS: That’s right, but he had done it a year before. 14, 20 NE: I didn’t know he was using then either. 13, 14, 15 AS: He was using during that first recovery walk? 9 NE: When he got arrested I asked him how long he had been using and he said for the last year. 9, 10, 19, 20 He told me he was withdrawing on the recovery walk. 14, 20 Outside of Lucas being swallowed up -- everything came so easy for Lucas except this. 19 He didn’t have to try at anything. 16 He was exceptionally smart. 20 He was talented in every aspect of creativity.  He was a superstar athlete. 9, 12, 19 He was charming, he was funny, he was handsome, and he thought he could do this on his own. 11, 12 He couldn’t and I don’t think he could believe it.  I came back October twenty-sixth and I held on for dear life. 11, 19 I would talk to him and the minute he said, “Hello” I could tell if he was high. 8, 10 He didn’t even have to say a sentence to me. 7, 15 AS: Was this because you had spent that time with him in October? 19 NE: No, I always knew when he was high. 6, 8, 12, 16, 17 Always. 16, 17 I would say, “What are you doing?”  He says, “I’m going to work.”  I said, “Really?  You’re high as a kite. 8 You’re going to work?”  This was his response: “Okay, mom.” 15 That’s what he said when he knew that I knew and he didn’t want to admit it. 6, 12, 13 “Okay, mom. 15 I’m going to go now.” 14 Amy, I knew somewhere. 6, 12 I never really allowed it to penetrate my consciousness, but I knew Lucas wasn’t going to make it. 6, 12, 15, 16 I knew it. 6, 12 I couldn’t take it in. 6 I couldn’t accept it.  I couldn’t look at it because who can look at that?  It is horrifying.  In the depths of my soul I knew it. 6, 12 My awakened mind knew it. 6, 12 I couldn’t hide it from myself.  AS: At what point would you say you knew that? 6, 12 NE: Probably four years ago. 20 AS: Really?  I just kept watching him spiral and do nothing. 9, 12 AS: He couldn’t get a grip on anything to pull himself up.  NE: And believe me if he had a fall he had such a net to fall into.  He had so many people rooting for him there, available.  I hate to say he couldn’t.  I also hate to say he didn’t want to. 13 I don’t know what is true. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know which part is true. 13, 14, 15 Maybe both.  I don’t really think that Lucas knew how to live on this earth plane. 6, 12, 13 He wrote me some remarkable stacks of letters and poems. 9, 19 He could present and express when he was ‘locked up’ if you will. 7 In a treatment facility. 9, 16 Not towards the latter parts.  He fought them; he wasn’t interested. 9, 11, 19 But, the minute he stepped back into the real world he couldn’t do it. 9, 12, 15, 19 The world was too scary to him. 7, 15 He couldn’t find ground. 8 He couldn’t find a way to really participate. 16 He didn’t want to play by the rules here. 12, 13 He wanted to set his own crazy standards. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 I think the thing that is so hard for me too is that he became like a thug. 5, 11, 19 He was like a split person.  He was the person you met, and he was that, and then he was this thuggish, hanging out with sludge, garbage, awful people. 5, 10, 18 AS: I keep thinking of the road trip story with the drug dealer. 9, 12, 13, 14 They are driving across the country. 11, 14, 16 I saw a picture that he had sent me in November. 7 In November he was going to see Tony Robbins in Nevada with his roommate who is very spiritual. 7 He was trying to influence Lucas to the best of his ability. 9, 16, 20 I never really looked at the picture because I didn’t like it. 10, 15 I looked at it not too long ago and it looked like Lucas had a broken nose and a black eye. 5, 16 I was so horrified.  I think -- and his father thinks too -- that he was in trouble. 5 I think people were after him for money.  I think everything that started to come out of his mouth was a lie to everybody. 9, 11, 13, 19 I don’t know if you know this. 13, 14, 15 He called me one night at the end of November: “Mom there is something mentally wrong with me. 7, 12, 14, 19 I’m not right. 14 Help me.”  I said, “I’m here Lucas.  Tell me what.”  I said a lot more than just that. 9, 12, 17 I said, “What thoughts are you having? 11, 12 What is in your head?  What are you hearing?  What are you believing?”  He goes, “I don’t know.” 13, 14, 15 He was sobbing.  I think he knew how far from reality he was going and that he was living in a very dangerous world. 6, 12, 15, 18 He wouldn’t say it.  I said, “Come to Minnesota.  Let’s get you out of California.  I’m here I’ll get you on the next plane. 13 I’ll come out there.” 13, 19 AS: Because he had lived here for a while.  NE: Yeah, but it was a really bad place for him. 11 Then he called me the first week of December at six in the morning and said, “I got it. 7, 9 I had an epiphany.”  I went, “Okay, what happened?” 12, 13 I had heard that before that people suddenly had these epiphanies. 13, 15 He said that he understood what this was all about. 9 And what life was all about. 11 I said I wasn’t following. 12 He said he was talking to my father and that my father was on the other side and my father isn’t on the other side. 5, 10 He understood his addiction and what purpose is here in life. 9, 11 Anyway, it was all very confusing, but for me it gave me such a sense of hope in the moment. 10, 13, 15, 16, 17 I thought he had an epiphany. 11, 12 Now, I think one of two things happened. 12, 13, 16 I think he had a near death experience.  Or I think he had a premonition and maybe he was on the other side. 9 AS: Maybe he had overdosed. 15 NE: Yes.  AS: He would just not be straight with you. 6, 9, 12 NE: Never.  AS: Even around something like that.  NE: No. AS: You would get the final statement but you wouldn’t get anything that led up to that. 9 NE: Raymond thought he was cracking up. 11, 12 I thought it sounded like he maybe had got his footing. 9, 10, 11, 12 He was talking to me like a sane person. 10 AS: Sounding like he might be ready for recovery.  Is that what you are saying? 11 Three weeks later he was dead.  AS: Let’s go through December.  That was the first week of December? 9 Then he swung back into, “I’m so scared. 5, 7, 11, 12, 19 I’m so sad. 12 I want to be happy.” 13, 17 That’s all Lucas said often. 12, 15 I went, “If happiness is your end goal you might as well give it up today. 6, 12, 19 That’s not how the world works.” 14, 15 I couldn’t do it anymore. 13 Every time the phone rang I had a heart attack. 7 It continued like that through December. 18 Maybe that’s when he was with Tony Robbins.  The first couple of weeks. 9 Then I saw the epiphany.  I don’t remember the dates.  Then at midnight on December nineteenth when the clock was swinging into the twentieth I woke up out of a dead sleep having a severe panic attack. 7, 19 I didn’t know what the heck was happening to me. 12, 13, 14, 15 I was up for four hours. 11 I finally fell back to sleep. 7, 15, 19 My mother called me the morning of the twentieth. 7 We went out to breakfast, and I was crying saying, “I think something is terribly wrong, but I don’t know what.” 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 I texted Lucas that afternoon and never heard from him. 15 Lucas always responded to me. 16, 17 Always. 16, 17 This was about my dad, and he would have definitely responded to me.  AS: When was the last time you talked to Lucas? 9, 10, 11 NE: The day he died. 19 The nineteenth.  AS: He died on December nineteenth.  NE: Around midnight. 8, 19 Around the time I woke up. 8 He was crying hysterically that day. 7, 9, 11, 19 That day I went and paid four thousand dollars for his rent. 16, 19 My father did because he said he was going to get kicked out. 5 It was a horrible day. 17, 19 He called his father and told his father I didn’t give a shit about him because I wouldn’t give him money. 5, 6, 7, 20 I haven’t really thought about that conversation. 11, 12 But, I did say to him, “If my name wasn’t on that lease you can rest assured that you wouldn’t be getting a dime from anybody. 6, 9, 12, 15, 19 I’m only doing this to safeguard myself because I’m the cosigner.  It’s not for you, Lucas.  I know I said something like, “You are such an ass. 13, 14, 15 I can’t even stand it.” 9, 12, 15 When we hung up I texted him and said, “I apologize.  You are not an ass.  You’re behavior is ass-like and it is very hard for me to watch it and to be witness to it and to be on the other side of it.” 10, 11 He wrote me back, “No, mom. 15, 19 I’m an ass.”  That was our last communication. 9, 10 I did learn also that his ex-girlfriend from Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation], Audrey, who he liked a lot. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 I don’t know what happened. 12, 13, 14, 15 She was in California, too.  They hadn’t spoken in a year. 19, 20 I did learn that she -- and I saw it on his phone too -- she contacted him that night and wanted to see him. 7, 10, 12, 13, 19 He went to see her and she never showed up. 7, 15 He died four hours later. 11 If you think I don’t want to call her and kill her I do. 7, 13 If that’s okay to say here.  AS: It’s just a feeling. 9, 12, 16 NE: She never showed up. 7, 15 The text was, “Audrey this is not a game.” 14 She called him. 7 I haven’t read through half of it. 20 He didn’t call me back or text me. 7 My anxiety was so high. 8 AS: So twenty-four hours later is basically when you wake up or later that night? 7, 11, 19 NE: I woke up for some reason that morning after having fallen back asleep with a feeling of doom. 7, 16, 19 My mother goes, “What are you talking about?” 10 I go, “I don’t know, but something with Lucas. 13, 14, 15 I know it.” 13, 14, 15 When he didn’t respond that day my agitation really heightened. 15, 19 I spoke to a bunch of my friends including Kim and I said, “I haven’t heard from Lucas.” 9, 12, 15, 18, 19 She goes, “Nancy.”  “No, Kim.  I’m telling you right now.” 14 People think you’re crazy because you’re kids disappear. 16 Lucas never disappeared. 12, 15 AS: Right.  You know what their patterns are. 13, 14, 15 NE: I know what his patterns are. 13, 14, 15 AS: Some people might not expect their kid to text back. 19 NE: I went to bed thinking he was really busy and I’ll get a text the following morning. 9, 12 I woke up Wednesday morning and nothing. 19 I texted him again.  I just knew. 6, 9, 12 I called Raymond at about four o’clock that afternoon and asked if he had heard from Luke. 7, 10, 15 He said he had been trying to get a hold of him for two days. 16, 19, 20 I flipped out.  I was hysterical. 9 I said, “I’m telling you something is very wrong.”  He said to call his apartment and I said I was too scared. 5, 7, 11, 12, 20 I was afraid to do anything.  Really, I froze in time.  My friend 12 Jane from New York called and said she was my sister. 5, 7, 9 At this point Raymond also posted something on Facebook unbeknownst to me: 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 Has anyone seen or heard from Lucas? 15 The building never called Jane back. 7, 15, 19 They said they would try to reach him. 13, 16 I called back at about five o’clock and they said they couldn’t reach him. 7, 13, 19 I said, “You need to go open his door.” 13, 17 They said that the only people that can do that are the police. 7 At that point my brother-in-law called me and said, “What is happening? 5, 7, 12, 13 Raymond posted something on Facebook.” 9 I said, “We hadn’t heard from Luke.” 15 He said, “Lisa and I have been trying to reach Lucas for two days.” 13, 16, 19 I then called the Santa Monica police. 7 The dispatcher was getting two police to the site. 7, 13 I called my friend Michael and I called my friend Kim. 7, 12 Michael came down; Kim was coming over. 19 The police called and said that no one was answering the door. 7 “We are leaving. 19 I guess he is not home.” 10, 19 I said, “You are not leaving. 19 You’ve got to open that door.” 17 “Because he could be behind that door.”  They then had to get permission from the building, from me. 6 At which point now Ann is here. 14 It is now six-thirty, a quarter to seven. 14 The police called to say they were entering and they would call back. 7, 19 Of course if he wasn’t there they would call me and tell me he wasn’t there. 7 I call back a half hour later. 7, 20 The dispatcher said they were still on site and they would get back to me. 9, 13, 19 Forty-five minutes pass. 7 It is now eight-thirty and my sister is here. 5, 9, 14 She said, “Nancy.  It is a crime scene.”  But I didn’t hear anything, Amy.  I called back. 7, 19 The dispatcher went, “Oh, Nancy,” and I went, “Yeah?”  She said, “They are still on site and they will get back to you.” 9, 13, 19 I said, “You’ve said that now for two hours.” 11, 14 At nine-thirty Lisa called and asked to speak to a sergeant. 7, 10 She said that this was borderline abusive.  We need to know what is happening. 12, 13, 14, 15 I went downstairs to have a cigarette with Kim and I came back upstairs. 9, 19 My sister just looked at me and I fell to the floor. 5, 9, 12, 15 He had been dead since around midnight the morning of the twentieth. 8 They were waiting for the coroner and the medical examiner to show up and that was why it took so long. 14 Ann explained that, although I didn’t hear anything.  All I did was scream.  I couldn’t get a hold of Raymond that night. 19, 20 He must have gone to sleep. 7 It was a quarter to ten here, which is a quarter to eleven in New York, you know, Eastern Time. 9, 13, 14, 15 Lisa stayed here and called Raymond the following morning. 5, 7, 9, 12 We got him on a plane here. 13 My friends 12, 18 Jane and Emily flew in. 7 In the Jewish religion they don’t do an autopsy.  I would have done it anyway, but with the crime scene they automatically do it. 7, 16 They never even asked me. 10, 15 Lisa did everything.  She got in touch with the coroner, the medical examiner, I don’t know who. 13, 14, 15 She got in touch with the funeral home in Pasadena. 12, 15, 19 Palisades is about a half an hour from Los Angeles. 12 Raymond and I booked flights to get out there.  We left Christmas day. 9, 19 They told us they were doing a brain and a full body autopsy. 11, 20 I didn’t know what an autopsy really meant and then I looked. 13, 14, 15, 16 You’re like a shell after that.  Raymond and I went out there.  I didn’t think I wanted to see Lucas, but Raymond definitely did. 12, 13 We asked the head of the funeral home if he thought we should see Lucas. 10, 11, 12, 19 He said, “Yes.”  There was a towel around his head because of the autopsy.  I did see some hair. 12 He had a sheet covering him from the neck down, but it was Lucas.  It looked just like Lucas. 9, 12 I couldn’t get off of him.  We went to the apartment and did work and then I had to leave and Raymond finished it without me. 6, 20 I’m talking as if I’m not talking about my child because it’s too much. 10, 18 It’s just too much. 9, 12, 18 Some days I think I could take those ashes over there and put him back together. 6, 10, 19 Did you see this?  Some of his ashes are in here.  AS: Wow.  That’s beautiful. 6 NE: As a matter of fact I was in New York at the camp and then his soccer team did a beautiful memorial for him. 6, 8, 10, 20 It was amazing. 15 New York?  NE: You have no idea the outpouring from all over this country. 11, 16 Yeah, his soccer team did a thing.  His coaches.  Thirty kids showed up. 7 AS: Was this high school or college? 8 NE: It was high school and traveling. 8 Some of his friends from high school had films of him playing soccer. 8, 12, 18 They gave me that picture.  They had two blown up pictures of the team they mailed to me.  The team was called the Galaxy. 7 They had a Galaxy ball that everybody signed. 8 The coaches were sobbing.  The kids spoke and were crying. 11, 19 It was probably one of the nicest nights of my life. 9, 11, 19 His camp friends and his ex-girlfriend came. 8, 12, 18, 19 AS: His high school girlfriend? 8, 12 NE: The one from camp. 8 The only girl he really ever cared about besides Audrey. 7, 11, 12, 14 When I saw Brooke I was like, “Oh my god.” 10 So many people showed up. 7 Brooke just sent me pictures of her and Lucas two days ago. 7, 9, 12, 19 I got an email two days ago from this kid on his floor that said, “I just learned. 9, 12, 17, 19 Lucas used to play with my dog all the time. 9, 10 I loved your son.” 13 We talked. 10, 11 AS: Was this in California?  NE: You can’t believe how many people in California reached out to me. 13 I had no idea. 11 His lawyer wrote me: “Lucas changed my life. 11, 16 I’ve never had this experience with a client. 15 He was a remarkable young man.” 14 I mean hundreds. 12, 14, 16 I had over a hundred and fifty cards up there. 7 I had no idea the impact. 10, 11 None.  Teachers, the owner of the camp, coaches, my babysitter who was with us for years. 5, 8, 13, 20 Loved Lucas; came to the soccer thing and the camp thing. 8, 19 He either didn’t feel it or couldn’t feel it. 16 AS: He had an addiction, Nancy.  NE: I know. 13, 14, 15 AS: It just hijacks their brain. 9, 12 NE: I know. 13, 14, 15 It is a very hard thing for me to accept. 11 I can’t really embrace -- and I do, up here -- but I can’t embrace that he couldn’t do it.  You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 I thought he would do it for me. 11, 12 I thought he would do it for me. 11, 12 I really did.  Even though I knew. 6, 12 AS: Even though you know scientifically and intellectually and spiritually that you have to do it for yourself. 7, 13, 14, 15 NE: We were that close.  Having lived with so much trauma and insanity for so many years I also didn’t think that God would let my story end this way. 9, 12, 16, 18, 19, 20 I thought the ending would be good. 11, 12 Somewhere down the line. 6 I didn’t know where that would be. 13, 14, 15 AS: That’s what kept you going through the struggle. 9 Is that what you are saying? 11 I did have hope. 10 Lucas always talked about how he wanted to get married and have five kids and he really did. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 I thought he would. 11, 12 I thought I would be a grandmother and have a daughter in-law and watch my son change other people’s lives the way he did unbeknownst to me. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 People wrote me that, “He saved my life.” 11 There was a mother at the service who flew in from Chicago because Lucas saved her son’s life. 7, 11 I didn’t even remember her. 15 She remembered me from the family program at Hazelden. 12, 18 Did she tell you?  NE: She said he was just there one hundred percent for Joey all the time. 9, 12 And Joey had no idea that he was struggling. 9, 11 People asked me, “Why didn’t he share. 10 We had no idea.” 11 AS: So it wasn’t just you. 9, 12 NE: No. AS: That’s pretty powerful. 15, 18 NE: He had so much shame. 18 He couldn’t admit that this was who he could be and this is who he turned out to be. 19 He couldn’t bridge the two and the devil won.  Evil won.  I’m actually afraid to get back his toxicology report. 10, 19 They told me it would take six to ten months. 6, 8, 20 The state of California once they get it back they send it to a secondary firm. 9, 12, 19, 20 They want to make sure the two match. 13, 15, 16 I don’t even want to know what was in his system. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 I’m sure he had Xanax, I’m sure he had heroin. 15 I mean they found the needle. 13, 16 There was one needle that was empty and one needle that was still full, which makes me think the first needle had a lot of Fentanyl in it. 9, 11, 13, 16, 17 I don’t get it.  When I spoke the neuroscientist, I said, “How do you explain it?” 9, 19 He said, “We really have no idea yet.” 11 I have a theory because listening to Gabor Maté and how he said things often skip a generation. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 I don’t know if all of our drug use impacted our kids. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 Everybody now, including this doctor -- 14 AS: Do you mean people who use drugs -- parents who used drugs in the sixties and seventies? 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 NE: Because Maté said to a degree that epidemiology now -- that layer that lives above the genetic level that everyone is talking about now. 10, 14, 20 AS: Epigenetics?  NE: Epigenetics.  That everything is stored on the cellular level. 5, 7, 9, 12, 20 That we pass everything on on a cellular level. 7, 20 I wasn’t a huge druggie, but I drank plenty of alcohol and I partied. 7, 14 I certainly had my share of cocaine. 9 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Certainly I have plenty of friends whose kids did plenty of pot smoking. 12, 18 Some of them have problems.  AS: Yeah, but some of them are fine. 14 NE: Yeah, but the population that is not fine is so big. 8, 14 How come? 13, 19 It’s not just -- I don’t know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I don’t know if it is technology, I don’t know if it is a breakdown in humanity and a lack of the family unit. 13, 14, 15, 18 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: I think that opioids have a different impact on the brain because we have opioid receptors and our body wants it. 10, 11, 13, 16, 17 We have a place in our brain for that particular plant chemical. 9, 11, 18 NE: Once you start doing them it naturally turns off your own -- AS: Right. 9, 11, 19 And then you need more and more and it changes your brain. 13, 16 That’s what Bob Levy was talking about the other night at the meeting when he came. 10, 13, 19 He was reiterating how different opioids are in the brain than other drugs. 10, 14, 16, 17 Opioids actually can take over your frontal lobe, but the part the opioid is responding to is your old brain, your amygdala, which takes over your frontal lobe. 6, 9, 10, 20 All the lying and the cheating and the stealing and hiding, all that stuff that it does. 9, 10 One thing that might be interesting to you to hear -- because he didn’t say this the first time -- he said they are finding now that genetics and addiction have about a forty percent correlation. 9, 14, 19 If you are related to someone who is an addict or was an addict you have a forty percent chance of becoming one yourself.  But one of the things some of this research is talking about is this kind of shield, and this is kind of like the epigenetic idea of the switch, and they are trying to understand why some of us are so susceptible to addiction and other people just aren’t. 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 The analogy he used was a shield: we all come into the world with a shield, but some of us have a really thick shield. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 Things can happen to us that don’t prompt addiction. 12 Other people come into the world with a much thinner shield and it is very easy for that shield to be penetrated. 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 That to me puts together all of the things we have been learning about and that we have talked about, you and I, and in our group. 10, 11, 12, 16 It is a shield. 14 What we give to our children and what they get from the world and what they get genetically and experientially, who they come into the world as with their own personalities. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I think that shield metaphor really makes sense to me and it fits with Maté’s thing about how trauma can create a tendency towards addiction. 5, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 What’s interesting though is what the addiction really does is it tries to thicken your shield. 9, 14, 19 AS: You try to protect yourself, which is ironic. 16 NE: It is so ironic.  AS: The very thing that makes you feel safer is actually killing you. 7, 10, 16 NE: Right.  They do say that people who really do struggle with addiction are heightened. 9, 15 They are more sensitive. 13 They are thin skinned that way. 16 AS: And often don’t feel at peace in their body or in the world. 12, 15, 16 NE: That was Lucas.  AS: I think we know a lot of kids like that. 13, 14, 15, 17 This very, very sensitive -- where you could touch and it could feel like a punch. 13, 15, 16 Also, Lucas, I may have mentioned this to you, had a lot of neural sensitivity. 13, 17 As a kid he would say, “Get this shirt off of me.”  “It is itchy and uncomfortable.”  He was heightened. 15 “I don’t like this sock. 10 It doesn’t fit me right.” 14 You know? 13, 14, 15 He had neuro stuff, body stuff that was sensitive to whatever it is. 9, 13 That’s what this doctor was saying. 11 He said your brain is completely rewired from opiate use. 9, 12, 14, 19 AS: Levy said that the other night. 19 He said there are parts of his brain that will never heal from his own drug use. 9, 14, 15 NE: They have found, I’m sure you’ve heard this, in mice -- have you heard this about mice and cocaine? 15 Mice who became highly addicted to cocaine they found a place in their brain that they can zap. 5, 8, 11, 19 They zap it and they put the mice back in the cage with mounds of cocaine and they won’t go near it. 10, 19 That is what they are trying to isolate and identify in humans. 16 Neuroscientists at the University [of Minnesota] are studying the brain and addiction. 9, 13 I said, “How close are you?”  He said, “We are closer, but we are still very far away. 9, 16 There are different transmitters for triggers, cravings, and memory. 7, 16, 17 Even though you can get control of one the triggers still remain. 9, 17 It’s not like the cravings ever fully go away. 10, 11, 16 We are trying to study the exact part of the brain where the cravings, triggers, and memory come together. 9, 10, 13, 16, 19 Mice don’t have a complex brain so we were able to identify the craving or the addiction part.”  That is what they are trying to understand: what actually happens to the brain. 9, 10, 12, 16 What gets rewired and what gets activated. 10, 12 Certain parts of the brain get turned off. 19 Look, we hear a song and we think of our boyfriend from four hundred years ago. 12, 20 [laughs]  We smell something and I go, “Oh my god, that smells like camp.” 8, 10 We hear a noise and think of our crazy father. 5, 16 People say, “That reminds me of my father when he went to work.” 5 You go immediately to fight or flight.  AS: I think those are things that -- the song you are waking up with everyday, the songs that are coming back to you as part of that memory bank. 16, 19 It is healing you, it is coming back, it is flooding you with memories that will comfort you in some way. 16, 19 It seems like it is part of the grieving process. 16, 19 NE: It may be part of the grieving process, but it doesn’t comfort me.  It makes me sob non-stop. 9, 10, 16 AS: I don’t mean -- just some things become alive again. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 NE: Yes.  AS: This happens to me in yoga or something when you aren’t thinking of anything and suddenly something pops in your head and you are like, Where did that come from? 10, 12, 13, 19 Just some random memory. 7, 9 NE: It has been resonating.  That is the interesting thing about epigenetics. 9, 19 Is everything really stored on a cellular level? 5, 7, 9, 12, 20 AS: And maybe a lot is stored that is never really needed or accessed. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17 The shield idea. 11, 14 If you don’t ever come upon drugs if you had a thin shield it might not matter. 13, 14, 19, 20 It just seems so random. 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 What Maté was talking about with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. 7, 9, 10, 14 Why do they have these high levels of depression? 8, 20 I also know the parents of those people and the parents were the children of the people. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 They have such heightened levels of anxiety. 15, 20 For one woman if there was less than one gallon of milk in the house she would have a complete nervous breakdown. 6, 9, 16, 18, 19 She would always have to have two gallons in the house just in case they ever ran out. 6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 She was anxious; the kids end up with depression. 12 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: You came back and you had the memorial service, which was so beautiful. 6, 19 NE: I haven’t listened yet. 9, 15, 17 That’s what happened. 12, 13 I went into action. 10 AS: That shielded you for a while. 14 NE: It shielded me. 14 It kept me in shock.  AS: I think we stay in shock for a while after trauma like that. 9 NE: I had other friends that came out. 12, 18, 19 I went to New York.  I have these silos, these different compartments of emotion. 16, 17 It’s like that jack-in-the-box.  They come up and go, “Ah!” 13, 19 And the other one comes up and goes, “Ah!” 13, 19 All of them are very different than what I want to have in my heart, which is compassion, and understanding, and adoration, and love for Lucas. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 But I have so many other things going on right now. 14, 16 I don’t like that. 10 AS: Like what?  NE: Like, “Why did you come here?” 13, 19 I feel tortured. 12, 16 I do, I feel very beat up. 16 In that Nar Anon room people say, “My child is coming back to me, they were who they were.” 7, 19 Lucas was tough from day one. 18, 19 He wasn’t an angelic, perfect little kid.  What he had was what he had, so naturally had everything going for him.  He had a lot of rage and a lot of anger. 17 Last night that’s all I could feel in my head. 9, 16, 19 All of it banging in my walls, telling me where to go, the stealing, the apologies, and then the stealing. 9, 10 You might have been there when I said my therapist in New York said, “Nancy, love is a verb.” 6, 9, 13 When I remember that I feel really bad, too. 16 NE: Because Lucas told me all the time how much he loved me. 13, 18, 20 But he acted contrary to that very often, and before he did drugs he was tough. 10, 12, 14, 15, 18 I was really a single parent. 10, 15, 16 AS: You loved him. 13 Does the rage make you feel like you didn’t love him enough? 13, 16, 20 NE: You know Amy, the rage was tough. 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: Can you hold those two things together: the love and the rage? 13, 16, 20 Or does that not feel -- NE: I think it was safer to have those two things when he was alive. 16 He made it hard to love him sometimes. 5, 11, 13, 16, 18 Sometimes I felt like I didn’t love him at all. 5, 13, 17, 18 There were times that I thought if he wasn’t my child I would want nothing to do with this person. 11, 12, 13, 18 They don’t feed my soul.  There is no give and take here. 6 There is no gentle kindness consistently. 9, 11, 15, 16, 17 Who I am and what I am going through doesn’t matter. 20 I’m left with a lot of output. 10, 17 There was so much output. 10, 18 AS: You were feeling empty. 16 NE: I’m empty.  I feel empty and left. 16 Some people say, “Things were so good for a month or two years or five years and then they relapsed,” but they had a period of time where there was rejuvenation. 8, 18, 20 Sort of a resurrection of a healthy relationship. 14, 18 NE: No, never. 15 Lucas walked out of the first rehab and bought drugs. 7, 9, 14, 17, 19 The second one I went down there and left early because he was doing drugs. 14, 20 The one at Hazelden -- he walked out and did drugs. 14, 17 He never really got sober I don’t think. 6, 15 AS: Would he tell you that he was sober? 6 AS: Was his dishonesty part of the rage, too? 9 Was it all just mushed together? 9, 12 NE: That’s an interesting question. 6, 9, 19 Now that you say that maybe that’s why I feel so left because he didn’t leave me with any truth. 6, 9, 16 If he would have told me he was struggling -- I feel used. 9, 16, 20 I was the one he called all the time. 7 I was the one who heard it all, but I didn’t hear the truth. 15 I was trying to help somebody who was being completely dishonest. 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 And he was counting on me, calling me, and expecting me to be there. 7 And I was for years. 20 And he wasn’t even standing on his face. 9, 12, 15 You know when they say ‘standing on your mat?’ 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He wasn’t even standing on his mat. 9, 12, 15 He was lying.  He was not true.  Even when I asked him. 10 Even when I said, “Lucas, you are high as a kite right now.” 8, 14 “Okay, mom.” 15 AS: You never got any acknowledgement that you knew what was going on from him either. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 That would make me enraged. 16 NE: That’s why I think I almost had a nervous breakdown in October. 9, 16, 18 I said, “Do you think I’m a freaking idiot?  Look at you!  What do you think I’m seeing!”  It is crazy making. 16 It’s like having a sociopath in front of you. 14 AS: I don’t know any sociopaths, but it might be worse. 13, 14, 15 Someone who is trying to make you crazy. 16 NE: I started to feel crazy. 9, 11, 16 I am watching, listening there and, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 AS: Right.  Slurring his words and nodding off.  NE: Completely. 19 Maybe that’s it.  Maybe all the work -- AS: With no acknowledgement of the truth of what was happening. 12, 13, 14, 15 NE: Why put me through that? 10 Why count on me that way? 16 Why make me privy to all of your misery, your heartache, your suffering. 16 So I should suffer, too?  And I suffered, and he knew it. 6, 12 When I came home from that trip he called me. 7, 19 He said, “I’m glad you broke down.”  I said, “You’re glad I broke down?”  He said, “Yeah, because you had all of that stored inside of you and you really needed to let it out.” 5, 9, 12, 13, 19 He didn’t say because it was legitimate, he didn’t say, “Because I’m using heroin.”  He didn’t say, “Because I need help.” 13 Maybe that’s it, or a big piece of it. 8 AS: I don’t know anyone who would deny you the right to feel angry in this situation. 13, 14, 15, 16 Even with the great loss and sadness. 11, 12 The anger about addiction and what it does to people is completely justifiable. 9, 12, 14, 19 NE: And as I said he was not easy or the most honest person to begin with. 9 This just exacerbated an already obvious tendency. 9, 12, 15 I wanted him to plop himself on that chair and say, “I’m going to make it all up to you.” 12, 13, 16 The way he used to say. 9, 16 “I’m going to show up and I’m going to be the son you want me to be and the son I want to be for you.” 13 Okay, well you know what? 13, 14, 15 You took that away too. 16 My head goes to that spiritual side.  Lucas and I were meant to be together and this happened for a reason and I do go there. 12, 13, 16 Even though my faith is in the garbage right now I still have that sense of myself and know this was for something and it wasn’t for nothing. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17 There is a woman who is in my grief group who is also in our Nar Anon group, and the other day she said, “I feel so peaceful.” 16, 19 I’m like, “Really?” 10 She’s way ahead of me in this game of time, but she said, “Every day I wake up I know I am closer to seeing my son again.” 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I’m going, “Really?  Every day I get up my son goes farther from me.” 19 The juxtaposition of those two thoughts. 11, 12, 13 She’s happier than me.  She’s finding peace.  Not peace, but that’s the way she holds it. 16, 20 I have too much rage right now. 14, 18 I did speak to a medium, I should tell you.  Yesterday. 9, 19 She told me that Lucas was really good, and that made me really angry. 16, 20 He’s good and I’m sitting here miserable, suffering. 13 She said what another psychic said to me in October: Lucas was not from this earth plane. 13 He could not find his way on it. 16 He came in like a warrior and was never comfortable or safe here. 15, 19 But that didn’t help me. 13 She said, “Are there a bunch of people that he knew?” 6, 9, 12 I said, “Yeah, he lost a bunch of friends.” 9, 12, 18 “They are all doing this Buddha chanting and talking about what they did.” 10 Because he lost a lot of friends to addiction. 9, 12, 17, 18 She said it was with a bunch of people. 9 She asked who the Russians were around him, and I said it was my grandparents. 7, 8, 10, 16 My mother’s parents. 10, 16 I don’t know if it was them or not, but she said he was good. 13, 14, 15 It didn’t help. 13 I wish it did.  I want him to be peaceful. 13 AS: You want to be peaceful. 13 Being his mother I want him to be peaceful first. 9, 13 She says he is.  AS: But you just said it didn’t help. 9, 12, 13 NE: It doesn’t, but I wish it for him.  It doesn’t yet, maybe it will. 9 I don’t know, Amy. 13, 14, 15 I never thought at sixty-one I would be facing my parents who are eighty-nine, my sister who has leukemia, my dog who is fifteen, and not have Lucas. 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 And not have a mate.  Time will tell.  Was this what you wanted? 12, 13 AS: I have another question. 6, 9 I wondered about the follow-up to when you had his phone and you told me you called the number he had been calling. 7, 12, 20 Did anything ever come of a drug dealer or anything in LA? 13, 14, 19 I tell you he got a text?  It said, “Got Roxy?”  I called the Santa Monica police. 7 That was the second time I spoke to the Santa Monica police. 7, 19, 20 They asked for Lucas’s phone number. 7, 10 I think they were trying to pin people. 16 I don’t know what happened; I never heard from them. 12, 13, 14, 15 I was very tempted to follow up with them. 12 There was a woman there -- I know who she is through these texts. 13, 14, 15 She said, “You’ve got to get off drugs.” 14 But then she was giving him drugs and is an addict herself. 11, 14 I said, “You could call about Cat.” 7 AS: Is that her name? 6 NE: Her nickname or something. 6, 8 I went, I don’t know if I want to put my energy here. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Someone said you could call and report her? 7 NE: The sergeant from the narcotics bureau said, “Call me anytime.” 15 I didn’t want to spend my energy there. 12, 13, 19 I was going through emails and everything and I never heard back from them. 15, 19 California is different from Minnesota, too. 16, 17 They go after the dealers much more actively here. 10, 13, 18 No, nothing was put to rest. 9, 10, 19 I see what Sam is going through.  Now they changed the court date. 16 The defense attorney now is trying to separate all the cases. 14, 16 Of course he is.  He is working on behalf of his client. 20 If they find something out and they let us know, great. 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 I told them I want to know. 13, 14, 15, 20 I don’t want to go fishing. 13 AS: Yeah, you don’t want to dig through all of his stuff. 9, 13 NE: I have it all on his phone and his computer. 7, 10 I have stayed away right now. 5, 9, 14, 16 I look through the texts.  There are over two thousand I have to read.  I said, No, Nancy.  You have your whole life to read this stuff. 9, 11 Some of it is really going to hurt you.  He was suffering.  The night he died he was really suffering. 19 I saw those texts.  He was vomiting profusely; he was very sick. 9 That’s horrible to learn. 12, 17 It’s such a crazy thing. 16 I think about the Nar Anon group and I think it is a beautiful thing that I can show up there and other people that have lost their child. 6, 9 AS: How is your grief group doing for you?  NE: It only meets once a month. 8, 13 I have a grief therapist that I started with and I see once a week that I like a lot. 6, 9, 10, 11, 17 Even the grief group is a little hard for me because people are talking about their gratitude. 10, 11 And I’m the only one with an only child.  AS: That would make a big difference I would think. 8, 16 My cabin is empty.  I don’t know what I am going to do. 13, 14, 15 I am proceeding with Facing Addiction; I’m proceeding with Cardboard House. 5, 9 AS: What are you doing with Facing Addiction?  What are your thoughts on that and why that group? 11, 12 NE: I don’t really know yet what I’m doing with them other than I’m collaborating on different things. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I’m trying to formalize in my head what I’m trying to do with them and find out what they want to do with me. 13, 16, 17 I don’t really know where we tie the bow. 13, 14, 15"

I give Amy permission to record and document any way she like, whatever it is we talk about today. 6, 10, 16, 19 AS: Thank you.  NE: You’re welcome. 13, 19 AS: Okay can you tell me a little bit about yourself and where you grew up, your childhood, family, your education? 10, 11, 18 NE: I grew up in Long Island, New York. 8 We originally lived in a place called Great Neck, if anyone is familiar. 7, 11 I am the youngest of two daughters, I have an older sister Lisa who actually turned 63 on Thursday. 5, 9, 10, 14, 19, 20 I am 60, she is two and a half years older than me. 5, 20 We then moved to Jericho, Long Island. 8 My dad was an educator, he was a teacher, and then became a principal in what is known as Bedford-Stuyvesant, a very tough area of Brooklyn and was pretty beloved, and is still a pretty beloved man. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 He ran summer camps for [unclear] every summer, a sleep away camp for kids five months old until twenty. 7, 8, 16, 20 I think it was there that I really learned who my dad was and learned to appreciate him and my sister and different aspects of her being. 5, 9, 12, 16, 17 I had a tough mom; pretty critical, pretty, you know it’s her way or the highway, not nurturing in any capacity. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 I’ve learned a lot about her life which was pretty traumatic too. 11, 12, 17, 18 My development as a person really circled around the need for good mothering. 13, 16 As my sister and I both say, we raised ourselves. 5, 9 She did it very differently than I did. 16, 17 My sister now has leukemia, and we are watching that. 5, 9, 14 If it wasn’t for my dad, who is kind and thoughtful and nurturing to a degree, I think life would have been very different for me. 11, 12, 16, 17, 20 I went to school… 8 do you want more? 13 AS: Yeah, keep going. 12 NE: I graduated from Stony Brook University with a psychology degree. 8, 13, 20 I did start my masters at Hunter College in New York City. 9, 11, 20 I was married at the time very briefly to someone I went to highschool with and he became an abusive husband, and I was lucky now thanks to him to get out of the marriage really quickly after a year, and then proceed with my studies. 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 Then, I got a job that I was at for 31 years on. 20 Moved forward, met my husband when I was 31. 5, 9, 15 We have a funny story that I will reserve not for here [laughter]. 9 Raymond is from France, he was visiting New York at the time. 7, 12, 13 We ended up getting married shortly after, and we were married for 20 years. 12, 16, 20 I am divorced now for eight. 5, 14 We had Lucas when I was just 35, I had just turned 35. 9, 12, 19 Mothering was the one thing that I was desperate to do then in my life. 11 AS: When do you remember having that feeling? 16 NE: Yeah, very young. 14 AS: Before you had a child?  NE: Yes.  I really wanted to be a mother. 12, 13 I really wanted to be a good mother. 12, 13 A nurturing mother, an available mother [laughter].  AS: How was your experience mothering when it actually happened at first. 9, 10, 12, 13 NE: Well, Lucas was a sick child.  So it tainted everything.  We didn’t know it at the time, but at three months old Lucas was a very collicky baby. 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20 We now can contribute that to his illness, we just thought he was collicky at the time. 9, 11, 12, 14 But, at the age of about three months, and I was nervous, I was a nervous mom at the beginning, when he was making noise about because he cried so often. 8, 12, 15, 16 And at about three months Lucas started to throw up for a couple of hours, but it started to happen pretty regularly, once a week, but continued to increase over the course of time. 8, 9, 11, 12, 18 We then realized after, you know, he was in and out of the doctors and the doctors kept saying it was stomach flu. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 And I said, “this isn’t the stomach flu.” 9 I don’t remember exactly when it happened but about a year in a half we rushed him to the hospital. 10, 12, 13, 20 They thought he had twisted intestines, but they couldn’t even get him off of me because he was clinging like a monkey. 9, 11, 12, 15 He calmed down and we went home but that accelerated pretty rapidly my... his dad was in the restaurant business and he wasn’t home evenings and weekends so I was really left to Lucas’ illness, or what became an illness, and it was horrifying because I didn’t know what was happening and he would be up for hours screaming in pain. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 Finally, after I don’t know how long it took we changed doctors, but Lucas was about three. 13, 14, 15, 16 We rushed him up to the hospital.  He had been vomiting profusely for hours and was really sort of out cold in my arms. 9, 11, 17, 20 The surgeon that came in at the time, the pediatric doctor on call, of course won’t look at a baby without getting all the bloodwork done, and realized that all of Lucas’ pancreatic enzymes were off the charts and that he was suffering from pancreatitis. 5, 7, 11, 14, 19 And the only reason my baby would ever have pancreatitis is they have a pancreatic tumor or something pretty deadly. 5, 18 So, that’s when the reality of what we were facing really took hold. 20 From that point forward Lucas was, every week, monitored, blood tests, sonograms, restricted with food, knocked out for six hours with other tests, it was constant; insane. 9, 11, 12, 19 It was a week, it was in January, one month shy of his fourth birthday they ended up doing an endoscopy because something was really obvious. 8, 12, 19, 20 They hadn’t done one, and they found what the surgeon always thought was the case with Lukey. 11, 12, 16, 17 He had a cyst called choledocal [unclear] cyst it was common bile duct. 7, 9 A congenital cyst between the gallbladder and the liver and he couldn’t digest any of his food. 9 He had probably been struggling with pancreatitis from the day he was born. 9, 19 So, he went in and they said once it burst it would be gone. 9, 19 And from that point forward... 9 he had surgery for 7 hours, he was cut pretty open, they also removed his gallbladder. 8, 11, 17, 18 We thought he would be in the hospital for 14 days but, I think this is one of the most telling and most important things to note, when he woke up with tubes everywhere, because he had a bag at the time, I went down to bend down to kiss him and the surgeon was there and with all his might he took his hand and he slapped me in the face and said, “Stupid mommy, stupid mommy.” 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19 And the surgeon pulled me and Raymond out.  AS: Who slapped you?  NE: Lucas.  The surgeon said, “I want you to hear me. 13 Children who have this kind of medical trauma, an intervention from birth, grow up with rage, anger, inability to listen to adults. 9, 14, 15, 16, 17 You need to get him into therapy as soon as you can.” 13 AS: Wow.  NE: And we got home and I don’t know who Lucas would have been. 13, 14, 15, 19 Maybe he would have been the same, but he apparently became really belligerent, hostile, tough. 5, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 Really tough. 18 AS: Just as the doctor had… 9 NE: Yes.  And then he had more medical problems. 14 They thought he had turrets, he started to tick terribly and we were running everywhere. 7, 9, 11, 12 It ended up he had what’s called PANDAS which is from all the stress that he had. 7, 9, 12 There is a correlation now between stress and ticks and it looks like turrets. 9, 14 So then he had his tonsils and thyroids out and was in the hospital again.  Then after that, he was hit in the head in kindergarten and was knocked out for twelve hours with a severe concussion. 11, 15, 16, 17 AS: My goodness.  NE: Then after all of that I got very sick, and he watched me because my autoimmune system just went berserk. 8, 9, 12, 17 So I got very sick for five years and was rushed to the hospital for at least once a week and he would witness that and it was for trauma. 9, 20 So to answer your question in a very long way, motherhood for me from the very beginning was all about crisis. 6, 9, 16 From birth, it was crisis after crisis.  And, it was difficult from day one. 19, 20 AS: Did you feel supported by your husband? 15, 16 NE: Not enough. 20 AS: Were you working full time? 11 NE: Yes.  Now, neither of us could sleep in the middle of the night, when either I needed to get to the hospital for myself because that’s when my problem really would occur, I would wake up and my tongue would be this big. 7, 8, 13, 19 Or, Lucas was not well.  And there was no waking Raymond up.  “Leave me alone, I need to sleep.” 7, 13 So I was pretty exhausted, I was working pretty… 9, 18 ten hour days and, with Luke all night and on weekends. 12, 19 AS: Would it be fair to say you were... you raised Lucas on your own? 5 NE: Yes, it would be.  AS: A single mother with a man in the house. 6, 9, 15 NE: Yes.  In many instances. 9 AS: Yes.  NE: Yes.  He didn’t take an active role with… 6, 10 Lucas was a remarkable athlete. 19 He was like a superstar kid. 9, 12 He is so bright, beyond bright. 14 And, he got into remarkable schools and ended up at the University of Miami and he wanted to go there because they had a good business school. 8, 9, 12, 13 He was a super-star athlete, he couldn’t play nice in the sandbox, but he was recognized for his academics and athleticism. 9, 12, 19 He played for the Junior Olympics... but Raymond is an artist. 8, 9 And Lucas is an all-American kid.  AS: Right.  NE: I was a sports junkie [laughter].  And we were very tight, and we still are. 9 I am really Lucas’ go to.  I’m his universe.  I don’t want to be his universe. 13 I want to be his mother. 13 AS: Interesting. 9, 19 NE: But not his universe.  AS: Do you think you played a part in that? 8 NE: I think I did.  I don’t think I’d do is... play the same role to the degree which I had. 20 But, the habit has been formed. 17 AS: Can you back up and tell me when Lucas was born, what his birthday is? 19 NE: February 18, 1991.  NE: He started experimenting very early. 9, 11 AS: Yes, let’s move on to drugs. 14, 19 NE: You know, he was a risk taker. 6, 13, 14, 15 Lucas was a really big risk taker. 6, 8 I remember at a birthday party he was dared and the police showed up. 6, 7, 12, 19 Nobody knew why, and they said someone from this location called the police. 6, 7, 10, 12 The kids had dared Lucas to call the police and say there was an emergency, and he did [laughter]. 7, 12 I almost had a heart attack, but he said… 9 AS: Wow.  NE: He was a daring kid.  And he had a lot of anger. 17 A lot of anger. 17 We tried therapist after therapist. 6, 9, 10 AS: So beginning from…  AS: What point…  Four years old? 20 NE: People, therapists would say to me, you can’t break him. 18 He’s not breakable right now. 14, 18 AS: What did they mean by that? 16 they couldn’t get into him, into his heart and his head.  AS: They couldn’t reach him NE: They couldn’t reach him. 13 He had such a wall built from all this trauma.  The only thing that Lucas would say is that he felt really different: “Why me?” is still, or, “Why are you doing this to me?” 9, 16, 17 is still a line he uses to this day. 6, 9, 19 And, it was what he said from the minute he could talk. 10 “Why are you doing this to me, mommy?” with his bellyache. 15 AS: Oh, because, oh right. 14 NE: ...Why are you doing this to me after his surgery.  AS: ...his physical problems, he connected those with you, and with other people being in charge of his body and mind. 17, 18 And to this day, when he is blue, or even when I was putting him in rehab, “Why are you doing this to me?” 10, 15, 19 And how do you explain to a three year old that I tried, I said, “I tried to help you. 10, 13, 20 This isn’t to hurt you.”  I don’t think it registered. 9, 12 I’m sure it didn’t. 15 AS: That is fascinating.  So, he’s a daredevil, he’s ten, and then when did you notice that he was starting to experiment or… 9, 11, 12 NE: I think he started to smoke pot at 13 or 14. 9, 11 I didn’t realize it at the time. 14 And, I don’t want to say I thought it was cute, I didn’t think it was cute, but I thought it was acceptable. 11, 12, 13 NE: But, it was a big mistake. 6, 8, 9 I now know it was a terrible mistake. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 And I never had pills in the house. 6, 9, 15 I never took them. 15 AS: Back up.  What was a big mistake? 6, 8, 9 That you just let that slide? 9, 12, 19 NE: Yes.  That I was easy about that.  AS: What would you have done differently? 16, 17 I’m thinking in the context of our culture where marijuana is being legalized and the 60s generation.  NE: It wasn’t legal then.  AS: Right.  It wasn’t legal then.  But what would you do differently? 16, 17 NE: I wouldn’t drink in front of him the way I did. 6, 14, 16 I mean socially we had parties and a lot of people were drinking. 6, 14, 16, 17 That would not be so cool today for me today at all. 17, 19 I would tell him that pot is illegal, and you can’t smoke it, and you can do what you want when you are out of this house. 6, 9, 13 AS: So he would smoke at home? 19 NE: Not a lot, but I really put the kibosh on it. 10, 17 He was going out every night and I knew what he was doing. 6, 12, 19 He would come home stoned out of his mind. 9, 13, 19 AS: Right.  Tenth, eleventh [grade]. 15, 20 AS: Any other substances? 9 NE: Yes.  NE: In eleventh grade I called home, which I always did, and I asked the woman who took care him…. 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 Lucy.  And she said, “Lucas is in his room with a girl.” 7 And I said, “I want to talk to him” and he could barely talk. 5, 10, 13 He was slurring, I had never heard him like this. 15 And he said “I’m really tired” and I said, “Lucy, what is going on in that room. 7, 12 He’s not tired.” 12 And then I spoke to the girl. 19 And I said, “You are not to leave my house. 6, 9 I want to know what you both took.” 13, 14, 15 And they said nothing.  And I said, “Well here is the deal I’m in New York City and you are not to leave the house I’m calling the police.” 6, 7, 9, 13 Because at that point Lucas had fallen asleep. 7 I called the police, the ambulance showed up. 7 Both of them at this point were out.  They were driven to the hospital, I called my friend…. with the ambulance at my house. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 I was working.  I was able to get back to the Island. 8, 19 By the time I got to the hospital, a couple of my friends were there. 12, 18 Lucas had Xanax, alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana in his system. 8, 9 The girl who was really in big trouble, I don’t know how she was talking to me, the way she was at first because he was the one who sounded really bad. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 It was awful because when he woke up he was awful to me. 10 Disgusting. 9 And we had somebody come to the house then that wanted to take him away, you know, like… 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 AS: To a residential treatment? 9, 16 NE: And Lucas was leaving three weeks later because he had gotten to an exceptional program in London, for the summer, at a bank. 15, 19 And Raymond and I were very conflicted.  Raymond wanted to send him and I didn’t. 12, 13 AS: Send him where? 12 NE: To London.  Let him go to London.  AS: Instead of to treatment. 9, 16 NE: And he went to London.  AS: Was he 16 at this time?  NE: Eleventh grade, 16 I guess. 10, 15, 20 Then, it was twelfth grade. 20 He was never home. 15, 19 He was getting high all the time i didn’t know what he was doing. 8, 13, 14, 15 A week before he was leaving for college 8, 19 I got a call that he was in jail for a DWI. 7 He was completely stoned out when we showed up to court on Xanax or something. 7, 9, 14, 19 And I said to the judge….  I was separated at the time and, I don’t know what I was thinking, wishing, hoping, praying. 13, 14, 15 I couldn’t really grasp the seriousness of what was happening. 12, 13 I think I was in such disbelief and such shock.  I didn’t want to look. 13 AS: Tell me about your experience with other mothers around this time.  Did it shift or change over time? 8, 16 When he was small did you have a lot of interaction with other mothers? 10, 17 NE: I had my good friends. 12, 18 But I didn’t have interaction with people who were struggling the same way. 9, 10, 16 And honestly at this point everybody in the high school's mother looked at me like I was a really bad mom. 8, 9, 15, 16 a lot of the women in Long Island don’t work. 8, 17, 18 You know they [unclear] very wealthy men. 13, 14, 15 I worked a lot of hours. 11, 17 I wasn’t home a lot because I worked so much. 17, 18, 19 I had a tough, youngster as my child. 9, 14, 18 Lucas was a fighter.  So, I was so uncomfortable there and I didn’t trust people there to share my life with. 9, 11 Except one very good friend who is still a very good friend of mine. 9, 12 But it was tough. 18 It wasn’t until, really, Lucas’ freshman year of college that I got really involved because I had moved back to the city, saw my house. 6, 8, 9, 19, 20 I moved back to Manhattan and I got very involved in something called the Freedom Institute in New York. 7, 8, 9, 19 there was a parent’s group there for people whose children were using a lot of drugs. 10, 14, 16, 17 AS: Was he at school at this time? 8 NE: He was in college. 8 Almost kicked out supposedly. 6, 9 I mean, lots of problems in college with drugs. 5, 8, 14, 16, 17 He came home... that summer I found needles and steroids. 9, 13, 19 We reentered therapy, there was a lot of back and forth with this. 12, 17, 19 Lots of Xanax.  Back and forth. 19 But I promise, I promise I’m finished, I’m done.  AS: Oh, this is what happened. 12, 13 Get caught and... NE: ….over and over and over again.  And then I realized there was a lot of money missing. 14, 16, 17 A lot of money. 17 He had cashed a 5000 dollar check.  AS: ...took your checkbook?  NE: I had a check.  Somehow, I don’t even know how he cashed it but he did. 13, 14, 15 5000 dollars.  I had no idea at the time. 11 I had no idea until 2 months later. 8, 11 Money was always missing from my wallet and I’m going, “How much money did you spend today?” 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 Thousands of dollars he took.  More car accidents. 7 And this lasted a long time. 9 And the first month of his junior year and that was it. 8, 9, 20 I don't know I woke up. 13, 14, 15 Something had happened. 12, 13 I called an interventionist, I was in New York, I found somebody in Florida, just a therapist, and I read him Lucas’ bio because I had written a story. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15 And he said, “Nancy I’m good, but I’m not this good.”  He said he needs to get away. 13, 16 And I flew down the next day. 7, 19 Lucas thought we were going to therapy together. 11, 12 I had already called the school and pulled him out. 7, 8 I had already called where he was living and cancelled his lease. 6, 7 And, I don’t know, I said, “It is up to you but you don’t have a place to live and you aren't enrolled in school. 8, 11, 13, 14, 15 Take it or leave it.” 6 And that was the beginning.  AS: Is this what the therapist recommended that you do or did you do this kind of on your own? 6, 9, 12, 16, 17 The cancelling thing? 7 NE: It was coming.  That I did on my own but it was coming.  I was at the Freedom Institute, I was getting help myself in New York. 9, 13 I was talking to other parents. 10, 16 And at that point in time something awoke in me that said “he is going to die if you don’t do something.”  And of he went the next day. 19 AS: So he agreed.  NE: He agreed.  I had his friends call me: “We will watch over him, don’t do this.” 7, 12, 18 I said, “if you really care about Lucas, don’t call me again.” 7 And I hung up the phone. 7 I don’t know how I did it. 13, 14, 15 But that was the first, we had three more after that. 9 He went to four treatments. 6, 9, 16 So how long did he stay, he’s only 25 now, so he must have been what 20, 21 by this point? 9, 14 NE: I guess. 10 He went... he was there for 12 weeks.  He then went to sober living in Atlanta, from North Carolina to Atlanta, the day he showed up in sober living he bought drugs and left, hitchhiked back to Florida. 6, 7, 14, 19 AS: Wow.  NE: I told him to call me when he was ready to go back but not to show up in New York. 7, 19, 20 He called me intermittently, we would chat about nothing. 7, 15 He would say no, whatever, and then he showed up. 7 He hitchhiked to New York.  Oh no, somehow he kept me credit card number and bought himself a first class ticket to New York. 7, 9, 12, 13, 20 AS: Oh, first class. 9, 20 NE: First class and showed up at my door. 7, 9, 20 AS: [laughter].  AS: Did he go to treatment again after that? 9, 16 NE: Not immediately.  He stayed with friends in New York City. 5, 9, 12, 18 He got a job, passed his real estate license in New York. 9 Got a job and then I started seeing him. 9, 11 He needed to leave that apartment, he came back to my apartment, and then same thing. 6, 13, 19, 20 He just nodded off, was spending time in the bathroom. 7, 9, 12, 19 I called the police and had him kicked out. 7 I got the interventionist. 9 He didn’t show up.  I went to Breakthrough. 18 And then he agreed to go to treatment. 9, 16 He stayed at the house the night before he was leaving and i woke up at 1:30 in the morning and he could barely move but i saw him snorting opiates. 5, 6, 9, 19 How we got to the airport…. 8 If it wasn’t for this guardian angel…. 8 AS: Why the airport? 8 NE: He was flying to Florida.  AS: Oh, for treatment. 9, 16 NE: But he could barely move. 5 Screaming and cursing me out in the middle of Laguardia airport with the entire airport looking at me and him. 8 He would fall down, I mean it was... and a transit person saw me, a woman, and said I think you need help. 7, 13, 16 And got me through, I don't know how because he couldn't walk. 13, 14, 15 Got him on an early flight and had him sit first class with the stewardesses watching him. 9, 20 But it was a horror scene at the airport for two hours. 8, 11 He was there for 3 weeks, 3 months. 8 Unbeknownst to me, he was in touch with a criminal. 15 He showed up… 7 AS: While he was in treatment? 9, 16 What kind of a criminal, what do you mean? 16, 17 NE: I don't really know what kind of criminal, a really bad criminal. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Like a drug dealer? 13, 14 NE: A drug dealer or I think worse. 13, 14 Or a mafia or I’m not sure. 15 Showed up at my apartment at Christmas, I said you have two days to get back to Florida or you are on the streets. 9, 19, 20 He introduced me to this guy who said he wanted to meet me and I told the guy that he was bad news to his face. 6, 12, 13, 20 I told Lucas that if you left with him then he could write me off. 20 Lucas was driving out to Las Vegas with him to do something supposedly, and he left. 6, 14 And I got a phone call three days later. 7, 19 Lucas was picked up in Utah, on five federal accounts.  AS: Federal?  NE: Federal.  He was in jail.  I don’t even know what I was. 13, 14, 15 I called my sister, she got their friend who is a lawyer here, who said to me, “You gotta get him out of that jail, it is one of the worst jails in the country.” 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16 And I said, “He can’t come back to me, I can’t take him back, I can’t do it.” 6, 13, 19 And my sister and Eric, her husband, agreed while he…. 5, 9, 15 we got a lawyer from Utah to come to Minnesota. 13, 19 They took him in while we were waiting to get him into Hazelden.  He did not, was not guilty of any of the….  AS: Charges?  NE: Charges.  Except for possession which he agreed the Oxycontin in his pocket belonged to him.  Everything else in the trunk he had no idea was in there. 11 AS: And he was with the guy that was at your apartment? 20 NE: No, that guy flew to Utah, and he probably knew what was in his car, he was criminal. 6, 7, 12 AS: Oh, a different guy. 16, 17 Who had been in jail before for possession and dealing. 13 Lucas went to Hazelden and was there... but he wasn’t doing the work at all.  Dr. Lee, the head psychiatrist at Hazelden said, “He’s a tough kid Nancy, and he’s a danger.” 9, 18 He lived here, he worked here, and he relapsed real bad. 18 And he had never done heroin before. 15 I didn’t know he had done it, he did it twice, he didn't shoot it he snorted it, and he got violently ill actually. 10, 13, 14, 15 But I saw him and he was…  AS: He had been using pills?  NE: Big pill user, big oxycontin guy. 8, 9 NE: Oh, and in college he had a grand mal seizure from the Xanax and Adderall. 7, 8 I got a phone call and thought it was him. 7, 11, 12 I was walking in New York [to my] home and I said, “Hi Lu” and they said “It’s not Lucas, it is blah blah. 15, 19 We are waiting for the ambulance, we think he is breathing.  We don't know if he is breathing.” 13, 14, 15 Of course I flew to Florida the next day. 7, 19 He was disgusting then too. 9 When he would see you after these episodes?  And his brain fried from all the Xanax and the Adderall and it didn’t know whether to go up or down. 13, 14, 15 It was shortly after that, no, that was the end of his sophomore year. 8, 12, 16, 20 Then he had the summer and then the first month of his junior year. 8, 9, 20 I must sound like a lunatic right now. 10, 14 NE: I can’t, like what do you, like hello.  When I listen to it. 9, 15, 17 AS: Yeah, that’s true.  When we hear the list of things we have been through, there’s our trauma. 9, 16 It’s our trauma that’s…  that makes our brains do that I think. 16 Because not very often do we list these stories in a chronological way, because it’s too painful. 9, 12, 15, 16, 18 Right?  Our brains, our traumatized moments are trying to protect us from that. 13, 15, 16 NE: And you can’t really believe that you are living this. 6 It’s so true.  NE: If anybody would have ever said to me, “You ever worry about your child growing up and becoming an addict?” 11, 17 I would go “It’s not even on the radar, what are you talking about?” 10, 15 AS: Right.  NE: It would have never even occurred to me. 12, 15 AS: So he had a bad relapse after Hazelden? 18 NE: Yes and my sister… 5, 9 AS: Was he living with your sister at the time? 5, 6, 9 NE: No he had an apartment with friends here. 12, 18, 20 And his roommate came to me and said “We’ve got a problem.” 7, 19 That night my sister, Eric... 5, 9, 19 I spent the whole day and got somebody here, was trying to help us get him somewhere. 13, 16, 19 And Lisa, Eric, and Trevor, his roommate, went to the Mall of America where he was working and did an intervention. 7 He was pretty high, really high. 8, 18 AS: At work he was high? 8 The police had been involved with him a couple of time at the Mall Of America. 7 And he was on probation mind you, for two years. 10, 20 We got him to Fairview.  Or Alina?  I don’t remember which one.  Because he had to detox. 10 He was there for 48 hours and he tried to tell me, it was the next day, that he was ok now, but he left that night for California. 10, 11, 14, 19 AS: For treatment? 9, 16 NE: For treatment. 9, 16 He was there for 3 months. 8 AS: So by this point he has been in treatment for an entire year NE: 9, 16, 20 At different times. 16, 17, 18 A total of a year in treatment. 9, 16, 20 Right, that’s what I meant. 16 In totality.  NE: Right.  A year. 20 And he was in sober living for three and a half months. 6, 8, 20 And he’s not involved in a program.  He’s never been. 15 AS: Interesting. 9, 19 NE: Never.  But he’s been sober for 17 months. 6, 8 AS: And he was living on his own? 6 NE: With his roommate, someone who goes to Pepperdine [University] who doesn’t drink or smoke. 6, 7, 13, 14 He is actually home with his folks now in China. 10, 14, 19 He is Asian. 8 He got his real estate license in California and is working. 9 Lucas is a serious worker.  He is very driven. 7, 14 Oh man he really wants to be successful but he is very driven by the externals. 7, 11, 13, 14 But he is in therapy now. 14 I don’t know what kind of work he is doing there. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 But he is different. 16, 17 He has matured to a degree, he has. 12, 20 He is not the same person he was.  But I did for a long time talk about community. 10 I can’t write his story. 9 NE: But I live with that uncertainty, as we all do.  AS: Right.  AS: So, how do you live with that uncertainty?  NE: Well, I’m very engaged in my Wednesday night parent group. 10, 16, 19 It is true though that when your child gets sober after a certain point you start pulling back a little bit. 6, 9, 11, 19 I think part of that is I don’t want to hear all the bad stories so much anymore. 9, 13, 18 I want something else, you know, but I do go very regularly, I do go very regularly to that. 13, 14, 15 I read a lot, I read a lot. 17 I stay very connected to my women. 9, 18 To other mothers, I’m very connected to other mothers because that support has been a godsend, lifesaving for me. 10, 11, 12, 18 AS: And you found those other mothers in….  NE: Program.  AS: In programs.  NE: I mean the people that I met when Lucas was in Florida, Caron, three years ago, were still some of the... they live in Ohio, they live in Pennsylvania, but we are very connected. 5, 9, 16, 18, 20 AS: How about the Freedom Institute. 9 Did they use a twelve step program? 9, 12 And it was a very intimate program.  It was much more of an interaction. 10, 18 We really spoke, the mothers, really spoke. 19 AS: Just... NE: 9 With a therapist. 6, 9 It was led by a therapist. 6, 9 AS: And it was all women? 18 But, I found that more women go to these things. 16, 18 AS: Well, that’s true.  NE: A lot of times… 17, 18 Yeah, I mean there aren’t a lot of men who really, consistently come. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 But it was led by Michael Noth.  If you ever watched Sex and the City you know Mr. Big? 13, 14, 15, 17 Christopher Noth. 9, 10 This is his brother believe it or not. 5 He is an addiction specialist. 9 He ran this program at the Freedom Institute. 7, 9 AS: Interesting. 9, 19 So what, if you had to describe to someone what it is like to be, not the mother of Lucas, but the mother of an addict. 10 What is mothering addiction like? 10 NE: Well, in part, I don’t feel like I have been part of the living for a long time. 6, 16 There is an elephant in the room and a monkey on my back from the minute i wake up to the minute I go to sleep. 7, 19 It has really forced me to take a real hard look at how I show up every day for myself and in the world. 6, 11, 15, 19 I don't know if I would have done it the same way had I not been the parent of an addict. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 NE: I don’t know how I have contributed or if I have contributed. 13, 14, 15 But I certainly wanted to invest in understanding if what I was doing would continue to contribute, or not help Lucas. 9, 12, 13, 16 I didn’t know if changing me would change him, but I knew that if what I was doing was certainly not helping him than I wanted to change that. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 AS: Ok, right. 14 Is it about, then, taking a chance and looking at yourself?  NE: Totally.  AS: Regardless of what your addict child does?  NE: Totally.  Totally.  Because I knew that whatever I was doing, that may not be working I was doing to myself too and was doing in my relationships with men. 6, 12 AS: What are those things that you were doing and how do they relate to mothering and your relationships with men? 16 NE: I couldn’t tolerate the thought of Lucas being uncomfortable in any way. 11, 12, 16 AS: As a mother.  NE: As a mother.  So I gave in a lot. 17 A lot. 17 AS: Would you trace that back to his illness? 14, 19 Or would you say that even with the consequences of addiction, the illegal behavior, you didn’t want him to be uncomfortable then either? 13, 15 I did not want him to be uncomfortable that’s for sure, but not to the same degree. 13, 15, 20 I could tolerate him being uncomfortable more.  I could not tolerate what I felt like and I’m not even sure what that really was. 15, 17 I could not tolerate the insanity and I needed to sort of make it ok. 13, 16, 17 I needed to quiet it down, I needed to… 13 because part of the insanity was Lucas’ incessant craziness around all of this.  He was verbally abusive, he was loud, he was aggressive, he was lying, stealing, cheating, and I just wanted to attenuate that horror. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 I got, my anxiety was so high from all of the insanity, that I wanted to quiet that down. 8, 12, 13 I also didn’t really understand, I wasn’t disciplined enough. 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 I didn't have the discipline, to say I don't care how uncomfortable he is. 6, 7 It is better than being a drug addict. 14 And not that anything could ever be worse than being a drug addict. 14 But I thought if I did that maybe it would help him. 9, 11, 12, 13 I thought maybe, you know what, it is too Amy? 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I thought I would be able to get to him. 11, 12 I thought that I was going to be able to show him the light. 11, 12 Through all our love and sacrifice and... NE: I did. 13 AS: ….efforts.  NE: I thought that with enough effort, if I tried a little bit harder and a little bit harder, he would wake up. 10, 11, 12, 20 AS: How do you connect that to good mothering?  NE: Well…  AS: Do you know what I’m getting at? 13, 14, 15 NE: Maybe.  I think Karen…  was all about bad, you know, thrown to the gutter, thrown to the walls. 13, 14, 15 AS: Right.  NE: I never bought that philosophy. 7, 15 And I knew that if I didn’t continue to show up in Lucas’ life depending... and how I showed up, of course, the chances of it really would have gone off the deep end. 6, 7, 11, 12 It would have gone worse.  I knew that loving him was still really important. 6, 9, 12 I knew that I was not going to disown him. 6, 12 I did throw him out multiple times and I did say “I love you, call me when you are ready, but I can’t have you in my life or my house unless you go get help.” 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 18 And it’s been different at different times, but I never disregarded him. 15, 16, 17, 18 I never said “I hate you,” even though I did hate him. 15 “Don’t ever show up in my life because you’re you're out. 11 I can’t push you out of my life.” 11 Is that what you are getting at?  AS: yeah. 10 Because mothering…  NE: How do you go to bed at night having birthed a child… 19 For me, and now, you know, like, I don’t have one? 10, 13, 14, 15 I’m going to pretend they don’t exist? 9, 12, 15 AS: Right.  NE: It’s almost crazy making, Amy. 9, 16 For mothers.  Because, I was really conflicted.  Because having Lucas around made me crazy. 8, 16 And not having him around made me crazy. 8, 16 AS: [Laughter].  And then there is that constant uncertainty of their… 9 NE: Wellbeing.  AS: ...wellbeing and their actual death, impending death when they use the way that they use. 9, 10, 12, 16 NE: Right.  Right.  AS: Would you say it is more extreme than worrying mothers anyway? 11, 16 NE: I don’t think you can compare.  AS: Like a normal kind of worrying of a mother versus mothering an addict. 11, 16, 17 For you what was that like? 10 NE: I knew what it was like to watch my friends when their kids were first driving saying “I can’t sleep until they get the key in the door.” 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 I understand that. 9, 12, 16 That is normal worrying. 11 I couldn’t sleep because I didn’t know if my phone was going to ring and my son was going to be dead. 7, 13, 14, 15 AS: Right.  Exactly, that’s the difference. 10 NE: I, and this is every day, for years, and years, and years, I don’t live with that same thought every day now, but it’s not too far away. 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 And, if I call Lucas now and he doesn’t call me back for an hour, it is the first place I go. 7, 9, 11, 14 Why isn’t he responding?  Is he back there? 19 It is where I go immediately.  Where most normal mothers would go, “Oh, he’s probably out with his friends, he could be at a movie... 12, 18 AS: He’s 25, he’s an adult.  NE: I don’t think those thoughts 11, 12 I think oh my god what is happening. 10, 12, 13 It’s like the Sword of Damocles is over my head all the time.  Waiting to just [noise that connotes death]. 9, 12 AS: Right.  Would you say that you have, because one of the things I am thinking about is the double meaning of mothering addiction. 16 Right?  So there is mothering addiction or addicts, and then there is mothering addiction.  And I am wondering, in the program we talk about the twelve steps and our work and our own recovery and do you have... 9, 10, 12 have you ever pulled those apart at all in yourself thinking about because I have been traumatized by my sons addiction I can’t, I’m kind of addicted to mothering? 16, 17, 20 Have you ever…  We talk about being addicted to our addicts, but I want to take it a little bit out and think about that in terms of how does that relate to mothering? 6, 10, 13 NE: Well, I’m really aware that my mothering has really been about saving Lucas, or fixing Lucas. 16 And it’s only very recently that I am even able to say to Lucas when he’s got a problem, “What are you doing about that?” 15 AS: Versus…  NE: Well, “have you thought about this and have you thought about that and da da da da.” 11, 12 Coming up with fourteen different ways that he could look at it. 16, 17 So, in terms of mothering addiction, all I want to do is mother addiction to keep my addicted child away from addiction. 12, 13, 16 AS: Even though you know… 13, 14, 15 NE: Even though I know I can’t. 13, 14, 15 But, every mother, I think, that’s probably not accurate.  Many mothers I would bet, know that and would give up trying. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 The thought of really letting Lucas fly on his own really? 11, 12, 19 I’m not there yet.  AS: Does he know that? 13, 14, 15 NE: Yes.  I am proud to say that I have made enormous changes and strides in the last three years in my life. 6, 9, 11, 16, 20 Probably more than I have made in the last 59, 60 [years] because I really, in my heart, have not truly accepted that maybe there is just a little bit of me that can’t make a difference. 9, 12, 16, 20 AS: Because that is the mothering part.  NE: And that’s what brings me back to, that is the mothering part. 19 You know, I think people who have children who have problems can show up for them differently. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 They can offer their ideas or assistance. 9, 11 When it gets to addiction the message continuously is “Don’t do that, it’s not helpful.” 13 It is probably not helpful for mothers to do that when their kids reach a certain age. 13 I think the whole acceptance thing is still, hasn’t been taken completely. 6, 9, 14, 19 NE: I haven’t accepted…  I don’t really wake up to Lucas’ addiction until I call him and he’s not home and he doesn't call back. 7, 19 It’s like I’m right there, I can’t explain it. 14 I’m not separate from “Oh I wonder what he's doing?”  and I’m still mothering the addict. 9 So much less, but I’m still mothering my trauma. 9, 18 NE: That’s what I’m really mothering.  It’s like that feeling in an instant: where is he what doing? 9, 16 And it's like, “Okay Nancy, what do we need to do for you right now?” 10, 13, 14 AS: So you have shifted that? 8 NE: Yes.  AS: And through work, a lot of work. 17 NE: A lot of work. 17 What do you do recently?  NE: I have spoken at a couple Hazelden meetings. 13, 19 Do you mean in terms of relation to addiction? 16 NE: I’m actively engaged in therapy. 10 I’m in therapy.  A wonderful woman who I see weekly.  I got to lectures all the time whoever is speaking I listen, I participate, I talk about it all the time, I’m not reticent about it, I will tell anybody that I am the mother of an addict I don’t keep it secret. 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17 AS: When did you start doing that? 9, 11 NE: Immediately.  AS: His first time in treatment? 9, 16 When did the shift happen then, let’s go back a second. 8, 12, 19, 20 When did the shift happen between the mother who didn’t feel comfortable at school to you knowing that just being willing to say that? 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 That it was time to go to treatment? 9, 16 AS: Yes, well not just to send him to treatment but often we don’t admit to very many people when our kid first goes into treatment. 9, 12, 15, 16 So I’m wondering at what point were you willing to just put it all out there and tell people? 9, 10, 12 Did you have a moment… 13, 15 Did you live in shame and stigma? 9 NE: I still have shame. 9 I still have shame. 9 AS: But you don't feel the stigma? 9, 16 NE: I don’t pay attention to it. 15, 16 I don’t know what people say or think. 13, 14, 15 I mean I’m sure people maybe say what happened in that household. 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20 I’m sure they do. 15 I was willing to talk about it with my friends and my family immediately. 10, 12, 18 I was never quiet about it. 15 I was really willing to go really public with it.  The minute that the therapist in Florida said to me “I’m good Nancy, but I’m not that good” I went “Oh my god.” 6, 9, 10 And it was at that moment that I said, let it rip, Nancy. 13, 15, 19 AS: Interesting. 9, 19 But it wasn’t like people didn’t know. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Oh right. 14 But, yeah I was just looking for that moment when you realized… 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 NE: I think I realized it when I really saw the steroids, the needles. 9, 13, 14 But, I think I didn’t know enough because I think I would have done something. 13, 14, 15, 20 I think you do something when you really know. 13, 14, 15 When something becomes really clear to me there is no wavering. 13, 19 It was at that moment when I knew. 6, 12, 13, 15 It’s now, Nancy, that’s it. 14 It's now or never. 14, 15 It's do or die.  I had a do or die moment at that moment. 13, 15 And that’s when I started to engage. 9, 11 Oh, and then I was very involved in the Caron [unclear] parent meetings in New York. 10, 13, 16 Up until the day that I moved here. 8, 19 And the first thing I did was look for parent meetings. 9, 10, 13, 16 I was first going to the Hazelden meetings. 9, 13 I don’t know how I found… 13, 14, 15 AS: Our Nar-Anon group?  NE: Maybe through the internet.  So, I listen, I engage my friendships. 9, 12, 15, 17, 18 Many of them are around parents of addicts. 8, 10, 16 AS: It’s our community.  NE: It’s our life, really. 11 So, I mean, every day I do something related to this world. 15, 16, 19 Whether it is helping someone else, listening to someone’s story, reading something, watching something, showing up somewhere, speaking. 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17 AS: So you have done some speaking? 16 NE: I told my story, to a degree, in Hazelden and in New york. 6, 9, 20 AS: When you’ve gone back? 19 NE: No, when I was at Caron.  AS: Oh, okay.  NE: Up until Hazelden, because I was in New York when Lucas was in Hazelden.  I didn’t move out here until he was out of Hazelden.  NE: And then he went to California.  It’s not that I want to live… 13 People would say to me “Don't you want to get away from it, Nancy? 13, 16 As a mother.  Don't you want to start thinking about life differently?” 9, 11, 13, 16, 17 I don’t really.  I really don’t.  Because I would rather be able to show up for other people. 13 Other mothers.  AS: right. 14 Mothering other mothers through addiction.  AS: Through their child’s addiction.  NE: I am going to say I don’t know how half of us mothers are standing. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I really don’t.  I'm surprised more of us haven’t have nervous breakdowns, emotionally collapsed, ended up in the hospital with some horrific illness. 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 Cracked up, or became addicts. 5, 19 [Laughter]  I mean honestly, I don’t, I really don’t, Because once you know where you are you are in such a spiral. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 Your life is never the same as a mother. 11, 15 It's true.  NE: And I didn’t have other children so I don’t know what it would have been like to be the parent possibly of a second child that may not have been an addict. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 And what that would have looked like.  I only know mothering in relation to addiction. 13, 14, 15 AS: Would you say that you are more, well you already said this, nevermind. 15 NE: I am much less judgemental. 14, 18 AS: Okay.  Do you want to talk about the shame and judgment? 10, 13 NE: You know, I remember too as a younger woman and looking at somebody’s disastrous child and thinking what is happening in that house? 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 What is the mother doing what is the father doing? 5 I am too educated now to know that we are not responsible for that... it is complete addiction. 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 I don’t judge.  I may have thoughts and feelings if I’ve witnessed something, saying “I don’t think that’s serving their child.” 11, 12, 16 Out of all the education I’ve gotten. 10, 15 But, if I see a child who is down and out my immediate thought next is not who is their mother and father? 5, 11, 12 AS: Right.  NE: I often admit people think that about me though. 11, 12, 15 And it’s hard. 11 It’s hard you know I’m not a Facebooker anyway but you look at all these blissful youngsters graduating, getting married, blah blah. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: In your son’s peer group, yeah. 10 NE: And it is very piercing.  It really is.  But, I have to tell you Amy, and I don’t know if any other mother feels this way, but I am a big believer that we will get exactly what we ask for in this lifetime. 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 And I know in the deepest part of me that Lucas and I were meant to be together because we both had a lot to learn. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 He has been my biggest teacher. 8, 9, 11 My biggest teacher and my best teacher because I’ve had great teachers and I’m like “Ok yeah I don’t need to learn that.” 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 I needed to learn about me and parenting and how to show up and be educated on this whole thing too. 10, 12, 13, 16 And that was because of Lucas.  AS: Do you consider yourself a good mother?  NE: I’m very judgemental about myself. 14 I could not answer easily.  Yes, I would consider myself a good mother.  I can’t say that affirmatively.  I can say that I have given my best to Lucas, possibly some of my worst. 6, 9 I think if Lucas would sit down and really think about it that he would say he was very loved by me and is very loved by me and that I was his biggest champion. 8, 9, 11, 13 He will remind me of all the gifts I gave him.  But, if I were to take an aerial view, I have a lot of would’ve should’ve could’ve. 6, 17 Even the healthiest parents. 9, 10, 14, 16 AS: Oh yeah, no matter who your kids are. 10, 20 NE: I feel proud to have showed up this way now. 7, 14, 16 So I think my parenting has really gotten better. 10, 15, 16 AS: Would you say you were the mother you aspired to be when he was little? 12 NE: Often. 15 Often. 15 Not all the time, but often. 12, 15 This thing called… 7 There was something on TV yesterday about mother’s and sons too. 9, 14, 19 But I think it is this thing called Mothers and Children. 7, 14 It’s different. 16, 17 I mean that’s the big joke and one of the first words out of their mouth: my mother. 8, 9, 16 I think the rivers go so deep for all of us, every single one of us with our own mothers. 15 And I think the same is true for being a parent. 10, 16 AS: Yeah, with our children. 14 NE: With our children. 14 AS: This is really wonderful.  NE: Was it helpful? 13 Do you have any other thing that you want to share? 13 NE: No, we just need to keep on keeping on. 9, 11, 12, 13 Keep doing the work.  Because like anything else you can learn something and then unlearn it very quickly. 9, 12 AS: And then have to learn it again. 12 NE: And this really is a process.  A never ending process. 12, 15 I think the biggest secret for mothers is to learn how to love themselves as much as they love their children. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 AS: Right.  NE: I think that is the big crucial piece that we are… 8 because it is easy to not do that as a person but it is harder to do that I think as a mother who has a child who is suffering. 11 AS: One thing we didn’t touch on was, at what point did you learn that addiction was a disease, or did you hear that, or what did you think about that when you first heard it. 9, 12, 15 What was your process?  NE: Here is the thing.  I have a problem with that.  And I just bought this book called Unbroken Brain. 5, 7, 9, 12 I don't know if you have heard about it. 13, 14, 15 I think there are so many factors that go into addiction. 10 But, I have not adopted the philosophy or the belief that addiction is solely a disease and that is the problem. 8 I think it has components of that, like everything else.  But, Unbroken Brain, and I’ll be very brief. 5 [Unclear] put it on our website actually. 10, 13 She was an addict, a woman who has been studying addiction for years and years and years and years. 9, 20 She believes that addiction is a mental illness in adolescence. 14 And that almost, if not all, addicts, and I haven’t started the book yet, and people who become addicts lives had some serious trauma in them. 9, 11, 13, 19 Could have been medical intervention, could have been crazy household, could have been sexual abuse, could have been physical abuse, could have been verbal abuse. 6, 9, 14, 16, 20 the way in which their brains embraced whatever their experience was and what their perception of that, and when they got high for the first time the relief that their brain felt from the trauma and that it is a very learned behavior. 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 Eventually you physically become addicted, no question. 6, 7, 9, 13, 19 I believe more along the lines of her. 6 And, I think it has a component that there are just some people who can take opiates for two months because they have a broken pelvis and then it is over and they don’t think about it again. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 Then there is another person who takes them with the same surgery and they become a full blown addict. 6, 11, 13, 19 I do believe it is about brain chemistry a lot. 9, 16, 17 I have always had trouble with this whole disease model. 15, 16, 17 AS: Good, I’m glad I asked you that. 10 NE: I am very timid sharing that a lot because I think people judge me for that, you know. 13, 14, 15, 17 [laughter]  AS: Well there is just a shift happening right now. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 There’s so much... 18 NE: And the truth is none of us know. 13, 14, 15 AS: That’s right 14 NE: We don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: That’s right. 14 NE: We also don't know why it is happening to so many people. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Right.  NE: I mean it’s hard for me to believe that thousands and thousands and thousands of youngsters have this same disease. 9, 11, 14, 16 Like why are all of our generations’ kids have this disease called addiction? 7 AS: Right if it’s a disease.  NE: If it’s a disease.  Did we drink too much coffee when we were pregnant? 6, 14, 18 I mean I don’t know. 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: Right, that’s interesting. 9, 19 NE: Because really, I mean not that there aren’t a lot of addicts. 16, 17 But now 50 year old women are becoming addicts. 14, 18, 20 There is a big thing now for women in their fifties. 8, 14, 18 Menopause, divorces, loss of money, vitality, feelings of womanliness, losing your period, the whole thing. 6, 9, 16 Drinking more and more.  Taking pills.  Did they have a disease?  AS: It is more complex is what you are saying. 11 That’s interesting. 9, 19 NE: I mean they’ve drinking their whole lives, and suddenly they have a disease they haven't had the last thirty years? 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 But I do know we are supposed to be doing something about it. 6, 13, 14, 15 Because that is what the world is telling us. 15 AS: Yeah, clearly.  NE: Because that is why it shows up this way. 16 I don’t know if you heard, if you were at the meeting, but [unclear] and [unclear] went to the meeting and there was Federal and State people there. 13, 14, 15 Minnesota has the fifth lowest population of addicts who have died of overdoses in the country. 9, 11, 15, 16 Lowest. 9 I thought we were the second highest here. 8, 9, 11, 12, 20 AS: Wow, no it’s...  NE: Fifth lowest of all the states, and ten people a month in Hennepin county alone are dying of an overdose. 7, 8, 9, 15, 19 That’s why how can mothers forget?  How do we forget?  AS: Right.  Because it is around us all the time.  NE: People are sober and then they are dead. 6 And that is what mother’s live with.  AS: Yes.  Well, at least that is what this mother lives with. 9 AS: Thank you nancy.  NE: You’re welcome. 13, 19 Was this helpful, was this what you wanted? 12, 13 AS: Yes.  You didn’t have a sense of something else or..? 17 AS: No, it was perfect. "
"8","Danielson_Jamison","Carson Garder Narrator Amy Sullivan Sue Purchase Interviewers January 11th, 2019 Tribal Health Department Building White Earth Nation, Minnesota Carson Gardner -CG Amy Sullivan -AS Sue Purchase -SP CG: Well the PhD behind your name means you have learned how to learn! 6, 12, 16, 17 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 AS: I've learned how to learn CG: And that's what it means. 12, 16, 17 It means a lot of other things I'm sure, but I know it means that. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: That's right. 14 [Pause] 9 AS: First, before we got officially started I wanted to see if you had any questions. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 I have a release form that I'm needing you to read and take a look at before we get started. 6, 9, 11, 13, 17 CG: Sure.  I hope that... 10 My only question is not a question. 6, 9 It's a request. 9 I hope that you will communicate with me and let me know when your book comes out and I will buy it. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Oh yes, of course I will. 14 Everyone who I'm interviewing is gonna know about that. 6, 13, 14, 15 Mostly this is a typical release form that just says that I can use what is said and spoken here in my other work and venues. 9, 12, 17, 19 The actual interview itself will belong to you. 6, 10 [Long pause. 9 Papers shuffling.]  AS: And Sue, I would say that if you have a question or you wanna participate I'm gonna introduce you as part of the conversation because you're in the room. 6, 7, 9, 12 SP: Cool.  SP: Okay.  CG: I'm gonna initial the review the content thing, not because I'm paranoid but I'm an old family doctor. 7, 15, 18, 20 AS: I put that thing in on my own after another doctor asked me. 10 CG: Yes it's not, it's not that I distrust you. 9 AS: Yeah, yeah. 10 CG: One of the reasons is we have a big push right now here on White Earth land to try to develop some ethical forewarning for people who come in here to do acts of artistic expression. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19 You may have heard of or seen, The Seventh Fire video? 15 It's a video that a couple of citizens here linked up with an LA producer/director. 14 And, they made a video and they kind of let people know they were here, but there was no supervision and no ethical contact. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 And, it turned out that the choice of the director and producer were to present things out of context in a very hurtful way. 7, 14, 16, 17, 19 That really hurt the community of Pine Point [unclear].  I think I did hear about this... CG: ...and our citizens.  And so, I don't recommend that you watch it. 12 Except, that yes in a way I do. 14, 16 It talks about issues you're concerned about AS: What was it called—the seven fires? 7, 10, 14, 15 CG: It's called The Seventh Fire. 7, 15 And yes, you should watch it. 14 But, when you watch it you need to understand that's what should not be done, because it hurt a lot of people here. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 And, the tribal council was upset and the community council at Pine Point was upset, and they tried to contact the producer and director, and they sort of blew it all off. 10, 11, 14, 17, 19 And said, ""We can do whatever the 'eff' we want."" 13 So, there's been a groundswell movement here to try to develop some ethical way to instruct interviewers, writers, filmographers... about the ethics of presenting a contextually respectful story about White Earth when it's done. 6, 7, 8, 9, 16 And, that doesn't mean we don't want you to tell the truth. 13, 16 The basic ideas in that video about drug abuse issues and generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences certainly are grounded in fact. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 They do happen, but the whole video presented things out of context in a quite hurtful way. 7, 12, 16 And the two individuals, neither of whom live here anymore and didn’t at the time that was made, are felt to have opportunistically taken advantage of their having lived here to make that video. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17 So, that isn't why you're here, and it may not have anything directly to do, but I have to tell you that if you haven't seen The Seventh Fire video you should look at it, because it deals with issues that you are going to deal with in your own way, and your creative product. 13, 14, 15, 16 But, just know that the way that whole thing was done was exactly not what the tribal council of the community council and our communities wanted. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 So, that's why I mention it, and that's why I'm signing initialing this.  AS: Right.  No, I appreciate that so much. 18 SP: I think the actors... didn't, you are Clinton tell me before? 10 Was Natalie Portman that was in that movie.  I haven't looked for it yet, I had it written down. 15 She was a producer, and of course her work is wonderful.  And so, nobody's gonna condemn her for her dramatic work and everything. 14 But the way the video was made was not acceptable and no one here was given any chance to ethically offer any standards or to review it or anything. 6, 7, 9, 12, 16 Natalie Portman no one's gonna say anything but good about her work as a dramatic professional. 14, 20 So... but she put the money up and produced it and it wasn't as it should have been done. 10 In our opinion.  That's our opinion but it's a solid opinion.  AS: Your address would be perfect since we had such a hard time finding you! 11, 14 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 SP: Clinton says he's supposed to be done by twelve thirty. 6 I was told two interviews, but they had way more come for the interviews. 6, 13, 16, 19, 20 AS: Okay.  [Long Pause] 9 CG: There, as you can see I'm a storyteller. 9 It's hard for me to get anything done without telling a story. 9, 11 AS: Thank you.  CG: I'm just not as dramatic about it as some. 9, 12, 14 AS: That's okay.  So, do you have any questions for me before we get started? 6, 9, 11 Like, who I am or what I'm doing.  Want me to tell you a little bit about how I got...?  CG: You know what, I would love to hear a little more about that. 13, 14, 15 You know what your time schedule is. 13, 14, 15 I'll leave it up to you, but yeah I like to hear people's stories. 6, 9, 10, 18 AS: So I, have a...worked on my Masters and my PhD while I was also raising my two daughters. 5, 9 My PhD is from the University of Illinois Chicago. 13 My oldest daughter struggled with addiction issues that no one would call addiction 'cuz she was a teenager. 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 20 And, when she was... and, I was also pursuing one of my areas of interests is history of medicine. 9, 19 And then, history of childhood. 9, 11 And then, women's history. 9, 18 So those are kind of my areas in U.S. history. 9, 16, 17 I also have background in Native American history, particularly twentieth century. 8, 9, 18, 19 And I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  And so, I've been in my life very much, my life's been very enriched by my association and being surrounded by Native culture. 8, 11, 18 CG: Other than obvious need to connect with Native communities, do you have other connections other than professional connections with Native communities? 13, 20 AS: No, just you know personal things in my life. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Cherokee nation.  CG: Do you have published work on the history of medicine and Native American history? 9 AS: No, not yet.  I'd like to know about those articles if you have them I would read them. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Sure, sure. 15 Well I wrote my dissertation about the Girl Scouts in Oklahoma who experienced a very intense tragedy in 1977 when three girls were assaulted and murdered at camp, outside of Tulsa near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. 8, 12, 15 Yeah, so I wrote about that.  So my... CG: Our community understands such things. 9, 12, 16 AS: Yeah, so where I'm coming.... where my work has come from has been looking at trauma, and PTSD, and how communities heal from crisis. 13, 19 CG: We have a lot of efforts going on in many of our divisions, and departments, and our community councils, and private individuals who are faith connected or traditional spiritual healers and teachers. 11, 14, 17, 18 So a lot of healing work going on all the time here. 17 So a lot of the women that were at the camp at that time were never diagnosed, and never had a chance to heal from that trauma. 8, 15, 17, 18 And, I was a child at the camp at the time. 8 I was ten. 15 And so, my insider status to that very—what became a very closed and tight-knit community because of the fear of that tragedy, you know, forever staining Girl Scouting in Oklahoma. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 It was very... it was my personal experience that allowed people to trust me thirty years later to talk about what happened. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 20 So, parallel to that is my work with the opioid epidemic because my oldest daughter ended up overdosing on heroin in our home before I, when I had never known she was ever possibly using any such thing. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 To me, as a child of the seventies that's not anything people would use. 9, 15 [Laughs].  Right?  So, her overdose, near death experience, coma, surgeries, and recovery. 15 In all ways—physical, spiritual, everything—really intrigued me. 16, 17 CG: How is she doing now? 14 AS: She is great. 11 She has a three and a half year old daughter, she's married, and she's about to start back at the University of Minnesota. 5, 9, 11, 13, 19, 20 Give her a hug for me.  You don't have to tell her that it comes from me, but give her a hug from me. 6, 13, 19 AS: [Laughs]  She's very, very much an inspiration. 18 CG: Good.  AS: But, what shocked me, as a very attentive, educated, mother, was that this could've happened in my house. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 And so I started, seeking out, just from my own personal knowledge. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 How did this happen? 12 What happened? 12, 13 And then someone said to me, who was working at a methadone clinic, he said, ""You know you should really write about this. 13, 14, 15 You should really talk to people."" 10 'Cuz he said, ""Things are changing, and in how we're treating... the opioid epidemic is changing treatment. 9, 16, 18 It would be great, because you do oral history, if you could collect these stories."" 9, 11, 18 CG: Yes, it's a perfect match.  I've done about seventy interviews in the last two years. 6, 9, 15, 20 And in all, in all... many different venues, all kinds of different people. 16, 17 What I have been particularly sensitive about, I came to the harm reduction, the summit two years ago. 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 Not last year. 9, 20 I met Sue two years ago. 5, 20 CG: Meeting  Sue will change your life 11, 16 [All laugh].  AS: Apparently! 10, 16 Yeah, apparently. 10, 16, 18 SP: Thank you!  AS: So we, I interviewed her. 6 And then, have been able to bring her on to do interviews as well. 6 CG: Good.  I don't know Sue personally, but I know Clinton personally. 13, 14, 15, 16 And, Clinton speaks superlatively highly of Sue as a pioneer in harm reduction life saving in Minnesota. 8, 11, 12 AS: Yeah, he called her the elder birch bark. 5, 7 SP: Yeah, he called me an elder birch tree of harm reduction! 7, 12 [Sullivan Purchase laughing]. 5 AS: So, I'm gonna make you a little patch that says that. 16 So anyway, that's just kind of how this got started. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 And, yeah. 10 I'm really honored to be here. 12 I also want to say that the chapter that I'm gonna work on around tribal nations and the opioid epidemic, I come to that with extreme awareness and sensitivity about portrayals and I'm very versed in my own history, where my people come from. 9, 13, 19 How I enter the story, my vantage point. 9 So, I just want you to know, that I'm so honored to be able to be here doing this. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I will treat this with the most sacred kind of intellect that I can bring forward. 9, 12, 16, 17 CG: Good, well you'll sell more books if you make us look twisted and evil. 7, 9, 16 [Sullivan laughs].  But, you will help more lives if you make us look human. 13, 16 AS: Well that's exactly what I'm doing CG: And, you can ask Sue, but I suspect Sue and certainly Clinton will tell you that some of the harm reduction we're doing here is pioneering work on Native lands, if not everywhere in Minnesota. 8, 9, 10, 12 AS: I know that. 13, 14, 15 CG: So, we're praying and working like hell to help save lives here, and to help offer people real healing of the underlying problems. 13 AS: Yeah, and well that's exactly why I wanna devote a chapter to it. 10 Because I got a sense from the harm reduction summit, that things were happening in ways that were transformative and that there were lessons and things being learned here that could be applied. 7, 12, 13, 16, 17 CG: Your problem is, you really need to interview about 350 people here, and you're not gonna get to do it. 6, 13 You and Sue.  AS: I know, that is my problem! 13, 14, 15 CG: You're gonna end up being selective, and by being selective you won't go crazy, but you'll also miss some powerful stories. 9, 12, 15, 16, 18 AS: Right, but, if anyone you know of is willing, anyone else is willing to be interviewed we are open to it. 6, 13, 14, 15, 17 We have cars. 7 CG: I think the best shot is Clinton and his team. 9, 15 Helping you Sue, to make connection with those who will want to speak their stories. 9, 13, 16, 18 So, that's gonna be your best shot. 9, 15 But, you know if, if you were an artificial intelligence and gonna be around for a thousand years you could interview almost everybody on the res here, cuz almost everybody would have a story of some kind. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 To connect to the pain and wounds and to the reach for healing. 13 AS: Right.  So, that said.  [Coughs].  Excuse me. 9 We should get started [coughing]. 9, 11 My sinus, I'm not sick.  My sinuses had a, took a beating last night at the hotel. 9, 19 [Official Start Time: 15:40]  AS: So, this is Amy Sullivan.  I'm here with Sue Purchase, and Dr. Carson Gardner.  And we are at the White Earth Nation public health...? 14 CG: Tribal health department building. 14 AS: Tribal health department building. 14 In White Earth, Minnesota.  It's January 11th, 2019.  Carson just to get started, I wanted to ask you to just state your name and say that you give permission for this interview to take place. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 CG: My name is Carson Gardner, and I am an employee here of the White Earth tribal health department. 6, 14 And, I give my permission for the interview to take place. 6, 11 And, I have obtained the agreement and support from the White Earth Nation research review board to allow me to do this interview. 5, 6 The only stipulation is, I will not be able to give specific identifying information on White Earth citizens. 6, 9, 17 AS: Thank you.  So, one of the things that we like to start off with in oral history, as I talked to you about is... get your, to look at, to get the whole story of a person as much as is possible in this short time we have. 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 But, if you could start with your childhood, where you were born, your birth date if you're willing to share it, and just talk a little bit about your childhood. 9, 10, 11, 12 CG: Sure.  I was born on July 1st, 1952 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. 9 My mother was forty years old when I was born, my father was fifty-six when I was born. 5, 20 It was my father's second marriage. 5, 20 They had been married for thirteen years, unable to have a child. 20 And, I came along and it was a great joy for them, for one year. 11, 19, 20 And, when I was a year old my father fell off a sixteen foot ladder, and he was terminally injured. 5, 12, 15, 20 It took him two years to die. 20 My mother was heartbroken. 5 Never really recovered from the grief of my father's death. 5, 12 My mother developed cancer when I was seven and died when I was nine. 16 I was a food stamp kid. 9 We had not enough money. 20 My mother got a job working as a secretary in a bank so she could get health insurance. 7, 14 And she worked for a year with a breast lump until she could get health insurance, and got health insurance, went to the doctor, and it was too late. 7, 9, 14, 20 She died a year later with brain metastases and lung metastases. 5, 9, 20 And we had no money and the insurance ran out. 7 And so, they put my mother in an open state mental hospital cuz it was the only hospital that would take her. 6, 9, 10, 14, 17 And when she died the duty nurse called our home, and my grandmother answered the phone and fainted dead away. 7, 12, 16, 19 I picked up the phone and heard the nurse saying, ""Mrs. Gardner is dead. 7, 11, 15 What do you want us to do with her body?"" 13 So yeah, adverse childhood experiences. 10, 11 My grandmother took over my care when I was nine and she was nearly 80, and she lived to be almost 98. 7, 9 We lived in the projects in East Minneapolis —across the river near the University of Minnesota. 9, 13 I can remember calling cops because there was a stabbing in front of our house. 6, 7, 9 You know, kinda rough, but a lot of good too. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 My grandmother decided she wanted to show me that she was serious about my staying in school and getting an education. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 So, with her eighth grade education she enrolled in some extension courses at the University of Minnesota. 10, 13, 15, 20 She completed a year of college, you know she didn't graduate, but everybody in the neighborhood thought that was pretty cool that Jenny Carson completed a year of college in her nineties. 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 So, that's kind of the context of my story. 9, 16, 17 AS: Were you named after her? 5, 6 CG: My mother named me her maiden name as my first name. 5, 6, 9 My name is Carson Timothy Gardner. 6 And, I don't know if you wanna know this stuff, but... 9, 13, 14, 15 CG: My mother prayed to her spirit helper, named Timothy for thirteen years begging to have a child. 5, 6, 13, 20 And so, my middle name is Timothy. 6, 8 And she quit praying to the spirit helper, specifically after my birth. 7, 13 So, I've always found that to be somewhat interesting. 9, 16, 17, 19 Many other spin-off stories. 9, 18 But, you know darn, nobody's ever asked me to tell my story. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 So you're gonna get some stuff like this that may not be pertinent, but it will help you understand who I am. 9, 12, 13, 16 AS: It's beautiful. 6 That's right. 14 Would Timothy be a Saint Timothy?  Do you know? 13, 14, 15 CG: I don't think so.  I think Timothy would be more like a minomoni [unclear] duke—a traditional spiritual helper, even though my mother was not avowedly or publicly involved in any traditional Anishinaabe spirituality. 13, 15 The other thing that I suppose I'm gonna tell you is important to me, because it gives me at least some connection here to the Anishinaabe community. 6, 9 My grandfather, Joseph Evan Carson, was the first white child born in Bemidji. 5, 7, 9 His father and Uncle ran Carson Brothers Trading Post. 5, 7, 9 And there's a whole story there that should be told. 9, 20 AS: Okay.  CG: But, when my grandfather was a preschool aged child, Shaynowishkung, if you know Bemidji you know about the statue in Bemidji of Shaynowishkung, Chief Bemidji. 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 You know that story? 9, 13, 14, 15 He's across from Paul Bunyan!  I didn't know his name or that there's a story, but I know exactly.. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 CG: Shaynowishkung. 14 There's a new statue, a beautiful bronze statue, done by a Montana, actually I think he's from Washington… 6, 9, 10 but, he lives in Montana.  Sculptor, that was commissioned by the city of Bemidji, after much argument and debate and years of planning. 18, 20 So, if you wanna know the story of the Anishinaabe in Northern Minnesota you should drive by the Shaynowishkung statue some time. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 But, Shaynowishkung was an Anishinaabe man who lost his wife and some of his children and moved to the wilderness around what became Bemidji. 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19 And, he lived there and tried to put his life together after grieving the death of his Anishinaabe wife, and white people began moving to the area and he began helping them. 10, 11, 13 Even though ultimately it resulted in him losing his own land and home and being displaced and everything. 8, 11, 19 He just kept helping white settlers. 9, 12, 13, 17 And he was well loved for hat. 13 That's why there's' a statue of him there in Bemidji, because he helped, he helped white people and they remember that. 9, 13, 16 So, he came into Carson Brothers Trading Post often for routine supplies. 9, 12, 15, 19 And, one day he came in, and as usual set his musket up against the wall. 17, 19 And, my grandfather walked over and grabbed the musket and of course those guns were loaded. 5, 7, 17 And, Shaynowishkung came over and just read my grandpa the Riot Act [confirm, unclear what “Act” Gardner is referencing], and my grandpa cried. 7, 9, 12, 14, 19 And, Shaynowishkung probably knelt down, I don't know, but he comforted my grandfather and that began a friendship. 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 And, what happened eventually is, not my great-grandfather but his brother, my great uncle, married one of Shaynowishkung's daughters—Mary. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 And so, we married into the Shaynowishkung family. 14, 18 And, Evan Carson, my grandfather, stayed good friends with Shaynowishkung through his life. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 He was obviously much older than my grandfather. 5, 7, 18, 20 But, when Shaynowishkung died he had a Western will. 9, 14 And in his will he willed that musket to my grandfather. 5, 7 SP: [Sullivan laughing] 5 Oh, that's beautiful! 6 CG: So, and it was on display in Bemidji for many years—lent by my uncle. 20 He died, and my oldest cousin, Nule Carson [confirm name], decided he wanted it back. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 So, my cousin has it now. 5, 14 But, I am connected to Leech Lake, and really to White Earth by that story. 9, 18 And so, you wanted me to tell you about my past and so I'm telling you about my past. 9, 12, 13 That story is known to a few people in the Beltrami County Historical Society and to my own family. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 And a couple, two and a half months ago, my wife Gale and I, and my cousin Nule and his wife Barb—who drove on short notice all the way from Kalispell, Montana— got to meet Donny Hedbird [confirm name], the great great grandson of Shaynowishkung. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20 And, got to meet a couple from Texas who are from Mary and Elle Carson [confirm name], heritage—descendents of Shaynowishkung. 6, 12, 13, 14 So, we all got together and had supper in Bemidji.  Met them for the first time. 9 That's history and that's oral stories. 9, 18 So, it isn't directly related to your book but now you know more about who I am. 13, 14, 15 AS: Exactly, thank you. 10, 13 So, what was your path to becoming a medical doctor then? 14 CG: I don't ever remember a time when I didn't talk about wanting to be a doctor and a minister. 9, 10, 13 That's what I said as a little kid, and it used to amuse my mother. 9 My grandmother took it seriously. 7, 15 And, that's just how it was. 9, 12 But, I'm quite sure that it had to do with my parents and their health problems. 10, 14, 15, 16 I don't remember my father. 5 The only thing that I remember about my father is the smell of his pipe tobacco, he was a pipe smoker. 5 Not, a traditional Anishinaabe pipe smoker, a Western pipe smoker. 9 So, I remember only the smell of his pipe tobacco and I don't remember anything about his health problems. 14 But, my aunt Grace was a legal secretary in Saint Paul, and she got pro bono help from her employer to try to get us some benefits since my father was millwright. 5, 13, 14, 16 Fell off the ladder at work when he was working, in a situation that called into question responsibility of his employer. 6, 7, 9, 13 Anyway, it didn't work out. 16 But when I got older I got to read that. 5, 20 My family got no benefits. 14, 18 And I'm sure, I probably as a kid heard my mother and grandmother talk in distress about how they were gonna survive. 7, 9, 10, 15 And, my mother's breast cancer metastasis was a horrible thing. 5, 9, 17 I do remember as an eight and a half year old kid, standing by my mother's wheelchair in our little rented home in Eden Valley, Minnesota and watching her have a seizure. 6, 9, 12, 16, 19, 20 And, she would come out of the seizure, look at me, and cry. 13, 19 She couldn't talk, but she would just cry. 9, 10, 12 And I remember being very angry at her doctor.  Not specifically, not knowing him, not anything. 7, 13, 14, 15 But, just angry at the doctor for letting my mother die, and I'm sure that there was some anger in me. 9, 12, 15, 19 And, I'm sure I decided that I was gonna grow up and become a doctor and fix everything and cure cancer and make the world better. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 I grew up and became a doctor and spent, I've spent over forty years now, and I realize that you can't fix everything and that bad stuff does happen. 5, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 And that, that doctor probably did everything he could to help my mother at a time when there was no Affordable Care Act and there was very little support system. 8, 9, 13 And that, my mother was lucky to have anywhere to go like the Anoka State Hospital.  No one ignored her and no one did anything wrong. 12 But, I'm sure that my experience as a child, and knowing about my parents' fates, probably gave me an exceptionally strong motivation to not give up and to succeed. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I went through a church school system, the seventh adventist system. 8, 9, 15, 20 My grandmother became an adventist when I was eleven, and I joined the adventist church along with her. 5, 7, 9, 15, 19 I am no longer a seventh adventist because of my own personal experience of noting administrators in that church, promulgate subtly the idea that if people didn't believe like adventists they would not go to heaven. 9, 11, 15, 16, 20 And, you know, there are a lot of wonderful adventist people, I'm not telling you the story to condemn that, but I left that particular church's politics and ideology for that reason. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 But, they have a very strong commitment to health care based on compassion, based on Christian values, based on the beatitudes, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. 7, 8, 9, 14 And so, I went to boarding school. 5, 8 I went to adventist boarding school right on through college and medical school because I got accepted at the seventh adventist medical school Loma Linda University in Southern California, and I did my training there. 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 And then, I came back and did my residency in family practice at Hennepin County medical center in Minneapolis. 9, 10, 14, 18, 19 And then, my wife Gail and I achieved my dream of becoming a family doctor in rural Northern Minnesota. 14, 18 We moved to Park Rapids. 8 We spent eighteen years there, but due to a number of things, I reached the point where I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe history. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 And, I discovered that I have actually a few drops of Anishinaabe blood. 10, 11, 12, 14 The old joke about nose bleed Indians, I mean no disrespect, I have to tell it on myself. 8, 16, 20 I try to avoid fist fights 'cuz if I get punched in the nose I'm gonna lose my Anishinaabe blood in the first thirty seconds. 9, 11, 16, 20 But I do have some blood, it's from Bowantan [unclear] from the Salto [unclear] 11, 13 Anishinaabe —the Sioux band, the Sioux Saint Marie band. 15 And so, I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe heritage, and the stories about marrying into Shaynowishkung's family. 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 And so, on relatively short notice I made the decision and Gale supported me, and we left our job in Park Rapids and came here. 16, 19 And we've been here for twenty years, and every day has been a joy. 19, 20 Because I can joke with people, and then talk with them about spiritual things, and then talk with them about tribal health business, all in the same conversation as perfectly fine. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 So, I've found a lot of what I was looking for. 17 Learned a lot about Anishinaabe spirituality and also been able to help. 13, 17 And so, that's my medical background in being here. 8, 14, 19 AS: That's fantastic. 9 Did you always wanna be a family doctor? 16, 17, 18 CG: I went through some struggles my last year of medical school. 8, 9, 14, 20 I thought about becoming a pathologist, but I'm red green color blind so that pretty much checks off looking at microscope slides. 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 I thought about becoming a psychiatrist. 9, 11, 12 Forty years, I've learned that basically family doctors are unlicensed psychiatrists in much of what we do. 7, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 20 So, I also thought about being a pediatrician, but in family practice you get to take care of kids and families. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18 So, ultimately I decided for family practice. 10, 12, 18 But those other thoughts certainly went through my mind in the intense last year of medical school trying to make some decision and to find some match. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20 AS: Did you ever have interest, or I mean did you ever have experience with addiction or a personal connection? 9, 16, 19 I wanted to kinda transition to... did you have experiences in your life that have later influenced you? 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 CG: Not during my childhood. 11 My grandmother... certainly as a historian you must know about Carrie Nation? 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: Mhm, yes! 14 [Laughing]  I teach about it!  CG: When I was in third grade I watched my grandmother who weighed a hundred bounds soaking wet, bodily throw a drunken 200 pound man out of our apartment who had wandered into the apartment. 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20 So, my grandmother was abused by her step-father when she was a teenager back in the late 1800s. 5, 7, 9, 12, 19 And, my grandmother made it clear to me when she said that at age 13 if she had been strong enough and tall enough to get her step-father's gun off its mount on the mantle, she would've killed him. 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20 So, that's a pretty harsh thing to say. 18 My grandmother wasn't a violent person. 7 She was a devout Christian, and believed in forgiveness and everything. 6, 8, 9 But she also told me that story. 9, 20 So, he was an alcoholic. 5 And, people in the throws of active alcoholism like other drug abuse, can do things they would never do if they were in their right mind and with good judgment and impulse control and everything. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 So, that's my family connection, but not in my immediate family. 18 As I said, we ended up living in the projects from the time I was middle school aged until the time I went away to college, and I still lived there came home from college. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19 So, we saw the effects of chemical abuse in the families that were our neighbors and friends in the projects. 9, 12, 18 So, we saw that, but my grandmother was a very gentle woman who was iron fisted when it came to anything related to alcohol abuse, or any other drug abuse. 7, 9, 11, 14, 19 And, white [unclear] people didn't mess with my grandma. 7 And didn't try to argue with her about that. 16 So, on anything else she was very tolerant, understanding, and even often very progressive in many of her views. 7, 9, 12, 15, 16 But, do not talk with her about any kind of drug abuse being okay. 10, 14, 16, 17 Don't even try! 15, 16 So, that's my background. 8, 19 And I began to of course in high school learn about kids who got kicked out of boarding school for going out and getting drunk. 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 And then, in college learned about kids who got into all kinds of trouble. 8, 12, 16, 17 I was always involved in the seventh adventist church school system and they also had no tolerance whatsoever. 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 And didn't often, you know, in the sixties and seventies didn't often offer much harm-reduction focused sympathy on young people who were abusing drugs. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 They just got booted. 9, 12 So that was, you know, kind of a harsh and fairly one-sided view, but that was my growing up view. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 And then when I got to medical school all of a sudden, my relatively protected childhood was ended as I got involved in clinical work, taking care of patients, and studying the science of substance abuse, and the damages it could do. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 AS: Do you have children? 14 CG: No, my wife and I were never able to have children. 14, 15 And it was a spiritual and emotional ethical debate for us. 13 But what we ended up deciding to do was number one, to throw our lives into our professions. 12 My wife's a dietician, and she did dietetic consulting in all the years in Park Rapids. 8, 20 And then, did dietetic consulting here.  And as a historian, you should know this little fact that is not trivial. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 My wife, Gail Gardner, developed the diabetes Bingo game. 16 which is now very popular, both in places like Oklahoma and other places where there are reservations, and also places where there aren't reservations. 11, 14, 17 She and her assistant Paulie Nyson [confirm name] developed a game based on bingo that teaches good diabetes self-care. 6, 7, 9, 16 It was developed right here about sixteen seventeen years ago. 14, 16, 20 And, a printing company out of Fargo Moorhead area, printed up the games. 10 And, a number of them have sold. 20 My wife hasn't made any money on it, it belongs to the tribe since she developed it as an employee, but she helped to develop diabetes bingo. 13, 16 So, we threw our lives into our work, and also we decided we would rescue big dogs. 8, 10, 12, 15 I always wanted a big dog. 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 When I was in medical school, one of my classmates and his wife went away for holidays. 8, 14, 16, 19, 20 Gail and I couldn't afford to do that.  And they asked us to take care of their Saint Bernard Golden Retriever mix—Ginger. 6, 7, 10, 15, 20 A wonderful gentle dog. 10, 11 And we weren't going anywhere, so we took care of Ginger. 7 And I took her for walks in the neighborhood when I hadn't been out in the neighborhood very often cuz I was busy studying. 8, 9, 12, 15 And, one of the first walks we were taking, out from an unfenced yard that was about a foot and a half higher than the sidewalk, came a full sized Great Dane running right up. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20 And, I, you know my life passed before my eyes. 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 And then I thought, my god Fred will kill me. 7, 10, 11, 12 This dog is gonna kill me and then kill Ginger, and if I wasn't dead already Fred'll kill me when he got back. 7, 10, 12, 19 And the dog came up to me and... 10, 19 Pardon me, I respect your space, but this is [acting out the scene]... 10 I'm a storyteller! 9 The dog came up to me just like that and went [licking sound]. 9, 10, 12, 19 [All laughing]. 5 And as I was laughing, and wiping my face off, I said to myself, ""Damn I'm gonna have a Great Dane someday."" 5, 19 So, after we moved to Park Rapids, in 1981, a few years later we adopted our first Great Dane, Chuckie. 8, 9, 20 Who was a mis-breed of the breeder.  He had a slightly short jaw, and the breeder couldn't sell him for big money, and so we adopted him for less than big money. 7, 8, 16 And he died at three and half of osteosarcoma. 9, 20 Great Danes get spinal cancer.  He died of osteosarcoma Christmas week, when he was three years old. 9, 20 And Gail and I, amidst oceans of tears and anger against fate, said we'd never adopt another dog. 10, 15 And one month later we got a call from a couple in Osage: ""We heard your Great Dane died. 7, 8, 15 We have a Great Dane named Sarah. 5, 6 And, she's been running the neighbor's cattle. 7, 10, 11 We're farmers too.  We're not willing to fence her.  Our neighbor came over and just said, 'You know folks, I love you guys, you're wonderful neighbors. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 But next time Sarah runs my cattle I'm getting out my deer rifle.' 10, 11 And so, would you take Sarah?"" 6 And Gail and I looked at each other.  We had said never again will we have a dog, we're not gonna go through that kind of grief again. 10, 15, 16, 17 So, we took Sarah, and we've kept it up through the years. 20 So we've had eight or nine Great Danes and other breeds.  And we also had cats for a while. 10 But, Sarah was our general.  Sarah had a higher IQ than me, I'm sure. 8, 15 Not that mine's that high, but hers was well-higher. 8, 15 And she, if we had let her run free, she would've organized all the dogs in the neighborhood into an army. 8, 10, 11, 12, 19 And she was the general.  Our neighbor was the Becker County canine officer deputy, and he kept his canine at home. 10, 19 And when the dog wasn't working, it got to run free. 10, 11 And the day I brought Sarah home, she was indignant about being on a leash, and she and I were trying to work that out. 9, 16, 18, 19 And the neighbor's dog came running over to introduce himself, and Sarah yanked the leash out of my hand, turned around, and my god.... 7, 8, 10, 11, 19 Sigourney  Weaver would have been less terrified of Alien than the snarl that Sarah offered that dog! 10, 12, 15 And she chased the police dog back into his yard. 7, 10, 19 And then she turned to me and looked at me like, ""Well let's get this over with."" 10, 19 So, I picked up the leash and started walking down the road, and that dog came back out again. 9, 10, 11, 15, 19 You know, head down, tail down, crouched, and tried to walk up to Sarah and make amends. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 And she turned around snarled and chased him back into his yard, and he damn well never into our yard again! 13, 15, 19 So that was, Sarah, our second Great Dane. 20 And she was wonderful.  She lived almost thirteen years, which is exceptionally long for a Great Dane. 9, 20 And she enriched our life with laughter and tears and wonder at her brilliance and her organization, and that's how we became dog rescuers. 5, 8, 10, 11, 19 And we specialized in Great Danes for years. 20 But, our last great dane a few year ago, Reggie, had congenital hypothyroidism. 9, 11, 20 And by the time I convinced the vet to do a thyroid profile on him, ""Listen Gardner. 9, 15 You're not a vet!  You're a family doctor. 18 Your problem is you feed him too much."" 18 He weighed 279 pounds.  And when, the vet finally said, ""Well, bleep!  I guess you were right and put him on thyroid medicine."" 10, 14 He got down to a svelte 212 pounds.  But, when he developed serious heart failure at five years of age, Gail and I couldn't lift him anymore. 13, 16, 20 so we, decided we better rescue smaller dogs. 10, 12 So, we now have a couple of Australian Shepherd Great Pyrenees mix dogs, that weigh about 60 pounds each. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 And they have double merle syndrome, which renders them partially blind and deaf. 12, 14 And we got them from a shelter in Southern Minnesota, who got a call from a shelter in Oklahoma that was a kill shelter, that said: [Feigning a Southern accent] 7 ""Would y'all send someone down and get these dogs, we don't wanna kill 'em they're such nice dogs."" 7, 10, 12 And so, Gail and I always tease people up here and say, you know our dogs bark with an Oklahoma accent. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 But they came to a Minnesota non-kill shelter. 7, 19 We found out about them on the internet and went down and got em.  I'm sorry, but you're a historian, and you like hearing stories and I'm a story teller, so! 8, 9, 10, 18 [All laughing] 5 Okay, so we should move on.  CG: Yeah, those are our children. 14 But we should move on.  AS: That's great, that's fantastic. 9, 11 So, why don't we talk about at what point... 10 well why don't you tell me what your job here is exactly. 10 And, if it's changed. 16 Like, what did you start here, and what are you now? 9, 11, 14 CG: My job now is, I am the medical director of the tribal health department. 14 That is not the top position. 13 My boss is Pat Butler, RN-BSN-PHN.  She was the long time director of public health nursing here. 14 And when the predecessor director of health services left, she took over that job. 12, 14 So, she's my boss.  But, I'm the medical director. 14 And I'm the medical director of the White Earth ambulance service, a rural ambulance service that does 700-900 runs a year. 11, 14, 20 Far, rural, long-run times. 11, 18 Difficult, low-budget, lot of challenges, and a lot of overdose calls. 7, 10, 15, 17 And, a couple of years ago I became the chair of the White Earth research review board. 5, 12, 19, 20 The White Earth tribal council, now called the reservation business committee, decided in the wake of Havasupai Incident, do you know about that? 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: No. CG: You should read about that.  It isn't about drug abuse, but it's about abuse of power. 9, 14, 15 A researcher from Arizona State University got the agreement of the Havasupai Nation, that live in the Grand Canyon, to allow blood to be drawn to do genetic research on diabetes. 7, 11, 13, 14 And, it was all fine and good, and the consents were signed. 7, 14 But, several years after the study was done the lead researcher allowed frozen blood samples to be used by other researchers who were doing anthropologic, sociologic research. 9, 11, 20 And ultimately, that was used to put forth the theory that the Havasupai people came across on the land bridge from Asia. 8, 9, 10, 19 And the Havasupai people were pissed as hell!  That's against traditional, spiritual, historical viewpoint of how we originated on Turtle Island. 8, 9 And, they didn't even tell the Havasupai anything about that. 15 But, a research review board member of the Navajo research review board, was reading and discovered this article and said, ""How did they get any Indian people to agree to that?"" 5, 8, 11, 12 And followed through, and found out what had happened. 12, 13 She told the Havasupai tribal council, and they took Arizona State University to court and won the case. 11, 13, 20 Got a substantial monetary damage from Arizona State, and it was very embarrassing. 5, 9 Arizona State administration felt terrible. 9, 15, 17 That's not what they set out to do, or how they wanted to do it. 12, 13, 17 But, it all just happened by the taking the easiest route. 9, 12, 13 And so, in the wake of that, our tribal council decided we better have a research review board and institutional review board. 5, 9, 11, 12 And so, it was established two years ago. 9, 20 And, I became a member, and I got voted in as the chair. 5, 12, 19 And so, we're dong that work here now too. 14 So that will inform you about my extra caution. 17 So that's what I do now. 14 But I came here in 1999, my first act as an employee after being hired by the IHS clinic, was to call in sick [laughs]. 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 You should laugh at that!  CG: Gail and I moved directly from Park Rapids to here, no time off. 8 We did our furniture moving and everything evenings and weekends. 12, 15, 19 And, two days before I was to finish work there and start work here, I ruptured two disks in my back. 9, 11, 12, 19 My left leg went paralyzed and I ended up with an emergency neuro surgery. 7, 12 So, I called in sick. 7 But, and I was here to work in a week cuz I was scared I'd lose my job. 5, 7, 11, 12 And now, I have to tell you another story. 9, 14 You can just slap me up when you're ready [Sullivan laughs] 9, 12 But, some historian should know this story. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 Poozy Hags [Confirm name], Clifford Hags. 6 You know about tribal nicknames? 6, 8, 13, 14, 15 AS: Mhm, mhm.  CG: Clifford was the director of evening housekeeping services at the clinic. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 And the week I started, my leg was still paralyzed! 9, 11 Took months for it to get better after the surgery. 8 And I was dragging my shoe, and I had the kind of shoe that would make marks on the floor. 14, 16, 17 And Poozy did the evening floor cleaning. 15 And so, like the third day of work at the IHS clinic, I was sitting in my office doing insurance forms and paperwork, like family doctors do in the evening. 7, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 And, in came this very Indian man. 8, 19 And he said, ""You must be Gardner.""  And I stood up with my cane and limp, and said, ""Yes. 9 I'm Carson Gardner.  Nice to meet you!"" 13 And he didn't even put his hand out. 10, 15 He looked at me and he said, ""You're making marks on my floor.  You come out here and I'll show 'em to you. 13, 19 We'll get along just fine if you quit making marks on my floor."" 9, 12, 14 And I had no idea that Poozy is one of the biggest jokers on the res, and the biggest story-tellers. 8, 9, 11 And you know, if I'd have known him, I would've laughed and said, ""Ah c'mon Pooz."" 10, 13, 14, 15 But, he took me out, showed me the marks, and said, ""You go buy another pair of shoes!"" 7 And so, I told Gail when I got home, and you know, I took it very seriously. 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 I'm an OCD kind of a guy, and so I was very worreid about it. 16, 17 So we went to Fargo, went to Penny's, I bought a pair of shoes, and I insisted to the sales person that I put them on, get up, and find the nearest linoleum on the store and rub my shoes. 5, 7, 9, 10, 19 And my wife Gail tells me that while I was doing that, the salesman turned to her and said, ""Does he do stuff like this often?"" 9, 12, 15, 19 And Gail said ""Yeah, all them time.""  So, I bought the shoes, I came back, I showed Poozy, and then he got a big grin, and said, ""Ah, we're gonna get along great!"" 7, 8, 11, 19 And Poozy became my secret agent here. 5, 19 He was the evening housekeeping lead who did the floors. 6, 9, 11, 12, 15 But he would come in, and we would trade stories during his break. 9, 13, 18, 19 And I'm sitting there anyway, not being paid for doing paperwork. 13, 16 So, he would come in and tell me a story. 9, 13, 19 But then, he'd say, ""By the way Gardner, one of these days ‘so-and-so's’ gonna come in for some little thing, and you need to know that they're having trouble with a heroin habit. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And you should see if you can figure out a way, don't tell 'em I told you, but see if you can figure out a way to get 'em to talk about it, ‘cuz they need help."" 10, 13, 16, 20 So all the years I worked at IHS, Pooz was my secret agent in the community. 20 He was as much a healer as any of the rest of us, snd maybe more so. 9, 18, 19 ‘Cuz he could get away with that, and to hell with HIPAA and all that. 16 Don't every tell anybody I said that.  You may have to erase that.  There may need to be a small blank on the... 13 AS: You just mean it… 9, 12, 16 you mean it, in a kind of philosophical way. 16, 17 CG: So, that's what I did first. 9 That's what I did first, from '99 until 2011, and then I retired. 9, 12, 19 And my retirement lasted three months and I got hired here, and I've been working here ever since. 8, 9, 12 And I will probably keep on working for any number of reasons. 12 Probably the most important one is a statement that I only heard verbalized recently, but I realize rapidly became my own personal unstated prayer: ""Creator help me to live in a way today that will make my ancestors proud."" 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I just heard that recently, but actually a lot of the stuff we all do here, is based on that. 9, 10, 12, 15, 17 My boss, Pat Butler, in department head meetings, again and again says to us, ""Just remember people, we have to do things twice as well here as anybody else to be considered equal."" 9, 12, 13, 16 And so, if you look at the Western administrative records, you'll see that White Earth has developed many best practices pilot programs. 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17 And it's because of people like my boss Pat Butler, who believe that, yes we do have to do things twice as well as everybody else to be considered equal, so let's damn well get busy and do it that way! 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 AS: That's great. 11 So, you mentioned you, that you know that Poozy told you about someone with a heroin habit. 13, 14, 15, 20 Was that the first time you had heard about it here? 9, 15 And then, when did it start kind of becoming part of what people were talking about? 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 CG: When I interviewed here, which was just a couple of weeks before I was hired, I called Howard Hayes, the medical director of the IHS clinic. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 When I decided ethically and spiritually it was time for me to investigate working on an Indian reservation, I called him, he answered. 7, 8, 9, 12 And I said, ""Hi Dr. Hayes, my name's Carson Gardner. 6, 14 I'm a family doctor in Park Rapids, not too far from you. 18 And I was wondering if you had any job.  And he said, ""When do you wanna start?'"" 9, 11 So, I went for an interview, and he took me around—nice man. 6, 8 But he said, when we did the interview, he took me into the Pine Point, little Pine Point clinic, he took me to NATUA, and in the car he said, ""You know Carson. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 The Anishinaabe cure will test you. 9 Just the first day someone will come in and want narcotic pain medicines, and you need to know what your own personal ethics and values are on that issue because we do have problems with that here. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And, I'm not telling you you shouldn't prescribe pain medicine, but you need to know that you will be tested. 9, 13, 14, 15 People will always come to the new doctor here. 6, 13, 16, 17, 19 People are struggling with substance abuse and will always look for the easiest source. 9, 16, 17 Howard said, ""I'm not criticizing our citizens, I love them, I'm here too. 13 But, you will need to develop your own ethics and your own values and your own decision making process on that because some people will push you very hard to get narcotics."" 11, 13, 15, 16 And so, I guess, in my interview a few weeks before I started here that's what I learned. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17 And then I came and started seeing patients and saw that it was true. 9, 11, 19 And, I was probably one of the most conservative prescribers of narcotic pain medicine. 15 But, after a few years we all realized we needed to take a more aggressive step in standardizing our approach. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 So, we developed a chronic pain management program at White Earth in the early twenty-first century, where we all sat on a committee, all of us medical prescribers at the clinic. 9, 14, 16 And, we developed a pain contract. 10, 16 And, we developed policy and procedure. 16 And, we developed random drug testing policies. 7, 9, 14, 16 And, we developed policies on what to do if a person tested positive, and policies on what would be the criteria for second chances, and what would be criteria for release from the chronic pain management program and everything. 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 So, we did that here, and we certainly used resources. 9 You know, other places, we looked at their policies and prodcueres as templates. 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 But we did that in the early twenty-first century here, because we, like many other IHS clinics, had to use locums doctors to fill in. 9 And the locums doctor from elsewhere might have a whole different view on prescribing... 16, 17 AS: What's a locums doctor?  CG: Locum tenans doctors. 15 That's I guess latin, and I haven't looked it up, but it's a doctor who specializes in doing fill-in work. 10 All they ever do is fill in for other clinics.  They go and work two months at White Earth, and then they have two months off to go sailing, and then they go and work two months at Pine Ridge, and then they go work two months in Oklahoma, and... AS: Is it mostly through IHS? 8, 9 AS: Oh, okay, but it can be anywhere, but?  CG: Yeah, it could be anywhere...  AS: But once you're in that network.  CG: I'm just using Native American examples. 6, 9, 12 But there are locums doctors that that's their own choice. 17 They want to work very hard for a few months, and then have several months off to not do medical stuff. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14 And, you know, a busy family doctor finds that attractive sometimes. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 But, locum doctors have no context, and they have their own set of rules. 12, 17 They can come into an IHS clinic, and if there is no policy on it, they will do whatever they think is right. 13, 14, 19 And, it isn't always necessarily conducive to managing responsible opioid prescribing. 16, 17 And so, the chronic pain management program helped to better standardize the policies and procedures for locums physicians. 8, 9, 12, 13, 16 And of course, while we were doing that Clinton and his team were being formed. 17 And I won't tell Clinton's story, but he started consulting here from a harm reduction program in the Moorhead area. 9, 11, 12 This is Clinton's home, but he was working there in harm reduction, came here to help out, and he will tell you the story about how there was a Hepatitis C cluster here in our community that sort of was the eye opener that helped community leaders to realize we needed a harm reduction program. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 And, he'll tell you the story on that, but harm reduction was being started on that basis at the same time we were starting a chronic pain management program policy and procedure at the clinic. 9, 11, 12 AS: And this is around 2011? 8 CG: Clinton will tell you, it was, I don't remember what year. 20 But probably, in the early 2000s.  Sue, do you remember?  SP: Maybe around 2006, 2007?  Somewhere in there.  CG: Yep.  And so, it was probably about that same time.  Maybe even 2005... when we started developing our chronic pain management program. 9, 11, 15, 16 I retired in 2011, but the chronic pain management program had been going for a number of years there prior to that. 12, 19, 20 AS: So, you retired for a few months and then... CG: I retired in 2011. 8, 12, 19 AS: And then you came back? 19 CG: And, I got hired here by Monty Fox who was the director of health services at that time. 12, 14 So, that's why I joke about my retirement lasting three months. 8, 9 AS: Right.  So it was still like, 2011? 9, 10 CG: But I became a desk jockey. 5, 19 I hung up my stethoscope in 2011, and that was painful. 9 I still see old patients here, who say, ""Damnit Gardner, why don't you come back and take care of patients at the clinic?"" 6, 7, 9, 13, 19, 20 And I always smile, and acknowledge the joys of clinical practice, but I have been a desk jockey here and administrative physician since 2011. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: So, besides the chronic pain management plan, how's the public health and the medical system here approached the opioid epidemic? 8, 9, 14 Could you describe how it first started, and what it became? 5, 9, 11, 19 CG: A couple of things happened to raise my consciousness, and I regret that I didn't get to meet Sue at that time. 12, 13, 16 But Sue, undoubtably was working with Clinton at that time.  Clinton and his harm reduction team, Minus Bala, Karen, Keller, and not Rachel Lawfranir. 7, 12 [confirm names] 6 She's on the team now, but she wasn't on the team then. 14 But, the harm reduction core team brought Sarah Gordon here. 9, 12, 18 Do you know Sarah Gordon? 13, 14, 15 CG: Yeah, I hope so. 10 If you haven't interviewed her, you pardon my french, damn well better! 6, 13 AS: I'm going to [laughs], I'm going to.  CG: You better, you better!  AS: She's on my list. 9 CG: Because, she came up here to talk about harm reduction, and specifically to talk to medical providers. 7, 10, 12, 14, 19 I was one of the few who attended that talk, but she showed the video produced by anypositivechange.org, you should know about them they're out of Chicago. 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Do you know them? 13, 14, 15 AS: Mhm.  CG: Have you seen their video?  AS: No. CG: You should watch it, it's on their website. 13 I can tell you exactly what happened. 10, 12, 13 I had been very conflicted.  Not about ethics, and responsibility, and compassionate care, but about how far I should participate in harm reduction. 7, 12 But in that video that's still available on their website—I checked it a year ago—they're still showing it. 9, 13, 20 They use primarily people suffering from active substance abuse, and not actors in that video. 9, 10 And, one of the scenes in the video, a young woman is sitting—calm, well-dressed, alert—and saying ""I got clean and sober, but my man is still doing heroin. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14 And, I want him to quit, but you can't quit for anybody else. 13 And so, I carry a naloxone kit, because if he's dead he can't recover, can he?"" 7 And the video goes [mimics ""swooshing"" sound effect], to black. 10 And I couldn't sleep that night. 7, 19 And I thought really hard about that. 11, 12 And I thought, okay, I have been a compassionate family doctor, and I support good care, but I haven't been active in harm reduction. 7, 10, 11, 12, 18 And, it's probably time I get active in harm reduction. 10, 12 And so, it was Sarah Gordon, and Clinton, and Mina, and Karen, and that video—which you should watch—that was the turning point for me. 19 That's when I got involved saying to Clinton, what can I do to help? 11, 13 And shortly after that, one of our child welfare workers gave a talk at a community forum meeting, and said, ""I just want you guys to know that last year we had twenty babies from White Earth that had narcotic withdrawal syndrome, and we damn well need to do something about it."" 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 And, it was a shock in the community, and we had more meetings and said you know we need a treatment program specialized to helping our pregnant moms who are struggling with substance abuse, but can we do that? 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 And so, medical minded people like me sat down and thought about it, and did our OCD thing, and wrote out timelines and flowsheets and said, at a meeting in 2013, late 2013, ""Well I think we can put this together. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 We can do it, but it'll take us about a year, maybe a year and a half to have it together."" 6, 9, 20 And, Tara Mason, our tribal secretary treasurer, was at that meeting. 13, 15 And she stood up, and said, ""Okay, it's December now. 9, 14 I want this program open and taking clients in June."" 13, 17 And then she walked out of the room. 7, 17 And then we looked at each other and said, ""Well hell!  Nobody told us we couldn't do it!"" 20 So we were open by June taking clients. 17 And the mom's program is still open, and it's won Minnesota state awards, and it's won some national awards. 9, 15, 17 And so, that was the other thing, they asked me to put together a debate position on the negative side 'cuz no one would do that. 10, 13 They had some nurse practitioners come up from the Twin Cities and present the positive position: 7, 10, 13, 14, 19 This is why we should have subaxone treatment program for pregnant women on the White Earth reservation. 9, 16, 18 Well, we need someone to argue the other option so Gardner why don't you put it together. 10, 13 That's your job.  And I, put together a lot of information, decided I really couldn't argue the negative position, 'cuz it needed to be done. 10, 12, 13, 17 So, that was the first active role. 9, 10 And then in 2014, my boss Pat Butler said to me, ""You know we have a lot of overdoses. 13, 14, 15, 17 You know that because you're the ambulance medical director. 13, 14, 15 We need to start teaching nalaxone rescue."" 9, 11, 13 ""Well, I uhm, uh, uhm..."" ""Put together a program!  I want to get going here in the next few months."" 8, 13 So, in early 2014, and I guess the motivation was I had told her that the Minnesota legislature was reviewing what became Steve's Law and about to pass it. 5, 10, 19, 20 And that's when she said, ""We need to be teaching nalaxone rescue. 13 We don't have to have state support, we're a sovereign nation, but it'll be good to have state support, so why don't you put it together?"" 9, 10 So, the ambulance manager  Devon Green and I, put together a teaching program. 10 And I went back to Pat, and to the tribal council and said, ""You know, we're having overdoses. 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 And you know, we're attending funerals here. 12, 13, 14, 15 And so, we need to do this."" 13 And that was at the time the Minnesota legislature, I think they passed it as of July 1st, but they weren't gonna implement it until late August or early September. 9 And I, I said to Pat, ""You know it's silly, I've got the program ready. 13, 14, 15 We could start teaching. 9, 11 No experience, but we could start teaching. 9, 11 The sooner we do it the better, but according to Minnesota legislature we can't start."" 9, 11 And Pat said, ""Let me talk to the tribal council."" 10, 11 And, like three days later they passed a resolution saying that we should start teaching and giving out nalaxone immediately, which for me, I'm not licensed by the tribe I'm licensed by the state of Minnesota. 9, 11, 19 And I thought, holy hell. 11, 12 If I do this, and some legislator gets pissed at me, they could yank my license, or have the Minnesota health department sanction me. 14 And I, talked to Pat about it. 10, 11 We looked at each other, and we said, well they wouldn't dare!  The tribal council would raise such a racism argument that they would get backed against the wall. 11, 19 So, we went ahead.  We started teaching nalaxone rescue here a month before the actual implementation of Steve's Law. 8, 9, 10, 11 Of course, it worked out fine. 14 And we met, Clinton, Matt, and I, eventually Matt Luxey Read Holtum [unclear] and you know, made that connection and all the wonderful good that has been able to happen here. 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 So, I haven't compiled the statistics for the last month, but as of a couple of months ago, and believe me there is no spiritual implication for this, so don't even think about spinning that. 8, 9, 10, 15 But, as of a couple months ago, we had trained 666 ""nalaxoners."" 8 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 And better than that, and that's ambulance service training, but about a year and half ago the ambulance service and harm reduction said, we really should get together and do team teaching. 12, 20 The ambulance service has done classes for groups of employees, and for behavioral health therapy group members. 8, 14, 20 And harm reduction has done individual one-on-one counseling, so ten to fifteen minute individual training. 12 Gardner's class and hour and a half with all the science and ""Oh god... 10, 20 Garner's gonna talk again."" 10 But, actually people like it. 10 They become the ambassadors to correct misconceptions about, ""Oh overdose? 12, 13, 15, 19 Give em, shoot up milk!""  Or, ""Throw 'em in the snowbank!"" 14 Or, ""Put 'em in the shower!""  Or, you know, our students from our group classes get to help correct misconceptions, and say, ""No, no. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 You have to see if they don't respond to pain.  You have to breath for 'em, cuz nalaxone won't work if they aren't breathing.  And then you have to give 'em the nalaxone, and then you have to keep breathing for 'em 'til they wake up. 6, 12 And this is how long it'll take, and this is what you can expect."" 6 So, the ambulance service and our tribal first responders, who are the security officers at the casino, have a 120 nalaxone saves since the summer of 2014, 120! 9 And twenty of them are the first responders at the casino. 9 They're basic emergency medical responders, not EMTs, not paramedics. 7, 14 But, they came to me in the fall of 2014 and said, ""Doc, we'd like to get in on this too. 10, 19 We see overdoses at the casino."" 15 So, I'm gonna guess that with twenty saves, that first responder group is probably one of the premier first responder groups in Minnesota for nalaxone rescue. 9, 10 But they came to me, to us! 19 To Devon Green and me and said, ""Will you train us?  We wanna get started."" 9, 11 So, but then you'll talk to Clinton and he'll explain to you, that Clinton and I, and Mina, and Karen, and Rachel Lawfrenir, estimate that for every one save, the ambulance has, citizen harm reduction trained rescuers have done three of four, maybe five. 9, 10, 12 So, we're pretty solid on estimating our 120, is probably 480. 9, 18 So, we probably have pretty close to 500 saves, and with all the individual trainings that harm reduction has done we have probably trained, we have certainly trained over 2500 nalaxone rescuers on White Earth reservation. 9, 12, 18 And, ""Isn't that enough Doc?"" 20 We will not stop, I like the quote from the director of the Baltimore Maryland health department who said, ""My goal is to have everyone over twelve years of age who lives in the city of Baltimore trained as a nalaxone rescuer."" 8, 9, 10, 14, 20 So, our goal is, we'll stop training when we have a year of no overdoses at all. 9, 10, 15, 20 We'll consider stopping training, we might not even stop then, but we ain't stopping training until we have a whole calendar year of not one single overdose on White Earth land. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20 And you know what, the truth of the matter is, as we struggle with the peaking of this opioid abuse epidemic, and the sinister introduction of fentanyl, and fentanyl cutting of heroin, that isn't gonna just happen like that [snaps]. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 So, we're gonna be doing nalaxone training and rescuing for a long time yet, and we will continue to do it as long as is needed. 13 AS: Would you, do you know, if it was pain pills that introduced heroin here? 13, 14, 15 Is it the same narrative that we're hearing in most of the U.S. about the upsurge of heroin was because of pain pill addiction? 15 That pain pill addiction started... 9, 11 CG: I'm certainly sure that that's a factor. 9, 10, 15 I'm not convinced that that's the primary origin of opioid abuse here. 9 I don't have statistics for you, but I know the street level view point of the matter. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 We had a serious crack-cocaine problem here twenty years ago, and we've cycled through the various changes in drugs, substance abuse of choice, and everything. 9, 14, 16, 17, 20 I believe that there was a small heroin problem here prior to the twenty-first century, but I have no doubt that pain management and prescription opioid use fueled a serious worsening here. 9, 19 So, I have no doubt about that.  I don't have statistics on it. 9 What I can tell you is, a year of two ago, the Minnesota health department put out statistics from 2000 to 2015 on county drug overdose deaths. 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20 Including the counties that shared with reservation land here- Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater. 6, 8, 12 And they estimated forty-five drug overdose deaths during those years- 2000 to 2015. 9, 14, 15, 20 And everybody I've talked to from tribal council to Poozy Hags, to everybody else says, ""Phew. 10, 11 That's a gross underestimate. 9, 19 We've had a lot more deaths than that."" 17 Which has brought up the issue of busy old family doctors who are tired and have a desk stacked with insurance forms and death certificates and which one's gonna get more attention? 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 And, what gets put on the death certificate? 10 And, does the coroner take the time to say, ""Well you know, cardiac arrest. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 Yes, of course, but...  AS: This person was twenty-five... CG: ""...This person was nineteen-years-old, or twenty-five years old, so, I'm gonna call old Gardner and say, 'You know Gardner I hate to be a pest, but you said this twenty-five year old died of cardiac arrest. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 Well, of course, that's the final mechanism but was there anything else that was a contributing factor or?'"" 10 ""Well yeah, they were a heroin user."" 9, 10 ""Well, wouldn't you wanna put that on the death certificate Gardner?"" 10 You know, that's hypothetical, but you get the idea. 11, 13, 14, 15 AS: But, how things get lost. 9, 16 CG: I'll insult myself and not somebody else.  So, there has been a problem with struggling with substance abuse disorder here for quite some time. 9 And it did include street heroin and other street opioids, but I'm certain that the 1990s concept of pain as the fifth vital sign, and articles from LA or New York about doctors being sued for providing inadequate pain control, and big pharma's advertising ""Oxycontin! 8, 9, 10, 17 No problem!  You wont' have any problem..."" [sarcastic tone]. 9 AS: Nobody gets addicted.  Right.  CG: [Continues]  ""Yeah, come have dinner. 13, 19 We'll buy you dinner, and wouldn't you like to prescribe Oxycontin?"" 7, 10 I'm sure that that had a lot to do with it. 15, 17 I came in 1999… 19 yeah I'm sorry I talk too much. 10, 18 AS: I'm just keeping track. 9, 11, 12 No, you keep going! 12 CG: I came in '99 here, and as I told you, Dr. Howard Hayes warned me. 14, 19, 20 There was a problem with prescription drug seeking, certainly was here. 9, 14 But I think, my opinion, working at IHS was, that we weren't necessarily the center of the problem. 9 There were other physicians practicing, not associated with IHS, in fact, do you know the Lee clinic story? 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: No. CG: Dr. Lee, god rest his soul… 9, 10, 19 Was he here, around here? 8 CG: Graduated from a residency program in Fargo, and opened up several urgent care clinics that people could walk into any time, and prescribed tons of narcotics. 7, 15, 17 You know, relatively speaking. 13, 14, 15, 16 And, ended up being charged with malfeasance and losing his license, and later committed suicide. 12, 17 So, very very sad story. 9, 12 Don't remember his first name, but… 6, 9 AS: Fargo.  In Fargo did you say?  Moorhead?  CG: Yeah, Dr. Lee.  And the clinic I think is called the Seven Day Clinic. 7, 15 It's in Detroit Lakes, and it's near Menards. 15 Sue, if you know Detroit Lakes. 13, 14, 15 That was originally a Dr. Lee Clinic, and it got bought out by someone else after his untimely and sad death. 7, 12 And, ultimately....  Essentia bought it up because they believe in mitigating competition when they can, but they don't run it that way. 7, 11, 16 They run it as a responsible urgent care clinic, but there were several clinics like that. 7, 11 And, Clinton will know about Dr. Lee. 13, 14, 15 And I, you know, I didn't see any court records or any board of medical examiners' records. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 But, that was going on in the 1990s.  And, I think that, very likely that situation helped to fuel a, you know, a serious habituation to opioids in this whole region. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 And you would have to look into that.  I can't give you any authoritative history, but I, but I was here when that happened and we heard the stories about people saying, ""Oh I can go down to Lee's clinic, I can get as much 'oxy' as I want to. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 I can get as much 'vic' as I want to. 13, 18 What the hell's wrong with you IHS doctors?""  So, we heard that. 15 And, apparently so did the North Dakota board of Medical Examiners. 10, 16, 18 And so did the North Dakota judicial system. 8, 9 So, you may wanna look into that.  It goes across the border.  But, many of his urgent care clinics were through this area, rural Minnesota. 7 In the 1990s.  And, they were handing out 'oxys' and 'vics' like candy.  AS: Right, right. 14 CG: And so, isn't it nice for Gardner to blame someone else. 17 There were various narcotic prescribing strategies by IHS doctors, but we had a solid core group from 1999 till about 2005 or 2006, we had no turnover in doctors and nurse practitioners. 9, 10, 15, 19 And, it was amazing 'cuz the whole IHS joke is, well you know, two years pay off your public health pay back, and then you leave. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 But we have the same group of five medical care providers, primary care, from before '99 until about 2005, 2006. 7, 14 And then it fell apart and people started leaving, and we got in short termers and locum tenens doctors, and it became more an issue with varying philosophies. 5, 9, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 But, from '99 when I cam until 2005 or 2006, we had dependable reliable team of primary care providers who were concerned about the issue and established policy and procedure to help minimize the risks of doing harm by opioid prescribing. 7, 9, 12, 13, 15 So, I don't think in that time of '99 to early twenty-first century we were the primary cause, but we certainly saw the problem. 9 And, yes we did prescribe. 14 And I had, I had an individual who had pain issues. 14, 15 This is an interesting story. 9, 19 I'll try to leave out any identifying factors. 6, 10, 16 So, here's the story. 9 This was an individual who was a community member who had pain management issues. 14, 15 Who came in to see me, and I did prescribe narcotics for the individual for a period of weeks. 15, 19 And then, I realized that there were red flag signals here of inappropriate requests, and early refills, and suggestion of using in excess of prescribed doses. 9, 12, 14 And so, I had a visit meeting with this individual and laid out the issues and explained to them that I was going to have to stop their narcotic prescription. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 And, they threatened to bring a gun to my yard! 15 Now, I have to give you the perspective, I've been a family doctor for forty years, I've been threatened four times. 6, 15, 18, 20 Three of them were by white people in Park Rapids.  So, don't think this is an ""Indian thing."" 8 But, but this was an individual who was desperate and said something desperate.  And, I reported it to the tribal cops and we looked at each other, and they shrugged and I shrugged.  And you, know, no harm was done to me. 13, 14, 15 And so, that happened, but that's not the end of the story because a week and half later I was on emergency call, and this individual came in having a profound severe heart attack. 7, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 And I got to care for them, and I looked at my nurse and she looked at me, and I said, ""Ueah we're gonna care for this individual."" 7 And so, we did care for that individual, and it was nip-and-tuck and the ambulance had to rush him to Fargo. 7 And they ended up with fairly extensive sub-specialty management. 12, 15 And on that, that's all I'm gonna say.  But here's the thing, I lost track. 9 Ajd a few months later my nurse came to me and said, ""'Member 'so-and-so?'"" 8, 19 And I said, ""Oh yeah, I remember 'so-and-so.'"" 10 And she said, ""Well 'so-and-so' is here and wants to talk to you.' 10, 11, 13 And I said, ""Geez what do you think?""  And she was a community member here and she said, ""Oh yeah, you wanna talk to 'so-and-so' today."" 10, 19 So, so-and-so's put in the room, and I go into the room thinking, ""Okay, chapter two of the 'What's the matter with you damn doctors?'"" 7, 10, 13, 20 I walked in, the individual had come to me to apologize for threatening to bring a gun to my yard, and to thank me for participating in the team that helped to save their life. 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 So none of the three white persons in Park Rapids ever came back... 19 [Amy and Sue laughing] and said I'm sorry. 5, 10 But, that individual did, so that's the whole story. 9 But, that happened here. 12, 13 And I would guess that if you talked to everyone of us who had practiced at that time, each one could tell you some other story. 9, 10, 11 AS: Oh, almost every doctor has told me a story like that, yeah. 9, 10, 20 CG: So, that's mine and I tried to de-identify it as much as a I could. 10, 18 AS: You did a great job. 11 CG: If you would make that into a big deal, I, you know some people who know, ""Well, I know who that is 'cuz I 'member about 'so-and-so's' heart attack and I 'member about this and such."" 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 CG: But, so those were the kind of things that were happening in the early twenty-first century. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 But I still maintain that narcotic prescribing at the IHS clinic was not the main problem that fueled the opioid abuse crisis here. 9, 15 I think there were other factors in play. 10 We certainly did prescribe narcotics, and yes some of our patients did misuse them. 9, 14, 15 But in the years that I was here, we proactively tried to be very careful. 7, 10, 20 What we weren't good at was we weren't good at harm reduction. 12 We didn't say, I'm going to have to stop your narcotic prescription, but I would like to have you talk to Clinton Alexander and Minus Bala [confirm names], and let's see if we can get you a substance abuse baseline assessment and some support here. 6, 9, 10, 15, 19 And maybe we can work out some harm reduction help that will help you get through this. 9, 12, 13 And I still wanna be your doctor. 9 And you know, don't wanna have this end on a bad note, let me put together a team that will help you. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 We didn't do as good a job at that as we should back then. 19 We're doing a much better job on that now. 14, 18 So, we had to grow up and learn about harm reduction. 12, 17 I told you about Sarah Gordon. 20 I told you about the video. 20 Profound turning point in my professional life was Sarah Gordon's visit and that video. 11, 12, 13, 19, 20 And she will tell you I give her a hug every time I see her. 6 I give her a hug and she laughs, ""You've already thanked me!"" 6, 13 But, that was a profound turning point in my professional and my personal life. 11, 16, 19, 20 SP: Government lady!  That's what she's known as up here. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Government lady?  SP: [Laughing].  Government lady!  AS: So, what about, can we talk about medicine for opioid maintenance? 10, 15 CG: Sure.  AS: And, and what have you, when did that, when did subaxone and probably, do you have, you don't have methadone...? 5 AS: No, can you talk about how that fits into the story? 9, 10, 14 CG: I was involved in doing basic research for the mom's program. 15 We recognized that although we were determined to create a program that included traditional medicine wheel, spiritual healing, human services support, psychological counseling and support, substance abuse assessment and support....that we were going to need to develop a medically assisted treatment arm of the mom's program. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 And so back in late 2013, early 2014, I did the research along with others. 19 I wasn't the only one, but I'm the OCD guy who in my next life is gonna be a medical librarian [Sullivan laughing]. 5, 8, 11, 14 So, I did the research, present it, and said, ""Look subaxone is what we need. 7, 13 We're not, you know, we have to move heaven and earth to open a methadone clinic here, but we can get a subaxone clinic open. 13, 14, 15, 17 You can find the staff who have some experience, or who can get the experience."" 9 And, Julie Williams and Minus Bala who helped Julie Williams start the mom's program here agreed with that. 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 And, Tara Mason, the tribal secretary treasurer, agreed with that. 15 And, all the other members on the work-group agreed with that.  And so, we went with a subaxone program.  And it was the same thing that I've already told you. 20 No one told us we couldn't do it. 20 So we put the program together! 10 And we didn't think too much about it. 18 Except Tara wanted it by June of 2014, and so it was there by June of 2014- working well not working clumsily and ineffectively. 12, 13 And then, a year or so later people started coming and saying, ""How the hell didn't you get this program going out of nothing? 9, 11, 20 Tell us how you did it!""  ""Well, no one told us we couldn't! 20 We looked at the literature, saw what it would take, got the people, got the training, started it!"" 6, 9, 11 So, you know, it would be good for you to talk to some of the mom's program. 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Yeah, I did meet Julie. 13 CG: I sound like I'm bragging, I'm not! 10 I'm bragging up the White Earth philosophy that we can do this together.  We have to be twice as good as everybody else to be considered equal, and we can do that. 12 So that's how the mom's program got started. 9, 11, 15 And, if you've talked to Julie, or do talk to her, or will talk to her, she'll tell you more of the detail. 10, 11 But, it became obvious to me and everyone else on the work-group that subaxone, buprenorphine nalaxone, was what we needed to use. 5, 9, 13, 19 And subutex without the nalaxone I think is an initially what was used. 9 I'm not sure now. 14, 15 I am not a behavioral health employee, and the mom's program is a behavioral health program. 14, 15 Jerry Jaskin is the director of behavioral health. 14 Pat Butler is the director of tribal general health services. 14 So, I was the crossover consultant helper. 13 And so, I know the literature now says there is not any likely harm from nalaxone, and so pregnant women could certainly take subaxone. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 But the tradition was to use subutex. 9 But we got that started real fast, and made it work, and provided the traditional spiritual support and healing. 9, 11, 16 Provided the human services support. 14 Provided the substance abuse counseling. 9 Provided child support, baby sitting. 13 Provided good parenting training. 10, 16 Provided group therapy.  Provided…  everything Julie can tell you about.  And, our program has worked very well, and we have served a lot of our equawa [unclear] our Anishinabe women who have struggled with substance abuse disorder, and who have been pregnant and needed help. 9, 13, 17, 18 And, many of them are now clean and sober and helping as counselors in our community and other places. 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17 So, that was one of the crossover points.  I told you about the video. 20 I told you about ""fade to black."" 20 I told you about ""I didn't sleep well that night."" 7, 19, 20 One of the big issues for me was medically assisted therapy 'cuz I had been resistant to that. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 I had supported what is still a very important tenet of the traditional viewpoint, and that is we can provide healing through medicine wheel traditional spiritual methods. 5, 9, 15, 16 And I still believe that, but even our traditional spiritual community are very gaetae [unclear] 9, 15 Anishinabe.  Our very conservative, old-line traditional spiritual healing community, has come out in favor of the mom's program and what the MAT [confirm acronym] program is doing. 6, 13, 15, 19, 20 What they have said is, ""Now, just so long as you don't do what Western medicine always does, damnit! 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 They always leave us out and think that we're some kind of bizarre, extremist group. 6, 9, 16, 17 And you know, 'blah blah blah blah Western medicine and traditional healing could never work. 9, 13, 14, 15 Our medicine wheel healing works. 14 You Western doctors need to understand that you're pretty good at curing stuff, but curing doesn't last. 9, 12, 13, 16, 18 What we do is heal people.  When you guys'll wake up and invite us to join the team, and help to heal, then your curing will last. 9, 13 And then we'll do some good.""  We're working on that.  I just got a call from out of the blue from an American Heart Association staff member in Minnesota, who has some American Heart Association regional funding and wanted to put on a conference fro Indian Health Service care providers and happened to call me because they have my name. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 And, like I always do, and have done for years, I said, ""Well you know, there are several things you could do. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 You know, you do a rapid heart attack response, that' great. 11, 13, 14, 15 You do rapid stroke response, that's great. 9, 11 You teach medical providers how to use a lucus to external compression device. 9, 14 That's great. 11 Why don't you sponsor a healing counsel here and get together Western clinicians and traditional healers and have us all talk together as equals about how we can help with heart health on the reservation here?"" 8, 9, 10, 13, 14 And that always ends the conversation. 12, 16, 17 ""Ah well yeah, that sounds really nice... and well thank's for the call we appreciate it..."" [Sarcastic tone]. 7, 9, 10, 13, 16 But this person said, ""You know, let me talk to my boss, but that sounds like a good idea."" 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I got an email back and said, ""I talked to the Minnesota AHA vice president here who's in charge, and they said we can do that!"" 10, 11, 17, 19 So I turned it over to our cultural director, Merlan Deegan [confirm name] who will follow up with it. 6, 12, 14, 19 But, you know I'm not gonna hold my breath. 13, 14, 15, 20 I've been saying this since about the year 2000. 11, 20 But actually, I know that person professionally, not personally, and when they say they're gonna do something, based on American Heart Association promise, they do it. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 So, we may actually have that after all these years, and that would be a very important advance here for Western medicine to invite traditional medicine with respect and humility, and listen to what traditional medicine says. 9, 10, 15, 17, 20 And, you don't have time for me to continue on with this, but I was asked by Dennis Hisgun, one of the senior substance abuse counselors here, a traditional Anishinabe and Dakota healer and substance abuse counselor, and you should hear his story! 9, 10, 20 AS: What's his name? 6 CG: Dennis Hisgun Senior.  H-i-s-g-u-n [spelling], Dennis.  D-E-N-N-I-S [spelling].  He's about almost eighty now. 9, 14 I'll have tell, I'll have to do the abbreviated story. 9 AS: Okay.  CG: But, Dennis asked me to put together a group of essays he could use to work with teenagers in recover to show them that traditional healing as a stature equal in value to Western medicine. 9, 10, 18 And I thought, I said, ""Dennis okay I'll do it."" 11, 12 And I thought, ""Yeah I'll have a few..."" 11, 12 By the time I was done I had fifty-two essays!  And I've, I keep a notebook now, and I've collected several other ones since then. 12, 14 I studied for a decade with a traditional healer, Wimba Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling], he's gone to the star world now. 6, 9, 14, 15 And, when I talk about Western medicine and traditional healing, I always point out to the audience, ""Wimab Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling] came to me at the IHS clinic for Western medicine, and I went to him at his sweat lodge, because we believed it was good to combine the best of traditional medicine and Western medicine. 6, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19 Now, he's gone to the star world and I'm still here so I guess that tells you whose medicine worked best!"" 9, 10, 15 [Sullivan and Purchace laughing]. 5 And the audience always falls over laughing. 5, 16, 17 AS: That's great. 11 CG: But, he used to say to me, ""You know Gardner, I feel bad for you Western doctors. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 If you wanna develop a new medicine, you have to spend twenty million dollars to do the research. 6, 12, 16, 19 And then you have to spend forty million dollars to convince the FDA to okay it. 12, 19 All I have to do is ask Creator and the Healing Spirits what to do for my client, and then damn well do it!"" 13 And we would laugh about that.  But, then he would also say, ""You know the other thing that you need to think about Gardner is you Western doctors joke about placebo effect. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 You call it lying to the patient, but that's Creator teasing you. 7 Because what placebo effect really is, is it's the inherent spiritual healing power that Creator has put into a human being. 10, 11, 15, 16 You look at your own Western research. 9 Often a placebo effect works a third to a half of the time, and you call it lying. 7, 11, 14, 15, 20 It's Creator saying, that there is inherent healing power in a person that can be activated. 10, 11, 15, 16 But Gardner, you Western doctors aren't willing to admit that you have to believe in it for it to work. 9 We believe in it.""  And there was just a study that came out in the Western medical literature, I just read about it a month ago, and it talks about what's called ""open-label placebo studies."" 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 And that's a whole new thing in Western medicine. 6, 9 Western researchers get people into the study and they say, ""We're going to do a study on this medicine 'triple crown barbecue sauce.' 5, 9 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 We don't know if it works. 13, 14, 15 It might not work at all.  We don't know, but we'd like to do a study, would you be willing to try it?"" 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 That's what they tell people, it's just sugar water. 6, 9, 12 And people say, ""Yeah!  I'd love to be in your study. 9, 13 You don't know if it's gonna work, have no idea? 11, 13, 14, 15 Not gonna hurt me?""  ""Nah it won't hurt you, but we don't have any idea it's gonna work. 11 We don't have any reason to believe it'll work, but it was suggested and we'd just like to find out."" 9, 10, 12 So, they give it to people and hell it works! 6, 14 A big percentage of the time! 8 So, Western researchers are now saying, ""Maybe we should be doing open-label placebo studies because when people believe that the sugar water's gonna work, they get better, at a much higher rate than they do if they don't believe that they'll get better!"" 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 And so, that's actually happening now in the Western medicine literature. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 So, okay here's Dennis Hisgun's story. 9 Dennis comes from a family, Anishanabe and Dakota. 13, 18, 19 He had a good stable childhood. 9, 11, 18 Two parent family. 10, 16, 18 I think his dad did farming, ranching. 7 But when Dennis was about thirteen, his dad died in a traumatic accident, and it just broke Dennis' heart and he ended up as a teenager on Franklin avenue in Minneapolis and that's where I grew up- pretty near Franklin Avenue. 7, 9, 12, 18, 20 So, I wonder if Dennis and I ever met each other. 5 But, Dennis would overdose on various things—whatever drug he could get ahold of. 14, 15, 16, 20 Certainly alcohol, certainly other drugs. 9, 14 And many people up here and over in South Dakota from his Dakota relatives said, ""You know, just leave Dennis alone. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 you know, he doesn't wanna get better. 13, 14, 15 He's never gonna make anything. 15, 16 He'll end up dying in an alley down there, and just leave him alone."" 6, 9, 12 But one day, when Dennis came out of old Hennepin General after yet another overdose, there were a few Anishinabe men standing on the sidewalk: ""Hi Dennis, we're here to take you home."" 6, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20 ""I don't know you guys! 13, 14, 15 Leave me alone!""  ""No, we're taking you home!"" 19 ""Let go of me!""  ""Dennis, we're just like you. 9, 10, 12 We're trying to stay sober and recover. 6, 9, 16 And we're gonna, we rented a house on Franklin Avenue. 6, 7, 9, 16 We're gonna do this together.""  ""Well, I don't wanna go with you!  I don't have a job, I can't help!"" 13 ""That's okay, we'll float you alone Dennis until you're feeling better and can get a job and help us out."" 13, 16 So, what're the chances that that would work?  What is one human life worth? 11 What is another chance worth?  Dennis went with 'em cuz there was no HIPPA, he didn't have a choice. 17 They grabbed 'em and they took him.  But it was good.  And Dennis got sober. 6 He thought things over. 11, 12, 16 He had the childhood, and the background, and the support that would help someone to get back into sobriety. 8, 11, 13, 19 And, he made that transition and he stayed there for a while—helped at the house. 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16 Then he came back up here, took an EMT class, became an EMT here for a number of years. 5, 19, 20 He was an EMT here and helped save lives, and then he realized that Creator wanted him to be a substance abuse counselor, and so he got that training and became a substance abuse counselor here, and in the intervening more than forty years. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 He's number one, stayed clean and sober one day at a time. 5, 6, 9, 19 And number two, he has helped thousands of people make a start on the red road of sobriety. 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 You can't get sober for anyone else, but you need someone there to help you when you're ready to make a try. 6, 13, 16 And Dennis Hisgun Senior is the one, and so when I'm giving a talk and someone raises that, ""Ah c'mon Doc what's one life worth?"" 10, 11 I tell 'em Dennis' story—I got Dennis' permission. 6, 9 But you would need to get Dennis' permission to tell his story, but he gave me permission to tell it verbally [Amy laughing]. 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 That's his story. 9 If those guys hadn't grabbed him, he probably would have died in an alley.  He will tell you, he had bad active addiction at that time to a number of drugs. 10, 14 But it took, and he dedicated his life to helping other people, and he's now almost eighty. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 He's still working part-time on the res. 9 He helped the mom's program. 13, 15, 16 He's helped our Oshki Manidoo center in Bemidji. 9, 13, 16 He's working right now with behavioral health. 14 We're doing regularly scheduled peer support recovery classes. 8, 20 We have tribal certification authority to certify peer support workers, and we do the training, and he's on the team that does the training. 10 So that's what one life is worth. 11 If there hadn't been someone to say, ""Wait a second. 20 We oughta give Dennis another chance. 6 See if we can help him. 13 He might do something good with his life."" 11 He did, but if someone hadn't of stepped up with harm reduction help—it was homemade, but it was harm reduction SP: 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 That's right! 14 CG: You know Dennis probably would've died in an alley of liver failure and other overdose. 13, 14, 15 So, you need to hear Dennis Hisgun's story. 9, 13 And, you have just heard it from me, but you really should try to talk to him. 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 AS: Oh definitely, definitely.  SP: Dennis was at the conference, the harm reduction conference in San Diego, with the mom's program. 12, 15 AS: Oh really?  CG: Yeah, I think so.  There's Dennis Jr. his son, who works here. 14 And Dennis Sr. but he's in his late seventies. 15 SP: Jr… how old is... ? 20 CG: He's a young looking man! 14 He doesn't look like he's in his late seventies but he is. 15 SP: So, that that's the same Dennis that I met. 5 CG: Yeah, probably.  CG: Yeah so, I love and honor him and wish I had met him many year sooner. 5, 13, 20 But, Dennis' story to me is the story of what one life is worth when you step up with harm reduction help and you don't give up on someone and you offer them yet again, help. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 SP: Harm reduction is home-grown. 12, 17, 19 CG: Yes, of course!  SP: It's the important piece about it.  CG: Of course!  You're right! 14 And I, I knew you'd love the story if you hadn't already heard it, but that's a story that should be heard. 6, 9, 12, 13, 15 And Dennis tells it when he tells his own story, but he hasn't made a big deal out of it. 8, 9, 13, 16 It's never been published anywhere, and if I write it in an article I dub him ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling], which is the Dakota name for ""bear."" 6, 15 I don't use his name ""Dennis."" 6, 9 But I talked to him and he gave me permission to tell his story, so if I tell it like this I use his name. 6, 9, 10, 11 But if I write it, I use the name ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling]. 6, 9 AS: Okay, Okay.  I think you've already answered my question about your ideas and philosophies about best practices. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 If there's anything else you wanted to add about that? 12, 13 CG: Best practices here… 9, 10 AS: Yeah what you've come… 13, 19 are what we need to do to help our fellow community members to find safer ways of living, and to find hope to heal the underlying generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences so that then they can receive long-term healing of the superficial issue of drug-abuse. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Drug-abuse is a superficial issue, but it's a lethal one. 12, 15, 19 But, if you don't offer red-road healing, if you don't offer healing of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences, then the superficial but lethal problem is going to continue. 9, 11, 12, 19 And, no I can't show you any community here where we have zero drug problem, but we are working very hard to offer healing for the underlying problems and trying to bring that to the front. 11, 14, 16 It's always been in the background, but it hasn't been the front. 8, 16, 17, 19 And all of our tribal public health, behavioral health, harm-reduction, judicial organizations—a couple of years ago we started an adult drug court, we've had a juvenile drug court, restorative justice courts... 9, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20 AS: Is that called the Circle Back Center? 7 CG: Circle Back is a, is an outpatient recovery maintenance group, therapy program for teens. 9, 15 But, it's connected with the adult drug court DIY—Dually Involved Youth Program—and the juvenile court program. 14, 18 So, they get referrals from juvenile court from the DIY program, and then Circle back can take kids just at their own request of their parents' request with no organizational referrals. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 AS: Oh, Okay CG: So, we're doing good stuff like that. 9 But we, have been trying since 2013 when we opened the mom's program, to bring to the front the concept that we need to find ways to offer durable medicine wheel healing—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual—for the underlying wounds of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences. 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 And, when we do that, then we'll have a platform for effective long-term sobriety. 17 So, those are the things in general that I think all our divisions and departments are working on, and we have a program that we call the Drug Task Force. 7, 16 Has Clinton told you about that? 20 SP: I don't think so.  CG: What the tribe declared a drug abuse emergency in 2011, or 2012—just around the time that I had my three month retirement and started working here—but shortly after the declaration the tribal council established the Drug Task Force. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 It is not a police group. 7 It's a group where representatives of every division and every department get together and meet once a month, sit down at the table in the administration building—the big table—we all sit there and say, ""So what problems are we seeing in our community now related to drug abuse? 7, 8, 9, 13, 14 What are the wounds?  What is the healing that's needed? 13 How can our programs work together across department and divisional boundaries to make things work?"" 16 And certainly that was one of the motivations for getting the mom's program going, 'cuz it was that table where Tara Mason said, ""I want it open by June."" 9, 13, 15, 17 And walked out of the meeting. 13, 17 It was a Drug Task Force meeting. 13 So, a number of our other programs in recent years have been based on that, and the cultural division director is the facilitator of that meeting, which is really good—Mike Larak [confirm name and spelling]. 6, 13, 14, 20 The police chief comes, representatives from drug court come—from substance abuse, from behavioral health, from tribal health, from harm reduction—but it's the cultural director of our nation that is the facilitator, Merlon Deegan [confirm name and spelling]. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 You should talk to him too. 10 D-E-E-G-A-N [spelling], Merlan.  He is a former cop, he's a former tribal policeman, who has traditional healing training in both Ojibwe and Dakota traditional healing. 7, 17 He's a nephew of Dennis Hisgun Sr. So there's a story there. 9 And so Merlan is our cultural director, and he chairs that committee to help us all keep on task and focus on the fact that we need to provide medicine wheel healing for the underlying wounds of our people if we want to establish successful long-term sobriety strategies here. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Do you feel hopeful? 10, 16 CG: Yes.  Very much so. 18 AS: About the opioid epidemic?  CG: I do, but I don't feel hopeful for any quick-fix solutions. 10, 16 What we need is the work of the Drug Task Force, the work of the mom's program, the work of our MAT program, the work of our traditional cultural division. 13, 15 Merlan has spent a number of years struggling to work with a consultant, Roxanne Delille. 9, 19, 20 She's a PhD level educator and an medaywan [unclear] woman, who works at Fond 10, 14, 19, 20 Du Lac College.  And, she has been working with Merlan an a group of us, a work group, to develop a new employee orientation program. 6, 16 And as it stands now it's three four hours segments, that talks about the cultural history, the spiritual history, the history that the conquerers got all wrong, the history of work the White Earth nation has done to help its community members, and to help others, and the last section is being completed. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19 And Merlan's hope with the support of our reservation business committee is that every new employee will get to sit in those sessions, and learn that history of ""Gawa ba be banicka"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 Confirm words for translation.]— ""the land of abundant white clay""—its history, its culture, a little bit about its language, its spiritual traditions. 7, 8, 9, 13 And, how they relate to issues today like drug abuse and like public health work, and human services work, and... 9, 14, 15, 19 Being a transportation bus driver! 7, 9, 14 Being a child care worker! 7 Being a whatever!  Everybody's gonna get that.  And, a commitment's been made to have all current employees attend that training too. 12, 15, 16 So, that's a big deal for us. 8, 13 And that's work that Merlan has helped to keep on the front burner, and not to be forgotten about. 12, 13, 15, 16 Because that's part of that, you have to deal with the underlying issues. 13, 14, 15 And, you have to acknowledge the hope that Anishinabe people have always had, but has often been distracted from by issues of colonization, issues of internalized oppression, issues of discrimination, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 You know those lectures and that's not why you came here, but I will tell you two acknowledge phrases that you don't need to learn but you should know about. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 One of them is, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 7 It took me a long time to learn that. 12 I am not a fluent speaker, I've worked very hard to learn that, and here's why. 11, 12 Do you know what that means in English? 13, 14, 15, 16 This is what it means in English: ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 9, 14, 16 So, even if you don't ever learn any other Ojibwe, that's what you need to know as our working policy here, and not everybody can say that. 12, 13, 14, 15 I've worked hard to learn how to say that. "" 11, 12 Gaween......"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 7 ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 9, 14 And the ""you,"" is not Amy Sullivan or Sue Purchase, the ""you"" is the life. 11 Okay?  ""You cannot destroy me life. 9, 11 You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 9, 14 That is, an ancient Ojibwe saying from [unclear] 11 Memorial.  It applies right now to the drug abuse crisis. 9, 14 And, we're working on using that in our work here.  The other thing you need to hear is this one. 13 This is from Roxanne Delille, who's helping with the employee orientation program. 13 She taught us this one.  I call these two sayings the ""Gaweens"" [Ojibwe. 7, 11 Confirm spelling of word for translation.] 7 This one starts out with Gaween. 9, 11 ""Gaween...."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 7 Also took me a while to learn that! 12 What that means in English is, ""It is not without reason that I do this."" 16 That is another Anishinabe saying. 11 ""Oh geez, oh why did they burn that sage, I always think that smells like weed, you know? 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 'Joe!  Look at putting down tobacco by a tree and there's food in that plane. 10, 13 That must be some aberration!"" ""Gawenn..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 7 It is not without reason that I do this.  Merlan can explain, I can explain a little, Roxanne can explain, his team can explain, many of us who have learned can explain. 12, 17 There's a reason.  A healing powerful reason, for each and every ceremonial thing we do here. 15 And, I have to tell you this about smudging, this isn't why you came here, but we smudge a lot. 17, 19 Harm Reduction smudges a lot. 17 You probably know that. 13, 14, 15 Did you know that there are only 400 nerve receptor endings in the human nose for sense of smell? 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 They're on a little piece of mucosa, about the size of a postage stamp in the back of the nose, 400! 9, 19 You've got hundreds of billions of neurons! 12, 14 I mean 400, that can't be very important. 16 Those 400 receptors are like a 400 character password. 10 They can recognize more than a trillion different individual inputs, and those sense of smell receptor nerve endings are the only nerve endings in the entire human body that go straight into the brain. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 They don't go to the spinal cord, they go straight into the brain. 6, 9 And do you know where they go? 13, 14, 15 They go right into the limbic system, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the part that's damaged by drug abuse and needs healing. 8, 9, 13, 14 And, do you know that Western researchers have discovered that human beings who can be given a brief meditational routine that helps to center them on healing thoughts will do much better in recovery, but it's very hard because in our text messaging, and phones, and blogs... 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 it's very hard to get people to do that. 11 That's what smudging does.  The Anishinabe ""Seven Fires"" prophecy, more than a thousand years ago, actually warned the Anishinabe that drug abuse was coming, and said that there would be something to help. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 Smudging is a direct line into the human amygdala, to remind our brain centers of, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. 6, 9 Confirm words for translation] 7 So we smudge here.  ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear.  Confirm words for translation] 7 ""It is not without reason that we do this.""  It's part of our hope. 10 So, that's my own eccentric version...  AS: No I don't think it's eccentric.  CG: ...but I'm pretty sure that people who are not as eccentric as I am, will agree with that. 15, 18 And that's one of my essays, in my group of essays that I gave to Dennis Hisgun, is don't laugh about smudging.  Let me tell you about human physiology, neuroanatomy and how it works. 14 Smudging really works! 14 AS: Will you share some of those with me?  The essays?  Are they ones that you've written? 15 CG: Yes.  AS: Oh, oh okay.  They're not, you aren't collecting research.  CG: Nope!  Here's the deal, I got tired of not admitting that I had written them. 12, 13, 15 I gave 'em to Dennis, but I wrote 'em and so...  AS: Ah, [laughing] the truth comes out! 5, 13, 19 CG: You can go on to Barnes and Noble, or SmashWords, and you can type in Carson Gardner, and you will see an ebook on a reinterpretation of the Dao De Jing...  AS: Oh wow. 14 CG: And you will see an ebook of very eccentric sonnets, and then you will see an ebook of essays.  And, I have probably sold ten, so I am not marketing, and I don't give a damn whether you look at 'em or not. 6, 13, 20 But, if you wanna read them you can get access to 'em, 'cuz I got tired of not sharing them. 6, 12 And, I decided well, I'll put em in an ebook and then I'll die. 10, 12 And, after that people will actually look at it. 10 So, I'm hoping to become a famous dead poet and a famous dead essayist! 9, 13, 19 [Sullivan laughing.] 5 So, the fact that they're available is just a way for you to look at 'em, otherwise if you want a totally free copy instead of spending four or five bucks... 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 AS: No I'll buy it. 7 CG: I'll email it to you from home. 19 AS: No, it's okay.  I'll buy it and then you can say you've sold eleven! 7, 15, 20 CG: I have no desire in making money but, the whole fifty-two that are in there as eccentric as they are and I, you know, there's nothing off color or intolerable, but it will take you down a path that Western Historians don't often go down. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 But I'll stand by everything I put in there. 9, 10, 12 SP: You mentioned they're on Amazon, what's the other one?  CG: They're not on Amazon they're on Barnes & Noble.  AS: Barnes & Noble.  SP: Barnes & Noble.  CG: Amazon requires that as an ebook author you have to sell 2,000 dollars worth of ebook before they'll even put it on Amazon. 7, 10, 15 Did you know that? 13, 14, 15 SP: Did you say another one like SmashWords?  CG: Smashwords.com A couple in California, frustrated writers, a decade and a half ago decided, ""You know maybe the best thing we could do is put together a website to help other people get their ebooks out there."" 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 And so, the Smashwords.com website has now helped amateur writers like me publish several hundred thousand ebooks. 13, 14, 16 Most people make no money, and SmashWords says, ""You know what? 13, 14, 15, 16 We'll do it for you free, and here's the deal. 13 If it sells we want ten percent of your profits."" 7, 13, 14 That's pretty reasonable. 18 And so, that couple is making a decent living on that, most of us never sell anything. 6, 7, 15 You know, Grandma buys one, our cousin whose always liked our poems buys one, and nobody else does. 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 But, they do it free, and they still do it free. 9 Costs you nothing except the rigamarole of getting the electronic text right. 9, 14 But they buy their groceries because 5-10% of their authors actually sell a bunch of copies, and so then they get paid. 7, 9, 10 AS: That's great. 11 SP: I'll have to check it out CG: Yeah, yeah, you get on SmashWords, you can get it somewhere else. 10 And, if you really don't want to buy a copy I'll give you the essays free 'cuz I always feel guilty. 6, 7, 13, 16, 17 That's why I need to become dead, so that I can become a famous dead poet and essayist, 'cuz I can't countenance charging anything for 'em. 9, 13, 15, 19 And I certainly gave em to Dennis free. 9 But, in case anybody ever asks, you're the first person that's ever asked, but in case anybody ever asks about a year ago I put em on SmashWords. 9, 10, 20 AS: So, thank you. 13 CG: Thank you for putting up with me. 10 AS: This was really lovely, oh no CG: Clinton and I both have the problem of typically after about 45 minutes in any meeting we're in, someone will say, ""Okay! 7, 13 Bring it in for a landing Gardner. 8 Bring it in for a landing Clinton!"" 8 So, you can tell Clinton I warned you.  AS: Well, thank you very much, it was really... 13, 18 CG: I'm a storyteller. 9 AS: It was really delightful to meeting you CG: I'm a storyteller, and I was one before I came here, but I have people like Poozy Haggs [confirm spelling of name] who really helped me to become a more effective storyteller here. 6, 9, 13, 16, 19 And so, I will always be a story teller, probably long after I'm retired, and his is an opportunity I couldn't pass up so, I snuck in all kind of stories. 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: No, those were beautiful. 6 SP: Can I ask you a question? 6, 9 So what about Hep C up here now? 14 Like, what are the rates like? 10 I remember like... 10 CG: Clinton will have some pretty good ideas about the rates. 11, 18 The IHS Clinic of course is reticent to just hand us information like that, but they do keep records, and Clinton is working with their new public health doctor. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17 They hired a new public health doctor, that's a physician with a masters in public health. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 20 Who has interest in things like PREP for people at risk of HIV and Hepatitis C treatment. 9, 16, 19 You know Clinton in harm reduction has developed a consulting relationship with, I think a Twin cities hepatologist, who is providing low cost Hepatits C care here. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 So i'm pretty sure Clinton can tell you stats. 9, 15, 18 But I don't know if he has full access to all the IHS statistics. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 He might though... 11 [End] "
"9","Devich_Stephanie","Janise Holter Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 14, 2016 St. Paul, Minnesota Janise Holter-JH Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan having an interview with Janise Holter on June 14th, 2016. 6 Janise, will you state your name and address and say you give permission for recording to be used? 6, 9, 14 My name is Janise Holter. 6 I give permission for Amy Sullivan to use all the contents of this interview. 6, 9, 15 AS: Thank you.  Could you tell me a little bit about your upbringing, aspects of your childhood that formed who you are, and a bit about your education and career? 7, 10, 11, 17 Whatever you say is totally fine and whatever direction you go off in is fine. 14, 17 If I want to bring you back I will bring you back. 13, 19 JH: Okay, perfect.  I’ll remind you to bring me back if I get too tangential.  [laughs]  Well, I grew up about two miles from where I live now, which is in Crystal, Minnesota. 9, 14 My parents were very young. 10, 14, 16 My mother was seventeen when she had my sister and nineteen when she had me. 5, 9, 15 My dad, we later discovered, suffered from bipolar. 12 He had a lot of bouts of depression growing up, so that was a pretty clear memory of dealing with his quietude or quietness. 13, 17, 18 My mother came from a family of ten and was very connected to her family. 18, 19 They were southern baptists. 7, 9 My grandma was from the South; my grandpa was from Sweden. 6, 7 So, I had a lot of cousins, went to church a lot, loved going to church. 5, 13, 17 Loved being in the really vibrant community. 7 I admit we got a little too vibrant and my mother left before I was baptized. 7 My sister was dumped and I was not because my mother left the church. 5, 9 We got a minister that was actually from Mississippi. 9, 10 He was a little bit too much of what the church was, so my mom left. 15, 18 We stopped going to church when I was thirteen. 9, 10, 20 I was kind of an odd kid. 16, 17 I was in the middle. 8 I have an older sister, younger brother. 5, 9, 14, 20 My parents were married to each other three times. 10, 16, 18 They divorced and married to each other three times in my childhood. 5, 11, 18 So there were periods of time when my parents didn’t live together. 10, 16 I have an older sister who is breathtakingly gorgeous. 5, 9, 20 So, that was an interesting thing to be second to. 9, 19, 20 She was very, very beautiful. 6 I have a younger brother who is four years younger than I am and he actually had an episode when he was twelve where he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized for a number of months. 5, 8, 10, 14, 20 My mother chalked it up to him having a concussion, but there was clearly some mental illness or something going on with him. 14 My parents owned a store, and I worked in the store. 5, 9, 10, 16 My mom is a folk artist. 9, 15 She paints scandinavian folk art [laughs]. 8 She owned a craft store. 5, 9 She got into that and bought a store in Osseo, Minnesota. 5, 7, 9 Small, little store, and I worked in her store with my dad. 5, 9 I worked in her store from the time I was fourteen until I was in eleventh grade. 5, 9, 15, 20 I got a job at a nursing home, and worked at the nursing home for the rest of my high school career. 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 I worked with my parents and I helped my mom teach classes. 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20 She taught a lot of classes in different types of folk painting and ceramics. 8, 16, 17, 20 She was very crafty.  So, middle class. 8, 20 My dad worked for the highway department until the store kind of started to make some money—he decided to quit the highway department, and he worked at the store and helped my mom. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 My parents finally got divorced for the third or fourth time depending on how you count it, when I was thirty! 5, 10, 12, 16, 20 [laughs]  I always thought of the Woody 11, 12, 16, 17 Allen line: “My parents got divorced, or stayed married even though we begged them not to.” 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16 That’s how I felt when my parents finally got divorced because my dad was clearly mentally ill and my mom was keeping it together and they were both being pulled down a hole that was not good for either of them. 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 So, once they divorced, my dad just progressively got more and more—cycles of depression and mania and addiction. 5, 9, 12 He was diabetic, and he had heart attacks.  He didn’t keep taking care of himself. 7, 12 He died at seventy-two.  My mother remarried a guy who was as mentally ill as my father, but the other end of the spectrum. 5, 12, 14 Very, very, religious, fundamental religious. 14 My dad was funny, and bigger than life, and sloppy, and everything, you know, was just sloppy. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 And my mother married this guy that is very rigid, and very neat, and very religious.  She has been married to him for about sixteen years. 20 She is very religious, very fundamental, very right-wing, very judgmental. 14 My parents were very hands-off. 10, 16 That was how I was parented. 6, 10, 16 I mean, maybe it was the time or maybe it was because they were young. 9, 14, 16 My mom was thirty-eight when I graduated from high school. 8, 15 We just did whatever. 9, 12 I remember playing softball and my parents never came to the softball games. 8, 10, 15, 16, 19 They worked at their store all the time. 5, 9 There was no discussion ever that I would go to college. 8 Never was it even considered that we would go to college. 8, 12, 15 Neither of my parents were college educated. 8, 10, 16 AS: How did you end up going to college? 8, 12 I got out of school and I worked for a couple of years. 8, 20 I started off by going to community college and paying for it all out of pocket. 8, 9, 11, 16 My first round in college was all out of pocket. 8, 9 I always worked full time. 11, 16, 17 I went to school, I worked full-time, and paid all my tuition out of pocket because I was raised that you did not go into debt. 5, 8, 11 My dad was German, and that’s stereotypical German frugality. 9 You don’t go into debt.  You don’t go into debt for education. 10 You go into debt for a house, but education is not worth going into debt for. 6, 9, 10 It wasn’t outwardly said, but it was definitely an attitude that, you know, I would go to college and my parents would be like, “Do you know what you’re going to do? 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 They had to see the ends. 12 In my family I am the only college educated child. 8, 10, 18 They had a really interesting reaction when I stopped going to school to be an accountant and decided that cultural anthropology was what I was going to study. 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, 20 [laughs]  That was interesting. 9, 19 My mom could not get it right, the whole, you know, whatever turned out being over four years I was in school. 8, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 She kept telling people I was going to school to be an archaeologist. 8, 9 I had to just let it go. 9, 12, 19 So that was not a value in my family. 18 In school I did really well. 8 I mean it was valued that I did well in school, but my parents were really hands-off. 8, 10, 16 I want to come back a little bit because I had my own addiction issues in high school. 8, 13, 14, 15, 19 The first two weeks of my tenth grade year, one of my very good friends committed suicide, and that was a very difficult thing for me. 9, 12, 15, 18, 20 I started using a lot of speed to go to school, and smoking a lot of pot. 8, 9, 11, 17 Everybody smoked pot, but I started smoking a lot of pot. 9, 11, 17 Like smoking pot on my way to school. 8, 16 My parents didn’t know how to address this. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I didn’t know how to address this. 13, 14, 15 I was fifteen and I had had this really close person—it was the first person, yeah I guess it was the first person that died. 9, 10 It was a person my same age.  It turns out that it was probably because he was gay. 19 I had glimpses of that and I kind of knew that, but it was 1976. 6, 12, 16, 17 It was forty years ago. 20 It was not a part of what you told people. 20 But you knew, and anyways he committed suicide. 6, 12, 16, 17 I responded to that by using drugs and started smoking cigarettes. 9, 11, 14 My biggest lifelong addiction was with nicotine. 8, 9, 11 My parents were both smokers too. 10, 16 My grandfather was a very serious alcoholic. 5, 7 Many of my uncles were alcoholics. 5 I later had an uncle that committed suicide.  So there was a lot of denied mental health issues in my dad’s family. 14, 15, 17, 18 If that wasn’t a family of people who suffered from serious depression—it was a dark and gloomy family. 12, 18 My senior year in high school I kept fairly decent grades, but I smoked a lot of pot, took a lot of speed, took a lot of speed. 8, 17, 20 That was my drug of choice just because it was, you know, it wasn’t a depressant. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 I think I was probably depressed and that was how I dealt with my depression. 12, 13 When I would talk to my parents about how depressed I was it was kind of a “get over it” kind of thing. 10, 12, 16, 17 It was: “You know it has been two years since this person died. 13, 14, 15, 20 You need to get over it.” 13 AS: Did you ever go to treatment of any kind? 9, 16, 17 How did you end up managing your— JH: 12 My addiction?  AS: Or ending your drug use? 9, 12, 14 I started getting serious migraines when I was seventeen. 9, 11, 15 I thought I was killing myself. 7, 11, 12 I thought it was all the speed I was taking that was causing this to happen. 11, 12 It scared the shit out of me. 5, 7, 11, 12 AS: It scared you. 5, 7, 11, 12 It scared the shit out of me. 5, 7, 11, 12 Because I was having all these weird things going on and I thought, “Oh my god, I am going to die.” 10, 11, 12, 16 AS: Like those aura things? 16 JH: Not aural, but yeah. 10 My fingers would go numb and stuff like that. 9 It was all coinciding with these amphetamines I was taking.  My children do not know this [laughs]. 13, 14, 15 AS: They don’t know you used? 9, 13, 14, 15 JH: Not to the extent to which I did. 15 It’s just interesting because I am telling you and it’s like I mean I could tell Allison this, but—and I would but— So anyways, I quit using amphetamines, got a job, and moved out of the house at eighteen. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 Got a job, lived uptown, worked at a record company, and had a blast. 6, 9, 19 Did advertising.  It was the late ‘70s early ‘80s.  I was just kind of going to school part time, thought okay, I’m going to be an accountant because that is really practical and that’s what I should do. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 So, I went to Minneapolis Community College because I could afford it.  Then the plan was I would do the first two years there and then I would, you know, go on and get a degree in accounting and be a CPA. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 I did it for about a year and a half and I thought it wasn’t—I actually, do you know who Norma Rowe is? 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 She was a University professor. 13 Anyways, she is an Anthropology professor. 16, 17 I think she is dead now. 14 She was a professor at Minneapolis Community College and she taught a class that was called Cultural Anthropology. 7, 20 I thought, “I’ll take this as one of my electives,” and it just blew me away, she just blew me away. 6, 9, 11, 12, 16 It was my introduction to feminism, and you know, I was like, “Oh my God, this is what interests me! 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 This is what I want to study. 9, 13 I want to study culture. 9, 13 I am interested in this.” 9, 11, 19 [laughs]  I’m not interested in spreadsheets! 9, 11, 19 This was 1970—this wasn’t on the computer it was on paper! 10 So, I stopped going to—I’m just like I’m going to go to the University of Minnesota. 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 She taught there, her husband taught there. 15 I worked at the record company, I became a waitress, I had worked for Republic Airlines for a little while. 5, 6, 19 I always had to work full-time. 11, 16, 17 I could never just go to school. 8, 9, 12, 15 I just couldn’t. 9, 12 Because I refused to go into debt. 9 AS: How long did it take you then to finish your bachelor's? 6 I never did finish. 15 I quit.  I quit the U of M. I was about thirty U of M credits short of graduating. 12, 16 I quit to make some more money so I could—that’s how I would have to do it. 16 It was a cycle.  I was about twenty-six at this time.  So, I was about seven years into this cycle. 20 AS: So no one talked to you about how affordable student loans were? 9, 10, 11 I had such a fear based mentality about that that I wouldn’t even consider it. 14, 15 I didn’t consider it until I went back and got my teaching license. 19 That I was able to break that kind of thing. 16, 17, 18 So, I quit the last time, and I got married for the first time [laughs]. 9 I married someone and was married for about a year, and then got divorced. 5, 20 Carey, the father of both of my kids, and were friends for a number of years, and I started to realized that I was gay. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20 I started to realize that very early on. 9, 11, 14 I started to realize that I could actually—I guess I didn’t because I went on to marry this person and have two kids with him. 9, 10, 11, 14 I think I was still trying to have that not be the truth. 9, 16 AS: Married Carey?  We didn’t get married until—Andy was in first grade by the time we were married. 9, 20 We were together for fourteen years, but we were only married for—actually I just recently got divorced, legally divorced, last year. 5, 9, 10, 12, 20 The year before. 20 He was an addict.  He is an addict.  AS: Did you know he was an addict when you married him? 13, 14, 15 When you two got together?  I met him when I was twenty-one and then I had Allison when I was twenty-nine, and we were friends for eight years. 5, 12, 18, 20 He had a girlfriend during that time, for months, and he’s older than me by eleven years. 5, 8, 12, 20 He was at the U [of M] attempting to get his Ph.  D. in philosophy.  I had gone back to the U—I was trying to finish up doing nights. 16, 19 That wasn’t working either.  Anyway, we smoked a lot of pot. 16, 17 That is a conversation I have had with myself a lot. 12, 17 You don’t know that when you are with someone who is smoking pot and they are smoking pot daily, but all these other things are… 13, 14, 15, 16 they’ve got a job, it’s not affecting their life. 11 You don’t realize it. 14 Oh, they aren’t ever going to be able to stop. 9, 10 I’m going to stop. 9, 10 I could take it or leave it. 6 I was always that way with alcohol, drugs, marijuana. 14, 16, 17 Take it or leave it. 6 I always could just take it or leave it. 6, 9, 12, 16, 17 I was a smoker though. 11 That I couldn’t take or leave. 6 I was a smoker.  I smoked from the time I was fourteen until the time I was fifty-four. 17 A long time.  So, the addiction was there.  When we had kids—it wasn’t a planned pregnancy.  Allison was not planned.  AS: And she’s your oldest? 5, 9, 20 JH: Yeah, she was not planned.  AS: What year was she born? 20 So I was twenty-nine, Carey was thirty-nine, almost forty. 9 He turned forty the year she was born I believe. 19, 20 The summer after she was born.  So, that happened, and I have always been someone who has been like, “This is the road my life is on.” 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 I never had this clear, “This is the way my life is going to turn out.” 11, 15, 16, 19 I am just going to go to college. 8, 9, 12 AS: You just kind of—how do you describe it? 9, 12, 16, 17 Go with the flow?  Follow the road. 9 AS: Float along.  I don’t know that I floated along because that sounds so passive, and I don’t think I was passive. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: Right, that does sound passive. 10 So when you got pregnant you decided you were going to keep the baby. 5, 12 I mean did that solidify your relationship? 16 Yes, yes. 14 Carey is a really good person.  He is a really good person.  I have to say if there’s ever been anyone I have been connected to in life it has been him. 11, 18 It has been hard because the addiction and mental illness started to really kick in and that takes a person away from you. 6, 9, 11, 14, 16 At that time, and during that period of time, I would say from that time until the next ten years, I felt really connected and really safe. 17, 18, 20 We had a great relationship and there were some underlying things going on. 11, 16 He was an addict and I was gay!  Aside from that!  [laughs]  I have to say, I never thought I would be a mother. 11, 12, 15 I am not very maternal.  I am not one of those—surprisingly enough I wanted to be an early childhood teacher and a mother. 11, 12, 13, 20 AS: But you didn’t have a mom. 15 My mother was a very, very good mother to us when we were little.  She likes little kids. 10 Once we got to be old enough where we could take care of ourselves she started having her own life. 6, 7, 9, 11, 20 And so she was a little bit absent. 7 In her defense, she is one of the oldest of ten. 5, 9, 20 She had taken care of siblings from the time she was… and she had us when she was seventeen. 5, 6, 7, 15 So her whole life had been taking care of little kids. 7, 11 I think as soon as she saw a glimmer of taking something for herself she did.  So the downside of that was that we all really still needed her and she was doing her own thing. 9, 13 She really was dealing with my dad’s mental illness and trying to do that. 13, 14, 16 Happiness, with religiosity in the background. 8, 13, 19 AS: Back to your early mothering— JH:  I loved being a mother to my kids. 13 I loved it. 13 I was surprised at how much I loved it. 13, 18 I quit my job, I had a paper route, I worked for a non-profit, I worked part-time. 14 Carey had a pretty decent job. 18 I own a house in northeast Minneapolis, which is tangential, but it was my house. 6, 9 Carey moved into that house and we just did what I am doing now. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14 We decided that this is the life we wanted. 11, 12, 13 I wanted to be home with Allison at the time. 12, 13, 19 He would go to work and we became really, you know, standard model of a family. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 I stayed home. 5, 9, 19 I went back to school, took classes. 8, 19, 20 I did some odd things. 16 I went to school to be an upholsterer. 8, 9 So I did upholstery out of my house. 6, 9 Then I got pregnant with Andy.  Then he was born.  I was a seamstress for a while, I did seamstressing. 9 I made dresses and stuff out of the house. 6, 9, 14, 16 Did a whole bunch of things like that. 9, 16 I had kind of a really mellow, hippy existence that I really enjoyed. 9, 15, 16, 17 On my deathbed when I’m harkening back on my life that will be my period of bliss. 11, 19 You never think that it’s going to go away. 15, 16 I don’t know where that has come from. 13, 14, 15, 19 But, anyway, AS: Do you want to stop? 9, 10, 13, 16 No, I’m good.  So, that surprised me that I enjoyed mothering as much as I did because I didn’t intend on being a mother. 12, 15, 18 I was struggling with the whole living this life that didn’t seem to fit in so many ways, but did fit. 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19 When I finally did decide that I couldn’t live this heterosexual life anymore my kids were in middle school. 8, 11, 13 People asked me, “What happened? 10, 12, 13 Have you ever had a pair of underwear that just doesn’t fit and... it's okay. 9, 12, 14 It’s okay, you can wear it.  You’ll get through the day with this underwear on but God, you want to take it off! 6, 13, 19 You know? 13, 14, 15 That’s what it was like living. 6 That’s how it felt for me. 17 I was in this life that wasn’t bad. 11 Carey was so kind, he’s a kind person. 16, 17 The addiction started, those things started to happen too. 9, 11, 12, 16 AS: Around that time?  JH: Around that same time.  I had to take some sort of step away from this. 6, 9, 12, 16, 17 I could have waited, maybe should have waited. 9 But I didn’t wait.  AS: How far apart are your children? 14, 20 JH: Twenty-two months. 8 So Andy was in sixth grade and Ali was in eighth grade and I moved into this building in northeast Minneapolis and met Jill, a woman I had a nine year relationship with. 5, 8, 9, 20 AS: Did your kids live with you?  They lived with their dad.  I moved away from the house because Carey did not want to leave the house. 6, 8, 9, 13, 16 That was my house, and I didn’t want to disrupt the kids and the house. 6, 9, 13 They were born in this house. 6, 9 They had fourteen years in this house. 6, 9, 20 I was going to do whatever it took to keep stability in this house. 6, 9, 12 Carey gave me money.  We figured out the equity of the house and he gave me enough to go buy something else and I put that money into this building. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 It was 2000 and the housing market was really hot.  It was right before the crash. 14 So, all I could buy was this building, and I bought this building and there was a part of me that was like I have this chunk of money. 7 I just started going back to school to get my teaching license so I went back to Augsburg [College]. 8, 9, 11, 12, 19 I knew that if I didn’t buy something with this—it was only $35,000, it wasn’t a huge chunk of money, but I knew if I didn’t buy real estate with it, it would not stay. 6, 7, 9, 12 It would be gone. 19 So I bought this building. 7 It had been a convenience store. 5, 9 It was open space. 17 Forty-two by forty-two.  It had a little bedroom in the back. 7, 14, 19 It had a kitchen.  It had some nice architecture features.  We lived in it…  the kids had tents. 15 Jill moved in, she had a child, and each child had a tent instead of a bedroom. 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 They talk about that. 10 Fondly and not fondly because I think it was a real transitionary period for Allison. 7, 13, 15 As she entered the end of middle school started to show some really serious signs of depression. 8, 9, 11, 12 She started cutting. 9, 11 I found that out in ninth grade. 20 I didn’t know she was doing it and the school counselor called me. 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15 I knew she had been having some depression issues, and then talking her to a therapist. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 So that started her whole therapy. 9, 11 Dealing with her depression.  Andy was a very quiet child.  Very introverted.  Allison is loud.  Any space she is in is all about her.  She is also very attractive, very articulate, and very intelligent. 10 If she is good or if she’s bad.  Andy is very quiet.  I could talk to Allison with what was happening with my sexuality. 10, 12, 13 With Andy I kept thinking I would wait until it seemed like he could handle it. 19 And I never really actually talked to him about it until recently. 10, 11, 15 I just kind of tried to make it okay for him. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 So Allison started having some really serious mental health issues. 9, 11, 14, 15 Andy was just quiet and he seemed okay. 9, 12, 19 He seemed like he was okay. 19 He got into video games a little bit. 10 He had friends. 12, 18 Never missed a day at school. 8, 19 Sweet.  A little bit fearful of things. 16 He was afraid of the water, he was afraid of a lot of things. 6, 16, 17 Didn’t like to be outside as much as I did. 10, 18 Jill had a cabin and we’d go to the cabin and he didn’t want to go to the cabin. 13 I would make him sometimes and coax him by saying, “You get to ride motorbikes,” but he didn’t want to be outside. 5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 18 He didn’t want to go swimming. 13 I didn’t recognize that as anxiety, partially because Allison was taking up so much. 18 I was going to school, and I almost didn’t make it through Augsburg because I was like a quarter away and then I was like, “Oh my God. 8, 9, 10, 16 I’m working full-time, I have two teenage kids, and I’m in school full-time.” 8, 11 I was signed up to do the Masters. 9 I was going to just do the Masters program. 9, 12 It would have been just another nine months. 8, 9, 12 I thought, “I just need the license.” 9, 11, 12, 13 That helped. 13, 16 I knew that if I didn’t get the license that I would… 6, 12 I did go into debt for this.  It was like $25,000 in debt.  Luckily, because I hadn’t graduated from the U and hadn’t gotten the degree I was eligible for a grant, so I got about $6,000 in grants to pay for that. 7, 8, 15, 16, 20 So that was pretty good. 18 I only had to do the education. 10 So I had everything else.  And religion because Augsburg is…  and those were actually kind of fun. 10, 16, 17 So I just had to do the education portion and two religion classes so it took me almost two years. 8, 9, 10, 12, 20 It was only supposed to take eighteen months. 6, 8 I ultimately didn’t get the Masters because I knew I just had to start attending what was going on with my children. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 AS: At this point Ali is about sixteen, seventeen? 15 JH: Almost sixteen. 9 AS: Is she using at this point?  She is not using.  Carey quit his job and is trying to be a writer. 16 I was supportive one hundred percent.  That was also the background. 8, 19 He had worked for a place for a long time that had gone out of business. 9, 11 He is now fifty-five years old, and he has decided that since his skills are fairly obsolete he doesn’t want to go back to school and he is going to be the writer that he has always wanted to be. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 At first I was kind of like, “You know what? 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 You deserve to have a year to kind of—” because he supported the kids. 16, 17, 20 I stayed home when they were little and I thought “Okay, I’ll do this. 5, 9, 11, 12, 19 I’ll pick up the slack.”  That coincided from just graduating from Augsburg, getting my teaching license, getting my first teaching job. 9, 12 So, I paid.  We were used to living very small anyways. 6, 9, 16, 17 So it was like “Okay, if you need this time it’s cool.” 13, 17 When it stretched into ten years and there was no child support at all, that was kind of a lot. 9, 16, 17, 20 You can’t just halfway through your kids’ childhood decide you aren’t going to work. 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 That is kind of part of what played into—and part of what happened was that his pot smoking, I saw that his addiction was having an effect on him, me, and the kids. 8, 12, 13, 16, 17 That coincided with me…  you know the underpants thing [laughs]. 13, 14, 15 The whole Carey and I separating from each other came down to “Let’s split up because she was gay.” 19 It never had anything to do with his addiction. 15 That’s the story, it was always the story, and it’s not the whole story. 9, 16, 17 It’s absolutely not the whole story. 9 AS: How was that for you as a mother?  Were you fine with that because your children needed another place to go? 11, 13, 14 Was his addiction affecting them?  JH: Yes.  Absolutely.  AS: Was there a protectiveness for you that you just let that story be about you being gay because you didn’t want to have to disrupt their lives even further by addressing his addiction? 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 JH: Yes.  That hits the nail.  I knew that I didn’t want to take it out on them. 6, 12, 13 AS: Right.  So the story was okay with you at the time. 9 It wasn’t okay with me internally.  AS: But as a mother it was okay with you in terms of what you were trying to provide your kids? 16 I don’t know if I want to use the word selfish but that is the first word that came to my mind, so I’m going to use it. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 He was selfish.  I felt tremendously guilty. 12, 17 So much so I couldn’t stand it. 9, 12, 18 So it was easier to not even stir it up partially because I didn’t want to face how guilty I felt because this was part of the reality of who I was. 9, 13, 15, 17 AS: You felt guilty about your…? 17 Breaking up my kids’ home because of my sexuality. 19 I knew there was so much there, but also a lot of it just came down to, “What do you have the energy to do? 6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 You just have to live.” 9, 12 Now, I’m in a relationship that’s not easy for either of us because we are both navigating this coming out late in life. 11 Jill had a child.  I was coming out to my family. 18 My siblings were okay with it. 5 My dad was okay with it.  My mother was...  [laughs] was okay with it.  Was not going to ever accept it.  Was trying I guess. 10, 16 It was a new identity. 6 I had been this heterosexual hippy mother for fifteen years in this neighborhood. 8, 20 The neighborhood in Northeast—I was very connected with people in that neighborhood. 8, 9, 18 People had opinions about what I had done.  So I was trying to get through school, and trying to finish it, and be responsible. 8, 16 Then Allison started cutting. 9, 11 There was just so much going on. 9, 12, 18 Addressing Carey’s addiction was very low on my—I knew it was going in the direction it was going. 6, 12, 14 All I could do was do my best. 9 This is the kids’ father. 5 They love him. 13 He is a very lovable person.  I wanted him to stop being an addict and be a better father, but I wasn’t going to be able to make that happen. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 I wasn’t going to take them away from him, but I did try to protect them from the reality that he was an addict. 6, 16 When they were older and in the car as if 5, 7, 20 I’m not even there driving having a conversation about their dad being stoned. 9, 12, 14, 15 They knew the whole time. 6, 12 AS: But you still somehow as a mother thought you could protect them. 9, 11, 12 JH: Absolutely.  I have protected them by not telling them.  What a mistake. 6, 9 What a mistake. 6, 9 I can’t undo that.  I protected them by keeping them with me. 11, 12 And he, come to find out, started giving Andy pot when he was in high school. 8, 9, 11, 13, 19 I didn’t know 13, 14, 15 Andy was smoking pot, and he got busted at school. 8, 9 And I was like, “Where are you getting pot? 10 You don’t have a job.”  AS: Would you say he loved his dad? 13 He loves his dad. 13 Both the kids love their dad. 13 Andy has something going on with his dad right now, and my dad died all during that. 14 Is calling it a shit storm okay? 7, 9 [laughs]  I have a mixed CD that is called “My Fucked up 48th Year in Music.” 7 Because I was forty-eight when all of this happened. 12, 13 Allison went off to college. 8 She went to high school. 8 She went to Sweden almost for a year as an exchange student and it was really challenging with her depression. 6, 9, 16, 20 She was having bouts of depression there and that was really hard because she was away. 11, 16 I could see that her mental health was really just starting to go on this really teeter tottery thing where… 9, 11, 12, 14 she had stopped cutting for a couple of years. 9, 10, 20 This whole, “I want to go to Sweden as an exchange student,” was her whole motivation. 6, 9, 13, 16 She came to me one day and she had this interest in ska music. 9, 19 She is Swedish—we are Swedish.  I said, “If you want to go to Sweden make it happen. 6, 12, 13, 16 I’ll help you make it happen.” 12, 13, 16 She had a job—she worked at a nursing home. 19 She saved up $2,000 dollars.  I paid for the plane ticket. 13 Took out a loan.  Which was really big for me. 8 Took out a loan for about $3,000 so I could pay for the plane ticket and pay for her fees, so then she went to Sweden. 6, 13, 16 She was sixteen.  She came home and turned sixteen. 19 And it was really brave.  She came home and was struggling with high school, struggling finding her place in high school. 8, 9, 11, 19 She is really smart, and that was hard. 11, 20 We had a couple years when I thought she was doing really well. 11, 12, 20 Was really interested in linguistics. 9, 11, 19 Very gifted with language. 13 Allison is very gifted when it comes to language, writing. 13, 19 She spoke very fluent Swedish when she came back. 19 She learned Korean, Spanish. 12, 17 She wanted to be something in linguistics. 9, 12, 13 Either writing, being a translator. 7 She thought she would want to be a person who did the subtitles in movies. 11, 12, 13 When she was a senior she did post-secondary at the U. So, her whole senior year she went to the U of M. That summer got on Abilify. 9, 20 That was working with her bipolar.  She was having some bouts with serious depression but we were hopeful that they were getting better. 10 She was doing behavior therapy, and that was helping. 13 She got accepted to McGill [University] in Montreal. 13 That was exciting.  And she didn’t send any of the paperwork in. 12 And so that all fell through. 15 At the time I was really disappointed because I was worried about the idea of her going to Montreal. 11 She was like “I want to go to McGill and speak French there. 13 This is this great university.” 11, 13, 14 Of course as a mother I don’t know how we are going to pay for it and I’m just going to let go and we are going to figure it out. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 But she didn’t send the paperwork in. 12 I found out later it was intentional. 15 She just got really scared and wasn’t ready. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 I’m not ready I’m afraid to be away. 16 I think she knew that her depression was not okay. 6, 12 She wasn’t well enough to go. 20 I was like, “You know what? 10, 13, 14, 15 We’ll try again next year. 16, 20 If you still want to go to McGill next year.” 9, 13, 20 So, she went to the U of M and studied linguistics and started working at a pizza place on campus. 8, 9, 11 Stadium Village.  And met this young man named Andy. 5, 6, 14 I liked him. 10, 18 He was from the Iron Range.  He seemed like a nice guy. 19 He was going to school to be a teacher. 8 A little older than her. 5, 20 And I was really relieved because I was kind of like, “Okay, she’s got somebody who is watching over her.” 10, 16, 17 Because she is seriously bipolar. 15 But it turns out he was an addict. 19 It turns up he had broken his back in high school in a skate board accident and was an opiate addict. 5, 7, 8, 19 And had been since high school. 8 Was he using pills or heroin?  He was using pills.  Allison had not really dabbled in using anything other than—she had lived with this other woman for a while, and this younger—Allison had some issues with alcohol. 5, 14, 15 She told me about Allison drinking too much, so I don't know if Allison was drinking too much. 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 I sensed that she had, but I don’t know. 13, 14, 15, 17 So, Allison was working at the pizza place and going to school. 8, 11 Then that’s when the odd stuff starts happening. 9, 11, 12, 13 “Can I borrow $50 because I don't have enough?” 20 The stories. 9, 18 The stories started, you know? 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 The elaborate stories of tuition and of this or that. 9, 18 And at first you have no clue. 9 “Okay, that’s reasonable.”  “Mom, can I have money for groceries?”  Is there anyway you can take us to Target and get some groceries? 6, 16 I need to pay for…” 13, 16 AS: All of a sudden she had a lot of financial needs that she didn’t have before. 13, 17 She had a lot of financial needs. 13, 17 There was some erratic behavior that I couldn’t understand. 9, 12, 16 I would meet her for coffee or something and she would be manic. 13 Just manic. 9 I was like, “Oh my gosh. 10, 17 Her bipolar is getting…”  That was the first place I went. 9, 11 Her bipolar was getting worse.  Then I started seeing these things right here on her arm. 9, 11, 14, 16 Like, this darkness.  I thought “Oh my god she's cutting again. 10, 11, 12 She's cutting her arm.”  I didn't realize it was tracks. 14 I didn’t realize that these were tracks. 14 She wasn’t even hiding them from me. 15 She wasn’t covering them up, and I didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 So I didn’t know… 13, 14, 15 I don't know why I didn't say anything. 13, 14, 15 I didn’t know what I was going to do. 13, 14, 15 So, I thought she was cutting again. 11, 12 I think I said to her, “Are you cutting again?”  I still didn’t suspect heroin. 9 I had no clue.  And looking back it’s like, “You dipshit! 10, 19 How do you miss it?”  AS: With the nodding off.  I didn't even know what heroin use looked like. 10, 13, 14, 15 I wouldn’t have even expected it. 15 JH: Yeah, and this was seven years ago. 20 This is something that even in the last seven years has risen to the top. 9, 15, 20 Growing up in the ‘70s, heroin killed people. 7 People don’t use heroin because it’s so flipping dangerous. 9, 18 My child isn’t using heroin.  She dropped out of school. 8, 14 Was still working at the pizza place. 9, 11 She was being persecuted by the owner of the pizza place. 11 The guy was kind of a jerk, so when she told me the story that he was accusing her of stealing from the till I’m still going, “Oh my God. 9, 10, 16, 17, 20 You poor thing.”  She calls, “Mom, I’m going into treatment.” 7, 9, 16 What are you going into treatment for? 9, 16 Well, she tells me, “Andy takes Percocet for his back, and I started using it and now I’m addicted to it.” 6, 9, 11, 14, 19 All right. 14 “I’m going into treatment,” I’m like “Okay that’s good.” 9, 16 She goes into treatment, and I think she lasted, I don’t even remember. 9, 15, 16 She’s been in treatment so many times I couldn’t tell you. 9, 16, 18 AS: She’s been in so many times you couldn’t... 18 Ten at least. 9 Ten at least, and then jail for a year. 9, 20 So this is in six years. 20 That was her first time though. 9, 11 AS: How did she end up in jail? 12 JH: Ohio.  AS: So did she kind of flee? 16, 17 For a circumstance here? 9 Is Andy still in the picture? 9 Her and Andy lived here for a while.  I mean you know the stories. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 I mean there are so many stories I don’t even know how they have stitched together over the last six years, but at some point she met up with this dude named Shake. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 Bad dude, bad dude.  He’s got some scam he’s doing with cell phones that she’s in on. 7 Probably for dealers? 13 I don’t even know. 13, 14, 15 I can’t even ask at this point. 15 I mean you fast forward… 9, 16 I’ve been through, “Oh, she’s going through treatment. 9, 16 She’s doing better.”  “Oh, yes you can come stay with me.” 9, 13, 14, 19 I’m going to love you back to health. 13, 14, 19 I’m going to walk in and she’s shooting up at the kitchen table.  AS: That happened? 12, 13 Oh yeah. 10 I’m going to have my work friends over, and you are going to come home and nod off at the table. 12, 13, 18, 19 I used to have an end of the year school party at my school where all my teacher friends would come here and have a party here and she came home. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 Her and Andy came home wasted. 9, 19 Absolutely wasted. 9 Talking to my friends, nodding off while they were talking. 10, 12, 18 because everybody knew. 6, 12 Everybody knew and I couldn’t… 6, 12 it was a disaster. 9, 20 I was in the middle of this disaster. 8, 9, 20 I’m the chairman of the board of this school, and my child is coming home on heroin with her boyfriend. 5, 8, 12, 19 Nodding off.  JH: I’m trying to remember. 16 I think it kind of solved itself. 16, 17 We were all sitting at the table back there. 13, 19 By the time they came home the party was down to some of the people who absolutely knew what was going on because I took a leave of absence to deal with what was going on. 6, 12, 13, 19 To help her navigate what was going on. 13 Her and Andy went downstairs. 9 I am trying to even remember it. 15, 16 It was one of those things like the people who were left were kind of looking at me, and I could tell that they could feel for me because she was supposed to be clean. 6, 16, 17 She had just gotten out of treatment. 9, 12, 15, 16 She was coming to stay with me because— AS: Instead of a sober house. 6, 9 And I kicked them out very shortly after. 16 That was one of those things where I said, “You two are out of the house in an hour or I call the police to come and take you out of the house, so get what you need and get out of my house.” 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 19 I went to my friend Linda’s and I got everything. 12 I took my computer. 10 She ended up stealing my guitar, and I got it back. 9, 10, 12, 19 Carey went and got it for me.  I had a mandolin at the time, she stole that. 9, 18 Left behind just shit. 9, 12 I went down and cleaned up and found paraphernalia:  needles, bags, all that crap. 13 AS: Food and...?  Andy was still living here. 6, 9 My son lived here at the time.  He’s smoking pot, and he’s getting sicker.  I’ve already had him taken away once by COPE. 6, 16 AS: What’s COPE?  JH: COPE is the Community—psychiatric team.  Psychiatric emergency team. 7 That’s a whole other tangential story. 9 How are you functioning at this point?  Are you just getting through it? 9, 12 Are you just kind of in that— JH: I had a really good friend who it also turns out has marijuana issues, and I ended up having to stay away from her as well. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 But we were friends for thirty years. 12, 18, 20 Do you know my friend Theresa? 12, 13, 14, 15 The blonde?  She is an interesting person, but she has been steady my entire life. 9, 11, 19 Is she the one who grew up in Texas?  That was Kit.  Theresa was tall and skinny and probably has one of the most Minnesotan accents of the whole group.  She is a person who you will never guess she is as intelligent as she it. 10, 15 But anyways I have known her ever since I was nine. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 We grew up across the street from each other. 9 AS: Is she the psychiatric nurse?  AS: Her sister… 5, 9 Was schizophrenic and died at thirty-one of natural causes. 9 Anyways, she helped me a lot. 13, 16, 17 My friend Linda was a really big help. 8, 12, 13 She had her own addiction issues. 14, 15 I mean I was really connected at my work. 16, 18 I worked constantly. 9 I was committed to work.  I was very connected at that school. 8, 18 It was a mission.  I shifted my focus to early childhood literacy. 8, 11, 15 AS: That was a charter school? 8 I didn’t date or anything.  Jill and I had broken up. 5 I don’t want to say it was the best time. 9, 13 AS: Did you have many resources around like parenting or mothering through addiction or around mental health issues? 8, 10, 14, 15, 16 Did you have any support at this time?  What was your strategy? 9 I realized something was going on with Andy. 14 I knew it started out as anxiety and all these other symptoms started adding to his anxiety. 6, 9, 11, 12 I knew that something was going on with him. 6, 12 I contacted Nar-Anon, and I went to their parent or their family’s education—it’s a twelve week thing. 10, 16, 18 I went to this group in St. Paul called Families Anonymous, but that wasn’t until later. 7 I got a therapist that I saw, Nancy was her name. 6, 9 I saw her off and on.  I started getting into Buddhism. 9, 11 I started looking to spiritual things because clearly that was the only thing I could hold onto at this point. 9, 11, 16, 20 The only thing that was going to help. 13 I mean, I don’t know if it is this way for you, but it is this way for me. 13, 14, 15, 16 At my spiritual group that I go to at church this week the topic is, “What was your spiritual awakening?”  Bring a story of your spiritual awakening. 9 I’m like, “Oh my God, I don’t know what to bring because I don’t have a story.” 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 It happened over such a long period of time. 12, 13 And all these things and all these really challenging things that, yes, they bring up emotions and tears. 14, 16 They have got me here and I kind of like who I am [laughs]. 16, 17 You know? 13, 14, 15 That’s tangential, but I don’t like all these… 10 I’m not going to say I’m not going to be one of those people that’s going to be grateful for my child’s addiction.  I responded to it by going inward and outward and reaching out to people. 13 I have good friends. 12, 18 I have people that get what’s going on.  I have people that I can go to and say, “My child is an addict and this is what my weekend was like.” 10, 12, 19 And they don’t judge me.  I don’t know if I lucked out or if it… 13, 14, 15 you know natural selection, how that happened. 12, 13, 14, 15 I have and am surrounded in my life by people like that. 8, 11 They aren’t my family. 18 It’s not my family. 18 AS: The stigma around addiction didn’t affect how you reached out to people around you to tell them what was going on in your life? 9, 11, 13 JH: Not people I really cared about. 7, 11, 12 Not the people that mattered. 12, 20 When I changed jobs and left Sojourner and went to a new school I didn’t talk about the fact that my child was an addict. 6, 8, 10, 16 AS: But at Sojouner there were colleagues that knew. 6, 12 Yes, absolutely.  I had a lot of support. 17 Because this is about mothering, I’m so cognizant of trying to stay on that topic about mothering, and I wanted to touch on this toggle that occurred with me where I would toggle between, “I need to do everything I can to be the mother that makes this okay,” to, “I have to walk away from you. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 I have to save myself.”  What came up was, “I don’t give a shit! 6, 19 Do what you want. 13 Mess up your life. 11 Get away from me. 16 I’m moving.”  There was a time when I thought “I’m selling this house and I’m moving. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 You will never see me again. 15 You guys do what…”  You know? 13, 14, 15 Then, “No, that’s not okay.”  Then getting really involved and, “Yes, you can come live with me after….” 13, 19 There were four different times I said, “Yes, you can come live with me after treatment.” 9, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 Until I realized, “You can never live with me again. 14, 15 You can’t even come to my house.” 6, 9, 13, 15, 19 You know? 13, 14, 15 I hope it’s not always that way, but it’s that way now. 10, 14, 16, 17 I’m not saying I have reached this place of equilibrium, or some kind of balance where I’m doing the right thing, but it is definitely more balanced where I would have these… 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 I would oscillate between, “I don’t care about these people. 7 I have these three—” Carey and the two kids all kind of have this sameness where they are very smart, very intellectual, and they are very addicted, and they are very mentally ill. 14, 16, 17, 20 They have told me they had this conversation about how I’m the dumb one in the family. 12, 18, 20 I’m not the intellect.  I'm not the intellectual in the family, but I’m the only one that can function. 18 [laughs]  Yeah, you know, I’ll be the dumb one! 13, 14, 15 One of the women in one of my circles last week was talking about how she has come to learn that intelligence is not necessarily an indicator for anything worthwhile in a person [laughs]. 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19 She said she was married to a really intelligent person but he turned out to be mentally ill, or… 14, 19 And you know that is what the three of them are. 13, 14, 15 I do feel very separate from them. 16 It is them and me in this family of four. 18 Carey and I have constant conversations about the kids and about things. 9, 12, 16 I never address his addiction. 14, 15 He’s an adult.  He has lost all of his teeth because he doesn’t take care of himself. 6, 7, 9 He is sixty-seven years old. 20 He looks like he is about ninety.  Every email he send me ends with “I love you” [laughs]. 12, 13 He’s very, “We’re in this life together for better or worse. 11 You are what you are I accept you for what you are.”  You are a hopeless addict. 10 You are hopeless. 10 He has written three books, published them all himself. 15 Loves his children, but enables until the end. 12, 14 Ali lives with him now. 14 She went to court yesterday for some charge. 9, 14, 17, 19 I’m sure it was a possession charge. 15, 17 I don’t even ask her what the charges are anymore. 13, 15, 17 AS: At what point did you stop asking what her charges were? 9, 10, 13, 17 When were you able to detach?  We talk a lot about detaching with love. 10, 13, 17 Did that happen because of multiple disasters? 9, 12, 20 Yes.  AS: The impact of them over time? 10 JH: Yes.  AS: Or was there a moment that you remember when you were just done? 9, 12, 13, 15 I don’t think there was a moment—I am not that kind of a light bulb person. 13, 15, 16, 17 I am a slow, brooding Scandinavian. 8 Things happen over time. 12 I don’t even know that it has happened yet, the detachment. 12, 13, 14, 15 I mean I’m still attached. 9, 16 I get the email that she has gotten off, and I want her to go to jail. 13, 15 I want her to be sentenced to treatment. 7, 9, 13, 15, 16 I get this email from Carey, “Guess what?  Ali got off!”  I get this pit in my stomach and I go, “Okay, well that’s…” 9 I walk away from it. 16 I have really applied those, “I cannot control it, it is not about me, she is an adult.” 17 This is something relating back to mothering. 19 I am not particularly maternal. 18 I’ve got a mother view.  I’ve got to fix this. 16 I’ve got to be with you.  I want you to have your own life kind of. 11, 13, 16, 17 I’m not overly involved.  I think if my children were not addicts and had mental illness I don’t know if I would be over involved either. 13, 14, 15 That’s how my mother was.  That’s how I was mothered. 12 I turned eighteen and moved out of the house. 6, 8, 9, 19 In the course of forty years I probably met my mother for lunch or dinner, not a birthday or something, a half dozen times. 5, 6, 18, 19, 20 I don’t have a relationship with her.  I have an interaction with her. 10 And that’s how I was mothered. 12 I have these conflicts.  I don’t necessarily want to be that kind of mother but I don’t know anything else. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I have these children with these really dramatic needs and I care about them and I will help them, but I can’t fix it. 7, 13, 14, 16 I am very aware that I can’t fix it. 16 Even with Andy I can’t fix it. 16 There is a high likelihood he will kill himself. 7, 8, 10 I know that. 13, 14, 15 I accept that.  There is a high likelihood Allison will kill herself, on purpose or accidentally. 7, 8, 10 Surprisingly enough that doesn’t conjure up the same kinds of emotions as some of the other things have because I have so reconciled that. 16, 17, 20 AS: You have prepared for their death? 12 Is that what you are saying? 11 That sounds so horrible to say out loud. 10, 16, 17 I know that you understand that and I can say that out loud. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 There are places I can’t say that out loud. 11, 17 There are a number of people I can say that out loud to.  Allison was on a respirator for three days. 19 Three days. 19 They said, “We don’t know if she is going to pull out of this opiate overdose. 13, 14, 15 Intentional opiate overdose.” 15 So when you come that close… 13, 19 I came home and that was the third time. 19, 20 That was the third time I had been to that brink with her. 20 It is not that it doesn’t matter because it does matter. 20 It’s that it just gives you this thing where you go, “Okay, I’m very likely to lose my child before me.” 6, 9, 10, 12 This is something that I don’t know… 13, 14, 15 I also don’t often say out loud because I don’t know if it will make people irritated or mad, but I’m going to say it. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 This is oddly comforting to me.  I grew up in the Vietnam War era, and my uncle was in Vietnam, and I lived next to a guy who’s son was in Vietnam.  All those mothers who had all those children in Vietnam sat in the same place I sit every day. 11, 13, 14, 19 Not knowing whether or not their child will survive that day. 13, 14, 15, 19 Knowing their child is engaged in something so dangerous that their life is [unclear]. 11, 14, 18 Why is that comforting?  To know that I’m not the first person. 9, 13, 14, 15 That I am not the only mother.  That I am not isolated in this being a mother who is on the brink of losing her child.  I know there are other situations that mothers are in where their children are doing dangerous things but that’s the one that comes up in my head. 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 All these years of my childhood, because as a child that is what I thought about surprisingly enough. 11, 12, 20 I have very distinct memories where as a child of eight, nine, ten, eleven thinking, “I feel sorry for the moms.” 9, 10, 15, 16, 18 And I felt sorry for mothers because they had kids who were in Vietnam that were being killed. 7, 10, 17 I think you are too young to remember that. 14 It was on TV every night. 19 How many kids had died?  All I could think about was all of these boys had mothers who had lost their children in combat. 8, 9, 14 I just listened to this Invisibilia [podcast] thing about, “You can’t control the thoughts that come up in your mind.” 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 Why did those thoughts about mothers in Vietnam come up? 11, 12, 13, 19 I found it comforting.  AS: When did that come up for you recently? 13, 19 A couple years into Ali’s addiction. 20 Maybe the second almost death. 9, 20 There were a number of not even overdoses where… 15 once you realize your child is doing heroin you walk it every day. 14, 19 Every day. 19 Every time your phone rings. 7 How many times do you change your phone ringer because the sound is so anxiety provoking? 7, 10, 16, 18 I cannot stand the sound of my own phone ringing. 7, 9, 10, 12 I very rarely take my phone out at work in the coffee shop. 6, 7 I had it out for some reason yesterday and I was at the tell ringing up someone’s coffee order and my phone was back on the shelf and the ringer went off. 7, 9, 14, 19 This is even a new ringer [laughs]. 6, 15 And off in the distance I heard my phone and I was very aware of the physiological response in my body where I got hot. 7, 9, 15 I was standing at the till talking to somebody who I knew and I could tell that my face started to turn red because I was having this anxiety and I said, it was a woman, I said “I’m having a hot flash.” 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 I didn’t want to say I’m having an anxiety response to my own phone ringing and this is because my child is a heroin addict and I have a child who is schizophrenic who tried to cut his own penis off, so any time my phone rings I’m scared shitless [laughs]. 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 You know? 13, 14, 15 That’s why I don’t call people very much. 7, 18 I text and Facebook because for me it’s a less scary way AS: Jarring. 7, 16 JH: Jarring…  a phone call is jarring for me because it is. 7 AS: So can you talk a little bit about, because we have prior knowledge of each other you never really talked about what happened to your son 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Andy when he was diagnosed and what he was diagnosed with.  Can you just explain a little bit about how that happened? 9, 12, 13 You did talk a little bit about that simultaneity with Ali’s addiction. 10 You called COPE, was it? 7 He got expelled from high school for smoking pot. 8 He had never missed a day of school from kindergarten to senior year. 8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 Never missed a day of school. 8, 19 Got expelled halfway through his senior year because he was smoking pot in the parking lot. 17, 20 Came back and got caught. 19 I kind of knew he was smoking pot… 6, 12, 16, 17 AS: And this is when she is 19, been in treatment... 9, 16 JH: Ali is…  yes… 14 Ali’s addiction is…  I’m not sure that this thing that starts with Andy in high school. 8, 9, 11, 15 I’m not sure… 15 he’s a senior, Ali is 19, I’m not sure yet that I know she is an addict. 13, 14, 15, 20 He gets expelled, finishes with an alternative program, gets out, and then Andy got obsessed with video games. 10 He had a room in the basement and so we’d… 7 it was just me and Andy living here and my dad died. 6, 9, 12 My dad died that summer.  That was another story but I won’t tangentially go off on that but that was kind of… 9, 16, 17 I went into what I would say was just a serious depression. 9, 12 Just depression. 9 I was off for the summer.  Good and bad.  Basically, a number of things had happened. 7, 12, 13, 16 My relationship with Jill.  There were so many things that had just… 9, 12, 16 I suffered from depression. 12 Andy kind of was just doing his thing and he was starting to smoke pot and I was kind of addressing it. 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 Ali was off to school and things were starting to get bad with her. 8, 9, 11, 16 I mean I wasn’t… 16 I didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 It wasn’t that I was completely ignoring it I just didn’t know what to do. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Carey wasn’t any help. 13 I was kind of by myself. 16, 17 I had been in this relationship for nine years that was over, and she was kind of hostile. 9, 16, 17, 20 So I had some hostility… 9 I might have been drinking a little bit that summer. 6, 14 I know I was depressed. 12, 13, 14, 15 I know I was really concerned about whether or not I was going to be able to go back to work in September. 13, 14, 15, 19 That is when I started seeing a therapist. 6, 9, 11 My dad had a surgery that led to a heart attack.  Had a surgery after he had a really long manic episode where he really wasn’t taking care of himself. 7 Led to a heart attack where they resuscitated him.  It took forty-five minutes of resuscitation and put him on life support so we could get there in time to say goodbye to him. 7, 10, 11 Oh, the other thing was my sister was an addict. 5, 9 A gambling addict.  I had taken over her house to avoid a housing foreclosure. 6, 9, 15 That was a whole other story that was going on. 9 My dad has a heart attack, they put him on life support. 10, 11 We get there.  My sister didn’t want to take him off life support so he could die. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13 He was on life support for twenty-one days. 11, 19 Finally the doctors were like, “We have to take him off. 6, 10 Everything else is shutting down.”  She went flipping nuts.  He was basically brain dead. 7, 11 She claimed that he squeezed her hand.  She claimed that he said he loved her. 13 Said he said goodbye to her.  I mean this man has been brain dead for twenty-one days and my brother and I are like “Please, please.” 5, 16, 19 After eleven days I just went in and I said goodbye. 9, 12, 19 I said, “Dad, I don’t know when she is going to let you go, but I’ll come back when it is time.” 13, 14, 15, 19 So all those things were happening that kind of led to this depression, and Andy starts getting this anxiety thing. 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 He won’t leave the house. 6, 9 He asked for a bulletproof vest for his birthday. 10, 19 You know… 13, 14, 15 you have to get a job, you have to do something.  He is becoming more and more reclusive.  I am fighting with him constantly to get out of the house. 6, 9 He starts smoking pot. 9, 11 He can’t stop smoking pot. 9, 10 That’s not good for you!  I wasn’t getting help from Carey. 13 He said, “He’s eighteen years old.” 20 I sign Andy up and he decided—he doesn’t decide. 12 I helped him decide he was going to do something if he was going to live with me. 13, 16 He was going to go to college or work. 8 What do you want to do? 13 Go to school or work? 8 He goes to Minneapolis Community College.  Sign him up.  He is now becoming afraid of everything. 14 I am seeing this just slowly build. 9, 12 He is afraid of the grocery store, he is afraid of people. 5, 9 He can’t make eye contact. 10, 16 He doesn’t make eye contact. 10, 16 He just… anxiety, you know, if we go into a restaurant, I would take him out for a hamburger and it is crowded and he would start to have this physical kind of panic attack. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 He’s having panic attacks.  He’s staying in his room, he’s playing video games. 7, 9, 10, 19 I shut the Internet off.  I completely shut the Internet off. 14, 19 I had no Internet, TV.  I am trying to… 16 It’s like if you see that your kid is using a drug and you are the one bringing the drug into the house. 6, 9, 14 That’s how it was with the Internet.  He goes to school for one quarter and I think, “Okay, he is just having some…” and then this is when I’m starting and Allison is starting to fall apart too… 8, 9, 11, 12, 20 we sign up.  I’m paying for this out of pocket by the way. 11, 16 [laughs]  The second quarter: 20 I’m working, I realize he’s not going to school. 8, 14 So, he’s smoking, he doesn’t go to school, he’s not going, he’s getting more and more reclusive. 8 He’s smoking pot and I said, “These are the rules of my house: you can’t smoke pot, and you’ve got to do something.” 6, 9, 12 I signed him up for therapy.  “I’m taking you to therapy.”  I’m monitoring everything.  I’m going down when I come home from work and saying, “You need to get up and we are going to go to the parkway and we are going for a walk.” 11, 13, 16, 19 I’m dragging his six and a half foot butt up the parkway. 14, 16, 20 I’m doing all this stuff to try and get him to not do what I know is happening and that is he’s sinking into this mental illness that I’ve seen, you know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I’ve seen it.  AS: It was familiar.  It was familiar.  You know I didn’t want it to be true. 13, 14, 15 You don’t want it to be true. 13 I came home one time and this is while I'm toggling through this… 19 I’ve had enough. 20 What happens is I—this is a common thing I think. 12 I do all these things and then I’ve had enough and I can’t do it anymore. 13, 16, 20 I just want to curl up in a ball and die. 8, 9, 12, 13 I never would kill myself, but there were nights where I would think, “If I don’t wake up I’m okay with that. 7, 15, 19 I’m okay with not waking up tomorrow.”  [laughs]  I don’t know if that’s going to happen. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: If I die before I wake…  If I die before I wake…  oh well!  So, I kicked him out because he won’t adhere to my rules. 12 “You can’t live with me.”  He goes to live with his dad who is still living in our house in northeast Minneapolis, but has let it go into foreclosure. 6, 9, 15, 19 Just stopped paying for it. 9, 10, 11, 16, 20 So Ali who is starting to use is living there, and Andy. 6, 9, 11 And the timeline starts to get blurry for me because it is just like—I mean it is a shit storm. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 So, I just knew I had to separate myself. 6, 9, 12 I had to deal with my… 13 I still had to work, I still had all these things I have to do. 9, 16 And, all this stuff is going on. 9 I’m not completely cutting myself off from them. 14, 19 By now I know that she’s an addict. 13, 14, 15 I found out it was heroin on the phone at work talking to someone who was doing her Rule 25 Assessment, getting information from me. 7, 10, 17 I’m at work and I get this phone call on my prep. 7 I know she’s getting a Rule 25 Assessment, this is maybe her second time in treatment. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I’m in my classroom and I see the phone and I’m like, “Okay, I’m supposed to be getting this phone call,” and I talk to the… 6, 7, 10, 20 “So, Allison has been using heroin for the last year and a half.” 9, 20 Are you kidding me?”  “Oh, you didn’t know that?” 13, 14, 15 “No, I had no idea.” 11 I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. 9, 17 I almost puked. 9 I almost puked. 9 This is such a distinct memory because I have such a good visual of my own classroom. 7, 9, 20 I remember my kids were gone and there were no students because they were at music or wherever they were. 9, 14, 19 I was walking around with the phone and I remember just rocking back and forth because I knew that I had to get rid of the panic before twenty-eight eight-year-olds came back. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20 I was still a smoker at the time and I remember as soon as I got off the phone I went to my purse and I grabbed my cigarettes and I told my co-teacher I said, “If I’m not back in fifteen minutes will you get my kids?” 7, 9, 19, 20 I just walked out the back door and up the block and lit a cigarette and just paced back and around the block. 9, 12, 17, 19 I was a block from the school because I had to smoke so bad. 8 I think I just kept saying, “Oh my fucking God. 9, 11, 12 Oh my God.  Oh my God.”  You know? 13, 14, 15 I bet that is the first I had heard heroin. 9, 15 All of that, you know, ‘60s stuff that I had grown up with. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17 Nw that was Allison.  I think at that point it felt like a death sentence. 7, 15, 17 That is really dramatic and I understand how dramatic that is but that’s what— AS: But you knew immediately the impact of that. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 Of it being heroin and not Percocet.  I was thinking it was Percocet.  Or Oxycontin.  AS: So get back to Andy. 19 Andy.  So I kicked him out, he went to live with Carey.  I went over, I would call him. 7 He was just getting—I don’t know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He was doing drugs, not getting out of bed, or something. 14 I stepped away for maybe a month or two or just like you know I would call him but I was really like, I mean by now they are eighteen and twenty, you know? 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Carey is sixty—I don’t know how old he is. 13, 14, 15, 20 These are people that I….  So, I call and I talked to Andy and I talk to him and he was not making sense. 7, 10, 11, 17 I went over there and something was tremendously wrong. 12 I didn’t know if it was drugs—I didn’t know what it was. 13, 14, 15 Carey’s elderly mother was living with them at the time, and I was talking to Andy and I was like, “So what’s going on?” 6, 10 And he was not making sense. 17 He was delusional.  I got up.  Carey’s mom was sitting in the living room. 6, 7, 13, 15 Carey was sitting on the couch, and I said, “Do you have any awareness of how sick our child is?” 13 I said, “I’m calling the county. 7 Prepare for it.”  I got in my car and I called my friend and I said, “What do I have to do? 7, 12 Who do I call?” 7 She told me to call COPE. 7, 20 She said, “This is what you say.  This is what you need to say to get people up there. 13 Don’t lie.  But this is how it works.” 14 “This is how the system works. 8, 9, 14 If you say you’ll take him to your house, they will let you. 6, 9, 19 But, you don’t want that. 13 You say he can’t…”  So I called and I said, “What is going on?” 7 And one of the things she said, “Parents tend to want to mitigate the severity of the danger. 12, 13, 15, 16 You don’t want to think that your child is dangerous to themselves or someone else. 13, 18 So you say ‘No, I don’t think so.’  Don’t say that.”  She said, “Don’t say that, if you had any…  don’t lie.  But if you think he is a danger to himself you say ‘My son is a danger to himself.’  And you say it over and over again.”  So, she really was helpful that way for me to advocate for him to be taken in and they took him. 6, 10, 13, 16 They came. 19 They assessed him.  Carey’s mom screamed at me. 15 Screamed at me.  That I was the reason the kids were messed up because I was a lesbian. 8 Oh my God.  He also came from a very religious background. 8, 19 His dad was a missionary and was killed was in Ethiopia and that is a whole other story. 7, 9, 15 [laughs]  She is screaming at me and I’m like, “This is my child. 10 This is my child to fix.” 16 They took a 72-hour hold on… 20 that was his first. 9 They didn’t keep him. 12 He came back and lived here. 19 I mean, there are a lot of details, but he kept smoking pot and kept trying to… 16, 17 I mean they both simultaneously were just going down. 9, 12, 16 It was just one tripping over the other. 9, 12 It just came to me having to step away from both of them in that way that people in recovery step away and not the way people in panic step away. 9, 12, 16, 19 I was stepping away in panic a lot. 9, 12, 16, 17 And that wasn’t helpful and then when I realized, “I’ve got to recover, I’ve got to take care of myself. 6, 7, 13, 14 I’ve got to fix myself.” 16 Not fix myself, but I’ve got to attend to myself. 12, 15, 16 Because I’m not being a good mother.  I’m not being a good mother.  I have to mother.  I have to mother these disasters. 9, 20 That was the first, the very first key to me being able to do it better was to accept it for what it was. 9 Because the whole time I was mothering in panic and reacting in panic I was not accepting that this is what I got. 10 These are my children. 14 I mean they are not what I thought it would be. 11, 12, 16 It is not what I thought it would be. 11, 12 It is not what some of my friends are going through. 12, 18 That's really hard. 11 Because all of my friends’ kids were having successful families. 12, 18 They are of that age of going to college. 8 Not being addicts and schizophrenics.  So, that first place wasn’t a light bulb moment, and still maybe isn’t completely solid, but is the acceptance. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 And that was when Buddhism came in because acceptance is everything. 19 Not accepting is all struggle. 9 You accept what it is.  You accept that it is yours.  AS: That is really powerful. 15 And when it is your children. 14 The other thing that I let myself do and I still let myself do is I let myself mourn my losses. 9, 19 That is something I have learned as an adult that I was not allowed to do as a child. 12, 17 Whether it’s a relationship like my one with Kathy or Jill—but, my children. 14 I have let myself mourn the loss of having the kids I thought I would have. 11, 12, 19 I thought I would have different children. 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 I thought that they were really Waldorf-y kids. 11, 12 [laughs]  I really thought that that’s what I would end up with. 11, 12 Even with Carey’s addiction—I let myself mourn that. 19 I don’t think I still mourn it the way I did. 9, 16 I have really come to accept that this is what I have in the rights to my life. 11, 13, 14, 19 I have two children that have serious mental illness. 14 One is manifesting itself in addiction and the other is schizophrenic. 9 Andy also, they diagnosed him as on the autism spectrum, which I guess also goes hand in hand with some of those behaviors. 10 He was originally diagnosed with Aspergers.  That was the first one. 9 Then that started off a whole round for trying to find psychiatric help for your child when they are an adult. 8, 9, 11, 13, 16 They don’t want to find help because they don’t think they are sick. 13 All schizophrenics—that’s their…  So I’m trying to find places. 11, 16, 17 I am going to say from 2003 to now I had to—I’ve know he is schizophrenic. 13, 14, 15 I had known he was schizophrenic. 10, 13, 14, 15 Because I have been watching him and have been reading about it and I have been seeing him. 11 I will take him to psychiatrists and say, “He is a schizophrenic,” and they say, “Well, it doesn’t really help us to take that diagnosis. 6, 9, 13 Well we’ll put him on lithium…” 10 Well, he’s not going to take it. 6 I can’t force him to take it. 6 That’s what is happening now. 12, 13, 14 He’s on Jarvis which is a quartered medication. 10, 12 I knew really solidly two years ago that my… 6, 12, 20 what I had to do was to step away and watch him walk the road and fall down the hole. 9, 12, 16 AS: Just like they tell us we have to do with our addict children. 9, 14 Leave them alone.  Cut them off.  Kick them out.  It’s harder when someone has—it has been harder with Andy than with Ali. 11 He can’t take it. 6 I’m going to say he can’t take care of himself. 6, 7 There is the mother—because he’s my baby. 5 It is kind of true. 16, 17 He’s can’t— AS: He’s not functioning in this world, right? 14, 15 He can’t make decisions for himself. 16 Here is the difference in…  AS: And he’s now in a hospital? 14 JH: Yes.  He’s civilly committed.  AS: Just for the record. 6, 9 He is in the hospital.  He is civilly committed.  I am working very closely with the psychiatric team.  I am mothering him.  I see him twice a week.  He wants to see me four times a week. 11, 13, 18 I bring him Taco Bell once.  I set up my limits. 17 AS: Did they let you take him out for his birthday? 6, 19 No, and that was okay.  I called his psychiatric nurse. 7 I said “I’m going to advocate for this as much as I need to.” 10, 13, 18 I said, “Can I take him out for his birthday?” 6, 19 She said, “No.”  I have a really good relationship with his social worker at the hospital.  He has been there for months. 8 They all know me. 13, 14, 15 He has been there longer than anybody has.  They don’t know what to do with him. 13, 14, 15 AS: Really?  They don’t know where to send him? 12, 13, 14, 15 Are there are other options? 7 Right now they are trying to get him into the intensive rehabilitative treatment center. 9, 14, 15, 16, 19 He got sent to one once and he cut himself again and they sent him back. 7, 19 So then he just went back to the hospital. 9, 12, 19 That has just been within the last two months. 8, 9, 12 His commitment is through September.  He still thinks he’s going to get to go back with his dad. 9, 19 Carey will not tell him “no.”  Will not tell him “no.”  I tell him “no.”  I am really working on having good boundaries with him.  I tell him, “You do what people tell you to do.”  He will say, “These people think I’m schizophrenic.”  I’m like, “Yeah, they do Andy! 10 You know what, here’s what happens what you cut your penis off. 12, 13, 14, 15 You have to stop.” 9, 10 I’m listening to this thing about the Freudian thought process: every thought that you have, especially if you are mentally ill, there is something behind it. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20 And then there is this counter idea that the thoughts just come and go but the ones we latch onto may be kind of random. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 Some people latch onto these dark thoughts. 11, 12 I have been thinking, “What happened to him? 12, 13 What happened to him?” 12, 13 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Because he is obsessed with the idea that he is going to be killed. 7, 11 That is his obsession.  He is going to torture himself before someone else can.  So he can prepare himself.  That is what is going on with him psychologically. 7 There is no talking to him. 10 That was the bulletproof vest. 9, 19 That was the start of it. 9, 11 Now I start tracing it. 9, 11 That is the hindsight is 20/20.  I see things that he was doing in high school that were like the precursor behavior to this. 8, 16 So, I want to stay on topic because I know time is an issue. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: We should wrap up soon.  This is tiring and emotional for us. 13 I don’t want to go off on too many tangents. 13 So, as it stands now he is getting treatment and he is under a commitment which is kind of like jail in a way. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 When an addict is in jail it's like “Okay, someone else is taking care of it.” 7 I do talk to his county psychiatric team. 7, 10 He’s got a site psychiatric nurse at the hospital. 13 For the first three months he was hospitalized he wouldn’t sign the release papers. 8, 9 No one could talk to me, no one could tell me anything, but I could still give them information. 6, 9, 10, 17 He was a little bit freer with Allison.  And God bless her.  If he would tell her something she thought was important she would pass it on to me and I would pass it on to his psychiatric team and he couldn’t talk to me but she could give me a message. 6, 10, 11, 12 This is what Andy is intending to do. 12, 15 He is cheeking his meds.  He is stealing his knives off of his dinner tray. 9, 10 Just so you know this. 9, 13, 14, 15 And I would never get any response about it, you would never hear anything. 15 I didn’t go visit him the first month. 8, 9, 12, 13 I went twice and he would say, “You are dead to me.”  AS: Because you had committed him.  Because I called the police. 7 I called the police because he tried to cut his… 7, 10 he tried to cut his toe off. 10 We didn’t discover that he was trying to cut his penis off until he was in the hospital. 16 He had cut his little toe almost completely off and he had tried to cut his eye. 9, 10, 14, 16, 19 I went to go pick him up and I had been watching the progression of him.  I noticed some burns on his arm and I was like, “What happened?” 10, 12, 13 While I am watching him go down and I know he is going down and I know he is getting sicker and I am just waiting for him to do something. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Because then they’ll keep him. 12 So I see that he is burning himself and I’ll say, “You shouldn’t be burning yourself.”  We are at Baker’s Square or Wendy’s or something. 12 I’m just like “Okay. 9, 12 I’ll see you next week.”  I pick him up for dinner.  I watch him and I knew he was injuring himself. 6, 12 I was preparing.  I knew that there was going to be a time when I was going to pick him up and we were either going to the hospital or 6, 12 I was going to have to do what I ultimately did, which was call the police. 7 AS: From home? 19 We were driving. 14 I picked him up.  The day that I picked him up Allison called me and I had seen him a couple of days before and I knew we were getting close, I knew that it had to come. 6, 7, 12, 13, 19 This is the sad state of mental—I knew it had to be over a threshold. 6, 9, 12, 14, 20 I knew if he was just burning his arm maybe they would put a 72-hour hold on him and then release him. 6, 9, 10, 12, 20 I had COPE come out three times and the third time they said, “Maybe he needs to go to a job placement program,” and I’m thinking, “He’s schizophrenic! 11, 13, 18, 19, 20 How can you not see this.  Yeah I’ll look into it.  Allison called me and I don’t even know where I was. 7, 13, 14, 15 I think I was coming home from church, yeah, it was Sunday and I was coming home from church and Allison says, “Mom, Andy just did something to his eye. 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 He is limping and he did something to his eye. 16 It’s bleeding.”  She is like, “Get over here.” 10 I’m like, “Allison, tell Andy that I am coming.” 10 I had plans to see him later that night. 19 “Just tell him, don’t panic, tell Andy I’m going to get him from lunch a little early. 6, 9 And to be ready.”  And I’m like, “Allison don’t panic. 10 Okay?  Just don’t panic. 9 It will be okay.”  Well, I’m talking to an addict. 10 “It will be okay.  I promise it will be okay.  Just tell him to calm down.” 9 So, I go there and in my head I’m thinking, “Okay, I thought I was going to take him here. 6, 11, 12 And, get him here and then go over to Nancy’s, or go somewhere and call the police to come and get him. 7, 13, 19 So he comes down to the car and he has cut the white of his eye. 7, 13, 16, 19 He cut the cornea of his eye and the white of his eye is now just red. 9, 12, 14, 16 And he comes down and he is limping. 13, 19 It is clearly bad.  And he gets in the car and I’m like, “Hey. 7, 10 Wow, what happened to your eye?” 12, 13, 16 “Oh, I cut it.”  I said, “You cut your eye?” 16 Acting like I know nothing about this eye. 13, 14, 15, 16 He’s like “I cut it on purpose.”  “Andy, you cut your eye on purpose? 16 “It didn’t hurt.”  I said, “Alright.” 14 I’m thinking…  this conversation needs to stop. 9, 10, 12, 13 “What do you want for lunch?” 6, 13 [laughs]  The whole time in my head I’m thinking, “How is this going to play out?”  “What do you want for lunch? 6, 13 Do you feel like spaghetti?” 16 So we are driving down Lowry Avenue and we are going towards the house and he goes, 6, 9, 14 and I said, “I think we should go back to my house and I’ll make spaghetti and I made a cake and we’ll just have lunch at my house.” 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 And he looks at me and goes, “You’re going to call the cops.” 7 And I’m like, “Andy…” 10 I think whatever my reaction was he opened the door and just got out of the car while the car is moving. 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 I’m lucky we are on Lowry Avenue.  I’m just going, “Oh fuck here we go.” 9, 12 I pulled over and 911, “My son is schizophrenic.  He has just injured himself. 9, 12 Please, he is not armed.  You need to take him to Fairview Riverside. 6, 13 You need to get him. 13 He is not armed.  He is not armed.  He is not armed.  He will run. 11 He will fight.  He is mentally ill. 14 Please get him.”  And I get off the phone and pulled into Betty Dangers, the place with the ferris wheel in Northeast—Lowry and Marshall. 7, 9, 11 I don’t know if you know it. 13, 14, 15 The cop says, “Where are you?  We will come and talk to you. 10, 13, 19 Pull over and we will come and talk to you.” 10, 13, 19 I just pull into the parking lot and I just sat in my car and I don’t think I started crying yet… 7, 9, 11, 12, 17 This is the weekend Kathy moved out too. 8, 12, 19 I just sit there and I think I started praying, “Please don’t kill my child. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 Please don’t think my child.”  AS: That they are going to shoot him.  Well, at least he’s white, you know. 9, 13, 14, 15 I had that thought. 11, 12 At least he’s white. 9 Because if he wasn’t white he might be dead.  That is a really horrible thought, but it’s the truth. 11, 12, 17 I did say a number of times, “He’s not armed. 18 He’s going to fight you.  I don’t think he fought though. 11 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: How far did he get?  You know I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know how far they got. 13, 14, 15 AS: He had an injured toe and a bleeding eye. 12, 16 JH: I mean he’s six foot six. 16 You’re not going to miss him.  He looks mentally ill too. 14 He’s bald, he shaves his head.  He looks scary. 7 So, they called me, “Where do you want me to take him?” 6, 7, 13 “Fairview Riverside.  I’ll meet you in the emergency room.” 7, 13 So they took him.  I have to be thankful for the police. 7, 13 They did exactly what I said. 10 Don’t take him to Hennepin County, take him to Fairview. 6 That was partly because he had been there and where his records were. 6, 7 He had already been there twice.  There was another thing that happened in between. 12, 13 This is the first one of this one. 9 They assured me. 12, 15 He was put on suicide watch and brought back to the psychiatric ward. 9, 10, 18, 19 I went back there and sat with him and he was just agitated: 9, 12, 19 “I hate you.  You are dead to me.”  So, I sat there with him for about an hour.  And I talked to the nurse and I said, “You’re not going to let him go, are you?” 10, 11, 19 She said, “There is no chance we are going to let them go.” 19 Because that has happened. 12, 13 I’ve had that happen with Allison and him. 12 I brought them to the emergency room and two hours later they are telling me to come pick them up. 7, 9, 11, 13, 18, 19 Allison poured boiling water on her arm. 6, 12 I brought her... probably to get pain meds looking back. 9, 18, 19 I think she was also in a meth psychosis looking back. 5, 19 AS: Can you say where is Allison now and what is she doing? 14 Is she currently using? 16 JH: Yes.  Allison is currently using meth daily. 5, 16 She works at a bagel place locally. 7, 11, 14 When she came back from Sweden she worked at this bagel place. 6, 11, 19 All through high school she worked in Golden Valley. 8, 20 And the manager of that bagel place took a risk and hired her when she came back from Ohio. 11, 12, 19 She was in Ohio for a year in jail, it was like a treatment center. 9, 16, 20 And then we sent her to Pennsylvania and she didn’t stay and she came home and she started using even before she got off the bus here. 7, 9, 11, 15, 19 Started using meth again. 5 She’s living with her dad who lives in subsidized housing because he is a senior. 6, 20 He lives in senior subsidized housing in northeast Minneapolis. 9, 20 She works and she holds down her job and she just bought a car but I guess the car is having some issues. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20 I saw her a week ago.  She came into my work because I had a pair of shoes she wanted. 12, 13, 19 And I quickly ushered her out. 9, 12 Because I don’t want that. 13 AS: At the cafe?  JH: Yes.  Because she doesn’t think anyone can tell she is a user but… 9 AS: Oh, really?  JH: Yes.  She said, “I have to quit this mom. 15 I have to quit.”  I said, “Yeah, you do.”  “I’m just getting so tired of this life.” 9, 11, 12 Can you imagine? 14 You know? 13, 14, 15 “I just hate AA.” 9, 12 “I know you do. 13, 14, 15 I hope you can do it honey. 10 You can’t be a meth addict and have a good life. 5, 11 I hope that you know that. 10, 13, 14, 15 I love you. 13 See you.”  She sees her brother twice a week. 5 So, she is really good.  And I’ve said to her, “You have to survive for him.  You’ve got to survive.  I kind of use anything. 9, 16, 17 [laughs]  AS: [laughs]  Another good mothering tactic. 10 Don’t stay alive for yourself. 9 Don’t go clean for yourself because you’ve got a brother who is really sick and your brother needs you. 5, 13 And he will always need you. 13, 16, 17 There will never be a time when he is not schizophrenic. 15 AS: There could be a time when you are not an addict.  Your dad is sixty-eight years old. 20 I’m pretty healthy but I had cancer this last year. 9, 14, 18, 20 It could come back. 13, 19 I use that with her a lot. 9, 17 I try really hard when I catch myself doing that. 10, 11, 16 That the coercion and talking them into it. 10 It is loaded with hope. 10 It’s not that I don’t have hope because I do have hope. 10 I want to have hope because they are my kids. 10, 13 When you have hope you have something. 10 I used to say when you have hope, you have everything. 9, 10 That's not true.  When you have hope you have something. 10 I don’t know what the future is, you know? 13, 14, 15 There are stories of redemption and human spirit that I don’t know, aren’t my story or my children’s story. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 I’m not going to act like I don’t have moments of like total bleakness where I just go, “Oh my God. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 Who put shit in this fan anyway? 10, 16 Who put shit in the fan anyway?” 10, 16 [laughs]  AS: Right, the little plaque.  JH: Right, I have a little plaque [laughs].  I don’t dwell on the possibility that I will survive both of my children, but I do understand that it’s very possible. 9, 12, 14, 16 AS: That it is likely. 10 JH: Right, that it is likely. 10 I know that Andy has not let go of the obsession to harm himself. 13, 14, 15, 19 The unfortunate thing is that he seems to think that he needs to cut his penis off and it won’t kill him if he does. 7, 13, 16, 19 And Allison is a drug user and and intravenous drug user. 9, 14 That’s as dangerous as it gets. 18 There is a good possibility that both of my children will not make it through their twenties. 14, 16 I hope that that’s not the truth of my life. 10, 11 I’ll cross that bridge if I come to it. 13, 19 If I ever come to it I will cross it and accept it. 13, 19 Not to be flippant or dismissive but nobody is meant to live forever. 16 I don’t believe there is a God with a plan—we had this discussion.  I don’t believe there is a God with a plan for me or my children. 14 I don’t want to. 13 That is disturbing to me. 9 It’s not even comforting for me. 15 That is downright disturbing. 9, 14 That is a whole other conversation. 12 AS: You were awesome.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot. 17"
"10","Eden_Frank_Rae","Dean Johnson Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 20, 2017 Minnetonka, Minnesota Dean Johnson-DJ Amy Sullivan-AS Ann Perry-AP AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I'm with Dean Johnson at his home in Minnetonka. 19 It's January 20, 2017.  Dean would you just state your name and say that you give me permission to record this? 6, 9, 12 DJ: This is Dean Johnson, and you have my permission to record this. 6 AS: Thank you.  Would you start by talking about your childhood? 9, 10, 11 Where you grew up, your family of origin? 18 DJ: I grew up in ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land, which is how I characterize my childhood to a lot of people. 8, 10, 11, 17 I was born in 1952.  I was number six of seven children. 14 We're all baby boomers. 5 My hometown was Valparaiso, Indiana, which is about fifty miles east of Chicago. 5, 8, 9, 19 When I say ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land it's because all the neighborhoods resembled the show. 8 That relationships—getting away with a couple of little criminal activities periodically was okay. 7, 10, 16 Lecturing, even a paint stick periodically from my father, kept me in line. 5, 6, 7, 9, 15 At that time Valparaiso had a thriving, wonderful, hundred-year-old downtown. 19, 20 You could ride your bike everywhere. 6 This was ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land. 8 AS: Where'd you go to college, or did you go to college? 8 DJ: I did go to college. 8 My father was a piano teacher. 5, 8 He has a master’s degree in music. 9, 20 In the course of his career he was primarily a private piano teacher. 7, 8, 11, 14 He had his own clients; he rented space at a music store. 5, 6, 9, 16 At times he had piano lessons at our home. 18, 19 I think as my oldest brother and sister were approaching college the notion of putting seven kids through college was strenuous. 5, 8, 9, 10, 20 Somehow he found himself in the music department at Valparaiso University. 13 All of us, having a relationship with the university, got free tuition. 13, 14 All seven of us went to Valparaiso University. 13 AS: That is a good deal. 13 DJ: Pretty extraordinary. 15 Then in the course of that tenure, I honestly don't recall, and both my folks are dead so I can't ask them. 7, 9, 15, 16 I don't know where my father abandoned the music and became a librarian or a library scientist. 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 Ultimately he became the director of libraries at the university, which was the job he retired in shortly after I graduated. 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 Maybe it was a little after I graduated. 8 He was still employed there when I graduated in 1974. 8, 9 I don't know, because music was the love of his life. 11, 13, 14, 15 DJ: More money, who knows. 13, 14, 15 Valparaiso University wasn't the place for him to continue his private piano clientele. 8, 11, 13, 14 I think part of it simply was that he needed to decide if he was going to nurture private piano students outside of the university career or just abandon it. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 He only took cream of the crop; his piano students always won state trophies. 8, 9, 14, 16, 17 He was very well known. 10, 13, 14, 15 He played the organ in my church for forty-five years, something like that. 8, 20 We grew up in a Christian environment. 8, 9 Of course we went to Sunday school because Dad played the organ. 8, 19 AS: What church did you attend? 12, 15 DJ: This was Emmanuel Lutheran Church, which when I was in my youth was a very small, maybe two hundred seat, one hundred and thirty-year-old building. 7, 9, 20 It was pretty cool. 17, 18 Attached to it was a lunchroom in the basement and a gymnasium on the second level. 6, 7, 20 That church started a Lutheran school. 7, 8, 9, 11 At some point where my oldest brother, who is ten years older than me, was already in fourth grade or something like that. 5, 9, 20 They started not a kindergarten but a first through eighth grade parochial school. 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20 My class size, again ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land, was twenty-four kids. 8, 20 Twelve boys, twelve girls. 8 I didn't know anyone that was divorced. 5, 13, 14, 15 I didn't know anyone of different color, persuasion, religion, nothing. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 When I graduated from Emmanuel Lutheran School as an eighth grader I was just shocked to go to a junior high in the public school system and meet hooligans for the first time. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 20 Big boys. 8 I was a big fish in a little pond. 8 I was very good in all the sports.  AS: At your small school. 8 DJ: We only played other private schools, Catholic or Lutheran schools all around the region. 7, 8, 14 Get into junior high I couldn't even survive on the C team in basketball. 8, 15 That was probably my first mental challenge: you used to be hot stuff and now you're not. 9, 10, 14 My favorite sports: basketball, football, baseball—I couldn't compete at that level. 8, 20 I absolutely could not.  I did play tennis in high school, but I quit that when I was a senior. 8, 15, 20 Anyways, went to Valparaiso University and worked only because at that time was the oil embargo, '73, '74. 5, 13, 16, 17 The economy was terrible and it was like, “Now what do you do?” 10, 15 I had a geography degree. 20 I started out as a civil engineer. 9, 11 I hated engineering and did criminology, philosophy—all of the liberal arts stuff. 9, 12 As a Lutheran university you took theology. 7, 13, 14 I actually have a minor in theology. 10 I took those courses not in pursuit of anything other than they were all interesting and stimulating. 9, 19 Here I said my class size in grade school was twenty-four. 8, 20 Most of the class size in the theology department were seven, eight students. 9, 14, 20 You got to become very intimate with all the professors. 13, 19 This was the love generation and I had experimented with the drug of the day in those times. 13, 14, 18, 19 It was very stimulating to be able to have really a one-on-one relationship with a lot of professors when you are in school. 8, 9, 17 All of my friends went to Purdue, Indiana University, Indiana State, some went to Butler, some went to very small schools like Shelley [Dean’s daughter] did at DePauw. 5, 8, 12, 13, 18 A couple of my friends went to Notre Dame. 12, 18 All of those schools with the exception of DePauw, the class size you've got freshman English and it's six hundred students in a stadium. 8, 9, 14, 20 I had a very cultured education from the time I was born in a very sound, stable family environment when I got out with a geography degree and a minor of theology it was like, ""Where are you going to work?"" 9, 10, 12, 18, 20 Valparaiso University is ten miles from all the steel mills that are on the south side of Chicago or Lake Michigan. 7, 9, 13 All of my older brothers at one point in time worked at the mills. 5, 20 I was the only one that hadn't.  I had a neighbor that was a general contractor and I did a lot of road construction work from the time I was a sophomore in high school all through my undergraduate years. 8, 9, 10, 17, 20 I worked at that construction company. 9 I didn't have to endure the mills. 12 A friend of mine who worked with an engineering firm said, ""We're contractors to Youngstown Sheet Tube Company and they need help. 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 It's not working in the mill.  You don't work for Youngstown Sheet Tube you work for this engineering firm."" 9, 19 I interviewed, they hired me at the steel mill. 6, 9, 12 [Phone rings]  It's a massive structure. 9 I suffered a year at the steel mill. 9, 12, 20 They wanted to hire me. 12, 13 I started out as an engineer and they said, ""Look we'll give you a full-time job not with this engineering firm but with Youngstown Sheet and Tube."" 6, 9, 11, 19 We were assigned to the engineering department.  They said, ""We'll give you a full-time job and you can go to school and get your college degree and stay here forever."" 6, 8, 9, 11, 20 I thought there couldn't be anything more ghastly in the world. 9, 11, 12, 15 I went and met with my advisor in the geography department. 5 He said, ""I have a friend down in Illinois that they have a city planning program. 12, 20 I'll see if I can get you in.""  A week later we met and he said, ""You're in. 5 The good news is for most of the term that you're down there you'll be a graduate assistant and you'll have free tuition. 6, 9, 13 All you've got to figure out is room and board. 5, 7, 13 Your first fall quarter you have to pay out of state tuition and your room and board and whatever."" 5, 7, 9, 16 So I went down and I have a sister in St. Louis. 5, 9 I lived with her that fall quarter.  I don't remember what it was, but I saved money from my previous job and paid out of pocket for that first quarter. 9 Then I had a free ride for two years. 6, 20 This was a two-year master of science in city and regional planning. 9, 20 There were not a lot of planning schools in the country back then. 8, 11, 16, 17, 19 I'm in line the first day of registration and who's next to me but Ann Roberts Perry from Minnesota. 6, 9, 19 I'd never been to Minnesota. 15 She'd never been to Indiana. 8, 15 These were the old days when you didn't do everything online, you stood in line. 6, 9, 19, 20 You're killing time chit chatting and I was just madder than heck after we finally had table openings and went our different ways, I didn't write her phone number down. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 Here we are in a graduate program—how hard is it going to be to find somebody? 11 I had no classes with her that fall. 8, 20 I finally bumped into her in a hallway somewhere. 16 Then we exchanged vitals. 16 She hated where she was living and I told her I was living with my sister and I didn't like that, and from that following quarter we had classes together and one thing led to another. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 20 By the end of our second year we decided we were getting married. 12, 20 AS: Did you move in with her?  DJ: She moved into my house. 6, 8, 9 I had roommates in the first semester, first year. 7, 9, 20 They were all done after that year. 20 I'm wringing my hands and going well, ""I've got this place and nobody's going to be here next year."" 11, 20 She goes, ""Okay.""  It was like, ""Woo."" 10 We weren't officially even dating at that point because she was trying to dump this guy who was graduating a year ahead of us also. 15, 16, 20 I didn't like him. 10 He was from Montana or Wyoming or somewhere.  She goes home for the summer and I stayed down there and worked at an outdoor festival, which was another story and a great thing that doesn't relate to addiction. 5, 9, 11, 19 Ann came back and I called her over the summer. 7, 19 She said, ""I'm planning on staying with you."" 9, 19 That worked out and I dragged her to my parents at Christmas break and on the way home she said, ""I could never live in Indiana."" 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 You have to drive through south Chicago, Gary, Indiana to get to Valparaiso. 7, 8, 14 She said, ""Nothing about Valpo, but I couldn't live that close to all that crap.""  Our deal was whoever got the first job that's where you go. 9, 13 The options were we could stay in St. Louis, which was a hellhole of the world. 7, 9, 15 We could move to Indiana, which was another hellhole of the world according to Ann. 8, 15 Or bless her heart she found a job.  She diligently went out and got a job.  We moved to Minnesota and got married the week after we graduated. 8 I'm a Minnesotan now. 14 I've lived here officially longer than any other time I spent in Indiana or Illinois. 8, 19 We were married five years before we had Spencer. 20 We had both gotten sick of our careers to the point where we had gone through a period of time when all we talked about was our profession twenty-four/seven—got old after a while. 7, 10, 11, 15, 20 We kind of figured that out. 12, 13, 16, 17 I think we were both thirty when Spencer was born.  We had talked it out. 10, 11 It used to be you had kids at twenty and now today it's forty. 9, 14, 19 At that time thirty was kind of a pivotal time otherwise the medical community was concerned. 14, 16, 17 When I first met Ann her first words to me were, ""I don't want a family."" 5, 9, 13, 18 That's the difference between being in ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land and her experience with an alcoholic father and a mother that was a little bit milk toast, couldn't deal with the family. 5, 8, 9, 13, 18 Ann was the second oldest and she literally raised all of the younger siblings. 5, 9, 14, 20 She was always a take charge, very strong personality. 6, 9, 16, 17 We didn't clash that much because I've a very strong personality, but I'm also very outward. 9, 16, 18 Ann is a little bit more of an introvert when it comes outside of her personal ground, her corporate environment, or the immediate family. 8, 13, 16, 18, 19 She's not as gregarious or outgoing as I might be. 18 She might prefer a less travelled path when it comes to being with people and I'm okay. 13, 14, 19 In all of my working career through construction I learned how to communicate with and deal with complete blue collar, almost uneducated people to very prima donna architect and engineer types. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 It gave me a wonderful background on, “How do you succeeded in life?” 8, 11, 19 That was probably the best training for me to have that much variety. 9, 18 Also I knew how my brothers hated working in the steel mills. 5, 6, 9, 12 That kind of cultured my attitude about a lot of things. 12, 16, 17 I can't be emotional in front of a crowd, but I can stand up and talk business in front of five hundred people. 9, 10, 12, 13 None of that bothers me.  When I get emotional I can't contain myself. 13 I can't even talk sometimes. 5, 10, 15, 18 I just have to pass. 9, 12 I'll tell Ann, ""You finish it.""  My stomach's in my throat when anything is emotional. 9, 13 When it's professional I'm lucky. 20 When I go to meetings now I don't do any prep. 13, 14 I listen to book tapes on the way. 9, 15, 16, 17 I just mellow out and go in there and hit them. 9, 12 That's a blessing from a career standpoint. 7, 9, 11, 12 Now people that have to deal with me professionally say, ""That guy talks more than anybody. 10, 13, 14, 20 Are you going to talk all night Dean, or are you going to let us get down to business?"" 9, 10, 19 You have to be conscious of how far to explain things. 16 I'm right now in this process of working with twenty-three communities doing long-range comprehensive plans. 7, 14 I've got sixteen of those clients with orientation meetings in January and February. 13 They're all night meetings. 13, 19 It's ghastly. 9 I had four meetings this week. 13 I’m just exhausted. 9, 12 Back when Ann and I met you're used to having twenty-hour days. 5, 9, 19 When you get retirement age this night stuff is a killer. 7, 9, 19 That's the far end of this mental issue. 12, 14, 15 What do you want to know about children? 13, 14, 15 AS: When your babies were born.  You guys were thirty…  Spencer was born in 1981 and Shelley was born in April of 1984.  Three years apart. 20 Spencer was delayed in school as a summer baby. 5, 8 They were class years apart. 20 Spence was a great kid. 11 I participated in the delivery for both of them.  Spencer was a little rough on Ann. 18 We had a midwife and he was not breach, but he was rolled over and she couldn't get him to do this and that. 13 They were wanting to do this in one of the new-fangled birthing chairs because it was so much better on the woman. 6, 12, 13, 18 Then here's Ann on her hands and knees in the bed propped up and getting a massage trying to move Spencer a little bit. 16 Finally, a doctor came in and helped. 13, 16, 19 He came out naturally, but when he came out all I saw was this white, wrinkly stuff. 9, 19 I thought, ""My God he came out butt first."" 9, 11, 12, 19 It was his head, it was severely wrinkled and it was pure white with this cheesy stuff. 9 They whisked him away and I'm hearing all this chatter and clatter, ""Give me this! 16 Give me that!  I need the..."" I'm panicking. 8, 13 I'm like the kid's got problems.  They're just cleaning his nose. 9, 12 They're just cleaning his nose but they're doing it all quick. 9, 12 I'm just watching this. 9, 12 When Shelley was born, the doctor said, ""Do you want to clip the cord?"" 13 The whole thing was calm.  She had an epidural so she was calm.  That was the difference of the two, but they were both perfectly healthy at birth and essentially healthy as they were raised. 5, 7, 14, 18 Spencer was terribly shy.  He was my shadow.  He not only looked like me, he walked in my footsteps behind me. 9, 12, 17 I'd turn around and look for him and he'd be right there on my butt. 8, 14, 19 He'd almost walk with his nose in my rear end. 9, 12 He couldn't talk to people. 10 He was extremely shy.  Shelley on the other hand—if some criminal was sitting on a park bench going, ""Hey, honey come over here."" 13, 19 She'd run right over there. 11, 14 They were very different in that regard. 16, 17 Spencer was one of the more inventive, creative people that I knew from children. 6, 12, 14 Certainly more creative than me.  He could build a spud gun.  He and his cousin built a guillotine for mice and frogs. 5, 17 Where did this devious, I don't want to say it's violent, but I mean it was violent. 13, 16 You're chopping the heads off of frogs.  We don't know where that came from. 13, 14, 15, 19 We didn't hear about any of that stuff until these kids were in college. 8, 9 They started sharing stories. 9, 11, 18 Well he was in ninth grade and got caught taking liquor to school. 8, 20 Three boys got detained and just based on the work schedule I lost the draw and had to go sit with the DARE cop, the principal, and I don't know who else. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Looking back, it's a serious deal. 13, 19 They had taken a 7-Up or a Pepsi bottle and poured vodka in it or something. 6, 12, 17 Somehow they got in study hall. 9 I don't even remember the details. 15 Three boys got bounced out. 8 One of the dads was an assistant coach with one of the sports. 9 It was an embarrassment. 5 Of course it was all his fault.  AS: Spencer's fault?  DJ: Yes, I think the blame largely came. 17, 19 He physically brought it. 7, 9, 18 They all planned it, but it was the first time that he stole alcohol, that we're aware of, the first time he stole alcohol out of our liquor cabinet. 9, 18 AS: Where was he going to school at the time? 8 DJ: This was Wayzata East Junior High. 9 He went to junior high. 8 I think by the time Shelley got through they converted to a middle school system. 8, 9 Spencer started going to high school at the old Wayzata High School, which was all of three miles from here. 8, 9, 11, 20 He graduated from the new, magnificent, enormous facility eleven miles from our house. 6, 8, 9 It was either bussing for a half hour or me driving them for half an hour or ultimately when Shelley was at the high school he drove one of our cars and drove the two of them to school. 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 They went to school together I think his entire senior year and her sophomore year. 8, 20 They got along pretty well. 18 He, like any kid, would pick on a little sister, but defend her to the death if somebody else wanted to pick on her. 5, 9, 12, 13 Otherwise they were natural irritants to each other.  I can picture Shelley and her cousin who was the same age and then her brother and Spencer who were also the same age at Easter. 5, 9 The little girls are in their dresses and got their beautiful hand woven baskets and they're getting ready to go collect the eggs in the yard. 6, 8, 14 The boys are in blue jeans. 8 They're laughing like little devils. 5 They went out and scooped up all the goodies before the girls even walked out the door. 8, 15, 17 Then you're consoling these weeping little children. 14 The boys are sitting there behind the tree. 8, 13 This is the way they were. 16 He was diagnosed with ADD.  I think that was before they added ADHD to these.  At an early age it was recommended he go on Ritalin. 12 At a relatively early age, I think fourth or fifth grade, I can't remember, he was on Ritalin all through high school. 8, 20 He personally claims that that was what put him down the path. 10, 14, 16 That somehow got him into this habit even though it's a well-used, monitored, legal medication. 9, 10, 12, 15 He attributes this to that.  He and Jamie [Spencer’s girlfriend] talked about whether Aidan [Spencer’s son] would have ADHD, or whatever his position was, don't get him on Ritalin. 10, 11, 12, 13 Avoid it like the plague.  There were a couple of times when Spencer was not performing as a student. 9, 17, 18 He was not necessarily ever a stellar student. 9 You could tell he was capable of getting As and Bs, but he was more frequently getting Cs and some Ds. There was an attitude change at junior high probably before high school. 8, 16 We went to a family counselor. 10, 18 This was dismal.  The guy was a specialist with adolescents. 9 We go in there and he stands up and he's just a nerd. 9, 12 His barn door's open. 5, 17 Spencer's laughing and he couldn't take anything seriously. 5, 6, 15 AS: No, after that point.  It's over you might as well leave. 6 DJ: He's like, ""Don't you ever force me to go to one of these clowns again."" 10 He developed a very nasty attitude about anybody who was under the guise of the medical community. 9, 14, 16 He always felt he knew what was in his brain not some other moron. 6, 12, 16, 17 That was consistent. 9, 15 That developed at an early age. 16 Shelley if I can depart, was a wonderful, a delightful little girl.  Dolls and all of that stuff. 9 She had a doting mother and father. 5 You try to be careful not to spoil. 7, 16 We had a lot of wealthier friends where they got all the great toys. 11, 12, 17, 18 From an early age we emphasized to them all of the natural things—and particularly Spencer. 16, 18 He grew up with this whole outdoor mentality. 14 I'm not a hunter, so I don't know weapons. 13, 14, 15 None of that included weaponry, but it included fishing, hunting, camping, outdoor skiing, cross country, downhill, everything. 8, 11, 16 From the time he was eight months old was the first time we went up to Ely to Burntside Lake—a place called Camp Van Vac and took him on a weekend before he was one-year-old. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19, 20 Ann and I had been to the boundary waters and one of our acquaintances, a neighbor right here who could see the house said, ""You don't have to give up that experience. 6, 9, 14 Come up to Camp Van Vac.""  It's true.  These were glorious sixty to eighty-year-old cabins that were far enough apart you didn't see the neighboring cabin. 20 They had pit toilets. 19 They had a central toilet for people who couldn't stand the thought of an outhouse. 6, 9, 11, 12, 19 You had running water in the cabins but you had privacy. 6, 7, 11 Most of them had boat docks. 7 We climbed through the ranks from 1982, the first year we went there, until we left in 2003. 7, 9, 20 We had stayed from 1981 to 2002. 5, 9 Twenty-one years, thirty-one years. 20 That's right. 14 I was thinking Spencer was thirty-four.  We were twenty-year alumni at this place and again graduated from having the worst cabin to having the best cabin by the time we were done. 8, 9, 11, 20 Most of the people in camp take the same cabin the next year. 6, 8, 20 You grow up with all of these families that are in your week. 17 We actually gravitated to two weeks. 10 From that standpoint they both learned new friends with no other connection other than Ely, Minnesota. 6, 9, 12, 17, 18 Both kids went through boat training and all of that and got their license to boat. 7 Both learned how to water ski and all of that stuff. 6, 9, 12, 17 When they were in middle school we said, ""Wouldn't you guys like to go to Washington D.C. or Yellowstone or something like that?"" 8, 9, 10 ""Yes.""  ""Well we'd have give up our week at Camp Van Vac."" 6 ""No way."" 16 They never went on those educational trips. 10, 15 We never took Christmas trips unless it was skiing somewhere up in Duluth or Wisconsin. 9, 15 Every spring break we went to New Mexico, California, Colorado, wherever and did ski trips. 18 They never saw Washington D.C. or Yellowstone because our emphasis was always these family trips that were outdoor oriented. 9, 15, 16, 17, 18 Shelley was on the high school ski team at Wayzata. 8 Spencer never did that. 15 He played football, baseball, didn't like basketball, tried hockey. 8, 10 So they were both very sport oriented.  To go back to Spencer, I think there was a bit of this rebellious attitude that probably was eighth or ninth grade. 19, 20 There was a lack of commitment for school at that same age. 8 Even though he had gone through the public school, I should probably say because he went through the public school system from the time he was in kindergarten versus me entering and being shocked at what I saw in eighth grade. 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 He was used to it by then and whatever element was kind of over the edge was his preference. 9, 16, 17 He had no time for anybody that would think about being in choir or band or those sorts of things. 15, 16, 17 They were the laughable segment.  As a parent you're like, ""Oh please get into choir and get into band."" 10, 15, 16 We don't care if you're a nerd. 7 Get in the computer club. 10 That wasn't for Spencer.  He was always on the fringe with his friends. 12, 16, 17, 18 AS: What do you mean on the fringe? 16 DJ: The ones that wanted a different type of experience. 12, 13, 16, 17 It wasn't just going to a movie. 9, 12 AS: He was around those people.  DJ: He would prefer to be somebody that would come up with the idea that, “Let's go to auto racing.” 11, 13, 19 Something a little more thrill seeking.  If I could characterize him it was he was a thrill seeker. 10 He was the type that would find, and they did find, an old zip line at a former gravel pit. 6, 17, 20 We're talking a sixty-foot drop. 10, 14 He'd be the one that would do it.  He had a friend take a picture of him when he let go of the zip line into the water. 6, 12, 19 He's halfway down to this thing. 16, 20 That was high school. 8 Yes, a thrill seeker.  We were aware of—because the Orono police called me, and one of our friends who happened to be there, that they had both of our boys at the police station. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18 They were caught at the Wayzata Country Club, which was closed because it was November. 10, 16 When a neighbor called and said there's a car parked there the cops snuck up on them. 7 Opened the door and the guy he goes, ""Man there was one cloud of smoke that came out when we opened the door."" 17, 19 Steve, my friend, and I said, ""Alright we've got to keep a straight face. 6, 9, 12, 14 We have to be stern."" 9 We told the cops, ""We want you to scare the living shit out of them."" 6, 7, 13, 20 They did a good job of that.  First offense, whatever. 9 They turned them over to us. 19 It's part of our own discipline. 6 AS: They were smoking pot?  DJ: They were smoking pot big time. 8 It was his buddy's older brother, who if I could describe the Eddie Haskell of the world. 5, 15, 20 Steve, his father, showered his love on the older boy Matt, who was Eddie Haskell who got away with murder. 5, 12, 13, 16, 20 He bought these kids pot. 7 But Johnny, the one Spencer's age, was always the one who got caught. 16, 17 He was the troublemaker. 16 I always felt bad for John who spoke at Spencer's celebration because his dad never gave him the time of day. 15, 16, 17, 19 They've got to rectify that because his older brother's got some health issues and other stuff and owns a business. 5, 9, 14, 15, 20 John's kind of running the business. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17 I'm like, “Okay, Steve, when are you going to go back and let John know maybe not that there was a mistake all this time, but how much you appreciate him?” 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 That's a different topic. 16, 17 Spencer was on the edge.  We were aware of a culture of trying things. 16 We never witnessed, and it's easier to witness alcohol than any other thing that kids might get involved in. 15 Sometimes as long as they chewed gum or whatever and the high from pot was down or it was just lousy pot in those days. 5, 8, 9, 12, 18, 19 It was easy to masquerade that.  I'm not aware of other things other than pot or alcohol at that time in high school. 8, 16 College I think it all entered into a whole new realm. 6, 12 Friends of his who freely admitted to exposing him to Oxycontin were the ones that didn't have these genes missing and had no trouble with saying, ""Hasta la vista. 9, 11, 12, 16 It's time for me to grow up and move on."" 17 The time period—I think in his early twenties, late teens until mid-twenties—he was in that period of trying a lot of different stuff along with friends to this day we'd bump into and they have normal lives and have walked away from that wildness. 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 His fringe buddies, I could name seven of them, Spencer's the only one who couldn't walk away from it, which is completely consistent with what the medical community— AS: With statistics. 6, 9, 14, 15, 16, 19 DJ: Fifteen percent.  He was not doing well in school. 8 We could tell that and we said, ""We're not spending this kind of money on that."" 12, 16, 17, 19 I don't know if it was a year and a half or two years that he lasted at the U [University of Minnesota]. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 The U would have been the last place on earth he should have gone. 9, 11 He should have been at St. Cloud, a much smaller place. 11, 18 He's not this extrovert.  He's the introvert.  He'd have done much better in a smaller setting. 17, 18 AS: Lost in the crowd a little bit. 9 DJ: It was easy to be overwhelmed by somebody who's like, ""Class? 10 You go to class?"" 20 That's what happened to him. 12, 13 There was nothing serious, nothing pressing in his mind.  That's the real start of being high more than half the time. 8, 9, 11 In high school it was way under the radar. 8, 16 I don't think terrible, but only he could confirm that. 15 Then there was a period of time he was working in the landscape business. 8, 9 He worked for one of my brothers in law at a flooring company. 5 He was maintaining jobs.  We'd bump into supervisors and one of his supervisors was at our old church. 12, 20 He'd go, ""Oh gosh Spencer's conscientious. 17 He's a top worker.""  Yet, like most of the people in construction and landscape tend to be a little high on the job but most of them are not doing pills. 8, 9, 12, 15 They're smoking pot when they move from one job to the other.  They're able to deal with that. 13 Spencer, from when people introduced him to Oxycontin, was spending more and more of his money on that sort of legal medication. 10, 12, 17, 19 It wasn't until— AS: Was he getting them legally?  DJ: He was buying from anybody he knew. 6, 7, 12 He's buying them on the street. 7, 9 At the point in time that he was getting them off the street they were still being dispensed like today. 9, 19 Today the quantities are certainly down which has led to the increase in heroin. 9, 19 There's a complete relationship to that. 19 Let me back up. 19 He had a girlfriend that was off the charts with personal problems. 12, 16 She was adopted. 8 Her parents tried to put her in a commune down in Arizona to straighten her out because she was a nonconformist and was experimenting in drugs. 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 They left her down there for a year. 20 Anyways, she latched onto Spencer and she was the type when she'd get high or mentally unstable in a crowd of people she'd scream rape and cops would come and accost Spencer. 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 It was a terrible relationship. 15 When she was normal she was a sweet, wonderful girl.  Ann and I found ourselves sitting in downtown Minneapolis at the Hennepin Medical Center because neither of her parents would come and she had freaked out. 10, 13, 16, 19 We're sitting in the room until they can get a psychiatrist in there, holding her hand and getting phone calls. 7, 9, 13, 20 The mother's just going, ""There is no way. 9, 12, 16 Her father's out of town. 5, 19 He's coming back tonight."" 19 Finally, the dad calls me and he's madder than heck that we're dealing with her. 7, 13 It was a very, very peculiar thing.  That resulted in her getting into some personal calamities legally. 16 Doing bizarre stuff, kicking a window in, whatever. 9 She finally got into some sort of rehab and then had gotten into some women's housing in downtown. 15, 17, 18, 19 I haven't seen her personally, but Spencer saw her seven years after the fact and she'd been sober for seven or eight years. 6, 10, 16, 20 Actually one of his sober home managers was dating her. 6, 19 It's a small world. 15 When that relationship ended, which would have been probably 2005 or '06, I'm pretty convinced at that time Spencer had not seen or done anything with heroin. 12, 18 I know he was snorting coke with this woman. 13, 14, 15 He told me, he admitted it. 20 Blowing a lot of his money on that. 17 Whenever he was able to get the pain pills he was routinely getting them. 15 He met Jamie, she was still a student at the University. 5, 9, 13 We had moved from our house to this house. 6, 8, 9 The old house was vacant. 6, 9, 20 We let Spencer and Jamie live in our house while she finished school. 6, 8, 9, 19 Unbeknownst to us until she's about five months pregnant, other than saying, ""Geez is Jamie putting on a little extra weight here?"" 8, 10, 11, 18 Neither of them told us she was pregnant. 20 She finally got fed up with him not telling us and she told us. 20 I'm like, ""Okay, good. 10 That explains a pretty large posture there young lady."" 9, 14, 18 It was just getting worse. 9, 12 When we had first met her, she was slim and trim and appeared to be the type that could struggle with weight gain but at that time was attractive and very conscientious about her appearance. 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 18 It was just like, ""Boy school must be rough. 8, 9, 10, 12, 18 Something's slipping.""  Aidan was born in September of 2008.  During the time they were living at our house she would never tell us anything. 6, 9, 15 She just didn't know us. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 She didn't feel comfortable with us and so we weren't getting anything from her. 16 It was only in my dealings with Spencer: “Well, wait a minute. 13 Jamie's the student. 9 Why is she able to pay rent and you're not?” 16 It was apparent to me again that he was wasting all of his money on medications. 9, 10, 16 AS: Do you think she knew that he was using? 6, 12 DJ: I don't know to the extent about the pills. 13, 14, 15 Clearly they met through mutual friends who had gone to Wayzata. 5, 12, 18 She went to Wayzata as well but she's like five years younger than Spencer. 5, 14, 20 They were never in school together. 8, 15 She was partying with a group of kids who may have had other siblings who were also in Spencer's group. 5, 6 They met while she was with a younger element of the same group that Spencer was hanging out with. 5, 14, 18 That's how they got together.  She liked him. 10, 18 Spencer was a good looking kid.  There wasn't any reason on the surface until his situation deteriorated that he shouldn't be someone you'd want to be with. 13 It was only after Aidan was born and Spencer called me in the morning. 7 He says, ""We got off on the wrong side this morning and Jamie's upset. 17, 19 I just want you to drive down to the house and see if there's a cop car down there."" 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 He was real agitated.  This was like 7:30 in the morning.  I'm going, ""What are you talking about?"" 10 He couldn't to my satisfaction come close to explaining himself or describing what the situation was. 10, 13, 19 He goes, ""I got to go.  I'm late for work already.  We just got into an argument."" 9, 12 I would officially, other than some bizarre times that he was with this former girl, this was the first time that I thought there was a pattern. 9, 11, 12, 17, 18 When he was with this other girl he was still drinking. 6, 9, 14 The last ten years he didn't drink, it was all drugs. 6, 9, 14, 20 When he was with her they were drinking, smoking, cocaine, a lot of stuff. 6, 9, 14, 17 AS: You thought maybe drugs were a part of Jamie and Spencer's relationship? 9, 11, 12, 14 DJ: I think Jamie has this potential of being a binge drinker, but doesn't have a sustained drinking problem. 6, 9, 14, 15 We've never seen any of that. 15 She's very capable of, like when you're in college, overdoing it. 8 I mean getting hammered to where you don't come home or stuff like that. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 We had Aidan and she was supposed to get him and didn't show up. 6 Her parents would leak a little bit of information that she could go over the edge. 10, 16, 17 We thought maybe this nursing student isn't quite... 9, 11, 12 That's not her character. 10 It's just that occasionally she can get out of line. 6, 9, 12 She'll get out of line in an environment that she shouldn't be in. 6 That could be with other men or it could simply be with her girlfriends but just totally overdo it. 9, 12, 17, 18 It was sometime after September 2008 that Aidan was born and this behavior was going on. 5 I remember that Christmas we had a lot of snow activity, so Jamie and Aidan were both over here waiting to open gifts and stuff like that. 9, 10, 14, 17 He's shoveling for twenty-six straight hours. 6, 9, 11 He was just a mess. 9, 12 Part of it you'd say is natural for having to snow plow like that but he was a zombie. 14 It was these pain pills.  He was probably getting speed and other stuff to keep up with that regimen. 9, 12 We had an intervention, if you will, in February of 2009.  That's the first time he went to The Retreat [rehabilitation center]. 9, 16, 19 We just said, ""Your behavior is bizarre. 9, 12 Here are your options."" 7 We literally read him the riot act and said, ""You're either going to go and take care of yourself or you’re done."" 6, 7, 10 Jamie was firm in spite of the fact that she probably was covering for him a lot. 10, 17 She got to the point where she realized she couldn't cover anymore. 13, 14 She said, ""That's right. 14 You're out of my life."" 11 I remember taking him down to Fairview and they were evaluating him.  They didn't even tell us that he had Oxycontin in him. 15 They released him and we had already booked a room at The Retreat. 7, 16 In the middle of the night they said, ""You've got to take him. 6, 8, 19 He's got to detox. 10 We don't take them unless they detox."" 6, 10 That was the first time we ever even heard the word detox. 9, 10, 15 Apparently he was going through some physical reactions to not having this Oxycontin. 10, 16 I remember when we were heading down to Fairview to have him evaluated.  I'm like, ""Spencer where is this stuff?"" 9, 10 He took me to three or four different places in the basement, up in the rafters, in the insulation. 11, 16, 17 He's pulling this out, he's pulling that out.  A bag of pills here a bunch of pot. 9 I'd say, ""Is this it?  Afterwards six months later I can't believe he threw all this stuff down the toilet. 8, 9, 15, 19 He's just weeping. 9, 12 He probably had five hundred dollars worth of stuff in there. 9 Once he sobered up it was like, ""I can't believe he'd do that."" 6, 10, 12 That's kind of his mentality and attitude for the next ten years. 14, 16, 17, 20 ""I'm not responsible.""  He told us every time and where there certainly were real moments of recovery they were glorified and his pattern of reuse was almost immediate for the first five years and then the next several years he would occasionally have what I think Nancy [Espuche] just experienced with Lucas, a year of sobriety. 9, 12, 13, 15, 20 You go to a meeting and you go, ""We've made it a year. 13, 16, 20 This is incredible."" 12 You're so thrilled, you're so happy. 17 Deep down inside you're saying to yourself, just outwardly when you have no evidence, ""It's been a year."" 9, 11, 12, 20 In Spencer's case and in Lucas it wasn't the case.  I can't say because there were several times when we thought for sure, five months, six months of sobriety so forth that he could turn the corner. 8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19 We knew enough about alcoholism but that's a life challenge. 6, 10, 11, 12, 20 You always want to have a drink. 6, 13, 14, 16, 17 It'd be the same thing with opiate addiction.  All during his rehab it was, ""I can't do Twelve-step. 9, 12, 19 I don't believe in Twelve-step."" 9, 12 AS: All rehabs or the first one? 9, 19 DJ: In every one.  It was always, ""Twelve-Step is a bunch of bullshit."" 9, 16, 17 AS: He went like thirteen times, fifteen times. 18 DJ: I think where  Ann gets that number includes the detox not just a physical rehab program. 9, 10, 12, 19 She's kept that chronology.  Someday we should corroborate that. 19 At least a dozen rehabs for the thirty-day period of time. 9, 19 AS: A dozen harsh stops right? 9, 10, 14 DJ: Yep.  In controlled environments. 17 However, as we learned, even if you're down in the resident program in Fairview they get the drugs right when they're in rehab. 12, 14, 15, 17, 19 AS: Did he get kicked out?  DJ: He got kicked out of The Retreat. 16 AS: He did it on the first one? 9 DJ: Second time.  He made it through the first Retreat. 9, 16 That's a function of early on, I'm convinced many of these places didn't know how to conduct urine tests. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 He routinely cheated them.  I don't know if you were at one of the Nar Anon meetings. 13, 14, 15 This is how life goes on after death. 11 I had like a squeeze bottle, it's a liquid, it's a prescribed not antiseptic but a bacterial agent. 10, 17 My scalp dries out. 14 It's not psoriasis.  It's very seasonal.  I would get dryness in my scalp and the doctor says, ""This is called betamethasone and it's liquid."" 7, 14 I also used betamethasone because in the winter I break out in a rash. 9, 18 I had this little bottle of betamethasone and here it was just before Thanksgiving or something. 9, 11, 12, 17 I take this thing put it in my hair and I'm like, ""What's that smell?"" 6, 10, 12 It was full of urine! 11, 19 The SOB had taken the top off, filled it with urine and so in one of his tests he'd have this little bottle and if anybody saw the bottle it's a prescription. 6, 9, 17, 19 When we were going through his things I'm like, ""That's my betamethasone. 5, 10, 16 He must have borrowed that.""  It was full of pee. 11 All over my head.  AS: That is horrible. 17 DJ: Six-month old pee on top of it. 8, 20 Whose pee was it?  AS: It was probably not your son's.  If he was carrying it around, he needed clean pee. 7, 8, 13 They had these other methods where you warm the urine or you freeze the urine. 5, 19 All these things that they claimed worked. 16 Scientifically could it? 7 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I couldn't care less. 7 I don't want to go there because that's not my responsibility anymore. 13 I am convinced that while he only got caught and kicked out of The Retreat his second visit—I'm beginning to believe that there might not have been thirty days of sobriety when he was in those residential programs. 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 You don't know. 13, 14, 15 Where do you want me to take this? 6, 13 AS: Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Spencer as a father through all this? 5, 10 Some of your experiences and some of your emotional states. 9, 13, 19 AS: If you could describe what your relationship was like before?  It sounds like it was pretty good. 10, 16, 18 During his addiction and as you became more drawn into trying to help, could you just talk about your experience as a parent and a father? 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 DJ: Both kids growing up, and even their friends will say, ""Oh my gosh your dad is the greatest dad on earth."" 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18 On the outside you'd say whatever this guy was doing was working.  It was how not only his kids reacted but his friends' kids. 10, 12, 18 Our old house was a neat piece of property, the yard was huge. 6, 9, 20 We owned a quarter mile into a wetland. 8 There was an island and upland area of trees in the center of this big wetland. 8, 9 In the winter we'd make paths out there in the snow in the cattails. 10, 14, 16 The kids would build forts.  They weren't getting an experience where their dads were with them.  You can say up that hill—it's starting to melt—I create sledding paths. 9, 11, 14 Aidan and his little sister sledded all last weekend on this little dinky hill. 5, 9, 12, 19 We did that in both our front and back yard. 19 Not only my kids, but my friends would say, ""He's the greatest dad."" 9, 11, 12, 18 AS: Did you feel like the greatest? 9, 11, 16 Did you feel like a good dad? 16 Were you enjoying yourself?  DJ: I had a wonderful relationship with my dad, but it was different. 16, 17 My dad never threw a baseball to me. 8, 15 My dad never pitched a horseshoe, tossed a Frisbee. 15 My dad was not that type.  I didn't seek to go do anything other than what I liked. 10, 18 My father tried to give me piano lessons, what he liked. 5, 6, 8, 10, 18 I was incapable of receiving that gift.  I had to play baseball, basketball, football without my father. 5, 8 That didn't inhibit the relationship we had.  There was not a physical, recreational—but my parents bought a cabin on the border of Michigan and Indiana right near the border of Ohio when I was in eighth grade. 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20 My dad learned how to water ski, and it was a big piece of property and an older cabin. 5, 6, 8, 12, 17, 20 We had lots of sweat equity in taking stumps and rocks. 5, 9, 17 All during junior high and high school I was the only one really at home. 8, 19 I worked my butt off and so did my dad.  Here's this prissy librarian/music teacher and he's working his butt off and I liked that. 8, 10, 18 I taught him how to water ski because I knew how to water ski. 6, 12 He water skied at age fifty, the first time. 6, 9 I was real proud of him.  I didn't go out to seek this natural relationship with my kids.  That's just my preference. 9, 12 When we have Aidan, we're like, ""Aidan you can take your iPad to the cabin, but you're getting a half hour in the morning and a half an hour at night. 6, 10, 19, 20 If you don't want that than you need to stay home."" 9, 13, 19 Here it's lot harder because his mom raising two kids alone, working twelve hour shifts. 8, 11, 15, 17 She puts him to bed he's got the iPad. 10 That's the sad fact of life. 10, 11, 12 He puts himself to bed. 10 When he comes here we read to him until he falls asleep. 7, 13, 19 He loves that. 13 We did that to our kids.  We read to them at night. 19 When the kids had their friends over for a sleepover we read to them. 7, 12, 18 I think that relational thing is pretty simple. 18 AS: You were present. 7 DJ: We were always there. 16, 17 During his addiction I was not the textbook person.  I was getting lectured a lot. 12, 17 I would freely say this in front of Ann.  I'd be sitting at my desk working and she'd shove an article in my face. 13 I'd go, ""Set it aside.""  ""You need to read it."" 13 While we were on the same page dealing with addiction she absorbed herself in finding out anything and everything medically, physically, socially, emotionally, and was constantly pestering: look at, read, do this, do that. 7, 9, 13, 14, 20 Much of that time she could not deal personally with Spencer. 13, 16 ""I can't deal with him right now."" 13, 14 I'm caught in this barrage of being the one that deals with him and also being lectured about what I'm doing wrong to where clearly more than once I'd say, ""Fine. 5, 12, 13 You feel so strongly about it you do it. 9, 16 You do it that way."" 16 As we went through this I certainly got far better and recognized and understood what enabling was and letting go and things of that magnitude. 9, 16, 19 My early enabling was like anyone's you would expect.  When he was using we kicked him out.  We got to the point where when you're not using, when you're in recovery we'll help you. 13 That's where the dilemma in talking to people in our small groups at Nar Anon, that's a personal thing. 10, 16 You have to decide what's crossing the line again when you're helping. 6, 13 Spencer understands that I promised and would deliver on coming through when he's in recovery. 9, 12, 16 Of course he would.  It's just him. 9, 12 He's going to hold me to it. 20 Ann and I were mostly in sync throughout this process. 9 Obviously some couples get divorced. 5 That was helpful. 13 Spiritually both of us advanced in our own faith maturity.  I grew up in it.  Ann bounced from one, and some pretty kooky religions, to the other. 18 Nothing was stable. 9, 18 My environment was real simple.  I got baptized, I got confirmed, I went to a Lutheran grade school, a Lutheran college. 7, 8, 20 How straighter could it be? 6, 9 I had a little bit of rebellion though when I got out of college and it was like, ""Okay, the pressures aren't here anymore. 8, 10, 13, 15 Where do I take all of this?"" 6 It didn't go anywhere.  That kind of got recreated for me. 16, 17 A part of it was when we had kids.  We didn't force Sunday school on them, but we were going to church fairly well in the time they were being brought up. 8, 9, 18, 19 We also went to different churches because I never had one here. 15, 16, 17 I never have. 15 I also struggled with the notion—and this is all of Christianity—that it's Jesus or it's no one. 8, 9 That message can be conveyed by certain churches to be completely exclusive and by other churches to allow some inclusivity of those who are heathens. 14, 16, 19 I got over that hurdle during this addiction.  I also got involved, pushing ten years, so it's about the same time we're dealing with addiction. 13, 20 The neighbor you can see back here is a very passionate Christian and a musician and involved with prison ministry and got me involved in a Monday night men's group. 8, 9, 16, 19 We went to a church in North Minneapolis for three years—we actually operated out of the Salvation Army Men's Center and that was okay until a new captain, or whatever you call the leader—we not only had to take our own breathalyzers every night, we had to sign statements about this and that. 6, 7, 9, 10, 19, 20 We were doing pat downs to come in there to go to Bible study. 9, 13, 19 It was just crazy. 9, 12, 16 Under the old management the men's center, which Spencer went to two different times, could hold a hundred and thirty-eight people. 9, 16, 17, 18, 20 At the time we were in our Bible study and this new mission came in. 6, 9, 19 They were routinely filling thirty-eight beds.  They were excluding—for whatever reason I never understood—one hundred people. 9, 15 Our Bible study group divested itself of the Salvation Army and our group is called Freedom Works, which is a post-penal rehab with housing options for people. 7, 9, 19 It is a Christian group. 8, 9 They go and recruit people while they're in prison.  Somebody decides good candidate and bad candidate.  They pick them up when they're released from prison and bring them to safe housing.  I'd say the rate that they have is far better than the rate for most.  AS: Of recidivism you mean? 16 DJ: Their recidivism is like—I can't remember if it's a high number? 8 Is that bad or is the...  Their people sixty percent of the time are not going back to prison. 19 Without a program like that that recidivism is the opposite. 13 It's eight out of ten are going to wind up in the same spot.  AS: You're doing this prison ministry. 9, 16 Are you doing this while your son is in active addiction? 10 DJ: It started right at the time when we had the first encounter, when Aidan was just born. 9, 11, 12, 14 I think that something like that would allow me to have an awareness of what prison and what prison recovery is like? 10 No way. 16 I did it because my neighbor badgered me for ten years to get more involved and do some volunteering. 12, 20 ""Don't be so damn selfish."" 13 I go, ""John, the big problem is I got three or four night meetings a week. 8, 13, 19 I don't need another night commitment. 13, 19 If you go and hold this Bible study on Saturday noon and we're not up at the cabin…"" 9, 19, 20 They're all evening. 15 I started going and then while Spencer was in Montana, he and Jamie moved to Montana a year after this first encounter. 8, 9, 11, 20 We could tell that while things were going well for six or eight months after his first rehab and he was working again and she was working. 8, 9, 16, 19 She was at a nursing home and wasn't happy with it. 17, 19 The nursing employment options in the Twin Cities in 2009 were awful. 7, 10 People were leaving. 19 She went on the Internet and found a job in Wyoming and another one in Montana.  I said, ""I've been out near Kalispell, that's a nice place. 11 but you don't want to go to Wyoming. 13 That is nothing more than a hillbilly, redneck, oil refinery town."" 12, 14, 19 She interviewed them both and took the job in Montana. 6 He was visibly using and the issue was whether she was going to let him come or not. 13, 15, 19 By default, having a one-year-old at that time she let him come. 13, 19, 20 He claims to me, and I don't have any reason not to believe him, that he was clean for nine months out there. 8 Maybe it was because he didn't know a damn soul. 13, 14, 15 He finally was advertising, he was putting flyers in mailboxes to do handyman jobs, snow plowing and whatever even though all he had was a shovel, no truck. 10, 14, 15 Eventually he got a job with a landscaper out there and that's what got him in trouble. 8 They said, ""You don't need Oxycontin. 13 We've got heroin.""  That's where it started, of all places, out in the middle of Montana. 8, 9, 11, 17 Six or seven years ago. 20 While heroin has always been prevalent in this market it's like it's out in Kalispell, Montana? 16, 17 That lasted about a year. 9, 20 Then she finally for the first time told us what was going on. 9, 20 He was stealing her stuff, pawning her stuff. 9, 10 I'm reimbursing her for the lawn mower and stuff like that. 9 Little did I know at that time, relating back to this Freedom Works Bible study, what criminal activity was associated with drug use. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Thank you for the soup, it's really good.  Did you make it? 16 DJ: Yes, we had some turkey breast for the kids last week. 9 I always keep the carcass of anything. 7, 12, 16, 17 AS: Me too, and boil the heck out of it.  DJ: Split pea with ham and Aidan loves this. 13 I love making soup. 13 I'm drifting, point me, steer me. 9, 14 AS: Let's talk about his last month or two, and then what's happened afterwards for you. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 DJ: There was a period of time being on and off again with Suboxone.  There's no housing for Suboxone.  Nobody accepts it.  DJ: You have these programs where hospitals are administering this and line you up with a doctor that can administer it, but insurance or whatever—you graduate, you're on the street and there's no safe, sober environment for people who are being medicated through the medical rehab community. 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 19 I can't tell you how many philosophical arguments I had with people.  ""Do you take Suboxone?"" 6 We're an abstinence program. 9 We can't have that influence here in our group."" 20 I get off on a tangent.  Why are people putting them on this and no one out there is tolerating it? 10 One guy says, ""I've been in this business thirty years. 9, 20 We're an abstinence-based house. 6, 9 I can't change. 16 You may have a valid issue."" 15 I always would apologize to people. 16, 17 I'd get too furious.  We'd have the names of forty places. 6, 11, 17 We found two.  Cornerstone in St. Paul and… 9 AS: New Way in Minneapolis will.  DJ: New Way, yes. 14 There were two or three of the places right around 20th Street, South Minneapolis. 11, 14, 17 I was thinking of Serenity Village.  We're the only two sober homes. 6, 19 Then you had these other rehab/living places. 6, 11, 17, 19 I can't think of the names. 6 Kim's daughter's been there. 5 If you wanted a single-family house, inconspicuous where you can have rehab it's two places. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 In St. Paul if you're on Suboxone it was $980 a month. 8 If you weren't on Suboxone it was $580 a month. 8 They doubled the price plus they kept the Suboxone so you'd have to find a way to get from whichever living unit it was to their dispensary. 6, 16 I'm like, ""What is that teaching anybody in recovery? 10 They're still in the hospital?"" 9 Give me a break. 18 AS: And we don't trust you. 9 DJ: Part of our problem was having exhausted all the options. 7, 9 He got kicked out of Serenity Village.  He got kicked out of Cornerstone in St. Paul. 9 AS: Because he relapsed? 18 DJ: Using.  The last time at Serenity, by the way the owner of Serenity has relapsed twice—he's a meth user, probably crack too. 5, 9, 16, 18 They will let people come in if there's evidence of recovery and they're clean or whatever but the minute there's any kind of secondary behavior they're just like, ""I'm sorry you're not a good influence."" 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I don't blame anybody for that. 17 I have no problem with that.  However, the progression had taken place and we filed charges legally with the police, as did some others. 6, 7, 11, 17 We had mounting legal problems.  When he got out of rehab two years ago there was no place to go. 11, 20 We finally said, ""If you're clean you do this.""  We both agreed, it wasn't just me pushing Ann; we both agreed: what are the options? 7, 9, 12 Send him to some other state that allows this and then he's not close to his son? 9, 12 His son was part of his rehab. 19 We let him stay here. 9, 19 On a day when his son and his son's mother were coming over here and we were all going to go to the auto show or the boat show, we're like, ""Aren't you ready? 7, 10, 19 We've got to go.""  He was acting agitated and I go upstairs and the bathroom’s locked. 7, 9, 10 I finally go get the little stick and push it open. 9, 17 He's hunched all over the floor and had shot up. 15 Here it was five, six months. 8 To this day, or up until he died, he maintained that he got overwhelmed because of his continued feelings for his ex. 16, 18, 19 This remorse about how bad he felt and he had to use. 9, 17 I said, ""You know what? 13, 14, 15 I believe that.  That couldn't have been Johnny-on-the-spot because I don't keep heroin in my house. 6, 9, 12 Somehow you had figured out in advance."" 12, 13 He's going, ""I had that hidden in the bathtub for longer than you think.""  He had this panel that ripped out underneath the whirlpool and he claims he could have used it two months earlier and he didn't. 8, 9 That day everything overwhelmed him and he couldn't deal with it. 13, 19 I have no reason to doubt that.  I'm not an addict so I can't understand that. 9, 12, 16 From what he has told me in his moments of sobriety and in moments of use. 9, 13, 15, 20 What I've seen in all these family programs and when I hear other recovery professionals talk about things all of that made sense to me. 10, 16, 17, 18, 20 We think he was probably sober for another five months and then something fell apart in the fall. 6, 8, 15, 20 We were like, ""We're not tolerating this. 10 We're not dealing with it."" 13 It was benzos.  That's when he got into this period of benzo use. 9 He met a guy that was buying all this crap on the Internet. 5, 7 These were like elephant tranquilizers. 7 I had a state patrol office say, ""You've got to come down here and get your son and move his car."" 7, 9, 13, 19 They didn't even incarcerate him. 7, 15 He couldn't even talk. 10, 15 I'm looking at this guy, “Like why didn't you remove him from the scene?”  As a result, he was getting a bunch of warnings, repeated warnings that we're not unaware of. 9 AS: You were not aware of?  DJ: We were not aware of.  Finally, he gets a notice.  I just opened it. 9, 12, 17 I violated every rule in the book. 12 I just opened it and they revoked his license. 9, 12, 17 It's a procedure where you have to have a medical person saying he was on these meds from his Suboxone doctor. 11, 14 He's blaming it all on this stuff. 9 I'm like, ""No, there's something else out there."" 10 His doctor confirmed that the stuff that he was using even if he tripled the dosage wouldn't make him drive that way. 7, 9, 14, 15, 16 We found out in his police record that he had like five call-ins, people on the road, ""Hey, here's a license number. 6, 7, 9 The guy's swerving all over the road."" 9 They never found him. 15 That's what was leading up to the Christmas before he passed away. 9, 16 AS: A year ago. 20 DJ: We were frantic. 7 We started the week before Christmas trying to find him a place. 9, 11, 16 We thought, ""St. Joe's in St. Paul."" 11, 12 At the last minute the guy's going, ""We've got an insurance snafu. 7, 9 We were just beside ourselves. 9, 12 We went through Christmas with him here. 9 He came to Church with us and he was sound asleep the entire service. 7, 10, 19 He had used before Church and used again Christmas Eve. 9 We had all of Ann's family, twenty-five people here that night. 18, 19 He was just a mess. 9, 12 The odd thing—we were just oblivious to it. 9, 12 We were like, ""We're not going to let it ruin our party."" 6, 10, 19 Ann's brother just was like, ""Why aren't you dealing with this?"" 5, 9, 10, 12, 13 He got real ugly about it.  Everybody else pretty much was like, ""That's what the disease is."" 10, 18 Her brother's not one that has any remotely liberal leaning thought in his bones. 5, 11, 12 Something happens it's military and it's black and white: fix it. 12, 16 When Spencer died he came around a little bit. 8, 19 Political persuasion didn't, but I think he understood the seriousness of this disease. 9 Leading up to all this we finally get him back into Fairview again. 19 I go up to visit him. 12, 13 Ann said, ""I can't deal with it. 13 I took Aidan twice I think.  I was seeing him the evenings they had open. 15, 17 I cheated a couple of times and just went in until somebody kicked me out. 9, 12, 18 Every Sunday for the family I would take Aidan there. 6, 18, 19 He's like pumped up. 10 He goes, ""I got the greatest counselor this time. 9, 10, 11 They're like, ‘Get back across the street. 9, 10, 19 Get yourself a degree in counseling and share these experiences. 20 Help others.’""  Was this a ruse? 9 Was it the ultimate in his ability for deception?  I don't know. 13, 14, 15 To see somebody so pumped up.  We had housing at something called River's Edge, I don't know what it was. 7, 13, 14, 15 It's out of Burnsville, but they have a Minnetonka facility.  We're on the way there and Spencer's calling them up and going, ""Well we're coming over. 7, 16 Where's the house at?"" 6, 9 They said to him, ""This is a lockdown facility.""  We had no idea that where he had gotten located by one of his counselors was no cell phone, meds were regulated by the whatever, and in the first thirty days he had no visitation rights. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I'm freaking out, too.  He's going, ""Did you know this?"" 13, 14, 15 We didn't show up.  Then it took us a month to find Greg, where he died. 8 AS: Greg's sober house. 6, 9 DJ: Greg McFarland, New Heights Sober Living. 8 The irony of that is he was connected to our church for the last six years that we were there. 9, 18, 20 We had no idea that he was in this business. 9, 11 He's a former alcohol abuser. 9, 17 He said, ""I used every drug. 9, 14 Alcohol is probably my weakness.""  That very last weekend then, Spencer earned his first overnight away from New Heights sober. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19 All we think is turned this leaf, everything looked great from his attitude at Fairview. 11, 19 We had Aidan for the weekend. 12, 19 He came here. 19 The two of them got to sleep together. 7 He gets up Saturday morning and said, ""I missed the meeting at New Way on Thursday. 13, 19 We have a makeup day today. 16, 19 I need to go down there."" 13 We're like, ""That's cool. 10, 17 We've got Aidan anyway. 16 Are you coming back?"" 19 ""I'm coming back, but I can't spend the night. 12, 19 I only got the one night."" 19 We knew that. 6, 12 Sure enough he came back at three o'clock and then after dinner he went home. 19, 20 I'll tell you his complexion, everything, all the good signs that you want when you're seeing somebody in recovery. 13 He wasn't broken out with all kinds of crap. 5, 16, 17 He wasn't spooky and talking weird. 10 All of those signs were gone and he spent that quality time with his son. 19 We get the call the next day that he's dead. 7, 19 It was a mind blower.  It was inconceivable and yet when you package it that's the hideousness of the disease.  We learned, as did Nancy, that there was a ruse within that last month. 8, 9, 12, 17 He was in fact using and getting away with it. 10, 16 While he wasn't stealing from us, and apparently wasn't in trouble or stealing from somebody else, he had figured out probably from new contacts at Fairview, all the time he was there, plus probably hanging out with people who are in mandatory rehab at New Way. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 He nurtured some contacts and in the police report that we saw, the night that he acquired this stuff from the woman who's killed five people he was buying it from some woman in Bloomington. 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 My feeling is he probably had one, two, or three of these relationships going on. 16 He went and told us that he had saved some couple over at Walmart in North Minneapolis when in fact it was probably he was getting them this stuff. 9, 10, 20 Maybe he could have helped them. 13, 16 I'm sure what was happening was he'd get four bags and he got to keep one or whatever. 12, 13, 15 Somebody else was buying it. 7 That was our last weekend with Spencer. 9, 12, 19 How was your walk?  AP: I don't want to interrupt. 13 I know you're recording. 6, 13, 14, 15 I want to send you a podcast that was especially made for today. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 I'll look it up, but you have to listen to the entire thing. 9, 15, 17 I don't skimp on podcasts. 9 What do you want to tell me about where you are now and where you've been since he passed in your thinking and in your grief and your own recovery? 13, 14 DJ: As I mentioned at the first Nar Anon meeting that I went to. 9, 13 It was probably four weeks or five weeks after he died.  Not knowing how to feel, not knowing how everybody else is going to react to you. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 Not knowing what possible contribution you have any more when you're the face of death. 13, 14, 15 Your experience is the end. 12 It's not what anybody who attends these meetings wants to go to. 11, 12, 13, 15 You sit and say, ""How do I contribute?"" 13 Fortunately, Barbara had come and relayed her own personal experiences. 5, 13, 16, 19 AS: Of losing her son.  DJ: And how positive things can be. 13, 14, 16 Not necessarily how they were at that moment but how it can be and how it's helped her life. 11, 13, 15, 16 How she related all of that to Twelve-step and so forth. 9, 12, 19 I found myself—that first night when it came for me to say something—saying, ""This is the ultimate letting go."" 9, 11, 19 People in grief can't let go. 19 I'm not saying I've done that, but I had my own personal spiritual experience, as you know, three days after he died that still provides all the clarity I need. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 AS: Can you tell me about that?  I've only heard little bits of it. 15 What happened? 12, 13 DJ: How detailed do you want me to get? 13 AS: As detailed as you want to get. 13 DJ: I know you said one thirty. 13, 14, 15 AS: I've got ten more minutes or fifteen. 7 DJ: Without getting carried away. 7, 16 Our first night was with Ann's family. 9, 18, 19 You're total zombies.  Our second night Greg, the sober home owner, had talked to us the first night and said, ""I have a house meeting and this is a first for us, too. 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20 Could you possibly come down here and talk to us?"" 10, 13, 19 We're like, ""You've got to be kidding."" 10 Somehow Ann and Shelley and I all went down there and it was powerful. 15 We're all just absolutely weeping. 9, 12 DJ: Nobody had gone through this experience.  They had eleven police vehicles, emergency vehicles blocking the whole street off. 7, 9 They put tape around the entire block. 10 AS: Because he had just died there. 9, 12 AP: The death investigation. 9 AS: But people were still living there. 6, 9 DJ: Yes.  Twenty people in this house. 6, 9 They've got some of them that were upstairs when it happened. 9, 12, 13 Some that were outside.  Some that weren't home at all or were coming back. 19 They've got police tape everywhere. 7 It was just this trauma. 9, 12 How do we talk about this? 10 We go do that Monday night, Tuesday we see the pastor about our celebration. 9, 19 I'm in the back yard with Pee Wee and at that moment while she's peeing I had this feeling. 13, 15, 16, 19 The next day, I knew I had heard the words on Tuesday. 6, 12, 15, 19 ""I'm not alone, I'm finally home."" 19 I couldn't see him but it's probably the Holy Spirit saying, ""He's with me."" 11 It was the start of having confidence that his life was so horrible that now it's good. 9, 11, 14, 17 He needed to go. 13 It's allowed me to accept losing my only son.  Anyways that happens Tuesday night. 12, 16, 17, 19 Wednesday morning, the third day, I wake up and Ann and I weren't sleeping at all, four hours, three hours, wake up frequently and didn't go to bed until like 2:00. 7, 11, 19, 20 At 6:00 in the morning I'm like, ""Oh my God, I thought of a client."" 10, 11, 12 I'm the only one that can do this and they had this scheduled public hearing.  I hadn't done any of the work.  I woke up and I went down and sat at my computer and thought, ""How am I going to do this?"" 10, 11, 12 I didn't even get that client file open when this ""I'm not alone, I'm finally home"" comes back into my head. 13, 15, 17, 19 I picked up a piece of paper and in ten minutes that song was there. 7 I still have the handwritten version. 9, 15 I just sat there. 9, 12 I probably sat there twenty, thirty minutes just thinking what happened? 7, 9, 12, 13 How did this happen? 12 On the back of the paper I wrote, I was sitting here so I wouldn't forget what happened. 12, 13, 19 If I had gone nuts or if something happened to me. 12, 13 I wrote it down.  This took like ten minutes. 7, 10 Maybe an hour now has past by myself, sitting at my desk. 9, 13, 14 It's light out at that time of the year. 20 I'm chomping at the bit to share this with Ann.  I go up there and she's sound asleep. 7, 10 I'm like, ""I can't wake her up. 10 I went down and I sat in her easy chair. 12 I never do that. 15 I was just looking out the window and again not seeing anything I had my body or my mind filled with a spiritual experience, which was not specifically this, it wasn't specifically that. 7, 9, 12 I wasn't seeing something; I wasn't hearing anything.  There was an exhilaration.  I mean like fireworks, but I'm not seeing them. 14, 15, 16 My body is slowly getting pumped up.  I'm not moving a muscle.  Ann comes down there and we're used to seeing each other sitting in a chair, blind, looking out the window. 9, 12, 13, 19 She's going, ""Are you alright?"" 14 I jump up and I'm going, ""This is beautiful!"" 6 I'm not some crazy Evangelical freak. 16 I don't know what I'm saying."" 11, 13, 14, 15 I'm babbling.  She's not buying this. 7 She's not coming any closer.  I just go, ""Go over and read that on my desk."" 9, 12 She went and saw the music and then she read this other thing.  We're hugging each other and crying. 11 Finally, she gets up to make coffee. 16 Goes into the kitchen and I'm exhausted because now it's probably an hour and a half since I got up. 9, 14, 20 I got down on my hands and knees.  I was going to pray.  I found myself walking. 15 I had sandals on and I kicked them off and I laid there and I just started praying. 9, 11, 12 I laid on my back and I started feeling the same thing I was feeling in the chair. 9, 11, 12, 16, 19 I wasn't seeing lights; I wasn't hearing a thing.  The ground wasn't moving at that time. 8 I'm feeling this presence that is inexplicable. 16 I'm like, ""Lord, I'm yours. 10 I'm convinced.  I'm not a doubting Thomas anymore. 13 Take me.""  Then I thought—because now I'm feeling physical movement in my body. 11, 12, 14, 16 I'm not levitating, but I'm feeling this. 16 I'm like, ""You can't take me now. 6, 10, 14 This will kill Ann."" 7 I'm saying to God. 11 I said, ""Okay.""  These experiences were obviously physical to me.  I'm probably racing to beat the band even though I don't recall a physical activity. 7, 10, 15 My pulse rate was probably exploding.  Take me.  I'm joining you right now."" 14 Then I said, ""No give me five minutes."" 6, 7 I called Ann and I said, ""Come in here."" 7 She finds me laying on the floor.  What did I say?  ""Hold me."" 20 AP: You were saying, ""Feel this."" 11 DJ: I wanted like the movies where you see, ""Take this moonbeam"" and it shoots out of my finger into you. 12, 13 I'm holding her and she's like, ""What's going on here?"" 10, 20 I tried to explain that this was spiritual. 10 We probably laid there for five, ten minutes. 7 She's like, ""I just have to figure this out."" 9, 10, 12, 13 She went back in the kitchen. 19 I laid there and now this shaking was concerning me. 14 All of a sudden. 13 I probably was doing breathing trying to tone myself down. 16 Maybe I was there ten minutes and I rolled over on my side and slowly pushed myself up. 7 I'm going, ""This is cool. 17 My number wasn't up.""  I walk into the kitchen and Ann looks at me like, ""Your face, you're tan, your bags are gone under your eyes."" 10, 14, 16 I'm like, ""Let me tell you. 10 I didn't tell you when you were hugging me, but I was crawling on the floor and I found myself kicking off my sandals like Moses in front of the burning bush."" 9 She told me first about my face being tan before I said anything about Moses. 9, 20 If that isn't enough. 20 I text the pastor. 9 I'm going, ""You've got to find a little time for me.  I had a pretty bizarre..."" 18 He didn't answer me.  That was Wednesday. 19 Thursday I get a text back. 19 He's going, ""I'm so sorry."" 10 Wednesday they have a Wednesday night service. 19 ""I'm doing a new sermon series and I was just struggling yesterday and can you come over?"" 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 I'm sitting down and I'm relaying all this to him. 13 He's smiling and I'm thinking ""Oh my God.  He's heard it. 15 He's heard this fifty times. 15, 18 He's just going to pat me on the back and say 'Let's see how you're doing after the celebration.'"" 9, 12, 19 Before I was finished with the story he goes over and he's got this enormous cupboard that's a dry erase board and he had his entire outline of this new seven-week series and it was referred to as ""A Call versus a Calling."" 5, 6, 9, 12, 14 He says, ""I just wanted to tell you how I struggled all day yesterday coming up with the final content."" 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 While I'm going through this is when he was trying to figure out what his final content would be for this series. 13, 15, 16 He says, ""I never had a call. 7, 15 You've just had a call. 7, 9, 12 You're one of the lucky ones.  My call I was sitting on my ass."" 7, 13 He said that to me.  ""I was sitting on my ass watching a football game eating a whole bag of potato chips and my high school Sunday school teacher calls me and says, 'Get off your fat ass and go to theology school.' 7, 8, 13, 19 I had a calling, but it wasn't a sexy call."" 7 Here his whole thing is about call versus calling. 7 ""I just got to tell you the timing of all of this is so remarkable because for the first time in my career as a minister I used an analogy from Hollywood."" 7, 9, 11, 12 There down here was call and next to it was Moses and the burning bush. 7, 9 [laughs]  In between that time Ann and I went back to Greg's to get Spencer's belongings. 19 I told him of my experience and he said, ""What time did you go to bed last night?"" 9, 19, 20 Ann says, ""Two o'clock.""  He said, ""I woke up at two o'clock.  I came down here and turned off a couple of lights. 19 I just couldn't sleep.” 7, 9, 12 I was sitting at my computer and I heard a door close. 10, 13, 15 I got up and I looked over.  This is an old B & B, so it's huge. 20 Twenty people live there.  He goes, “Then I hear the same thing.  A door close, but nobody came down. 19 I went back to my computer and just like you always feel somebody's eyes on the back of your head."" 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 He turned around and he claims that he had a vision of Spencer and Spencer said, ""Hey, it's cool I was just checking on all my friends."" 8, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 Pretty spooky.  I have never had a vision of Spencer. 15 I've had many Spencer moments. 13, 15 This takes the cake, that whole song. 6 The whole time leading up to the celebration.  AS: You wrote a song?  You wrote music?  AP: Amy wasn't at the service.  DJ: I'll print and e-mail you.  I wrote this summary down, and then it has the song.  AS: Could you take a picture of it and send it to me? 6, 12 AP: Did I give you a copy of his memorial? 6 I think I've got an extra.  AS: I don't think so.  DJ: When you say a picture.  AS: You had written it down, your handwriting. 15 That one I still have in a file somewhere. 9 DJ: The song now, everything's packed up. 14 AS: Are you saying that a tune came to you? 11, 19 DJ: Even the melody came to me. 19 On my handwritten, again my father being a piano teacher I know what notes look like. 5, 8, 13, 14, 15 I used to sing in the choir in the Lutheran school. 7, 8, 9 I was trying to as this melody was coming to me and then I hummed it and even recorded myself and gave that to the pastor. 6, 9, 15, 16 The music director at our church was on vacation until the Thursday before the celebration. 10, 14, 19 All she had were the written words and I actually sang a verse and the chorus. 10, 15 She nailed it.  AS: That's so beautiful you guys. 6 I never saw this. 15 AP: I thought I gave you a copy. 11, 12 AS: If you did I'll return this. 19 AP: I've got like five extra.  AS: Oh, my dear.  DJ: I have a hard copy right here. 11, 14 AP: You could just take a picture of it. 6, 9, 12 AS: Is this the song?  AP: Yes.  AS: I don't remember seeing this.  AP: Did you ever meet Spencer? 13 AS: I met Spencer very briefly at the first picnic that we had at St. Louis Park. 5, 9 AP: That's right. 14 AS: Aidan was there.  AP: That's right. 14 AS: Doreen's daughter talked to him, went outside with him and chatted with him. 5, 10, 11 I think he was in some form of recovery. 17 AP: Usually he'd relapse in the fall, Christmas time is what I want to think. 9, 13, 18 I've got it all written down somewhere. 15 That's what I've got on my list to do. 9 To start this insurance. 7, 9, 11 They're looking at the insurance. 7 Then I thought that I should talk… 10, 11, 12 AS: Thank you,  Dean, that was really very powerful. 15 I appreciate it.  DJ: Yesterday Jamie tells us about Aidan moving and she got all emotional. 9, 13, 19 All I have to do is hear somebody whimper and I'm gone. 19 AP: He can never speak publicly. 15 I mean you're a great public speaker. 11, 16 AS: But with emotions.  DJ: It can't include emotions.  I couldn't go to my own retirement party. 6 Don't plan one.  That got me going and then Ann says, ""Nancy wants to talk to you."" 10, 11, 13 AP: Nancy called yesterday. 7, 9, 14, 19 DJ: Talk about our experiences.  Nancy and I talked for about forty-five minutes. 7, 10, 11 We're both bawling.  Then I had to go to a meeting last night. 9, 13, 19 Then this, it gets me pumped up.  AS: Thank you.  DJ: It's positive. 13, 14 AS: I have to agree with that.  AP: It is very cathartic to talk. 10 Have you talked to any other people who have lost their kids? 9, 10, 11 AS: Yes.  AP: Is it helpful to them, too? 13 AS: Yes.  People in different stages of grief. 9, 16, 17 I think that you two are the first people who I've talked to so quickly after. 9, 10, 11 We talked in the beginning of July. 10, 11 It had only been two months, three months. 8 AP: That was right near his birthday. 14, 19 AS: You brought the pictures out. 9, 18 AP: I still haven't taken them out. 6, 9 AS: Sometime when we have a moment more. 5, 13, 15 I would like to talk with you about or just get your thoughts even in writing about this case with the dealer and these five people whose death she's being charged with. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 Your take on it. 6 How you've processed it.  AS: Kind of just if you have a moment and you're thinking about it and you just wanted to write it down for me. 9, 12, 13, 15 I feel like it's very controversial because there is this grey area. 16 It's not the black and white.  Even though the drugs are illegal and what they're doing is illegal what the addicts are doing is illegal, too. 14 I'm just kind of interested in that grey area. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 AP: That's what's difficult. 20 Especially—I'll put it in Aidan's perspective. 10 Here we tell him that his dad died of a brain disease.  Yet, somebody's being charged for his murder. 17 DJ: Even outside of that perspective, his behavior is such that whether it was this woman or another he might have had three dealers. 13 He voluntarily did this plus we were told from a victim advocate… 10, 20 AP: I got the letter yesterday. 9, 14, 19 DJ: Having to go see therapists, losing work, or whatever. 6, 9 We get a letter back going, ""You're not eligible for this because your son did illegal activities."" 10, 19 The question you're posing is not a sensitive one to me. 6, 9, 13 I'm in agreement with you.  If I was forced to go to this trial I probably, whereas when you read some of the things from the other parents. 10, 16 They want to go in there with a gun and shoot her. 13 I'd probably forgive her. 6 AP: I'd like to have the drug companies up there with her. 10, 14 AS: The oxy.  AP: The therapist I'm seeing, I said, ""I just don't know how to deal with this. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I don't feel anything towards her. 16 But yet I want to represent how Spencer would feel and he'd want us to forgive her."" 6, 7, 13, 16 DJ: I think so, too.  AS: Think about Dylan Roof who just went into that church and gunned down all those people and what was their response? 9, 12 We're going to forgive you. 6 DJ: And his was no remorse.  AP: And no remorse.  She might choose to have that, too.  It doesn't matter. 20 Then we think well, maybe we shouldn't even participate at all in it. 9, 15 DJ: I have no intention at all. 15 AS: Of going you mean? 16 Participate how?  They want you to testify? 9, 13 AP: No, no, not testify but just go and hear what the trial is. 9, 12 I'd probably go more for interest or to read a victim's statement, which would be one of forgiveness for her. 6, 9, 19 AS: That would be powerful. 15 AP: Or ask why the drug companies aren't up there with her. 14 AS: Just get that in the record. 6, 9 That would be powerful. 15 Has she been charged? 17 AP: She was supposed to go on trial two days ago, the 17th, but then the judge had a conflict so now it's rescheduled for the 20th of March. 6, 14, 19 You're more than welcome to come with me. 13, 19 I don't want anybody making a political statement out of it. 9, 13 I don't want the newspaper sitting there. 6, 13 AP: All the other men that have died using her heroin have been named in the paper and Spencer hasn't. 5, 6 That's the way we want to keep it. 12, 13, 16 AS: For Aidan.  AP: I could care less for us, but for Aidan. 7 DJ: Maybe the silver lining is that he's moving to Kansas City and this won't hit the street until after that. 9 AP: We haven't talked to the prosecuting attorney at all. 10, 11 She might plead guilty, or they'll come up with some settlement. 13, 17, 19 What's scares me is that the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, this is political hay that he can make by getting somebody with five convictions against her. 7, 16 This other mother that's such an activist, I just don't want to talk to her. 9, 10, 12, 13 DJ: If you consider somebody like Michael, relatively young person, early in the stage of recovery this would be devastating. 9, 14 AP: This woman, this family that lost their twenty-year-old son. 9, 18, 20 He'd only been using about a year. 20 They don't have the experience of dealing with the disease that we've had. 13 DJ: If they're ever viewing us and her at the same time the answers would be well we're like, ""Our son had absolutely no quality of life.” 10, 11 “Our son didn't have a chance to experience life."" 11 When you ask that question and you think you've got five different individuals you’ve probably got at least two and maybe three different opinions on how they attack this. 6, 9, 16, 17 Part of my release, part of my letting go is not wanting anything to do with this. 13, 19 I don't need to read police reports anymore. 7, 13 I don't want the details. 13 It's part of letting go because it can't possibly help me. 13, 19 It might hurt me.  I'm not fearful of that.  For Ann to want to pursue it, she's got to do it. 13 I don't have any problem, but I don't want her to be dragged into my attitude and I don't want to be dragged into hers. 13, 14 The pastor made that clear. 9, 16 You're going to have totally different paths on how you do this. 14, 16, 17 Let's just hope you can stay joined at the hip while you're going down these paths. 9, 10, 12, 14 You too Pee Wee.  AS: Pee  Wee's the dog by the way. 10, 16"

AS: Do you want to talk about where and when you were born? 10, 13 CK: I was born November 30, 1976 in Minneapolis.  I want to say I was born at St. Mary’s, but I don’t think it exists anymore. 9, 13 I have a sister, but we don’t share the same dad. 5, 9 I have a brother and sister who we have the same mom but different dads. 5, 9, 15, 16, 17 Then I have a brother who we have the same dad but different moms. 5, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: Are you the oldest? 5, 9, 20 CK: I am the youngest. 9, 14 AS: Where did you grow up? 17 CK: I grew up in South Minneapolis.  My dad had a house on Fifteenth and Lake Street and my mom moved around a lot. 6, 8, 9, 15, 17 I moved back and forth between them both until I got a little older and then I was with my dad. 5, 8, 19, 20 AS: What were the circumstances that led to you living with your dad? 6, 9 CK: My dad just wanted me to have a stable place. 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 I think my mom tried but it was just really hard with three kids. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 I felt that my dad could financially support me better than my mom. 15, 17 I don’t know if this will be in the book, but I have never confronted my mom about it, but her boyfriend was really mean to me. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I was treated differently because I was biracial and my siblings weren’t. 5, 16, 17 AS: What is your background? 8, 19 CK: I am Hispanic.  My dad was Hispanic.  AS: Was he mean to you physically? 7, 16 He would hang me out of a second story window by my feet and let me go and then catch me again. 9, 10, 19, 20 He would lock me in the porch and say I was sleeping with the porch monkeys. 7 I didn’t know what any of that meant. 13, 14, 15, 16 I haven’t talked to my mom about it, whether she knew it was going on or not. 6, 10, 11, 12, 15 I just feel like I’d rather not know because I am close with my mom now. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I never told my dad because I was afraid he would hurt him because he was a violent person. 15, 20 AS: That’s a lot to hold onto. 17, 20 CK: My dad dated his first cousin for ten years. 5, 9, 20 I had no idea. 11 When I was young I just thought it was his girlfriend. 9, 11, 12, 14 I didn’t put the dynamics together until I was a little older. 5, 10, 20 I just thought we were just going to family events. 9, 11, 12, 15, 18 I didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: That is complicated. 10 CK: It is a lot now that I’m older. 5, 14, 17, 20 It was always the, “Don’t talk about it” in our family type of thing. 10, 16, 17, 18 AS: On both sides?  CK: I’m not that close to my mom’s side of the family, but on my dad’s side for sure. 15, 18 We just don’t talk about it. 9, 10, 12 Nobody talks about it. 10, 14 AS: How old were you when you moved in with your dad? 8, 20 You’re dad must have know things were going on that weren’t good. 13, 14, 15, 16 CK: I don’t know if he did. 13, 14, 15 If he did know what was going on I really think he would be in jail. 13, 14, 15 AS: Is that guy still around? 8, 9 Is he still with your mom? 9, 15 My mom met somebody when I was around ten and he’s a really good guy. 5, 8, 15 I’ve never even heard him raise his voice. 15 I think my mom drank a lot then, too. 7, 14, 15, 17 When I look back my dad was doing drugs back then and I just didn’t know the signs. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I didn’t know what was going on. 13, 14, 15 AS: When you were small.  You have memory of that.  So you moved in with your dad when? 8 CK: I went back and forth until we moved to Andover when I was around eleven. 8, 15, 19 I would go to my mom’s and visit but I lived with my dad. 12, 13, 15 AS: How was your middle school and high school time? 8 CK: It was fine. 14 I was pregnant in middle school, so I had to leave middle school. 6, 8 AS: Do you want to talk about that? 10, 13 CK: Nobody ever talked to me about sex or anything so I had no idea what I was doing. 10, 11 I got pregnant the first time I had sex. 9 I got pulled out of school to go to the Teen Parent program in Anoka. 8, 16 I went to school there. 8 I should back up. 19 My dad was livid, obviously, and he wanted me to give it up for adoption. 6, 12, 13 I was young and scared and I didn’t know what to do. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 We went to this adoption agency and went through everything and met with families and stuff. 5, 9 When I talked to the doctor before I had her she said if I say that I don’t want to give her up in front of the nurses and the doctors my dad can’t make me do it. 6, 10, 11, 13, 16 AS: She let you know about your power. 13, 14, 15, 19 I did that and it was rough. 18 It was hard. 11 AS: You got pregnant at fourteen then?  I think I was pregnant just when I turned fourteen and I had her when I was fifteen. 9, 12, 19 AS: Talk about that a little more.  What happened when she was born? 12, 13 CK: I got my own place. 11 I got emancipated.  AS: What happened in the hospital? 12, 13 CK: I had her and right after I had her I looked at my dad and the nurse already knew I was going to do it. 6, 12, 14 I just said, “I don’t want to give her up for adoption. 6, 9, 12, 13 I’m not okay with it.”  He left and took her dad’s shoes.  I don’t know why but for whatever reason. 13, 14, 15 I stayed with him for a little bit and finished a little more schooling. 5, 8, 9 She went to school with me because in the Teen Parent program you went to school and then you worked in the day care for an hour or an hour and a half a day and then you went to your other classes. 7, 8, 16, 19, 20 All the girls in this school were pregnant and we all switched off. 8 There were some other staff there too. 9 AS: How many of you were there?  CK: I want to say there were maybe fifteen. 9, 13 AS: Did they come from one high school? 8, 13, 19 AS: When was she born?  CK: March 27, 1992.  I ended up getting my own apartment on Twenty-ninth and Lake Street and I went to South High School. 12, 20 My mom helped watch her while I worked two different jobs. 13, 15, 16, 17 At that age you could only work so many hours legally. 11 AS: You worked and you went to school full-time and you have a newborn? 6, 8, 11 I ended up not finishing school. 8, 12 I went back to finish school, but it was too hard. 8, 11, 19 I had to support myself.  AS: I can’t imagine. 14 Did you ever get connected with WIC [Women, Infants, and Children Program] or any of those assistance programs? 9, 14, 18 CK: I was on WIC.  She was allergic to formula and she had to have goat’s milk or something and I remember back then that it was twenty-eight dollars a can. 17, 19 I did end up getting on WIC. 12 In my entire life I think I have been on welfare for six months. 8, 11 I was determined.  Everybody told me my life was over. 11, 20 There was no encouragement there.  None.  My life was over instead of being like, “this will be a different path” and encouraging me. 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17 I remember being young I never felt stable because I was bounced around and back and forth so much. 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 I didn’t want that for my kids. 13 It made me feel like I never had a home really. 15, 16, 19 I did get what’s called Homes Park Village. 7 They are subsidized townhomes and I did end up moving there which helped me a lot. 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 And then I met my youngest daughter’s dad and we ended up getting married and bought a house. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 We ended up getting divorced, but we were together for sixteen, seventeen years. 5, 12, 20 When did you go back to school? 8, 19 CK: I think Ashley was two.  AS: That is your second daughter. 5, 20 What is your first daughter’s name? 5, 6, 9 CK: My first daughter is Ashley and my second daughter is Asia. 5, 9, 20 When Ashley was two I ended up going to get my GED and then went to Lakewind Dental Academy, which was on Lake Street at the time near Lake Calhoun. 12 I went there to get my dental assisting license. 9 I didn’t like it. 10 I finished all the bookwork and paperwork and I opened someone’s mouth and I couldn’t do it. 17 I ended up getting a job where they made dentures and stuff and I worked there for a few years. 9, 12, 16, 20 I ended up getting my job at Regis and I have been there for fifteen years. 12, 20 I work in the corporate office.  CK: I am an education coordinator. 10 I work for the Super Cuts brand. 7 There is an umbrella, so we own ninety percent of the hair industry. 9, 12, 16 Super Cuts is mainly franchise owned, so I work with the franchisees. 7 Before a stylist can get on the floor they go through a weeklong training so I schedule those. 9 AS: Do you have another job?  CK: I do I work at Abbott [Northwestern Hospital]. 9 CK: I schedule the nurses.  You schedule the hospital every four hours so you have to get the floor staffed every four hours based on their needs. 9, 11, 13 You have the scheduled staff, but people call in. 7, 9 AS: Are you full time? 11 CK: I am a point seven.  AS: How much do you work for Regis? 18 CK: I work for Regis full time. 11 AS: So you basically have two full time jobs. 7, 11 CK: Yes.  AS: You have worked hard your whole life. 11 CK: When I got divorced was when I had to pick up the other job because I couldn’t make it without it. 5, 16 AS: When did you notice your dad’s addiction issues? 14, 15 CK: I noticed my dad’s addiction issues before Ashley was born. 14, 15 Probably around when I was twelve. 8 He would walk around the house like a zombie. 6, 9 I didn’t know exactly what was going on but then I realized it because he would send me to go get his drugs because he couldn’t drive high. 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 We lived in Andover and I would drive. 7, 14 I think I was about thirteen or fourteen then.  Go to the houses and get his drugs and then bring him home. 6, 9, 14, 19 I did it because I was scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 AS: How long of a drive? 7, 14 To Minneapolis from Andover.  I don’t know if you know where that is. 13, 14, 15 AS: Where did you go in Minneapolis?  CK: Do you know where the Sears Tower is? 13, 14, 15 It was right there. 14 AS: You drove in your dad’s car to get him drugs. 7, 14 They just knew you were coming? 6, 9, 12 CK: Yes.  I remember being so scared when I would walk in the halls. 5, 7, 11, 12 We would get it and it looked like a can of hairspray or something. 12 We would unscrew the bottom of it.  AS: And you would hand over the cash?  I never looked in it. 15 It was like a little envelope and one time I did look in it because I was curious.  CK: That time it was white.  AS: It was heroin?  Was that his main thing?  CK: Yes it was, but he would get high off anything if he couldn’t get that. 8 AS: How many times do you remember going for him? 18 CK: Through the years, several. 20 I don’t even remember. 15 AS: It was frequent though. 11 It wasn’t just one time. 9, 12 Eventually I ended up getting my license so I could drive and then I felt like I had to do it because what if he got in an accident or hurt somebody? 7, 12, 14, 17 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 In my head it was like I was doing the right thing AS: Even though you could have gotten in terrible trouble. 14, 15 None of that crossed my mind.  Never.  It never crossed my mind because I guess I never thought that the cops could raid this place or the cops could--none of that ever crossed my mind at the time. 10, 11, 12, 15 AS: Where are your older siblings at this point? 5, 20 Do you have contact with them? 10 CK: Yeah, but they were completely separate with my dad. 14, 19 They were with my mom. 15 AS: All your other siblings are not his children? 5, 14 You're his only child?  CK: My brother. 5 My brother was with his mom and he has addiction problems, too. 5, 15 He was never raised by my dad has seen him, but not a lot through his life. 5, 11, 15, 17 AS: So your main priority was protecting your dad and other people from him getting in a car? 7, 19 CK: I think in my mind honestly it was more protecting him than anybody else. 9, 16 Then I remember I moved back home. 8, 19 I got my place until fifteen and I moved back home when I was--he moved because he was living in a woman and he moved into a trailer and I think I was there for about a year. 6, 8, 11, 19, 20 AS: You lived in the trailer with him and your baby? 5 CK: Yes.  I would just stay there because I was scared he was going to die. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 I was so young. 14 I was scared he was going to overdose and be by himself. 5, 7, 11, 12, 15 And so I stayed, I would watch him--the minute I would even talk to him on the phone I would know he was high. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 I knew instantly. 6, 9, 12 Then I remember I tried to commit suicide once. 10 I just wanted him to wake up. 9, 12, 13 I didn't really want to hurt myself, but I just wanted him to see he was hurting me, and I didn't understand why I wasn't more important than this drug. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 He came to the hospital. 19 AS: Where did you try to do that? 16 Do you mind talking about it? 10 CK: No, I don't mind.  We lived in Oakdale at the time when he moved into the trailer park. 8 It was called Glandfall. 7, 8 AS: You did that where you were living with him? 6 What happened? 12, 13 Did you take something? 6 CK: I took these pills called trazodone. 7 I took like twenty of them.  CK: I don't remember how--I don't remember where they came from, but I remember taking them. 19 My girlfriend knew something was wrong and she called the police and they pumped my stomach. 6, 7, 9, 12 Now when I'm older I think, ""Why didn't social services step in at any point?"" 5, 9, 12, 14, 20 They had to have known he was high when he came to the hospital. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: You were fifteen?  CK: No, I was probably—I have to remember because the way I deal with things is I just don't think about it. 9, 12, 13, 16 I had to have been sixteen.  AS: Because you had had that year and then you moved back with him. 8, 19, 20 Do you remember ever talking about what was upsetting you? 10, 17, 19 CK: I was very--yeah and he would say he wants to clean; he wants to do better. 10, 11, 13 He went to treatment several times and every time he would get out he would relapse. 9, 16, 18 AS: Was he ever on medically assisted treatment that you knew of? 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 Was he ever on methadone?  CK: Not that I know of. 13, 14, 15 He tried to hide it for so long because he was a Minneapolis firefighter. 10, 15 AS: Can you talk about his life? 10, 11 What you know about your dad's life and his parents? 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 CK: I know that my grandpa was very abusive to him. 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 AS: Where did your dad grow up? 17 CK: In north Minneapolis, I believe.  He used to tell me about stories of how my grandpa would kind of shave his head, physically abusive to him. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 My grandma—the Mexican side lost custody of him so my grandpa Jack—I think it was boiled down to who had more money. 7, 9 AS: Was grandpa 7 Jack white?  So they had more money, so my grandma Margaret ended up raising my dad. 7, 12 It was Jack's mom. 15 She was my great grandma. 7, 11 I loved her. 13 She was my grandma. 7 My dad was her favorite, and she knew my dad was sick. 6, 12 She always used to tell me, ""He's sick."" 9, 16, 17 AS: When you were little?  CK: When I was older. 5, 20 AS: So she seemed to have some compassion with that. 19 AS: Did you ever know your grandma on the Mexican side? 7, 13, 14, 15 I did but when he was dating his cousin she wouldn't—I didn't get why we would never go over there. 5, 15 We would see her at Christmas or when they would all get together, but it would never be where I would go over there and visit with her. 9, 12, 13, 15 I didn't understand until I was older why—that she didn't agree with it. 5, 9, 12, 16, 20 AS: She had a point.  [laughs]  [laughs]  AS: What else do you know about your dad's life? 11, 13, 14, 15 His career? 7, 11 His schooling? 8 CK: He didn't finish school. 8 I remember when he passed away I tried to get his school records because I was curious and he didn't make it out of elementary school. 6, 7, 8, 10, 16 When he started in the fire department he was grandfathered in, and my grandmother was able to read the test to him because he couldn't read or write. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15 I remember he would be able to take tests home and I would read them to him and he would answer the questions. 6, 9, 19 I mean he could do basics, but he really couldn't spell. 16 AS: He missed out on a lot of school. 8, 17 He was very lucky to get the job with the city. 20 I believe my grandma Margaret told me she took his GED test for him. 7, 9, 20 I don't know how. 13, 14, 15 Back in the day it must not have been how it is now. 14, 19 I have no idea. 11 AS: So he did get a GED?  CK: Yeah, but she took the test for him. 9 I don't know how—I've always wondered, ""How'd you do that?"" 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Did they let him take it home? 6, 19 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I would be curious.  It was so long ago who knows how it was. 13, 14, 15 AS: This would have been in the seventies? 15 Do you know when he started working in the fire department? 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 CK: I don't know the year, but I know he was there for seventeen years. 13, 14, 15, 20 I think he passed away probably four years—I can't even, I don't even know the time frame after he retired early. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 AS: How old were you when he was retired early? 12, 19, 20 CK: I was in my twenties, maybe thirties. 9 No, I was in my late twenties.  AS: Can you talk about your life once you got a little older and you started— CK: I didn't let my kids see him. 5, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20 I just didn't want them to have to see what I would have to see. 9, 12, 13 I would get calls from him like, ""I'm hungry,"" or ""Can you come get me?"" and I would always go. 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 I would leave the kids with my husband and I would go and I would always help and it took me a long time to realize I'm not helping him. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I'm enabling him.  AS: Because you would get him food and bring him what he needs. 13 And then someone was like, ""That just gives him to use his money for drugs because he knows you're going to bring that stuff to him."" 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 I think when I finally moved out of the trailer is I took a nap in his bed and I woke up and there was a needle sticking in my leg. 8, 9, 13 I had to get tested for everything for seven years. 9, 20 I don't know if it was, I can't remember—he used to, I don't know if there was anything in the needle at the time. 9, 13, 14, 15 Probably not.  There wasn't anything left over.  [laughs]  CK: Yeah, I was done.  CK: I was probably seventeen. 15 Sixteen, seventeen.  AS: So that lasted about a year? 9, 20 CK: Yeah, and I just thought, ""I can't do this."" 9, 11, 12 You know? 13, 14, 15 It was just—it was every time he called I would be like, ""What now?"" 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 It was never a happy feeling when he would call. 7, 15, 16, 17 AS: Your whole life pretty much. 11, 18 He was in another jail.  AS: And he would be able to go back to his job? 19 CK: I guess this was after he—I don't know when he—I'm serious I just completely... 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 After he got let go was when he was in and out of jail. 19 I believe when he was working a few years before he was let go they did raid the fire department and found stuff in his locker. 9, 15, 19, 20 I think it is actually online because I remember printing it and reading it. 6, 10, 11 AS: So for you this is like putting piece together about what you experienced, but you never had all the information. 10, 15, 17 CK: Just when I look back now at all of the weird stuff that would happen would make sense. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 I knew very young he was using. 6, 12, 14 And I didn't—until my twenties was when I realized this is how he was going to die. 14 I remember when I got the call when he—he had a drug induced stroke because he would shoot up and he had a stroke in his brain stem. 7, 9, 14 A week, maybe a week and a half prior to that he had this terrible headache where he was—he had never called me like he was in pain and I took him to Region's hospital in St. Paul and they were like, ""We're just going to give him some—it was either Percocet or Vicodin—two of them because he was labeled as a seeker is what they called him. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 19, 20 I was like, ""Are you going to do any cat scans or anything? 10 And they didn't because they just looked at him as a drug user. 9, 12, 14 AS: What was going on in his brain?  CK: He was having many strokes because basically the nerves in his brain were misfiring and that was what was causing the headaches, but he was shooting up and he had MRSA [methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus] and it went into his blood stream and somehow in his brain—before that he was hallucinating, he would start hallucinating. 5, 7, 9, 11 I donated his brain to science, the coroner asked me to, but then when I got to the hospital when he had the big stroke he was coherent and he was like, ""Do you know her?"" 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 And he was like, I mean, he couldn't talk. 10, 16 He lay down and that was the last time he was conscious because he had it in his main brain stem. 9 He was alive for three days before they took him off life support. 11, 19 They said he was never going to—and he has told me he doesn't want to live like that. 13, 15, 20 AS: Can you talk and unpack that story a little more about the treatment at the hospital when you took him for the headache? 9, 10, 16 CK: I was angry.  I called them after he died. 7 I called the patient representative and I told him, I said, ""I feel like..."" I don't know if anything could have been done, but I feel like he wasn't treated fairly because he was a drug addict, and it's crazy because I remember calling the hospital and being like, ""Someone needs to help him. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 He is not capable of taking care of himself. 7 He's hurting himself, he's hallucinating,"" and they were like, ""There's nothing we can do unless he walks in here on his own."" 10, 12 CK: This was way before this incident happened, but I would remember being so frustrated. 9, 12, 13, 16 No one would help and he is an adult, you can't make him get help. 13, 16 I just wanted—he was hurting himself. 9, 12, 13 I remember thinking, ""This is ridiculous.  He is hurting himself."" 12 I remember in the hospital when he died I had to sign a waiver because they had to put him in this machine—it's like a big tube—because they wanted to see what was going on in his brain. 8, 10, 12, 13 AS: After he died?  This was like the first day. 9, 19 The MRI thing.  I had to sign a waiver because he was an addict.  They put tape on his arms right here and right here. 10, 14 When he went in all the needles that were broken in his arms and his hands burned up to the surface of his skin. 5, 13 Because it is a giant magnet. 8 They knew—I didn't know that was going to happen, but they knew. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 I'm assuming they had seen it before, but they made me sign a waiver that if there's any metal in his body—that explains why they put tape on his arms and his hands. 5, 10, 16 I felt guilty. 17 I felt guilty for a long time because I remember when I got the call I was like, thought to myself, ""Let this be it. 7, 10, 11, 12, 17 Let this be the end."" 12 AS: I can't imagine thinking anything else after what you had been through. 14 Because he had been hallucinating so bad up to that point.  He was at my uncle's at Stacy, Minnesota and he broke into a fire house. 6, 9, 15 Out there they don't stay in there. 9 When there's a call they go. 7 He stole the fire truck and went to my uncle's with full lights, everything. 9, 11, 15, 18 It is a funny story because I can't imagine what my uncle was going through, but he had the full lights on and walked in there fully geared up and put a flash light in my uncle's face and said, ""There's a bomb in the house."" 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17 He thought people were—the CIA was following him. 11, 12 He really was hallucinating.  AS: And even at this point that's not grounds for mental health— CK: No, they wouldn't help. 8, 13, 14, 15 Not if he doesn't walk in there on his own.  I think that was a couple, maybe six months before he died. 8, 9 AS: Was he using meth do you think? 5 CK: No, he was using cocaine and heroin.  He was doing speedballs. 8 There were always burnt spoons and cotton balls. 8, 16, 17 Alcohol—I didn't know what the alcohol was for. 13, 14, 15 AS: When we talked on the phone I think you talked about what it was like walking into his place. 7, 10, 11, 15 CK: After he passed away. 16 It was sad because he didn't have much. 12, 18 He was an addict so he— AS: Had you been there recently?  CK: I had been there a couple of times. 18 He was at a house—he rented a duplex and he rented the top floor to I think he was a former captain of the fire department, Larry. 6, 9, 15, 16, 17 He rented it from Larry and I think Larry felt bad for him and knew he had some issues. 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 It was hard because I had to warn people and be like, ""You can't just dig around and go in pockets and lift things up because there's going to be needles."" 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 He would hide them everywhere and I think when he was high he would hide them or put them places and forget where they were. 8, 10, 11, 17 Used ones.  That's when I found out about the needle exchange. 13, 16 I didn't know what to do with them. 13, 14, 15 I was like, ""I can't just throw these out,"" because I knew he had hepatitis. 6, 9, 10, 12 I was like, ""I don't feel right because what if someone gets stuck with these, what if..."" 9, 10, 14, 16 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I didn't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: So after he passed you collected them all?  I called the hospital and they're the ones that told me about the needle exchange. 7, 13, 16, 20 Access Works.  I think it's on Nicollet. 19 It's almost downtown and you would never know it was there. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I remember walking in and there were couches and there were people sitting on there, and I remember walking in and bursting into tears. 9, 13, 15 I just did not know—I had no idea what I was—it just was really sad to me. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The people that were there were getting clean needles. 13 And I just thought, you know, it just broke my heart. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Because your dad didn't overdose? 15 He died of his drug complications due to his drug abuse. 9, 10, 14 What happened? 12, 13 CK: I didn't stick around. 8, 9 I do remember that she asked me if I was okay. 10 I just said, ""Yes, I'm okay."" 9, 12 I just explained that these were used needles and they were my dad's. 9, 12, 13 She was like, ""Do you need to talk to anybody?"" 10, 13 And I just wanted to get out of there and I just wanted to leave. 6, 9, 12, 13 It wasn't a scary place. 7, 11 It just—I just didn't know this type of stuff existed. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: And your dad didn't either.  CK: I don't know where he would get his needles. 13, 14, 15 I don't know how. 13, 14, 15 I never figured that out. 12, 13, 15 How he would get access to them. 6 AS: Did you ever go through his cell phone? 7 CK: Did he have a cell phone? 7 I never went through his stuff because at that point he was just gone. 9, 12, 15, 19 I remember when I was younger though he was a good dad when he was sober. 5, 6, 14 I remember being on the boat. 7 Those were the happiest times when he was sober. 6, 9, 18 I always think about those times. 16, 17, 18 AS: There was a nice picture, I think he was on a boat. 7 Did you pick that out?  For his obituary.  AS: Do you remember the story about him delivering the baby? 5, 9 CK: I do when they talked about it at the—because the fire department came to the funeral. 10, 11, 15, 19 AS: Because he got some kind of award? 16, 17 CK: Yeah, but he was also in the Star Tribune.  He rescued a young girl from a fire. 14, 15 I always thought it would be really cool to see her. 11, 12, 16, 17 [laughs]  You have to be an EMT for a little bit before you're a fire fighter. 15 She went into labor and he delivered the baby in the ambulance. 5, 12 AS: So he had EMT training?  CK: Yeah, and he couldn't read.  It was just weird to me. 9, 12 AS: You think of all those things as being literacy dependent, and yet, if you can retain stuff— CK: 9, 12, 16 He had been doing that for a long time.  He could fix anything. 16 He was a roofer for a while.  That was his side thing.  He would roof for Donner Construction. 9 He could make anything, fix anything. 16 AS: He was let go of the fire department because of his drug use? 9, 14, 15, 19 Had they worked with him in the past to get him to treatmen? 9, 16 I don't know exactly what they did. 10, 13, 14, 15 I don't know how many times they actually put him into treatment because it was never discussed with me. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 He would never tell me— AS: Would he go away? 15, 16 No, it was always outpatient. 9, 16, 17 He was at inpatient at Unity for—this was towards the end after he had lost his job. 9, 12 He worked with the fire department for so long that they retired him early so that it didn't look like anything so he got half of his pension. 12, 15, 19, 20 They did try to help him. 13, 16 AS: And there was a point where—did he show up to work high? 8 CK: You know, I don't know if he did that. 13, 14, 15 I think he would just get randomly tested. 7, 9, 12 When you are a fire fighter you work one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off, then you got ten days off. 15, 19 Then you would work one day on, one day off. 19 So, I mean you had a lot of time off. 16, 17 They would work twenty-four hour shifts, so he would work one twenty-four hour shift and then have twenty-four hours off. 8, 11 I remember when they came to the funeral one guy spoke and he said that my dad was always the first one in and the last one out. 9, 16, 17, 19 AS: He was brave.  Kind of fearless.  CK: Or it was the adrenaline rush, or I don't know. 6, 13, 14, 15 When they said that I was like, ""Was that what he..."" 10 And he told me about the first time he tried heroin. 9, 10, 20 He said it was a high that he never had had before. 8, 15 He said he never got high like that after, no matter how high he would get it was never like that first time. 8, 9, 15, 20 AS: That memory of the first time. 9 Wow.  Yeah I've heard that. 15 AS: Yeah, people describe it as this incredible hug, just this incredible warmth. 9, 12 A feeling of complete peace and calm. 16, 19 No worries, no nothing.  CK: I've always been too scared. 5, 7, 11, 12, 16, 17 AS: Yeah, so talk about that. 10 Your own relationship with it, with substances. 9 CK: I just think I was too scared because I had seen him so many years hurt himself. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 20 What he would go through—I just was scared to try anything, anything. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16 Even this I wouldn't take pain pills for. 6 And they did try to give them to me. 6, 16 I was like, ""No thank you."" 10, 13 It's just that—because my sister struggles with—she's had some addiction problems with pain pills. 5, 9, 12 I've seen it.  I've seen plenty of friends that I've grown up, went to school with, have issues with it. 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 It's just insane to me how many people have issues with it. 9, 12, 14, 15 There are a lot of people. 17 That's considered fun for them to take pills. 6, 12 AS: What about shooting heroin?  Do you know people who do that or would admit to it? 13, 14, 15 CK: I don't know people that would admit to it, no. 13, 14, 15 I know that they've done it, not— AS: How old are you? 13, 14, 15, 20 CK: I'm forty.  AS: Is your sister older? 5, 9, 20 CK: My sister is forty-two. 5, 9 AS: That's mostly pills that you hear about? 9 CK: The heroin is more—they call it recreational. 7 They don't do it all the time apparently. 10, 16, 18 To me there's no such thing.  My dad used to say that when he first—he said he did it recreationally or did it to party. 6, 9 And then he couldn't control it. 17 So do you drink socially? 6, 14 I'll drink wine, but I feel like— AS: Was your mom an alcoholic? 5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 16 She hasn't drank in—probably since Ashley was young because she's a juvenile diabetic, too, and it made her very sick and she had to take her health—she had to change. 6, 7, 14, 16 AS: And she was able to do that.  CK: She just stopped, but she would drink a lot I remember. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20 It was like her and my aunts would get together and they would party. 6 That's just what they did, I don't know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 But it was a lot of drinking. 6, 14, 17 That's where I don't know if her judgment was very good when she was dating the guy she was dating. 13, 14, 15 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: How about your girls? 8 What are they like? 10 When you look back on yourself as a mom? 15, 19 CK: This is what my oldest tells me now—that I was way too strict on her, and I was. 5, 9, 14, 16, 20 I was really scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 I'm a little more lenient with my second one, but with my first it's always like, ""Well why does she get to do that? 9, 10, 16, 17, 20 I couldn't do that when I was young."" 14 It's always like that. 16, 17 But then I realized that I had to let her, my youngest, because I feel like my oldest was like, I feel like I sheltered her too much. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 She's very smart. 20 She got a full, four year scholarship to the University of Madison, which was only one of ten girls. 8, 11, 13, 20 She didn't end up going. 12 She went every summer, but she ended up going to school here because she had a baby at eighteen, which I thought I was dying when I heard because it was like, I tried to—I told them all how rough it was, I thought I was open. 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 AS: Did they know about sex? 13, 14, 15 CK: Oh yeah. 10 I mean it was probably too much. 16, 18 They were probably like, ""Just stop talking."" 9, 10 My youngest is strong willed, I'll say. 9, 14 She'll be nineteen in June.  AS: Did she finish college? 8 CK: Yeah, she works at the University of Minnesota. 13, 14 I'm not quite sure what she does there, but she just enrolled back into school. 8, 9, 12, 15, 19 AS: And you have a granddaughter or a grandson? 5, 7 I have a granddaughter and a grandson. 5, 7 My grandson is seven months old. 7, 8, 20 My youngest graduated. 8, 9, 14 I was a little nervous about that one. 16 From high school. 8 It was a tough road to get there. 9, 18 Not that she was just—mouthy. 9, 12 She just was very defiant. 8, 9, 12 When I separated from her dad was when she really got—but she's starting to turn around. 8, 9, 11, 19 She just got a job at Wells Fargo. 9, 12 She's going to enroll in MCTC [Minneapolis Community and Technical College].  I don't care what she does, just something. 7, 9, 12 AS: Had they had substance abuse issues? 9, 14, 15 CK: Nope.  I was open with them when they got older why they didn't have a relationship with my dad. 5, 17, 20 I did let them know why. 13, 14, 15, 19 They don't know specifics as far as the stuff 9, 13, 14, 15 I've been through—they know some of it, but I just didn't want them to have to know their grandpa that way. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: So it was just better to not know him. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 CK: I think so just because at the end it was so bad. 9, 12 AS: They were pretty young because he died eight years ago? 14, 18, 20 CK: Has it been that long?  Wow.  It doesn't even seem that long. 15, 19 It was May.  I think you're right, and I can't believe it's been that many years. 14, 20 I just put it so far in the back of my mind. 9, 10, 12, 19 It's probably not healthy to do that, but it just helps me because I don't want to sit and think about how he lived. 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 AS: The thing is too when we're ready, when we're strong enough, or motivated enough, something sparks it, then we do. 9, 20 CK: I just think it was so hard because I looked up to him. 9, 11, 12 He was a fire fighter, he was my dad, he protected me. 15 I was a daddy's girl.  I just didn't understand why wasn't I more important than that. 9, 12, 16 Why can't you see you're hurting me? 12 And that was really hard. 11 AS: And that's nearly impossible.  Do you know that now? 13, 14, 15 AS: You know it intellectually, but you still feel that sadness. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Because you know he would steal from me. 9, 13, 14, 15 He would steal from everybody. 9 It got that bad.  AS: In these last four years? 9, 20 AS: So as soon as he was retired there was nothing else for him? 12, 19 He tried a little bit. 10 I can't remember how many times he went into treatment, but he would be good for a little bit, and then he would fall back. 9, 16, 18, 19 Then he would try to sober up a little bit. 6, 16 It didn't ever last very long. 9 AS: There's no long period that you remember of months and months? 8 CK: No. And I always wondered—he would get arrested and get out. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 I don't think he was ever caught with it, it was just paraphernalia. 9, 12 It would never be on him, like drugs. 14, 15 But I guess it's because he would do them. 10 AS: He would get off?  AS: Because do you think they knew him as a firefighter? 6, 12, 15 CK: I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I just think there was never any—he had paraphernalia on him and that was it. 9, 12, 15 He would get off on it.  He would do it again a few months later. 8 Don't they like arrest people for being high and driving? 8, 9, 14, 19 I guess I never thought about the fire fighter thing. 10, 11, 12, 15 AS: Oh yeah. 10 I know people who have been arrested just sitting in their car not even driving. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 CK: That's crazy. 16 AS: And kids who have gotten off when they have crashed on the side of the road. 9, 15 It seems pretty random who gets busted and who doesn't. 7, 9, 16, 18, 19 CK: I guess I never thought about that. 10, 11, 12, 15 I would just be like I don't know if it's because he was a user and that's why he would get out and say he would go to treatment. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: Have you ever requested any of his records? 6, 7, 9 CK: I could get them, I haven't ever.  I remember after he died the bill collectors—I'll never forget T-Mobile. 15 [laughter]  AS: So he did have a cell phone! 7 CK: Yes!  He did have a flip phone at the end. 7, 12 He did, but it was like they would call non-stop and I'd be like, ""He's dead."" 7, 9, 10 And this would be a year later. 20 And they were like, ""There's no way to take him off this collection."" 6, 10, 16 And I was like, ""You're not getting your money. 10 He is deceased.  Do you need me to send you something?"" 12, 13 They were like, ""It's not going to stop."" 9, 10 I just thought, ""How insensitive."" 9, 11, 12, 13 For a year I got those calls. 7, 20 Then I remember my grandma thought—my grandma was really selfish. 7, 11, 12 His mom. 15 His mom who didn't raise him. 15 I haven't—I've seen her maybe three times since the funeral because it was so—she made me pay her back for the flowers she put on his grave. 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 AS: Because you were the beneficiary— CK: Of nothing!  [laughter]  I mean I don't know why people thought I was going to get this big payout because I knew he didn't have any money left. 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I was his beneficiary.  He had, I remember the fire department called me and he had I think it was fifteen hundred dollars, and I said, ""Can you send it to the funeral home to help pay for that."" 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 That was the great inheritance she thought I got. 11, 12 I really think she did.  When we got the cards and everything she made me open them in front of her and the people that gave me money—I had to give her half. 6, 7, 16, 17, 20 I specifically remember a check for six hundred dollars and she was like, ""Now you know you wouldn't get this unless it was for me because these are people I know."" 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 And I was like, ""So what are you saying?"" 10, 11 And my girls were sitting there. 8, 13 I just thought, ""You know, you'll have to answer to someone else bigger than me someday for what you're doing,"" in my mind and I gave it to her. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I think I had to give my grandma over a thousand dollars for food and stuff she had contributed to the funeral. 6, 7, 9 And that was really hard. 11 I just don't know how to forgive it. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I know people are like, ""You have to forgive."" 6, 10, 13, 14, 15 And I don't know if I have that in me. 13, 14, 15 AS: Is she impoverished?  She lives in Shorewood.  AS: She didn't raise him?  She's the one that lost custody? 9 My grandma Margaret raised him. 5, 7 I didn't even have enough money to pay for his urn. 15, 16, 20 They let me make payments until I was able to pay it off, and I never—I just really have never had a relationship with her like that. 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 After the first cousin thing and I got older we had a relationship, but it was more like Christmas and holidays. 5, 9, 19, 20 After that I cut it because I feel like my other cousin she would have never done that to ever. 5, 15, 16 When it's your grandma—I think about that with my grandkids. 7 How can you feel okay with that? 16 How can you feel like you are going to benefit from this somehow? 14, 16 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 It was really hard. 11 I know the family is like, ""Well, that's your grandma."" 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 My aunt, my dad's sister is like, ""I don't think she's malicious in what she does."" 5, 9, 10 I really think she is.  I really think she knows what she's doing. 13, 14, 15 AS: It's hard to imagine a grandma being malicious, right, we don't want to think about the consequences of that. 7, 11, 13, 14 CK: I really just feel like it was really heartless. 9, 12, 16 I feel like, ""You don't really care what I was going through."" 7, 10, 16 I'm sorry, just random things are coming to me. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16 I remember my uncle had given my dad an air compressor and my dad had pawned it and it was in the pawnshop. 6 My grandma——this is not even two days after my dad, after the funeral she's like, ""Well, he pawned his compressor,"" and I'm like, ""Grandma, I can't go get it, it's in his name."" 6, 7, 10, 15, 19 I had to call a police officer; I had to do all these things to get this air compressor because I was trying to do the right thing. 7, 14, 16 My dad pawned it, who shouldn't have pawned it, I understand that. 9, 12, 16 So, I went to get this air compressor and it was just a source of contention for me. 9, 12, 15 It sat in my garage for over a year, and I was like, ""You hounded me about this."" 10, 20 They never picked it up, so I donated it when I moved. 8, 15 I was like, ""It was that important to you,"" and I felt bad. 10, 17 I felt like, you know, this was my dad who did this stuff. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 I'm trying to just do something right; try to make it right somehow. 9, 12, 14, 16 I just was like, ""You can't even let me mourn my dad without—I know how my dad was. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I know what he did wrong."" 13, 14, 15 I just was trying to do the right thing, and then for it to sit in my garage for a year? 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 I would get so mad every time I would see it.  AS: Where do you think you got your moral compass?  Your sense of wanting to do right? 13, 14, 17 You said there were things you loved about your dad. 13, 16 CK: I remember there were times where—I don't know where I got it because when I was young I would watch my dad beat up his girlfriend really bad, and I remember thinking, ""I'm never going to let someone do that to me."" 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 I remember that.  I don't know where I got it. 13, 14, 15 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I don't know if it was just—I just remember I never liked the way I felt as a young child. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 The situations I was in I always just felt scared or uncomfortable, you know. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: Do you feel better today? 16, 19 CK: I do because I know it's me who I'm responsible for and my kids and I don't have to rely on someone else to take care of me. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 That's a good question. 6, 9 I guess I don't know. 10, 13, 14, 15 I think working around good people—I really learned a lot from the people I work with. 8, 12, 17 There are three women who I work with who have all been there the same amount of time. 18 AS: Did you have good support from friends when your dad passed away? 12, 16, 18 Do you have a support system? 8, 9 I don't really, so I've always just—I think that's one thing I could do better with my kids because when they're having a hard time I'm like, ""You've got to just pick up. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 You don't have time to feel sad about this."" 12, 16 And I do find myself doing that because I was like that.  I remember when my dad died my ex-husband was like, ""You've got to just pick up and keep going,"" and I remember that was probably the beginning of the end with him. 9, 10, 12, 15 He just would not let me mourn. 9, 12, 19 I didn't have time—not that I would have ever fallen apart, but just can people around me just give me a moment to do nothing and just sit? 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 20 And it was never like that, so now I see that I do that with my kids and I try to correct myself, but I do see that in myself, like, ""No one is going to do this for you."" 10, 14, 15, 16 Kind of a little insensitive I think, I mean, honestly that's how I feel. 9, 13, 16 I know and I see it in me, and I try. 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: It might read as insensitive, but it seems like you had to do it for survival to keep yourself going because a lot of bad things could have happened to you. 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 You could be not the person that you are right now sitting in front of me. 13, 14 Do you know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 It takes—you can go one way or the other, and I remember thinking that as a small kid: 6, 16 I'm not going to live like this when I'm older. 5, 20 This is not how I'm going to live.  I'm not perfect.  AS: That came from inside you. 19 Like I said I'm not perfect, I just knew I wanted a stable place to live, I wanted a family, I wanted to just try to be normal whatever that means. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18 AS: Do you ever talk to your mom about your dad? 10, 15 You said you guys are close.  We have talked, yeah. 10, 11 He was abusive to her, too, physically. 7, 9, 11 They were never together though, they were separated when I was a baby, so I've never seen them in the same room except for a courtroom. 5, 7, 11, 15 I remember when we were going to court for custody with my mom and my dad. 9, 15 My dad—I remember we lived in these apartments, I don't know how old I was, I can't remember, I was really young. 13, 14, 15, 20 I don't remember the circumstances, but I remember my dad grabbing me and running, running down the street with me and I remember the cops throwing him on the ground. 7, 8, 9, 11 I remember I thought they were going to hurt him and I was so scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 Not that he was—I think he was just taking me from my mom. 9, 12, 15 I don't know why, I don't know any of the circumstances behind it, but I remember watching the police do that to him. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 We lived in an apartment on Lake [Street] right by K-Mart. 14, 20 [laughter]  AS: That's still an intense place. 9, 11, 15 I remember it was in the summer and there were all kinds of people out watching. 16, 17 This was on the street. 9 He took me from the apartment building. 20 The courtroom I just remember they would ask me, ""Who do you want to live with? 7, 9, 12, 13 Who do you want?"" 13 And I would say whatever anybody wanted to hear. 12, 13 It wasn't what I wanted because I didn't want to hurt anybody. 12, 13 I think about that now, like I was way too young for that. 14, 16 Way too young. 14 AS: I hope they have learned something. 10, 12, 17 I'm just sorry for all the people who had to experience that in the seventies and the eighties. 9, 10, 12, 15 I think the eighties was probably the peak of that.  CK: I think they have.  And they would ask me in front of both of them.  Like, how?  [laughter]  AS: So what is your take on addiction and people who struggle with it? 6, 9 What do you notice and what do you wish was different? 16, 17 Do you read about it or think about it very often? 12, 15 I think people associate it with people who have had rough lives, but I don't think that is at all what it is. 18 I think it's the people we hang around, the people we—as young kids—who we associate with, where if you're daring—I just feel like you can't pinpoint it to one reason why people—sometimes there's no reason and it's just curiosity. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 Some people aren't strong enough to overcome that curiosity. 9, 13, 19, 20 Some people are.  Some people can do it one time, and that's it and be done with it and some people can't.  I think it doesn't have any bearing on how you were raised. 5 AS: What do you wish would change about the way we deal with addiction from your perspective? 13, 16 CK: I wish the medical field would care a little bit more. 7, 14 I really wish they would not treat them as not people or that they don't deserve health care or that they don't deserve to be treated kindly. 7, 14, 16, 17 I see it all—I even see it now. 14, 15 I see the way the nurses talk about it at my job, and I don't say anything. 10, 16 AS: What do they say?  CK: They're like, ""Oh, yeah, they're just here to get their fix and then they're back on the street again. 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 But guess what? 10 They're fixed up when they leave the door so they'll be in next week for their next..."" you know? 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 It's stuff like that. 9 I know they're probably frustrated because I work at Abbott [Northwestern Hospital], which is in the middle of—you know? 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I see it all day long. 19 I guess I'm not a healthcare provider, so I don't know how frustrating it is to have to deal with people like that, but I know what it's like to have to live with someone like that and know that they deserve to be treated the same way anyone else would, regardless of—not that they should be prescribed pills and leave, but, treat them—I just remember how my dad was treated when I went into regions. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 It was like—they just treated him like he wasn't a person. 9, 12, 16 I remember like, ""Can you please do something? 10 Can you please scan his head?""  Because my dad never complained about headaches or anything, and I was like, ""Can you just do something? 9, 10, 12, 15 And they were like, ""There's nothing we can do. 10 We gave him two—"" I don't remember what it was, and sent him on his way. 7, 16 I was like, ""You're not going to do anything?"" 10 AS: And later he was back in there in the MRI? 19 CK: It was about a week and a half later. 20 He was transported by ambulance to Unity Hospital and that's when he had the stroke. 7, 9 I never asked how—who called. 7, 10, 15 I know it was his girlfriend, but I didn't know her very well. 12, 13, 14, 15 She was a user, too. 9 Something must have happened, I don't know, and that's when I got a call saying, ""Your dad's in the hospital. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 We think he may have had a stroke. 9 Can you come down?"" 13, 19 Then when I got there I remember the nurse saying, ""Do you know her?"" 11, 13, 14, 15 And his mouth was open and that was the last time he was conscious. 9, 17 I remember when the doctor pulled me into the room and said, ""You have to make a decision."" 7, 16 And I struggled with it because I struggle with religion. 9 I don't know what I believe. 13, 14, 15 I believe in something I just don't know what. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I don't know what type of religion he was because he was trying to comfort people—the hospital chaplain. 13, 14, 15, 16 I'm just looking at everybody and I was just like, ""This does not comfort me."" 9, 10, 12 I asked if I could speak to him alone and I just said, ""I hear you saying he's going to go to a better place and you're praying, but what if you don't believe that? 9, 10, 11, 12 What if you don't know?"" 13, 14, 15 And I can't even remember how he explained it to me. 15 He explained it somehow with being born and— AS: Because he was trying to convince you that your dad should be taken off? 6, 16 CK: No, he was trying to convince me that he was going to be okay. 16 That he was going to be in a better place. 11 I think that's how he was comforting everybody.  I was just sitting there and I was like, ""This isn't working for me."" 9, 10, 12, 13 [laughs]  AS: You started to say that you never say anything to the nurses—what would happen if you did? 9, 11, 12, 15 What would you say?  CK: Sometimes I just want to be like, ""You have no idea what it's like to be that person or a loved one of that person, you know?"" 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: Would you get in trouble for saying something like that? 11 CK: I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: One of the things that I keep coming up against is that the only way—and this isn't to put any guilt onto you—but the only way that we can break that stigma is by calling people out on it. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18 It's the same with sexism and the same with racism.  It's just the next thing we have to do or keep doing on a new topic. 6, 9, 12 AS: I had that experience of my daughter being referred to as an ‘OD’, and it just pierced me in a way. 5, 9, 12, 16 And my sister who is a doctor—my daughter is completely unconscious, completely hooked up to everything you could imagine—my sister who had come, who is a family physician, came up from Texas and she saw me and she just went into the hall and was like—because this guy was a resident or something—""It would be really good if you didn't say that in front of family."" 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 And they do, it is part of the work, they can't think of everyone with all these feelings and all this. 16 They are in a field where they're supposed to be helping people who are suffering, right? 6, 13, 14 The nurses at Unity were very, very nice to me.  They have a different approach at Unity. 16, 17 CK: Yeah, I felt like they did. 17 I felt like they had compassion for what he was going through, for what everyone was going through at the time. 17 I didn't feel like they treated him just like he didn't matter. 9, 12, 16, 20 There is one other thing.  I remember when he was dying they gave him morphine and my grandma had a really hard time with me okaying him to have morphine. 7, 11 She said, ""He doesn't need that."" 13 I said, ""Grandma, he's probably in there withdrawing on top of going through all of this and he is trying to fight this."" 7, 14, 16 This is my thought. 11, 12 And she didn't want him to have morphine and it was like, ""I don't care what you think at this point."" 7, 10, 13 AS: Could it matter at that point? 20 CK: Right, it didn't.  But these were the challenges I had in the hospital. 10 I remember them telling me, ""He's not going to make it,"" and my grandma, for almost two days, the family thought that he was going to come out of it because he would twitch, but they told me when you twitch, when they do pain tests on him you don't go in, you try to get away from the pain and he would twitch in—his hands would twitch in. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 I remember I told her I didn't want all kinds of people at the hospital. 13, 16, 17, 20 I just wanted to deal with this as him, me, you, and my aunt, and the whole family was up there. 9, 12, 13, 18 I was so angry.  I didn't leave the room—they were in the waiting room—I didn't leave his side. 6, 7 For three days I sat there. 19 I had to wear gloves because he had MRSA. 13 I just didn't like it because I was like, ""My dad is not going to want people to see him like this."" 9, 10, 12, 13 His fever was like one hundred and six, and it was just bad. 9, 12 Antibiotics did nothing.  After he had the stroke he was done. 9 I don't know why it took three days for them to finally say—because I remember the nurses telling me very early, ""It's in his main bloodstream. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 He's not coming out of this.""  They didn't say it like that, but they were very nice about it.  I just said, ""I want to know, honestly, I want to know the truth,"" because I needed to prepare. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I needed to know what I was doing. 13, 14, 15 I knew his wishes—we had talked about what he wanted. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 He didn't want to be kept on life support. 11, 13 I mean probably all kinds of other stuff will come to mind, but it's just that I've never really sat and talked about it. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: I'm just so honored that you sat and talked to a total stranger about it. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 CK: It feels good to talk about it. 10, 16 AS: Good.  Well, you're really a remarkable person to have gone through what you did and to hold on the way you have and to get through that. 16, 20 You must have come into this world pretty darn strong. 9, 13, 15, 18, 19 You're not a newbie! 6 You've got some power in you. 15 That's a powerful story. 9, 15 I'm really sorry that you lost your dad. 9, 10 I'm sorry about all of it. 10 CK: Thank you.  I think he's—there's a museum, I don't know if it's still there, I should look—it's of fire fighters. 9, 13, 14, 15 I'll have to look it up and see if I can find it.  AS: Look it up and share that with me.  I would appreciate knowing more. 13, 14, 15 CK: And the fire department gave me all of the awards he won for things he had done. 15, 16 And the picture of the girl in the Star Tribune.  It has her name on it, but I just—I should share that with you. 6, 9, 12 AS: Yeah, I would love to see that. 13 CK: I think it was in Minneapolis.  It looked like she was Native American, I can't—I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: Thank you,  Chandra. 14 CK: You're welcome. 13, 19"
"12","Espuche_Nancy","Rose McKinney Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 16, 2016 St. Paul, Minnesota Rose McKinney-RM  Amy Sullivan-AS RM: Yes, my name is Rose McKinney and I give Amy permission for this interview. 6 AS: Thank you.  Rose, could you start by talking a little bit about what your childhood was like, where you grew up, your education, and your career. 7, 9, 10, 11 What you do today. 19 RM: I am the youngest of three daughters. 5, 9, 14 There is a fair amount of gap in between, which makes things interesting. 9, 16, 18, 19 I have one sister that is seven years older and a sister that is twelve years older. 5, 9, 20 So my parents had me a little bit later in their life. 10, 11, 16 Before 1966 it was kind of a rare thing. 16, 17 My mom was almost forty-one when I was born. 9, 15 Had a great childhood. 11 Growing up my parents owned a business. 9, 10, 16 Prior to that they had moved around a fair amount with my dad’s jobs. 8, 18 Before that he had been in the army. 19 My sisters had transplanted childhoods. 5, 7, 9, 11 My childhood was pretty much all in one place. 11, 18 I grew up in Des Moines, Iowa.  Close with my sisters. 5, 9 Close with my parents. 10, 16 A couple of interesting things about my background. 8, 9, 16, 19 I went to boarding school at age fourteen. 5, 8 I went back out East. 9, 19 I spent my high school years away from home. 8, 16, 19, 20 In some regards, that may have been the sanest thing that could have happened. 9, 12, 13 I was a good kid, but I didn’t take things for granted. 6, 7, 16 I would push my dad’s buttons and we would get into round and round discussions. 8 I think that it was probably a good thing that allowed me to begin to see those ideas and opinions and independence which probably brought us closer when we did get together at holidays and summer were really enjoyable times. 9, 11, 12, 18, 19 They liked to hear about what I was thinking versus the day to day stuff. 9, 10, 18, 19 I went to college. 8 I originally thought that I would like to be a broadcast journalist. 9, 10, 11, 12 I thought I wanted to be the next Jane Polly on the Today Show. 11, 12, 13, 19 Interview interesting people. 9, 19 Hear their stories. 9, 18 I quickly learned that the route to become that was not something I was interested in. 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 I didn’t want to—by who, what, when, and where. 13 The kind of life of a reporter. 11, 16, 17 I found that I was really interested in telling deeper stories. 9, 11, 18, 19 I wanted to know why organizations weren’t talking about all these other things. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 They said, “Oh you need to be in public relations.” 13 I had no idea what that was. 11 I took a PR class and the very first day of class we talked about the definition and building mutually beneficial relationships and helping organizations create understanding. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 That’s pretty much what I focused on in college and started my career in public relations. 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18 Met my husband while I was still in college and we got engaged and got married right after I graduated. 8, 9, 14, 15 That takes me into my motherhood piece. 6 I had been working for about nine months and I got pregnant. 8 In 1988, ‘89, there was not job sharing.  There was not flexible hours. 11 We didn’t have email!  AS: You couldn’t really work from home. 19 RM: There really weren’t any of these things. 16 I remember going to my boss and saying, “You know, I’m not sure that I can come back full time after this baby comes.” 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 They said, “Well, put together some sort of proposal.” 10, 17 “What do you think?”  And my daughter ended up being born three weeks early and I never got my proposal put together. 5, 10, 12, 15 They started calling me and saying, “Hey do you think you could at least finish the newsletter project? 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 19 Do you think you could work on the publicity for this client?” 20 I was able to freelance and be a mom. 15 It was pretty incredible. 12, 18 I was freelancing a little bit part time.  Mothering, young mother at age 23. 14 Three years later baby two came along in 1992. 19, 20 At that point I was still doing some freelance work and a lot more volunteering like in a Montessori school and these kinds of things. 8, 9, 16, 17 I had an opportunity through a freelance project to go back to work full time in 1996. 11, 19 I loved that opportunity. 13 Working full time. 11 We were lucky to have some nannies that worked out really well for our family. 18 And then we got pregnant with baby number three. 5 And we said, “Oh my gosh. 17 I loved my job. 13 Let’s just see what happens with trying it this way.” 9, 12, 16 So I had been the stay at home mom with the freelancing and I had been the full time mom and it worked out really well with baby number three to continue working full time and not freelance. 5, 9, 11, 15, 19 That’s kind of the motherhood journey. 16, 17 AS: As your kids got older, can you talk about your son, was he the middle child? 5, 8, 10, 20 Can you talk about what he was like? 10 What your other kids were like? 10 How you navigated the difficulties? 20 RM: Great relationship.  In fact, because of the three year difference between Julia and Ryan, Ryan and I were really close. 10, 20 She was in Montessori school. 8 In the mornings, drop her off for a couple of hours and then Ryan and I had a lot of one on one time together. 11, 14, 17 Which was really special.  I think to this day we have a close relationship. 19 We enjoy spending time together one on one. 12, 19 I credit it back to those early years. 12, 19, 20 We would have those mornings together.  Then, pick Julie up from preschool, go home, have lunch, naps. 6, 8, 19 I would work on projects.  Life was pretty good. 18 Ryan always had a good sense of humor. 16, 17 He was always a very mature kid. 16, 17 He would hang out with his older sister and her friends. 5, 9, 12, 18, 20 He was kind of the tag along in the neighborhood. 8, 16, 17 He was the youngest in the group of six or seven kids that all hung out together. 9, 14 The interesting thing with Ryan is he was always so good natured and happy and everything. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 Every once in awhile if he would get out of sorts or fussy or irritable, backtalking, what not. 10, 17, 19 I would get frustrated and send him to his room or something like that. 7, 9, 12 The interesting thing is that generally within a matter of minutes he would be asleep. 7, 9, 19, 20 Or he would be getting sick.  I came to recognize when he was out of sorts he was either exhausted and needed a nap, or was, you know, an ear infection was coming on or a cold. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 The getting sick would maybe show up the next day or something. 9, 19 It was intersesting because at the time you don’t realize it. 9, 14 This kid is being crazy, or separation. 16 Then you would go, “Oh, now I get it.” 14 Like anything you would recognize, “Oh, I need to pay more attention. 13, 15, 16 Just because he isn’t taking naps anymore regularily I need to see if he is tired.” 9, 12, 13 And say, “Don’t react to the behavior.” 10 So fast forward, I wish that had been in my mind. 9 Hindsight.  I can say, “Oh, we missed some things. 16 AS: Can you give any examples? 6 RM: I think when he would, he got into high school we started to notice he was struggling around junior year. 8, 9, 11, 20 Didn’t want to participate in a lot of family things. 13, 16, 17, 18 Back talking, argumentative, keeping to himself, breaking the rules. 10, 11, 12, 18 Not anything bad.  Just little stuff. 9 Didn’t seem interested in anything. 9, 11, 19 He has always been such a smart kid that school was always kind of boring. 8, 16, 17, 20 We got concerned about that and went to the doctor to rule out if it was depression or who knows what was going on. 12, 13, 14, 15 Even at that point my husband and I said, “Do you think he could be using drugs?” 14, 15 We didn’t have any real, hard reason to believe it. 11 But we weren’t naive enough to think that his behavior and his mood couldn’t be related to that. 20 That is one example of the differences in how he is behaving. 6 He is not the same person right now. 14 What else could be going on in his life? 11 He will tell us now that he didn’t feel like he fit in. 14, 16 And yet, he had tons of friends. 12, 18 He would say he didn’t feel comfortable in all these social situations and yet he was always mister center of attention. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17 I think there are a lot of times where your perception of yourself is not necessarily what other people are seeing and experiencing. 17, 18 My thought now is when there is this big gap between what one person perceives and what the self perceives, you need to stop and figure out why and what. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 So, we noticed it.  We tried to stop it. 9, 10 Couldn’t get at anything.  At that point he couldn’t articulate what was going on.  You couldn’t even have the deep conversation to get at it! 12, 15 AS: Did you bring him to a doctor around that time?  Or did you just go yourselves? 9, 12 RM: We took him to a doctor.  That was actually very disappointing. 10 My husband took him. 15 They had been very close throughout childhood. 11 You know, Boundary Water trips, coaching sports, watching movies. 13, 14, 15 Just really lots of good, active father son time. 5, 9, 10, 17 It was my husband that actually identified it. 10, 15 Said,  “I think something is off.”  I was a little more like, “Yeah, you know, teenager.” 10, 13, 14, 15 They went and that ended up being somewhat dissapointing because the doctor ruled out anything physical. 12 “Maybe some family counciling would help. 11, 13, 18 It’s tough being a kid these days.” 19 My husband asked the doctor, “Did you do a drug test?” and the doctor said, “I don’t think that’s what’s going on. 9, 10, 14, 15 I just think its really tough being a kid these days. 9, 12, 19 He’s a good kid.  Just some counseling.” 9 I don’t know if anything would have shown up at that point or not, but I am apalled that as long as they were doing blood and urine tests anyway that they wouldn’t at least check. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And again, it might have come and said no, there is nothing in the system. 8, 9, 13, 19 AS: But if you don’t check, you don’t know. 13, 14, 15 RM: Exactly. 10 That was one of the first frustrating things. 9, 16 From there we did go to see a counselor. 10 Both independently and together. 12 The counselor would talk to us and say, “Yeah, it sure sounds like maybe that’s what’s going on.” 9, 10, 15, 16 And then he would talk to our son and he couldn’t get anything concrete. 10 So, there are these two different things going on. 16, 17 I believe the counselor knew there was drug use, but because my son wouldn’t come right out and say it, or he always had some kind of excuse, he could snow ball or tip toe around. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 We had group sessions and it just didn’t work. 9, 12 When we started finding marijuana and that kind of stuff then it would just get into the arguments over, “Well it’s good for you, or everybody does it, or get off my back, or it should be legal.” 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 Again, it just went round and round and round. 8, 9, 12 We did find evidence senior year of high school that it was more than pot. 8, 20 We kept saying, “This just doesn’t seem like it could only be pot.” 9, 11, 12, 19 You know? 13, 14, 15 Yet we didn’t— AS: What was the evidence?  RM: We found strips of aluminum foil with burn marks in the car. 7, 9 Took it to the police who said, “Yeah, it’s likely heroin. 7, 10 Could be meth or something. 5 Likely heroin.”  AS: This is his senior year? 20 RM: This is his senior year at this point. 20 And yeah, ask him about it. 10 “I’ve never seen it. 15 I don’t know what that is.” 13, 14, 15 And we said, “You know what, you are responsible for other people in your car.” 7, 13, 14, 15 He would just come up with all kinds of wild things. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 “Well, maybe someone was in my car when I was at class.” 7, 9, 20 [laughs]  I mean this is the type of thing. 16 We would get into these logical things that were, you know, if someone was watching us they would be like why? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 There was just all these circular arguments. 9, 12 You would just get lost in it. 9, 12 So, whether it was him or someone he was with, clearly someone was using heroin.  Fast forward a couple years after that when he was in inpatient treatment. 9, 16, 20 He comes forward in our first family meeting and says, “I want to tell you I’ve been using opiates and heroin.” 9, 13, 18, 19 And we just looked at him and said, “Yeah. 9, 12 We know this.” 13, 14, 15 And he thought it was some big confession and he still made it sounds like it had only been a few months. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 AS: How long was it?  RM: At least a couple of years. 9, 20 If he had been using full time, or regularly, it was there. 11 I thought back to all the times that I had found a roll of tin foil in his backpack or a roll of tin foil in the car. 7, 11, 12, 18, 19 All those things and you are like, “It’s been there.” 10, 16 AS: Right in front of you.  Right in front.  And we knew it. 6, 12 I mean you can do plenty. 16 You can talk about it, you can encourage conversation. 10, 12 We went and got smart, we went and got knowledgeable, we found out about it. 13, 14, 15, 20 But when I say, “What can you do?”  The cliche that always comes to mind is you can always lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink. 6, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 And the adage that you can salt the oats.  I feel like that was kind of— AS: That made his life more difficult towards recovery? 11, 16, 17, 20 And not even necessarily more difficult, but you can make more encouragement. 15, 16, 20 You can say, “Hey, we can help. 13 College is possible when you go to treatment. 9, 16 We might be able to help you out with the car. 7, 13 We can do things.” 16 Because the drugs have hijacked his brain, even if those offers sounded good he couldn’t give up. 6, 10, 14, 15 It takes a long time for parents to, or anybody that loves somebody that is using, to come to understand that there is really nothing you can say or do that is going to be compelling enough for them to go, “This thing that I survive on, that I enjoy, or that maybe I don’t enjoy it anymore but I survive on it, I can’t give that up.” 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 They can’t see that road forward. 9 AS: What was your relationship with him like at this time?  RM: We maintained regular contact. 10 Call, text, have him come over for dinner. 13, 19 We probably did see him at least once a week. 9 Sometimes maybe it was— AS: While he was using? 5, 9, 18 RM: Yeah, while he was using.  Most of the time it was pleasant enough. 20 As long as we avoided talking about use. 9, 10 Or talking about going to treatment or something. 9, 10, 16 We would have this back and forth between should we continue to try and talk it through and get him to see what is going on and get some help? 10, 13, 16, 19 Which would usually escalate and not go anywhere. 10 Or, should we just let him know that the family is here and the home is here and that we love him, and that he is welcome, and let him know too that guess what? 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 While he is choosing these other things right now, our life is going on. 11, 14, 16 Guess what, we are going on vacation? 10 Guess what, we are going to a movie.  Our life is still going on and you could be part of that. 9, 11 AS: Did you just kind of naturally have that response? 9, 12, 16, 17 Did you get help from other people that were familiar with addiction or teenagers? 13, 18 Early on, right at the start of 2011, things had really gotten out of control. 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 I will back up a little of the history. 9, 19 He had graduated in June 2010. 8 He had a scholarship to go to college and then decided not to do that, and he was using. 8, 12 We had a horrible summer of running away, and being out at all hours, and sleeping all day. 7, 11, 16, 17, 19 He was living the addiction lifestyle. 6, 9, 11 We were still figuring out what was—I mean we knew he was using pot. 6, 9, 12, 16 We had found the strips of tin foil. 9 We knew things weren’t right. 6, 12, 14, 16 We were in that sorting out period, and seeing a counselor off and on. 10, 17 He decided at the end of the summer that he was not going to go to college. 8, 12 Which on the one hand was disappointing because a) he had this scholarship and b) we were excited for him to be out of the house. 6, 9 [laughs]  He announces that he is going to go to community college and keep working his job. 8, 12 We are like, “Then the ground rules are,” and that ended up being a horrific semester. 8, 9, 12 We could tell that his…  he wasn’t happy. 17 He was always angry. 16, 17 He was always tired. 12, 16, 17 AS: Was he living at home? 6, 19 RM: He was living at home. 6, 19 I would check the mileage on the car. 7 He would say he was going to be one place and not. 11 During this, the counselor we were working with, our son was a tennis player, Ryan did decide that he might go to school that second semester. 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 We jointly decided that it would be good if he stayed in tennis. 5, 9, 12, 15 So, we paid for him to stay in tennis at the health club and continue working with the team. 9, 14, 15 It was a very talented team and in fact was a team that qualified for nationals. 10 Some of these kids played at state and went on and did phenomenal things. 8, 9, 16 He would go to practice, but somehow the miles between home and practice were a lot more than they should be in the car. 7, 10, 17, 19 We know in hindsight he was making his rounds. 8, 13, 14, 15 He would say, “Oh, after practice I’m going to such and such with so and so.” 10 Of course, that wasn’t what he was doing.  We just kept catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie. 9, 10, 12 For a while, it was data finding.  Like being a detective.  Then after a while you keep finding the same things and it still doesn’t make any sense. 9, 12, 16, 17 All you can say is this is addiction.  This is bad.  Anyways, at the last minute, he did decide he would go second semester and the school said they would honor his scholarship. 8, 9, 16, 17, 20 A spot on the men’s tennis team was still open. 9, 15, 17 This is when things really—this is the turning point. 16, 19 We took him up on Sunday and said goodbye and that week didn’t hear from him. 19 I texted him a couple of times. 18 I thought, you know, part of it is he needs that space. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Was college far away? 8, 16 RM: Up in Duluth.  St. Scholastica. 9 Not that far, a couple of hours. 11 I was headed out of town for a business trip and my husband and younger son were going to come with me and spend a weekend. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 That morning I tried to contact him again. 10 Didn’t hear from him.  The whole weekend we were in New York didn’t hear from him. 12, 19 Didn’t hear from him.  We both said you know, if something was wrong I’m sure we would have heard. 13, 14, 15 So, that Sunday when my husband got home, he checked the phone records and there had been no activity on the phone. 6, 7, 10, 15, 19 This is not good.  Not good.  We could see some calls coming in. 7 That night, at the hotel, I got a phone call from Ryan and—let me back up. 7, 19 When we dropped him off for school that Sunday I’m giving him a hug and I’m saying, “Clean slate,” and he said, “I know mom.” 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 He said, “I won’t fuck up again.”  So that Sunday when he called me he said, “Mom, I fucked up again.” 7, 19 And I said, “What happened?” 12, 13 The way it went down is that that Friday night, he and the college kids had been partying. 6, 8, 16, 19 Drinking and what not.  Drinking, marijuana, and some pills and I’m not sure what. 15 He passed out in the snow. 14 This is January in Duluth, subzero temperatures.  He was taken by ambulance to the ER and then put into detox. 6, 10 At that point the school was trying to work with him and the coach was trying to work with him. 8, 16 The coach, when we had been talking before, and I had said, “You really need to keep him on a short leash. 10, 12, 13, 16 School and tennis.” 15 We talked a little bit. 10, 11 I didn’t ever tell the coach what had been going on those six months, but I just said it has been a really rough six months and senior year was rough. 8, 9, 12, 18, 20 I said, “You don’t know how much he needs to be on this team and in classes. 8, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 If he’s got structure maybe he’ll find a path forward.” 9, 14 The coach said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” 10 After this had happened the coach said, “I didn’t realize. 12, 13, 14 Now I know what you mean by a short leash.” 13, 14, 15, 16 And again, we couldn’t control it. 17 He couldn’t control it. 17 But, maybe he would have gotten more than a week, I don’t know. 9, 13, 14, 15 So, fast forward again a couple weeks later. 9 I get a phone call, I get home from teaching. 7, 19 It is about ten o’clock at night. 19 This time it is the Dean of Students: “Mrs. McKinney, don’t worry, Ryan is okay, but I need to inform you that we have just sent him in a taxi to a hotel and we are going to put him up for a week. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 He has been using drugs in the dormitory. 14 He has been talked to. 10, 11 He has ignored our conversations. 12 Therefore, we are revoking his housing privileges.”  He wasn’t kicked out of school because he wasn’t failing his classes. 8, 20 Talk about a rock and a hard space. 11 You can go to school here but you can’t live on campus and eat in the dining hall. 8 Where does he live?  We’ll put him up for a week in a hotel. 10 Oh my gosh. 17 Well, he just plummeted. 5, 9, 12 At this point he is using all the time, he is not making friends, well, not those friends. 12, 18 Depression is sinking in.  He doesn’t have anywhere to go.  We are trying to—is there an apartment, is there someone you can room with? 7, 16, 20 He isn’t a problem solving—at all.  He doesn't actually want to solve this problem at all. 10, 13 He stays on the sofa at somebody else's place for a while. 9, 11 Then, of course, he gets sick.  It is difficult to get transportation to class so then he’s not going to class. 7, 20 By the middle of February, he’s not going to class, he doesn’t have a place to live, he has no income. 8, 11, 13, 19, 20 It’s a disaster. 9, 20 At that point, this is a long answer to your questions, I had sought out a therapist because this was a lot to deal with. 6, 9, 13, 17 I had had one appointment and was kind of describing what was going on. 16, 17 It was on a Thursday. 19 Saturday my husband and I were going to go up and see my son and sit down and have a face to face with him. 13, 15, 19 Try to figure things out. 13, 16 So, we go up there, we pick up his stuff at his friend’s place, we have that in the car. 7, 9, 11, 12 We go and have lunch. 6 Overall, it was a friendly conversation. 12 One of the things he had been interested in was the military. 9, 11, 16, 19 Even at the end of high school when he wasn’t sure he wanted to go to college, he thought maybe he would go into the air force or do something like that. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 He went down for his meeting and he admitted that he smoked marijuana. 13, 17 They said, “Okay, you have to wait for thirty days. 19 Don’t smoke for thirty days and you will be fine.” 14, 19 Of course he couldn’t do it.  He kept postponing that. 9 Another thing that had come up in high school was he looked into the naval academy. 8, 13, 19 He had started the application process. 9, 10, 11 He did not finish it, but he started the process. 9, 11 He was in the top twenty candidates.  He had a high likelihood of getting accepting. 8, 10 This shows how smart he is. 20 So we are at lunch and we said, you know, you could always reopen your application and try that direction for next year. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 There is still time. 9 Just trying to get him to think about options. 7, 9, 16 My husband had gone to the bathroom. 7, 15 I said get your laptop and we can pull stuff up and see what we could do. 9 He looks at me and he goes, “Mom, dad’s going to kill me. 7 I don’t have my laptop.”  And I said, “What do you mean you don’t have your laptop?” 16 “I sold my laptop.” 20 And then, “I sold my laptop because I had to pay some rent to the people I was staying with.” 9, 16, 19, 20 Well we know it wasn’t for paying rent. 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 That was the, “Oh my gosh.” 17 At that point we said, “You know what? 13, 14, 15 We are going to get into the car and go home. 7, 19 You are welcome to get into the car with us and head down 35 back to Minneapolis. 7, 13, 19 And that will give you a couple of hours to figure out what you are going to do. 6, 11, 13 Because you know what? 13, 14, 15 You are not bringing this chaos back into the house.” 6, 9, 19 That was crazy talk. 10, 16 AS: Had you offered him treatment along the way at this point? 9, 12, 16 RM: Well, counseling.  AS: But not treatment. 9, 16 RM: Right, because at that point we didn’t really know that that was what he needed. 13, 14, 15 We didn’t quite have the handle on what he was using, how he was using, and any of that.  At that point then he came back. 19 He lived with some family friends that would benefit from some rent. 12, 14, 16, 18 We paid for him to be able to stay there. 9 We thought close with trusted people but not in the same house where things will turn into these round and round discussions. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 19 We would see him on a regular basis, several days a week, talk to him on the phone. 7, 10, 19 He was still thinking of the military at this point, but the reserves were—work together could never make that appointment. 9, 15, 16 We know why he couldn’t make that appointment. 13, 14, 15, 16 It was just kind of like this pretend effort toward things. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 Finally, things were getting worse and worse. 16 He was becoming quite depressed. 12 The lies were out of control. 17 Delusional lies.  The family that he was living with one day the son called me and he said, “I don’t think he is going to work. 6, 7, 18, 19 He is telling me this thing about how his bike got stolen and all of this.” 9, 18 Things just don’t add up to me.” 9, 12 And I said, “Well let me tell you what has been going on.” 19 He goes, “Yeah I think this is what is going on.  This is what I’m observing.”  One particular day Ryan couldn’t get out of bed. 18, 19 The friend called and said, “He hasn’t left the house, he hasn’t gotten up, he’s just…” 6, 7, 9, 12, 15 My husband and I come, and he was in a deep depression. 13, 15, 19 Just feeling terrible and rotten. 9, 15, 16 At that point I just asked him, “Do you think that the drugs are making you feel better, worse, or the same?” 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 And he said, “Well, I don’t think they are making me feel better.” 16 We thought that was a huge insight. 11, 12 We said, “We really think that you need to go into a treatment program.” 9, 13, 16 The counselor at this point finally recommended he should go to counseling and get some psychological testing. 9, 10, 12 They said, “Until you are sober we can’t address the mental if there is in fact mental. 6, 10, 14 So, you need to get sober.” 6, 13 He wouldn’t go and he was supposed to try and find a place on his own because he didn’t like what we were recommending. 6, 10, 11, 12, 16 That didn’t come up with anything. 13, 19 We found this place out in Montana called the Wilderness Treatment Center. 7, 11 We thought he would really like it because it was for boys fourteen to twenty-four, nice age range. 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 Hiking, backpacking, and he likes—that kind of stuff. 9, 10, 16, 17, 19 He halfheartedly—I wouldn’t say halfheartedly—he agreed to go. 20 He was going to go the next day. 19 We were getting packed and filling everything out and that afternoon he wanted to call his grandpa to say happy birthday and he said he was going to tell his grandpa but he didn’t. 7, 12, 13, 17, 19 He also wanted to go see his girlfriend. 12, 13 They were kind of on the odds at the time and he wanted to go see one of his best friends from kindergarten to tell him what was going on. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 He didn’t come home that night. 13, 19 Which we could have— The next morning he showed up and my husband was there when he came home and he didn’t know where he slept. 7, 13, 14, 15, 19 He said, “It doesn’t look like he slept anywhere.  He didn’t sleep at somebody’s house.” 6, 7, 9 We found out later he never did go to the friend’s. 12, 15 Who knows? 13, 14, 15 He came in and he fell asleep on the sofa in our home downstairs. 7, 9, 15, 19 This is late morning.  He stayed asleep until ten o’clock at night. 5, 7, 9, 19 Meanwhile, I’m getting his bag packed, finishing all the paperwork, got the plane tickets, they are supposed to leave the next morning. 6, 13 He wakes up at ten o’clock at night and it was the worst night of my life because my husband and I decided that my husband would go to bed since they had to get up early and I would stay up with Ryan and hopefully he would go back to sleep. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 19 Of course we ended up staying up for hours talking about, I wrote a blog about this, how did we get here? 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 He says to me, “I just don’t understand how we got here?” 9, 12, 16 [laughs]  AS: Your son said this?  And he’s like, “I don’t think this is the right thing for me. 10, 14 I don’t think I need this.” 13 At first it’s, “I don’t think this is the right thing. 9, 14 I don’t think I need this.” 13 And then it got ugly.  Because of dad.  All this stuff. 9 And I was just adament, “Nope, tomorrow you and dad are getting on a plane. 9, 12, 13 At the end of sixty days we’ll talk.” 10, 12, 19 I tried to put it in the positive: “You know what? 10, 13, 14, 15 You will feel better. 16 You deserve to feel better. 16 All these great things.” 11, 16 So, the next morning of course, he is refusing to go.  And my husband is like, “Get in the car.” 7, 10, 15 We were adament.  “You get in the car and you go.” 7 The frist leg of the flight was fine. 9, 14 And they had to stopover in Salt Lake City and he was refusing to get on the plane and my husband was like, “You have to get on the plane.” 9, 10, 13, 15 But, I don’t know if this is true but it is a federal offense if you don’t get on the plane. 13, 14, 15 [laughs]  AS: You told him it was a federal offense! 20 [laughs]  RM: Because he had a ticket! 13 And you are on the jetway, you can’t go back! 16, 19 Once you’ve given them your ticket which you have just done. 6, 9, 12, 13 It was one of those puddle jumper planes from that point. 13 Unfortunately they weren’t seated next to each other on that flight [laughter].  They got to the airport. 8 The counsellor was there to pick him up. 7 They hugged each other and said they loved each other. 13 That was a positive goodbye. 13, 14 My husband got on a plane and flew back home. 7, 13, 15, 19 A couple days in, we got the call that he was okay, not talking to him, the counselor. 7, 10, 19 He was okay, he hadn’t quite gotten into the groove. 15 He was being polite, participating, and everything.  We would have a chance to talk to him the next week. 10 Couple days after that get the phone call from the counselor: 7, 10, 19 “Is there more information you can give us, things you can share? 6, 16, 17 He has got the guys here convinced that he doesn’t belong here.  The guys are convinced he doesn’t belong here.  He is insisting. 9 You don’t have on here that he uses opiates. 9 Are you sure that he’s not using opiates?” 15 I said, “Well, we found the foil and I have a picture.  We can send you the picture.” 12 He said, “Because he is behaving like somebody who is withdrawing from opiates. 14 He said he insists that he doesn’t. 9 He insists it’s just marijuana.” 9, 12 We are like,”Yeah, see, this is what we have been up against. 10 He doesn’t behave like someone who just uses marijuana. 9, 12 We found the foil but we don’t know for sure. 13, 14, 15 And he never injected so there were never marks.” 15 He ran away from that program a week in. 7, 16 Runs away; no phone, no wallet. 7, 16, 19 Crazy stuff that happened from there. 9, 12, 13 We hired a private investigator to find him. 9, 12, 14 Got him back to the Twin Cities because we thought he should at least be close to home. 9, 11, 12, 19 That was another one.  We couldn’t pick him up at the airport. 8 Some neighbors picked him up for us.  With the idea to find out where he wants to go. 11, 13 The options were go to treatment somewhere else. 7, 9, 16 Go somewhere.  AS: How long did it take the investigator to find him? 6, 9 RM: Not long.  Maybe a day or two. 19 You’re in the middle of nowhere and, yeah. 8, 10, 14 AS: How was that time for you?  Did you sleep? 7 RM: Adrenaline. 6, 14 Problem solving mode.  Trying to keep things calm. 12, 16 We didn’t share a lot with family at that point. 17, 18 AS: Had you shared anything up to that point? 12 We did the need to know basis. 13, 14, 15 We didn’t know what was happening. 12, 13, 14, 15 We didn’t want to have a gazillion people throwing their ideas, or trying to help. 11, 13, 16 We are trying to be pretty stealth in what we are doing. 9, 16, 18 AS: Were you and your husband always on the same page about what to do in this situation? 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 RM: Mostly. 9 We were mostly on the same page. 9, 20 We realized very early on, and we have a strong marriage, that we needed to be unified. 9, 13, 14 We would make decisions together. 16 We would talk things through. 10, 16 A little bit of that balancing each other out.  I think some of it is probably gender. 12 I was more of the let’s find out what is going on, let’s talk about it. 10, 19 My husband is more “I’m going to sit him down and he’s going to…” 13, 15 [shouting]  I’m exaggerating, but it was really helpful that we would talk things through and support each other’s decision. 10, 13, 16 It was also important because there were also times that we weren’t both available to make decisions. 16, 18 For example, when he had told his counselor that he wasn’t staying at treatment. 6, 9, 10, 16, 19, 20 Between the time he said that and the time he actually took off, there were lots of phone calls back and forth. 5, 7, 10, 17, 19 When he finally did leave that morning, the counsellor called and said, “He left. 6, 7 We’ll let you know if he shows back up.” 13, 14, 15, 19 I had a major client presentation I had to go on. 7, 18 I could have said something, but I thought, “You know what? 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 My husband is on it as well. 15 We just made that decision right then and there. 9, 12, 14, 16 In the next two or three hours if you have to make a decision, you make that decision and I’ll support you and I won’t second guess it.” 10, 11, 16, 20 That was also a really good turning point in our marriage as parents because we continued then for several years to have those points where ideally we would both make a decision, but sometimes we had to let the other one do it. 5, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 Sometimes it just didn’t make sense because you’ve got other kids, other responsibilities. 5, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18 We couldn’t put our lives on hold every time that something crept up. 10, 20 Which happened a lot. 12, 13, 17 By that point I had been going to Nar-Anon which I found helpful. 13 I did a—called Serenity Summer. 7 I did a blog post about that. 9 I started taking Friday afternoons off and I blocked the time out on my calendar and I would sit outside every Friday afternoon from Memorial Day to Labor Day with a pad of paper and a stack of books. 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 And these were things like the Four Agreements and Buddha. 16 I had an abbreviated version of the Tallmud and I’m not Jewish.  And poetry books and I had been learning to meditate at that point, too. 12, 16 So, a lot came to me during those periods of meditation, which I never realized. 14, 15, 17, 19 That brought me a lot of serenity and peace. 9, 17, 18 Being able to weather what was—during that first chaos. 9 Well, it wasn’t the first chaos. 9 During that first chapter I really did find that Serenity Prayer helped, being able to stop. 9, 10, 13, 16 It was also during that period of time that being a writer professionally, or at least that is part of my job in public relations, that a paragraph came to my mind. 9, 19, 20 That paragraph began the start of Our Young Addicts and some of that writing. 9, 11 I think it was because in my mind I would always frame things like worst case scenarios: what would happen if I had to announce that he had overdosed and died? 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 What would happen if we had to share things with the family? 12, 16, 18 What would happen if—? 12 I know that is a sad thing, but when you work in my field we deal a lot with crisis and being prepared with those statements. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 Same kind of thing. 16, 17 I framed things in my mind in terms of how would I— AS: Convey this message? 16 RM: Convey this message.  So, this kind of paragraph came to mind for me around what was happening. 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 At the time I didn’t really know that I was being told by whatever that I was getting a message to write and do this. 13, 14, 15, 20 Interestingly, shortly thereafter, that’s when I ended up sending emails to the Pioneer Press and to Renew magazine and basically saying, hey, nobody is telling the story of what it is like to be stuck in the muck. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 AS: As a parent. 10, 16 RM: As a parent. 10, 16 From this perspective.  They said, “Write about it.”  And I started writing about it. 9, 11 Nobody ever wants to be on this path. 11, 13, 14 I wouldn’t wish it for anybody.  I think only if you have been on this path can you appreciate what I’m about to say now. 14 Only if you are on this path can you appreciate the gifts you have gotten in any other way. 14, 15, 16 The relationships that I have made, the self awareness and understanding, the life lessons, sense of gratitude, sense of—lots of things like that. 5, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 I have looked back and I feel like I am richer because of it. 16, 19 I’m sure that is true of all kinds of scenarios with other diseases and other things. 6, 15, 16, 17 I feel like I grew through this process. 16 I don’t look at anybody the same anymore. 13 I teach downtown. 19 AS: What do you teach?  RM: I teach public relations and communications. 10 When I get to campus early, sometimes I will see homeless people. 5, 8, 18, 19 Maybe they have stopped in the student center and they are sitting at the table, or 9, 10, 13, 20 I see somebody at the bus stop or I see a kid. 9, 10 I now think about them differently. 14, 16, 17 What was their childhood? 11 What is happening in their life? 11, 12, 13 What kind of help do they need? 13, 16, 17 Or maybe I run into a frazzled parent and I don’t know what is going on. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 I don’t judge them anymore because I’m like I wonder—something is happening. 12, 13 It is probably not about the interaction that we are having. 10 There’s also—I’ve noticed, and I’ve blogged about this one too—there is a silent language. 13 I wish, and maybe through this project it will happen, more people will talk about what is going on. 9, 10, 12 We were always pretty open. 16, 17, 18 I wouldn’t just start telling the details. 9, 11, 12 But if people asked me I didn’t shy away from what was going on. 10, 16 There is kinda this silent language and you will be at lunch with somebody and you will ask about their kids and you will get this, “Yeah…” 6, 13, 16, 17 And they don’t answer the question. 6, 9 And you can let it pass, but now I’ll start being like “There was a time I used to answer that question in that way. 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 It was because, and I’ll tell why,” and oh my gosh will they open up. 17 They gave me a clue, I gave them a clue, and then they made a decision to either share or not share. 16 Like,  “Oh my gosh, that is happening in our family, or that happened in my family or that happened in my neighbor’s family. 12, 13, 17, 18 Overall—let's get to the stigma word. 9, 19 Overall, we did not experience a lot of negativity in that realm. 17 There were certainly some families that we would talk to that didn’t want to believe it kind of thing. 9, 10, 13, 16, 17 Or minimize it or change the subject. 16 But, not any like, “Oh, that’s the McKinney family,” or, “We don’t want to associate.” 10, 13, 18 None of that.  There were people that, they would ask how are things going and they wanted to hear the “Great!” or “Guess what! 12, 13, 16 Things turned around! 8, 19 He’s better!”  I think they would get tired of they are even shittier than the last time, and I would tell them and they would be sorry they had asked. 9, 10, 12, 15 I would get some of that.  But not really any of the negative stigma persists. 9 AS: Why do you think that?  Have you thought about why that would be for your family in particular? 11, 12, 18 RM: I think two things. 16 With people that were in our lives at the time during Ryan’s high school years, they witnessed how hard we were trying to get him help. 8, 11, 13, 16, 20 How hard we were trying to figure out what was going on. 11, 13, 16 I think they had more of a sense of appreciation. 17 That didn’t seem to enter into it from people that didn’t know us. 13, 14, 15, 19 As I said, I think we are at a changing point now. 14, 16, 18 Maybe it is just the time that we came into this where there is a lot more of the, “Yeah, I’ve been through it, I know someone’s been through it.” 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 There is just a lot more, I think, acceptance. 9, 12, 17 That doesn’t mean that it is better yet. 16 It is no longer a surprise anymore for somebody to say they are dealing with addiction in their family. 13, 18 A few years ago I think that was still the thing. 9, 20 Again, I think how we talk about it matters, too. 10, 20 I think if we talk about our experience in honest terms then we send a really positive message and allow people to respond. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 If we use stigmatizing language, if we use stigmatizing negativity other people come back to that as well. 9, 13, 19 Or, if we don’t and they use that “they are just a useless junkie” I think we can role model or counter that. 9, 12, 15 We may not be able to change them or their language or perceptions, but I think we are finding, maybe it is just a Minnesota thing, we are finding that people here are embracing and being a community and talking about things. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 It is a much more open conversation today. 12, 17, 18, 19 AS: I want to talk more about that but I also want to back up to talk about your experience as parents in the treatment world. 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 In family programs, how you as a mom became engaged in your son’s recovery process. 5, 15, 18, 19 Not just you personally, but how did professionals engage you and what was that experience like? 9, 12, 16, 20 RM: Overall, we worked with some really good professionals. 20 They cared; they were good at what they did. 7, 11, 12 They were what you would hope. 10 I feel like there were enough unique things in our situation in terms of just how much in denial our son was, how much he could convince people that nothing was going on. 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20 Sometimes we would get to a point with a particular professional where, “I don’t know what to do!” 5, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 because he wasn’t following the model. 12, 15 AS: He didn’t fit the mold of the addict. 14, 20 RM: So that would be difficult. 20 Again, one of the challenges, because he was over eighteen at this point, before we got him into any programs is that he wasn’t signing release forms. 10, 17 Therefore there wasn’t a lot of access—that frustrated me as a parent to no end. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 A) we had information, B) we had insights, C) we needed to be part of the success; part of the process. 13, 17 Sometimes I felt very shut out by that. 5, 17, 18 They would say, “Seems like things are going really well now.” 14, 16 And I would go, “Really?  Because that’s not what I am experiencing!”  It is a challenge of the system because when they are working one on one with a client they are that client’s advocate. 8, 9, 10 They are not the parents’ advocate. 10, 16 Sometimes there is a divide between what is going on, and I felt like a lot of times they wanted to change us or make us change or have us accommodate things. 5, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 It’s like, you know what? 10, 13, 14, 15 Truly we’re not perfect, but up until that point of junior and senior high school there had been a good relationship and things had been going well. 8, 16, 20 Really where the communication disfunction happened was in the drug induced state. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 So, no, we were not at our best at all. 9 That was not our main operating style. 9 That would get kind of frustrating. 9, 16, 17 Even in the Al-Anon world, many positive things to say about that but, okay, work on yourself. 13, 14, 15, 16 Okay, cool. 17 But I have a crisis or a chaos thing here.  I have someone who needs help, I have someone that doesn’t realize they need help. 13, 14 They could die.  Cool, but I should make my list of amends and take care of my things so I can take care of myself, but what I really need is someone to get my kid in treatment and help my kid stay in treatment and help him be successful. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16 AS: While you felt supported in some ways as a parent or mother you weren’t supported in the ways that you really needed to be. 10, 13, 16, 17 Did this lead you to creating Our Young Addicts?  RM: I felt like I wanted to share this experience because I knew we weren’t the only ones going through it. 6, 12, 13, 17 I have really found a lot of things elusive in terms of information. 16, 17 You Google something and you get something that was completely irrelevant. 14, 19 All these places had bought up all the search terms and you look up ‘Minnesota this’ and you get some place in California and you Google non twelve-step and you get some place in Florida that is a twelve-step. 7, 9, 11, 12, 17 I did feel like I wanted to try to create something where people could find information and share perspectives. 12, 13, 16, 17 I don’t think there is one right way. 14, 16 I think that we need to know what our options are so that we can try different things. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 If this doesn’t work try this. 16 If this doesn’t work try that. 16 Certainly for my son, it took different tries to find something for him. 16, 17 Then there is the readiness side, too.  It wasn’t that the approaches were bad, he just wasn’t ready. 9, 12 Let me go back to professionals. 19, 20 There were two that stick out to me that were just kind of terrible. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 One, we had been talking with an intervention group and thinking that that might be a way to get my son to go to treatment. 9, 10, 16 At the end of the day, in our gut we didn’t feel like that was going to be the right approach. 12, 14, 16, 19 In fact we thought that might create a greater wedge. 10, 11, 12 We were getting hesitant about moving forward. 9, 13 At that point, the professional that we were talking with started attacking me and saying that I was in denial about my kid’s problem and that I was preventing him from getting better. 9, 10, 11, 15, 20 It was—we walked out of that meeting and never looked back. 13, 15, 17, 19 I was irate.  What they were trying to do, because then it was if you don’t want our intervention services then we need to get you into our family program because you need help. 13, 14, 16, 18 You need to heal your family. 13, 18 I said, “You know what? 13, 14, 15 I’m going to Al-Anon, I’m seeing a therapist, and I’m really happy. 6, 9, 17 And I’m doing my Serenity Summer, I’m really happy!” 17 [laughs]  We had another one where, again, Ryan didn’t want these traditional methods, he wasn’t interested in twelve-step. 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 We thought you can’t force somebody into something. 11, 12 He had gone into this outpatient program which had a harm reduction philosophy. 9, 12 I didn’t entirely understand it and I think harm reduction is a tough concept for parents because we think and know they need to quit. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 At this point medication assisted [treatment] was not being introduced as a part of this harm reduction. 9, 10, 12, 16 It was more we will meet you where you are at. 13 If you are using you can use and we won’t kick you out. 9 He was taking advantage of this program.  We had had a ton of psychological evaluation that really gave a pretty clear picture of what we thought was going on in our son’s life. 11, 12, 18 We gave it to the treatment program and they said they wouldn’t even read it or consider it. 9, 15, 16 They said, “He doesn’t have any of those psychological problems.”  And we said, “We think he might be having a dual occurring—and here’s why,” and she said, “I don’t put a lot of credit in that stuff.” 9, 10, 12, 17 I was irate that she would not even consider another professional. 15, 20 She said, “I can do my own evaluations.”  You don’t have to agree with it, but why wouldn’t you at least acknowledge the work of a colleague? 9, 13, 14, 15 Just to get another perspective on things. 9, 16 At that point it became a wedge between family and my son where I felt like it was them again us. 5, 17, 18, 19 That’s just not—I’m saying we want to work together. 9, 11, 12, 13 And crazy stuff too: “He doesn’t feel like you are supporting him. 9, 16 You should let him come back home.” 13, 19 We never said he couldn't come home but these are the conditions. 13, 15, 19 “He says he wants to go back to school.” 8, 11, 13, 19 No shit he doesn’t want to go back to school! 8, 13, 19 I finally said, “You pay his tuition? 16 Because we’re going to be flushing money down the toilet to pay tuition. 16, 19 He won’t go to class. 20 You want him to go live at your house? 6, 9, 13 Okay fine, live at your house. 6, 9, 14 You leave your wallet and purse out. 6, 19 You leave your son’s birthday money within grasp and you see what happens. 6, 12, 19 Leave your car keys out and see if the car is there.” 7 Those are terrible things to say about your own kid. 15, 16 RM: That’s the craziness.  You are asking us to bring chaos back into our home. 13, 19 We have a younger kid. 5, 14 There are some times—I understand the restraints of eighteen plus and privacy and releases, and part of Our Young Addicts is that we are a community. 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 We need to surround this young person with all kinds of things. 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 It is not just treatment and recovery and relapse prevention. 9, 12, 15, 16, 18 We need to surround them with love and we need to surround them with nutrition and we need to surround them with living and we need to surround them with lots of things. 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 17 AS: When did you start Our Young Addicts, and why do you keep doing it? 9, 11, 12 Then maybe you can tell me about your son’s recovery? 9 RM: Informally, it started with some writing that I did in 2011 for the Pioneer Press. 9, 11, 17 That was a biweekly column.  At that point I was posting as RM: Real Mom. 9 I wanted to be completely honest, but at the same time protect identity. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 That was the best way to do it. 9, 16 Not use any names but be completely open about everything else that was happening. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 At that same time I was interacting in an online parenting forum. 6, 10, 16 There were several moms and dads and we were posting and supporting each other. 9, 15, 18 The person who facilitated the forum was moving out of the country and she was going to shut it down. 11, 16 She said, “I’m shutting this down.  I encourage you to exchange your contact information if you are comfortable.” 10, 16, 17 A few of us did and one other mom and I in particular said, “We should start blogging or tweeting or doing something.” 9, 11, 15, 18 We started with a little bit of blogging and we came up with okay, these are our kids, these are our addicts. 9, 11, 19 Shortly thereafter she decided it wasn’t quite for her, and so I kept it up and started the tweeting and started doing more. 9, 11, 12 It started out as an opportunity to take that Pioneer Press column and get it to a bigger audience. 6, 8, 9, 11 Over the past two years, really, as Ryan has been in recovery, I started to formalize it a little bit more in terms of, okay, I write about our experience. 9, 11, 17, 20 I have guest bloggers. 9 Started doing things in schools—conference, building resources, being more of a hub. 8, 16 The reason that I continue to do it is A) our journey is not over.  I think there will always be something there. 16, 17 More importantly, it’s about experience and letting people share their experience so others can take something from that. 6, 19 It’s about sharing resources.  “Hey here is something that worked for me.”  Or, “Hey here is something I heard about. 15 I never used it but maybe check it out.” 9, 15 And hope. 10 I use that phrase a lot. 9, 17 When you are stuck in the muck you have hope, but you really have to continue to keep the hope alive. 9, 10, 12 I was talking to another mother yesterday. 9, 10, 14, 19 Have you talked to Gloria Englund? 10, 11 I was talking to her yesterday and one of the things she said about grief was there are two places for it in this scenario. 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 There is the grief when you realize your kid is going down this path and that the dreams and hopes that you had for this kid, that they had for themself, are no longer possible or are not current. 10, 14, 16 And then of course there is the tragic grief when that kid passes away. 16 I think I experienced a lot of that first grief. 9, 17 Our whole familiy did.  When the kid that we knew and loved was unhappy and in dire straits and struggling and not behaving. 6, 9, 12, 13, 17 The behavior is a symptom.  AS: And unable to help himself. 13 RM: And unable to help himself. 13 Unable to see the problem.  There is a grief there.  It was during that point of grief that I was finding sources online, or not finding sources online. 6 Going to Al-Anon meetings and talking to people and writing. 10, 13 To me, I think that the feedback that I’ve gotten is that it is very approachable. 15, 19 It is not pushing one particular perspective. 18 It’s also showing people through our experience that it is possible to continue your life and to not get gobbled up by this. 11 Keep that possibility alive that recovery is possible.  No matter what happens you can make it through. 12, 16, 20 You can keep on. 12 I realized that two years in July is a huge milestone. 9, 14, 20 I have every confidence that this is going to continue.  Yet, I also rationally know that addiction, and particularly the opiate addiction, is fragile. 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: The recovery is fragile?  Or you hear about people decades later having a relapse. 18 There is always, I wouldn’t call it fear, but there is always that little possibility that this path might detour. 7, 14, 16, 17 AS: Right.  It is having fought cancer or being diabetic, that you are always aware it could come back if you don’t do certain things. 13, 16, 17, 19 With cancer you can’t know. 13, 14, 15 It really does help to think of it long term. 13 This is my journey as a mother with this child.  This is how it’s played out. 8 And you have to figure out a way to move forward in grace with that. 9, 13, 16 RM: Our Young Addicts are a community of—and professionals. 20 That is really important to me.  It’s not just parents and it’s not just professionals. 9, 10, 12, 16, 20 So, to the conversation we were having a few minutes ago, sometimes because of the constraints you can’t have that open conversation with the professional because they are working with your kid. 5, 7, 9, 12, 17, 18, 20 But, you could have a conversation with another professional and get their weigh on it. 12, 20 AS: Who is not working with your kid.  RM: And you might go, “Oh, now I understand what they might be thinking, or here is something else that I could try.” 9, 12, 14, 16 I think it’s really important to foster that parent professional relationship. 9, 10, 16, 20 AS: Outside of the context of services rendered. 12, 14 RM: Bingo!  So this community of parents and professionals is concerned about the number of young people using drugs and alcohol. 10, 14, 16, 20 Depending on the statistic the number is going up, the number is going down, the number is stable. 9, 12, 18 Doesn’t matter. 20 One is too many.  No matter where that person may be on that spectrum: 20 I just found out my kid used marijuana for the first time. 9, 12 Is it a problem?  Maybe not.  Maybe it is.  He seems to be using it a lot. 16, 17, 19 It’s recreational.  Here is what you keep an eye out for. 12, 16 Oh, it has turned into use. 9, 19 Oh, it has turned into abuse. 9, 19 Oh, it might be addiction.  We want to get into treatment. 9, 13, 16 Oh, they’ve relapsed. 18 Oh, they’re in recovery.  I wouldn’t call it a continuum. 7 There is a spectrum of different times and different ways that people are using drugs and alcohol. 14, 16, 17, 18 Again, trying just to give people a place that they can get information and share information. 6, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 We’re not a support group.  We’re not set up to be a support group. 17 More of a sharing community.  Online gives people a lot of access. 6, 17 Started locally here just doing some more programming type things. 7, 9, 12, 16 Face to face is also important.  You can’t do it all online. 6 AS: The parallels in our journeys are very interesting to me. 9, 19 A few years ago I was looking for something like this and thought there was nothing, and started thinking about how could I create something like this. 9, 11, 12, 20 A place where information could be shared and stories could be shared. 9, 11, 12, 17, 18 It’s very serendipitous and wonderful to meet you and see another person with that same desire to share information. 12, 13, 17 Yet, I think about our backgrounds and your PR background actually gives you a whole set of tools and you already have all these tools— RM: It’s this intersection of personal and professional. 6, 8, 10, 16, 17, 19, 20 AS: And that is exactly what I’m striving towards. 9, 10 Using my skills as a historian to try and bring some kind of awareness to a situation and document what is happening. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 RM: It’s amazing what families have done. 15 We hear a lot about the mom projects and I know that is where you are focusing. 13, 14, 15, 17 It is absolutely amazing. 15 I think we can and should coexist because each one is a little different in terms of what they are doing, what they are offering, and what they are all about. 9, 16, 17 I do hope somehow someway we can develop a collective parent’s voice. 10, 16 I’m not sure that that collective voice is getting heard yet from a policy standpoint. 9, 12, 15 From a clinical standpoint. 9, 12 That might be a future orientation or iteration of this.  How can we take this project and this project and this project and this project? 6 So many of these unfortunately have come through somebody’s loss. 13, 19 They are memorializing their loved one with the creation of something. 13 Yet, unfortunately, if everybody does that, then we have a gazillion of these.  AS: Which is kind of where we are right now. 14, 16, 17 When you look, when you start digging around online. 6, 8, 9, 11 RM: Not to minimize—  AS: Shatterproof is scaling buildings with people.  I don’t know where to start documenting some of this stuff. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 It is clearly—there is a need among parents. 10, 13, 16 The collectivism is really interesting. 9, 19 RM: I am hoping there is maybe some way to build a coallition of these things. 9, 16 We are each doing something that is different and needed. 13, 16, 17 We are each trying to fill in a piece that didn’t exist before. 9, 16 I think the other thing is that sometimes it is hard for people to find these things. 5, 11, 16, 18 Just like it was for us. 9 Hard to find…  AS: You and I were having a parallel experience in 2011 even. 15 RM: I do hear that one specialist that we didn’t work with, I got to know him after the fact. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 We were talking about support groups and what not and he said, “There is a need for a parent support group that essentially does what Our Young Addicts is doing but in a face to face model. 7, 10, 13, 15, 16 I’m sure I could fill a room for you week after week.” 7, 15 He said, “When you go to Al-Anon its about working on yourself, not trying to solve your loved one’s situations.” 13, 16 And he said, “Parents in particular, they need someone to say, ‘Have you heard about Tapestry? 9, 13, 15, 16, 18 Do you know about this? 13, 14, 15 Have you done this, do you know about this. 13, 14, 15 Not to say, “Here is what you need to do.” 13 Or be able to go in and say, “You know what? 13, 14, 15 My son’s place is suggesting that he do this. 9, 11 What do you guys think?”  Because in most of those support groups they discourage any cross talk. 10 And I understand that and there is a reason for that and it is a good reason. 9, 12, 16 But, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a reason for interaction and sharing. 10, 16 AS: Especially when your child is under thirty.  RM: I agree!  AS: I notice the benefits of Nar-Anon to some parents whose children are in their thirties and forties and they’re still navigating addiction and there is really truly nothing they can do about their child at this point. 9, 10, 14, 16 Their influence is nill. 20 RM: Very true.  AS: And yet, the parents of younger people don’t—didn’t you also find some kind of relief in those meetings to just feel like I am among people who understand me, who are living in this crazy world, this crazy life. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 But, yet, when you are in crisis you don’t want to be working on yourself. 13 RM: No. Not in crisis.  That brings us to another point that might be interesting for your history. 9, 19 The distinction of being a young person with addiction versus an older person. 5, 9, 14, 20 To me, as a mom, as a parent, we have a very different relationship with that person that is using. 10, 15, 16, 17 A lot of the protocols and the practices are really geared toward, I think, adults. 10, 12, 17 Either spouse relationships, or adult relationships. 9 AS: For best practices? 9, 10 Even for things like detachment and letting go and even setting those boundaries. 15, 16, 17, 19 At eighteen while your kid is legally an adult, if they don’t have the skills and the mental capacity because of the drugs to be doing these things then your job as a parent is not yet done. 7, 10, 14, 16, 20 You have not transitioned them, or they have not let you transition them to independence. 7, 12, 13, 19 So, at a time that your kid should naturally be making that transition to independence and adulthood, they are hijacked by this brain disease that isn’t allowing them to make these smart decisions. 7, 12, 13, 16, 20 AS: And yet, the law won’t let us override those because of their condition. 6, 19 RM: I think the same thing is true in a lot of the treatment programs. 9, 16, 17 What happens when you put an eighteen year old, or even a twenty-four year old, in a treatment program with someone who has had decades of challenges with this? 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20 Who also has some different things at stake. 6, 9, 16, 17 Their relationship, maybe children, jobs, financial at stake. 6, 9, 14 I was leaving a meeting the other day at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge to wrap up some conference things. 13, 16, 19 There were a couple of men and I am going to say they were probably thirties or forties.  They were discharging, they were finished, and they were leaving and moving onto whatever was next. 19 They had their duffle bags and one was waiting for a ride and they were saying goodbyes and wishing each other luck. 6, 11, 14 I was thinking about it and I was just in the waiting room and it wasn’t a private conversation. 7, 9, 12, 14 There were somethings I could definitely tell. 5, 16 There were some relationship things someone needed to work with with their spouse. 9, 13, 16 I was like man, they were graduated, I know they are going to have some after care stuff, but they are going back into a situation where they have been absent now for an x period of time. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 What a challenge. 10 Think about it even for our young kids. 14, 15 For Ryan, he’s taking classes at MCTC [Minneapolis Community and Technical College] right now. 8, 14, 20 Doing great. 11 But, the traditional college experience won’t be his. 8 What are you going to do at twenty-four years old? 20 You aren’t going to go be with the eighteen and nineteen year olds in a dormitory. 20 That experience is gone. 19 I think that in the treatment programs those young people haven’t fully grown up. 9, 11, 14, 16, 17 Their brains aren’t fully developed. 11, 16 They don’t have the perspective on life that somebody older has. 5, 11, 20 We need to see more things that begin to look at how do we help this person at this phase in their life and not throw them in with everybody else? 11, 13, 16 You know what? 13, 14, 15 While there are commonalities in addiction, they are not all the same.  Even differences in economic and cultural upbringing.  I even remember Ryan saying sometimes, he was staying in a homeless shelter and we would go pick him up and he would get angry because, “People give me such shit that you pick me up in this nice car and…” 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 19 AS: Why are you taking a bed?  Why are you taking a bed?  RM: Exactly. 10 Or, how do you—you’re sitting in group and you’re listening. 9, 13, 15, 17 Again, some of the research you look at, the adverse childhood effects. 11 AS: ACE?  A test and also— RM: Absolutely. 9 But, you know what? 13, 14, 15 Not every kid, and certainly not my kid, experienced those things. 9, 16 How, in a group setting, do you have somebody that is talking about the abuse situation or growing up with the alcoholic parent or these things. 5, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17 Sexual abuse. 9 You’re sitting there going the worst thing that ever happened to me was they took my Nintendo for a week… 9, 12, 13, 15 AS: Anecdotally, do you think that might—a person from a more affluent background dismissing their drug use? 8, 9, 14, 16, 19 Are you thinking more that young people need to be more placed together with more similar circumstances? 9, 11, 13, 14 RM: I’m thinking maybe some of the similar circumstance piece, maybe not even similar circumstances, but keeping in mind it’s not one lifestyle. 9, 11, 12, 15 It’s not one experience.  You’re going to have a more honest contribution and group conversation if you feel like there is some compatibility in your experiences. 9, 12, 16 You know, I don’t know if I have an opinion on the rest of the question. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I think the young versus the old is probably the most important factor to keep in mind. 10, 12, 14, 20 AS: For long enough they do end up experiencing some of those adverse childhood, or maybe we can make it average teenage effects because they enter into a very dangerous world. 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20 Where many bad things happen to them because of their need for the drugs. 12, 13, 14, 16 The law, sexual assault, selling themselves. 7 RM: Violence.  AS: Violence, being beat up, being abandoned. 15 There is just so much that the drug experience of being an active addict creates adversity. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 RM: Absolutely.  They get in this survival mode.  This is the other thing about being a mom and being a parent. 10, 15, 16 We realize, maybe not fully, but we have seen enough on the news and TV to know that they’re entering a very dangerous environment. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 You don’t want them to. 13 I think that is another reason why we tend to do what the experts call enabling. 7, 12, 15 Because oh my God I can’t let him sleep on the street. 7, 9, 19 AS: We are so afraid because of the stigma of the people sleeping on the street. 7, 9 RM: Not even the stigma, but just the fear of what he would become. 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 Ryan has talked about—well when you are walking around and you have no place to stay, you might as well do it high. 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 Because you are feeling so bad. 16 You don’t feel like there is anywhere for you to go or call. 7, 16 The places you can go you don’t have transportation to. 7, 11, 17 I do think about, and I feel terrible, I feel terrible about how terrible he felt a lot of times. 15, 16, 17, 18 The first time he didn’t have a place to stay. 9, 11 The first time—you know? 9, 13, 14, 15 A lot of those things. 16, 17 And, certainly, maybe not the safest to be around. 8, 9 Again, no stigma toward those people or judgement. 9 They landed where they are for whatever reasons too. 8 But it doesn’t change the fact that they are not a good influence, or that they are not safe. 10, 16, 20 AS: Is there anything else you want to talk about? 10, 13 RM: We covered a lot. 12, 17 AS: I just wanted to ask a final question. 6, 9, 12, 13 What impact did you have on Ryan ultimately getting into what is now almost his two years in recovery? 9, 10, 14, 20 Going back to leading the horse. 19 RM: The story there was he had gone to a residential program, inpatient. 9 It was the first time he had made all the arrangements and he had recognized that he needed to change and that kind of stuff. 7, 9, 13, 16, 17 Then it didn’t fully work. 11 We knew that when he was discharged that he wasn’t fully engaged and that he wanted to get back to at least smoking pot. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 That’s not going to work.  The halfway program he was in had a lot of, not a lot of supervision but a lot of rules. 12, 16, 17, 20 Talk about the dichotomy.  Things didn’t work out so well for him and he relapsed. 18 Pretty hard and pretty fast. 9, 11, 18 We were getting worried.  At this point we did a family intervention. 18 He said, “Thanks, but no thanks. 13 Not today. 19 I know I need to do something but this isn’t it.” 13, 14, 15 At that point he was so fragile and we were so concerned and the interventionist said you ought to set up the boundaries. 9, 17 We went the opposite direction and started saying, “Do you want to stay here tonight? 9, 11, 13, 19 Do you need a shower? 13 What do you want for dinner?” 13 He was staying home more and more often. 9, 12, 15, 19 It was a revolving door.  Things got to be pretty bad with the revolving door because we were back where we were in chaos. 18, 19 Some money went missing again. 16 It was, I think it was July 9th, he had come home, we were out, and our younger son texted us that he just came home and what should I do? 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 We said, “Let him in,” and he said, “I did and I don’t think anything is going to happen. 12 He’ll probably shower and eat something and fall asleep.” 7 We are driving home and thinking about what we are going to say. 14, 19 We are kind of going through what we are going to do, and we get home and we start having this conversation with him and it’s clear in the middle of this conversation that he is nodding off. 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 He’s not really participating coherently in the conversation anymore. 12, 13, 16 I’m not sure if he was technically overdosing or close to overdosing or what. 7, 15 We just looked at each other and we were like, “He’s not even here.” 9, 12, 15 We decided it was time to go to bed. 12 We said goodnight and he said, “Yeah, goodnight.” 19 We went upstairs and then I heard him come upstairs a minute later and go into his room and close his door. 7, 9, 13, 15, 19 The next morning he said, “What is it you want me to do?” 13 I said, “It’s not what I want you to do. 13 Here’s what you need to do. 13 I said you need to call a place by the end of today and you need to start a program. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 He went to the office with me that day and slept on the floor under a desk. 19 Typical thing that he had been doing.  It got to late in the day and I said, “Have you called any places?” 7, 11, 17, 19 And he said, “Oh no, now probably nobody’s going to answer.” 14 I handed him a sheet of paper.  He had been really adament about the three things he wanted. 12, 13, 16 He wanted outpatient, he didn’t want twelve-step, and he wanted Suboxone. 9, 12, 13 I had done a lot of research and it was really hard to find that trifecta. 11, 17 I handed him a sheet of paper with three places and I said, “You need to call these places before we get home, which is in like one hour.” 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 He called one and talked to them for a little bit and said, “No, I don’t think that’s the right one.” 7, 10, 11, 14 I heard him say, “Yeah I guess I could probably get a ride there tomorrow.” 6, 10, 15 I’m like yes you could. 14 The next day was July 11th and we went to Valhalla Place. 19 I think at that point— AS: Was it Valhalla that he went to?  RM: Yeah, Brooklyn Park.  I didn’t go with him—he started their outpatient program. 9, 11 He started on the Suboxone. 9, 11 I asked him a couple months later, right before he was wraping up the outpatient program, I said, “What is it about this program that is working for you? 8, 9, 10, 14 And that the other programs didn’t?”  He said something along the lines of, “Well, I really like the way they treat me. 6, 10, 16 They are respectful.”  Then he kind of quickly goes, “You know it’s not that the other things weren’t. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 But this was the first time that I didn’t want to go back to using and I didn’t want to go back to the life that I had. 9, 11, 13, 19 Interestingly, he went to treatment sometimes because he had to. 5, 9, 16, 18, 19 He went to treatment because he needed to once. 9, 13, 16 But the time that worked was when he had to, he needed to, and he wanted to. 12, 13 I think that in part, the foundation that we kept throughout this journey of being in contact with him and continuing to tell him that he deserved a better life and that we wanted to help him get help and that we would be there for him. 10, 11, 12, 13 Keeping those boundaries of what we could and couldn’t have in the home. 19 We never wavered from our feelings on it. 12, 15, 16 Knowing that we made the right decision at the right time. 14, 16 The professionals sometimes say this is what you have to do. 5, 18, 20 Well, it depends on the situation. 12, 13 I think we read in his situation at this point two and a half years ago that he needed us to provide him a foundation. 13, 20 If he wasn’t getting sleep and he didn’t have a place to shower and he didn’t have access to food, there was no way that he was ever going to be able to see the way to get better. 6, 7, 11, 16 AS: That’s great. 11 I’m happy for him RM: I am too. 17 AS: Happy for you.  RM: The last thing I’ll say in closing is recovery is not easy either. 9 I’d much rather be dealing with recovery than not. 13, 18 We’ve had to do a lot of, well, the same things you learn during the addiction. 12, 16, 17 Being able to let go, make their decisions, live with the consequences, be there to support but not to enable, and continue to tell them you are proud of them and you love them. 13, 16, 19 Give them the hugs, the encouragement.  It didn’t happen overnight. 8, 12, 19 They aren’t going to get better overnight, but the best thing has been the trust returning, the relationship returning. 8, 9, 19 Seeing not one hundred percent the same person that he was, but a lot of the same. 17 Good sense of humor, engaging conversation, the personality. 12, 16, 17 It’s possible.  Again, is it possible for everybody?  But you can’t stop trying. 9, 10, 16 All you can do is keep trying. 12, 16 AS: Thanks Rose.  RM: Thank you. "
"13","Espuche_Nancy 2","Lori Lewis Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 18, 2016 Oakdale, Minnesota Lori Lewis-LL Amy Sullivan-AS LL:  This is Lori Lewis and I give Amy permission to record this. 6 AS: Thank you.  Could we start off by talking about your own childhood? 9, 10, 11 Where were you born?  What was your family life like? 10, 11, 18 Where did you go to school? 8 LL: I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.  I had a great childhood. 11 We had a lot of fun. 17 My dad is an alcoholic. 5 I am the oldest of five. 5, 9, 20 I was raised in an alcoholic situation. 5, 13 I think I was nine or ten when they separated.  We didn’t lack anything as far as love—my mom was always there for us, always providing what she could with what she had. 13, 15, 16, 17 From what I remember I was always loved and it was fun and even though I was the oldest of five and had a lot of responsibilities after my dad moved out. 5, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 I can honestly say I had a good childhood. 9, 11, 16 Went to school in White Bear, graduated in 1983 from Mariner the last year before they split schools. 8, 9, 20 Anyways, great area to grow up in. 11, 16, 17 We had fourteen kids we were always playing kick the can or something. 16, 17 Really fun.  It was good outside of—I saw a lot of things that in an alcoholic family that you probably shouldn’t. 5, 16, 17, 18 You know, it helped develop me who I am as a person now. 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: Was your mother a single mom for very long? 15 LL: She got remarried when I was probably twenty I think, which unfortunately was to another alcoholic. 5 That marriage did not last very long. 9 Maybe a couple of years. 20 Then she swore she would never get married again and she hasn’t. 15 She is just this wonderful lady. 9, 12 Positive attitude. 13 Very, very strong, but I think that’s where I get my optimism from and my positive attitude. 9, 13, 14 I try and look for the good in things because I could very easily spiral down. 16 AS: She provided that example for you? 6 LL: Yes.  She’s seventy-four going strong. 9 Doing good.  Independent in her own home. 12, 19 AS: After high school what did you do? 8 LL: After high school I tried college a couple times and wasn’t ready. 8, 10, 18 [laughs]  I wound up just working. 9, 12 I worked in a couple of different restaurants bartending and waitressing. 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 Honestly, I made so much money back then. 9, 16, 18, 19 My mom kept saying you got to go to college! 8, 11, 15 LL: I know! 13, 14, 15 So that’s what I did for a while and went out and had fun with my friends. 12, 18 We did the bar scene back then, too. 5, 19 Just had fun. 9 I was working at a bar called Hog’s Breath up on Rice Street, do you know where that is? 5, 7, 13, 14, 15 It was packed every Saturday and anyway that’s where I met my husband. 5, 15, 16, 19 But, it wasn’t until I had my second child that I really took a look at my life and said, “Okay, I have two young children here. 11, 14, 20 He was bartending too and doing construction. 5, 9, 12, 15 I started going to school for nursing. 8, 9, 11 AS: Had that been something you had thought of doing? 11, 12 LL: It is interesting because no, I had no idea I would be interested in the healthcare field. 7, 9, 11, 14, 19 After I had Ryan—would work different shifts. 8, 16, 17 I just wanted to be home. 9, 12, 13, 19 I love being a mom. 13, 15 I just wanted to be home with my kids. 9, 12, 13, 19 I didn’t want to miss anything. 13 I opened up a home daycare. 7, 17, 18, 19 I did that until Ryan was in first grade, Jenna was in kindergarten. 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 While I was doing home daycare was when I went through school. 7, 8, 18, 19 I would get up before the kids would come in the morning. 13, 19 I would study. 9 I would study during their naptime, and I would study at night. 9, 19 I would lock myself downstairs and tell Keith, “You have to watch the kids.” 9 I was very driven and I wanted to get A’s and do my very best. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 AS: When did you go to classes? 8, 20 LL: I went in the evenings and he was home with the kids. 15, 19 It was very tough because I went part-time until I went to St. Kate’s and was in the nursing program. 18 You have to go full-time evenings. 11, 15 I think just being with the kids—there are always sick kids, and nurturing them, and figuring out what they had. 9, 12, 16, 17 That led me to nursing.  AS: Are you currently working as a nurse? 16 What is your specialty?  LL: I started out, once I graduated back then, you could only work in nursing homes. 8, 9, 11, 19 I started in a nursing home but quickly moved to—they call it a sub acute unit. 7, 8, 9, 11, 19 Patients from the hospital not quite ready to go home. 19 I think now they call it transitional care. 7, 13, 14 I just loved that. 9, 12, 13 I remember one guy with an open chest wound, that’s why he was there because his wound wouldn’t heal. 9, 17 He had open heart surgery. 17 It was open and we had to clean it with triple antibiotics and pack it and I just loved it. 9, 12, 13, 17 There are some people who just couldn’t do it. 9, 12 I knew I wanted to go into med surge. 6, 12, 13 I quickly transitioned and went to Hudson Hospital at that time and worked on the med surg unit. 7, 9, 13 AS: And that means surgery? 16 LL: Yeah, post surgery. 9 Anything really can come into a med surg unit. 13, 19 That hospital was really small so they cross trained you in every area.  I wound up working in the emergency room, which was funny because I ended up working with an ER doctor that I went to school with. 7, 8, 12 I remember looking at each other and I’m like, “Are you Butch?” 10 And he’s like, “Are you Lori?” 10 It was really funny.  From there I went to Regions Hospital because I was really interested in working in a bigger hospital. 8, 9, 11, 19 Started working in the ER there.  That was after I had had my third child. 20 Worked in the urgent care for our clinics and then the hospital and I was working like the 5:00 pm to 1:00 pm shift. 7, 8 Then transitioned to OB, which I worked up until three years ago. 7, 13, 20 Because I had a back surgery so I can’t go back to nursing. 19 I could, but not on the floor.  Which really bums me out because I love patient care. 7, 13 AS: What do you do now? 14 LL: I work at the ISNT department with computer programs for, I don’t know if you have heard of EPIC, but it’s electronic healthcare. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 Everything is electronic.  And anaesthesia for the surgery. 9 It is still really fun and allows me to apply my nursing because they need nurses and physicians—all kinds of people to take the clinical piece and bridge a gap between technical people who are just focused on computers. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 It is nice because it gives me another avenue to apply my skills and still have that connection with healthcare. 6, 7, 9, 14 I would love to go back to nursing. 13, 19 I miss OB nursing.  AS: But you hurt your back on the job? 19 LL: No, they don’t know what I did. 13, 14, 15 I mean one of my kids was eleven pounds twelve ounces. 16 AS: But nursing is pretty physically— LL: Yeah. 7, 18 I’ve ended up having another surgery since then. 12 I have had two within the last four years. 9, 20 They said you probably shouldn’t go back. 19 Some of these women who have c-sections and they are three hundred pounds and you have to lift them and help them. 13, 18 But, you know what, I love my job that I’m doing and someday—even if it is phone triage—I love the education piece of the nursing, and that is why I loved OB I think. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: So much talking to patients. 10, 18 LL: And new moms, yeah. 6, 10, 15, 18 AS: And new babies. 6 LL: Oh yeah! 10 And who doesn’t love that? 13 AS: So, talk about your children and how you approached mothering. 10, 14 You were clearly very busy. 9 You talked about the daycare part. 7, 10, 11, 18, 19 But, as they got older, what kind of a mother were you? 5, 16, 17, 20 LL: Well we were—I say ‘we’ as in me and my husband—we were very invovled with our kids. 15 That was our focus. 15 I come from a family of five and I wanted to have a big family because I just loved it. 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 It was so much fun and that’s what I wanted my kids to experience. 12, 13, 18 That was our focus. 15 If someone wanted us to go out to dinner or do something, which was it good or bad? 12, 13 Probably not—we needed our time alone, too, but if there was something going on with the kids we did that. 13 Whether it was sports or swimming or Girl Scouts, whatever.  Plus, it was fun.  I’m a really outgoing person and I like to sit with the other moms and chat. 10, 13, 15, 18 You know? 13, 14, 15 So, it was, that was our time too.  AS: Being with other parents? 10, 16 LL: Yeah, yeah. 10 So, we always were very involved with them. 16, 17 Always very honest with the kids. 9, 16, 17 Very open. 17 There were some times when you are too open: 17, 18 “Quit being a nurse.”  We would talk openly— AS: Yeah give me an example. 6, 10, 17 LL: Ryan and Jenna are a year apart. 20 Ryan and Jenna were in the kitchen and we were making something to eat and Ryan’s friend Zach who lived right up the street was sitting here. 9, 12, 13, 14 We had started talking about, oh, in class they were learning about health and sex education and they were in high school and talking about diseases and all this stuff. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20 I said, “That’s very important.  You need to wear condoms. 13 You want to make sure you are ready. 13, 15, 16 You don’t know what is going to happen in the heat of the moment,” and Zach is beet red. 12, 13, 14, 15 Just beet red. 9, 12 Tall and skinny and curly, curly hair and he is laughing hysterically. 5, 7, 9, 12 I’m like, “What is so funny? 10 Do you guys not talk about this at your house?” 6, 9, 10 He is like, “No, that is why I love being over here!” 10, 13 So, we were always open and we still are. 9, 16, 17 We always told the kids, “Don’t worry about the consequences about something. 11, 16, 17, 20 If you are somewhere and you are drinking and you don’t feel safe—I don’t care if you are in Duluth, I don’t care—we will get you a ride home. 6, 7, 14, 16, 19 Always reach out to us.” 13, 16, 17 But kids, they don’t.  And we always told them there will be consequences based on what the action was and the outcome, but know that you can always call us and we will be there for you. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 But even as the kids got older—the kids when they were younger, Ryan was just going on nine and I had Wilson our last son. 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, 20 For years there were—it was funny because when I told the kids we were pregnant again Ryan said, “Oh, that’s it. 20 I’m never getting to Disneyland.” 8, 15 So, when Wilson was a year and a half and Ryan was nine and a half we took all the kids. 20 When they were younger we did so much as a family. 5, 14, 18 When they got older into junior high and then high school that’s where you could see the definite separation between the older two and the younger two. 5, 8, 14, 20 AS: You have four children? 14 Four, yeah. 10 Jenna is my only daughter. 5 Cal is twenty.  Wilson, our youngest, is sixteen. 9, 14 Ryan would have been twenty-five.  You could definitely see the separation.  Then it was harder because they are teenagers and they wanted to go off with their friends. 11, 12, 13, 18 The younger two, we were still all involved in sports and clubs and groups. 5, 9, 14 You know what? 13, 14, 15 I was the mom, too, who I always knew—I thought I knew—where my kids were. 6, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 I was always the parent that as they got older I would call and find out, talk to the parent where they were going if they were invited to a party or a pool party or whatever. 5, 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 20 How many chaperones?”  All of Ryan’s friends knew, his friend’s moms would call me because they knew I would do it. 6, 7, 12, 15, 18 Even Wilson now, he’s like, “Mom, you do not have to do this!” 10, 14 I’m like “Wilson, I will do this up until you are eighteen!  I want to know where you are!” 13, 14, 15 I’m probably a little bit overprotective.  Controlling, yeah, which I have learned I have no control over anything. 10, 12, 17 Except for what I eat and what I wear.  [laughs]  We just were involved with our kids. 9, 12 AS: That’s good.  Can you talk about when you started being aware that your son Ryan started having problems? 9, 10, 11 How did that appear and when?  Did your daughter have any troubles? 5 Was it with the two of them being so close?  LL: Ryan was in his junior year at Tartan. 8, 20 Jenna was a sophomore. 8 We suspected he was smoking pot, but we never had any proof or anything. 15 One night I came home from work and I was nursing so I was working the evening shift. 8, 15, 19 It was like midnight and I heard something downstairs, so I thought, “Oh I’m just going to go check.” 9, 11, 12, 15, 19 He was smoking pot downstairs. 9 That told me if he is comfortable enough doing it in the house, he has been smoking for a while. 6, 9, 20 At that point I went and got my husband up and we dealt with everything. 13, 15 I wasn’t naive enough to think that was it and he was going to stop. 9, 10, 20 After the third time of him getting caught downstairs we got him into an outpatient treatment at New Connections in St. Paul. 9, 16, 20 It was a thirty-day treatment where he actually went to school there, too. 8, 9, 10, 16, 19 It was all day long. 19 After the thirty days he went back to school and finished out his year as a junior. 8, 19, 20 The whole senior year was really uneventful. 15, 20 At that time Jenna wasn’t doing anything.  In fact, Jenna was dating this big jock in high school. 8, 10 She was a volleyball player. 8 They would go to parties and they would come home and I’m like, “You guys just left an hour ago.” 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 “Well, there was drinking there so we left.” 6, 14 And I was like “Good job.”  Anyways, it was really uneventful. 15, 16, 17 He was about twenty when he moved out with his girlfriend Camille. 8, 12 Yeah, I think he was twenty.  Anyways, everything was fine. 14, 16, 17 AS: Did he go to college? 8 LL: He tried college a couple of times. 8, 10, 18 Actually, just wound up stopping going, which frustrated me. 9, 10, 12 If you didn’t want to go you should have just come and told us. 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 Now we are $4,000 now are considered F’s because you didn’t go. 12, 14 We did some kind of petition thing because he was really depressed at that time, too. 12, 16, 17 All this was happening at the same time. 12, 13 We got him on antidepressants, which he refused to take. 6, 9 He didn’t like putting pills in his body, which is interesting in the way things panned out. 9, 10, 16, 19 He went back, tried again, and just didn’t like it. 9, 10, 12, 19 He actually job hopped from then on quite a bit. 10 He, though, is very talented. 11 He taught himself how to play the drums, the guitar, the keyboards. 5, 14 He did photography, painting, drawing. 14 That was when he was the most content. 15 That is what he wanted to go to school for. 8, 12, 13 We said, “Well, let’s try that.” 16, 19 And he just never went back. 9, 12, 15, 19 When he was living with his girlfriend we suspected that there was some pot smoking and possibly other stuff. 6, 9, 12 We confronted him and he’s like, “You know, don’t worry about it. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 We never really thought anything. 11, 12, 15 No legal troubles, he’s working.  Then we started to see it decline in his girlfriend. 6, 9, 11, 12 He would ask us for money for rent because he couldn’t hold a job. 16, 20 In hindsight now, looking back, you can see the progression. 14, 19 One day she called me up and she just said, “You know I just got off the phone with Ryan. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 He’s at the apartment. 20 I’m really worried about him.  He’s saying that nothing matters anymore. 11, 13, 20 He doesn’t want to live.” 13 So I call him up and he sounded really bad. 7, 10 I must have been off that day. 19 I don’t even remember. 15 I went over to his apartment and noticed that he had some cuts. 20 To me, that was just a cry for help. 9, 12, 13 Whether he was really trying. 16 We are not going to ignore this.  I convinced him to go into Regions ER.  It was during that visit that they found benzos in his system and narcotics. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15 We would find out that he took from me after my back surgery. 19 AS: So pain meds LL: Pain meds.  So, Oxycontin.  I went to look for him and sure enough they are gone, and I don’t know how many were in there. 13, 14, 15, 19 I had it after back surgery and only needed so much andn I didn’t lock them up. 13, 18, 19 I didn’t think we had to.  So, whether he had been using them before and realized I had some or realized that’s what started it. 9, 11, 14 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 He went back home because that was at the end of November, and I think it was the end of December, January, he was like, “You know what? 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Things are very stressful. 9 I haven’t found a steady job.” 9 This must be right around the crash in 2009? 14 LL: Nope, this would have been—because he graduated in 2009—must have been around 2012. 8 So, he was fine for a long time after that. 14 After he graduated from high school. 8 Went on a long time.  A couple years. 20 But, so anyways, he said, “Can Camille and I and the dog,” which is a 120 pound sheep dog, “move in until we can get caught up on stuff?” 9, 10, 16, 17 I said, “Sure, as long as you are doing it for the right reasons. 14 You will get a job.”  And, his girlfriend, I always loved her. 12, 13, 16, 17 She comes over every once in a while. 13, 19 And the dog, everybody loved the dog. 10, 13 At the end of that time—they moved out in the end of January—I noticed that you couldn’t even have a conversation with Ryan. 8, 12, 15 He was so, he was moody since he has been out of the womb.  That’s just the type of kid he is. 9, 12 But really, really moody with John.  Lost a lot of weight, looked pale, was sick a lot. 9, 17, 18 I never expected, you know—we question, are you using anything? 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 Never thinking heroin, but you know, are you using narcotics again, or what is going on here? 13, 14, 15 AS: What would he say?  LL: No, don’t bother me about it.  He would get really irritated.  He would leave. 6 So, he would get sick of it and he’s like, “I’ve had enough of this. 10, 20 I’m going to move out.”  He moves out with his buddies.  We don’t want—we want to make sure. 13, 15, 16 “I know you are in a bind, too,” and I said, “You’re welcome to stay here until you can find a place.” 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 So, we loved her. 13 She was just a really good gal. 9, 12 But, so shortly after that, he had brought laundry over for me. 9, 14, 16, 18 We dropped him off and some of his buddies picked him up and I thought I would do the laundry, and that’s when I found the needle. 11, 12, 13, 14 I was like, “What the hell was going on?” 10 So, I call Camille and she’s like, “You know what, I can’t get a hold of him either,” because she was trying to get to him through a friend of his. 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 Through that phone call they suspected he had been using as well, which I found out from him later as well. 7 They actually knew he was using. 6, 10, 12 And you know what? 13, 14, 15 They didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 They flat out said, “We’re coming up with a plan.  There were three of us that were going to take him against his will and take him up to Duluth for a week.” 6 AS: They were going to deal with it on their own? 13 LL: Their brains aren’t developed. 16 They don’t know. 13, 14, 15 One of his friends really had a hard time, Brent. 11, 12, 16, 18 He has been over here a couple times. 18 The more he comes over the more he divulges. 13, 19 He feels tremendous guilt, and I understand. 9, 12, 16 Two of his other friends were just over here two weekends ago and they sat here for four hours talking. 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19 These are twenty-four year old men that wanted to talk to, you know, it was so much fun. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 Tears and stuff, too. 9 I think it’s good for them to talk, too because it helps them work through their guilt. 10, 13 At that point, when we found the needle—I don’t remember all the details because you are just in crisis mode. 9, 12, 13 We took him into the ER.  We took him into St. John’s at that time.  I know he had to be going through withdrawls at that time. 13, 14, 15 He was still actively using. 9, 10 An ER doctor was going to discharge him. 17 I went to go to the bathroom and told the ER doc, “How can you discharge him? 7, 17, 20 He’s going through withdrawls. 14 You did testing. 9 You know he is using something. 13, 14, 15 You can’t detect heroin.  It comes up as a narcotic. 13, 15, 19 If you discharge my son here, he will probably die and I will hold you responsible. 17, 20 I don’t care what you have to do.” 7 They went in and talked to Ryan and put him on a seventy-two hour hold. 10, 11, 15, 20 I had left because he was so irate and upset. 17, 19 I figured the best thing to do was just leave for a while. 6, 9, 12, 13 I get a call from my husband. 7, 15 They are discharging him, and I couldn’t believe it.  I couldn’t believe it.  I wound up going there before they discharged him. 17 We came up with a plan, talked to a social worker. 10, 11, 19 The social worker, after talking to him, she said, “He needs inpatient treatment.” 9, 10, 13, 16 I’m like, “Yeah, and the ER doctor was going to discharge him.” 10, 17 They tried to look for a bed. 10 As you probably know there is nothing. 13, 14, 15 I think Hibbing was the closest one, and we couldn’t get him in for three weeks. 9 We took him home, helped him go through withdrawls. 13, 14, 16, 19 Watched him the whole weekend. 12, 19 Then they called up and said, “We can get him in. 7 We have an opening in outpatient treatment at St. John’s. 9, 16, 17 Would you like to do that?” 10 Well, “Sure,” while we continued to look for a bed. 18 Well after about two weeks, we wound up getting a call. 7 He was going to outpatient treatment. 9, 16 He seemed to be doing okay, very emotional though, crying a lot, which I thought, “Okay, he is working through things,” but he was still using. 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 So, he wound up in the ER so sick from withdrawals. 14 So, they said we need to kick him out of teatment because he has been using. 13 AS: He was using erratically enough that he would go into withdrawls, then use again. 7, 9, 14 LL: Yes.  When all that stuff happened when we found out he was using it around June. 9, 12, 13 It must have been 2013 now, yeah. 10, 14 Again, there are no beds open anywhere. 17 So, we wind up going to, what is it up the road here? 9 I can’t remember what it is called. 7 Canvas Health.  So, he’s in an intense inpatient treatment in the evenings so he can continue to work his day job, which he did have a really good job at Target. 9, 15, 16, 19 And AA meetings. 13 So, that went okay for a while.  Then, in October he relapsed. 18 Not relapsed, he was continuing his using. 18 At that point I called up St. John’s again and I said, “This is ridiculous. 7 We need to find a bed for my son. 13 I don’t care what I have to do.” 7 I sat at this counter and called every ficken inpatient facility. 7, 9 I mean even outside of Minnesota. 15, 16 Trying to find, and there are no beds.  So, anyways I was just frustrated. 9, 12, 16, 17 I wound up getting ahold—at this point I didn’t even care if our insurance covered it. 7, 12, 15, 20 I wound up getting a hold of Hazelden. 20 They actually had somebody leaving and they did have a bed. 10, 19 They didn’t have anybody on the waiting list, which I found was odd. 9 It is me sitting here. 13 Everything happens on a Friday where you are like, “I need to get through the weekend with my son.” 10, 12, 13, 19 You are so anxious as a parent. 10, 16 They did a phone interview with him. 6, 7 Did a phone interview with me. 6, 7 We got him in on Monday for a chem dep [chemical dependency assessment] because nobody would take anybody without a chem dep assessment. 6, 9, 12, 19 Trying to find someone to do a chem dep.  Quite frankly, HeathPartners, we have good insurance. 7 I know the ins and outs, and still it was a battle. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: You still struggled even though you work in health care and you know who to call. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 LL: I knew who to call. 6, 7, 12 I knew the back door numbers. 6, 12, 19 Like you say, you are in crisis.  I feel so bad for parents who don’t have the resources or the knowledge because I felt like I was on my own trying to deal with this. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Anyways, we wound up getting him into Hazelden. 16, 17 By this time it is like mid-October.  He was in, of course, only twenty-one days. 19 Quite frankly at that time I didn’t understand heroin. 7, 9, 12, 16 I didn’t understand the disease of addiction. 9, 12, 16 I didn’t realize how severe this was. 14 I wish to God somebody would have said to me honestly, all these counselors—and he’s at Hazelde! 9, 10, 16 The best place. 9, 11 One of the best places. 9, 11, 17 I wish they would have said, “If your son does not find recovery it’s not a matter of if he’ll die, it is when.” 20 That’s harsh, but—and quite frankly it’s all in hindsight. 7 Would I have been more frantic and anxious? 7 I don’t know back then— AS: If someone had said that to you? 13, 14, 15, 19 LL: I don’t feel like we were given enough resources. 6, 16, 20 I was Googling stuff. 9 AS: Did you go to the parent program at Hazelden? 10, 16 We went to the parents and siblings. 5, 10, 16 It was a four day—I asked all the kids to go. 10, 19 Jenna was furious at the time.  She didn’t want to go. 13 I didn’t find out until later, the first day she didn’t go. 9, 19 Then I just begged her to go. 9, 12 She said, “Do you know why I don’t want to go?” 13, 14, 15 I said, “Of course not.”  She said, “He had dealers calling my phone to get through to him. 7, 13 I have had enough, Mom.” 20 She was upset with him, too. 17, 19 I said, “You know what, Jenna? 13, 14, 15 This is a reason you have to go.”  We all went, and it was very beneficial.  We all learned a lot during that four day time. 12, 17, 19 Just even talking to other parents. 9, 10, 15, 16 It was very good.  But I remember sitting down, too, in that group where we had to introduce ourselves and I couldn't even speak. 13, 15 It was just a flood. 9, 12 I was crying so hard I was heaving. 11 But I wasn’t the only one.  It was very good.  It was beneficial for the kids, but looking back now they were just so angry at Ryan because of what the disease was putting everyone through. 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 Our focus was on Ryan for a year and a half. 15, 20 This is the time where Jenna was out looking for places to live. 11, 17 We should have been giving her some of our time. 11 Cal was graduating from high school. 8 We should have been looking at colleges. 8 Wilson wanted to go to Creighton, a different high school because he hated Tartan. 8, 12, 13, 16, 17 It was unfair to them, too.  They didn’t have any of our time or attention. 15 If they did we were so stressed out. 9 We couldn’t focus. 15 He was there for twenty-eight days. 19 Then they discharged him to home. 17, 19 During this time we went up to visit him, too. 12, 13 AS: Was he at Plymouth?  LL: He was at Plymouth the first time, yes. 9, 14 They thought at his age he would be better with teens and young adults. 11, 12, 14 You could tell every time you went back to see him he looked healthier. 14, 19 His sense of humor was back. 17, 19 He was laughing. 5 He was interacting with us. 10 He was having fun.  He gained twenty-five pounds I think when he was there.  Twenty-five pounds in a month. 8 He just looked really good. 9, 12 He was discharged. 17 It must have been early October when he went in and it was early November now. 14 Within three days 19 I noticed again what was going on.  Confronted him about it.  AS: Is he at home or in an apartment? 19, 20 LL: He’s at home. 19 Later, we would find out that he used the same night he came home. 9, 19 He had it stashed somewhere in the house. 6, 9 We called up. 7 He went back into Hazelden for a two-week time frame. 19 This time he went to Center City.  We got discharged from there and— AS: Were they offering any medication-assisted treatment? 9, 10, 16, 17 LL: At that time they had put it on the one that starts with a B— AS: Buprenorphine? 9, 10, 11 LL: Yes.  He was discharged with Vivitrol. 17 They gave him the Vivitral shot before he left there. 15 We were responsible for finding a place. 11 He did go to IOP, intensive outpatient program, but because he wasn’t going consistantly, he ended up getting kicked out of there, too. 9, 12, 15 They give me the Vivitrol. 6 They are like, “You are a nurse. 10 You can administer it.” 9 I asked the counselor, and I said, “Do you know anything about Vivitrol? 10, 13, 14, 15 If I give this to my son while he is actively using he could overdose and die.” 6, 10, 15 I’m like, “You have to do a urine test first. 9, 10, 19 I don’t have a urine test at my home.” 9, 19 Again, here I am in crisis mode.  AS: So now they are using you. 14 Yes.  It is ridiculous.  I called up our clinic in Woodbury. 7 He went in with the Vivitrol.  They sent him back home. 7, 19 He was super pissed off: “They can’t do Vivitrol there they don’t even know what it is.” 12, 13, 14, 15 So, I called up a nurse there who wound up being very helpful. 7, 13 I used to work up there at that clinic. 9 She said, “Let me know what I can do to help.” 13, 14, 15 I’m just balling. 8, 9, 12 I don’t know what to do and I don’t have any resources. 13, 14, 15 It’s ridiculous.  She wound up getting us a number for Valhalla Place in Woodbury.  Ryan did go there.  They did the urine test. 9, 19 He must not have had anything in his system because they gave him the injection. 8, 9 AS: For outpaitent? 15 LL: No, just to get his Vivitrol shots. 9, 12, 15 AS: Once a month? 8 LL: Yes.  He was doing good again for a while.  Again, we are talking five or six weeks because then it was January 3rd or 4th. 10 I was at work and got a call from my daughter. 5, 7 She said, “My car won’t start.” 7, 9, 11 I said, “Is Ryan home?” 19 She said, “Yeah, he must be.  The Jeep is here.”  I said, “Go downstairs and see if he can give you a ride.” 6, 9 Within minutes and she was calling me, frantic, and had 911 on the other line. 6, 7 He was blue and his eyes were bugging and his tongue was sticking out and she was terrified. 9, 14, 16 I just said, “Hang up with me. 9, 12 I am on my way home. 16, 19 Stay with 911.  I will call Eileen,” she’s our next door neighbor. 7 She’s a nurse.  She came over and the paramedics were here within minutes. 7, 19 I met them at Regions. 5 AS: Did they have naloxone?  LL: I do not believe he was given naloxone. 6 By the time we got to the ER he was on the monitors and everything and I had to constantly remind him to breath because his respirations would go down to ten… 9, 15 The alarm is going off, beeping, and no one is coming in.  So I know how to work the freaking alarm so I’m silencing it. 13, 14, 15 Finally, I go out and I’m like, “Do you know his alarm is going off constantly because his respirations are six? 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 I have been silencing the alarm.”  She said, “Don’t do that.”  I said, “Well no one is coming in.”  Just the whole experience. 9 We wound up leaving him there that night on the advice of doctors and counselors. 10, 19 They said, “You guys are enabling him,” which is hard for a parent to hear. 10, 11, 16 But it was true.  They are like, “Leave him here. 10 This is probably not the first time he has overdosed. 9, 15 He needs to figure this out and you need to leave him here. 6, 13 He needs to figure out his own ride home.” 6, 13, 19 My husband and I left. 15 That was when we were in January when it was twenty below.  It was terrible. 15 AS: Who told you to leave him? 6, 20 LL: The ER providers.  Not a counselor. 10 An ER provider and the nurse.  This nurse was wonderful.  They find out it's addiction and they treat you like crap. 16 I don’t care. 7 This one was really was empathetic. 14 She was just like, “I’m sorry. 9, 10, 12 We see this a lot. 17 The best thing you can do right now is leave him here.” 6, 9, 14 It was heartfelt. 17 Monty and I came home and he showed up when he got discharged. 7, 17, 19 I found out when his friends came over two weeks ago. 12, 18, 19 That it was Mike was the one that gave him a ride home. 6, 19 I had no idea. 11 AS: Because it was so cold? 20 They dropped him here? 14 LL: Yes.  I had packed a suitcase and left it by the door.  He thought he was going to stay here. 9, 11, 12 I said, “Ryan, you can’t.  I have everything in this suitcase.  I don’t know where you are going to go.” 13, 14, 15 Monty and I were up all night. 19 We were sick to our stomach. 9 It was frigid.  People die in that!  He wound up staying with a friend that lived over there and after two days he called and said, “Can I please come home?” 7, 9, 12, 13, 19 I said, “Under the conditions that you go back into treatment.” 9, 16, 19 And he did at Hazelden.  Here is the other thing, too.  I didn’t know that we had other options at the time. 7, 13, 14, 15 You are in crisis mode and you go to whoever has a bed open. 17 I don’t feel Hazelden was the right place for him. 11, 14, 16 One reason was because they follow the twelve-step, but they are very faith-based. 9, 12 We’re spiritual, Ryan was spiritual but—we went to church when the kids were little, but cramming that down his throat.  But I didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 I just didn’t know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He got discharged from that one. 17 I said to the counselors, “I don’t know where he should go. 10, 13, 14, 15 I feel like he is using at home. 16, 19 He shouldn’t be coming home.” 19 My husband and I were not on the same page through this whole thing. 15, 20 He didn’t want him to go to inpatient treatment. 9, 13, 16 He thought Ryan and him could do it through AA meetings. 11, 12, 13 AS: That he would go with him to AA meetings? 13 LL: No, that Ryan would go.  But I started going to Al-Anon after the first time Ryan was in. 9, 11 The first four or five meetings, I would go for Ryan. 9, 13 Then at the sixth meeting I was like, “Oh my god I’m here for me.” 10, 13 I learned a lot about myself. 12, 17 A lot of good skills to use on Ryan. 7, 9, 17 In fact, Ryan had said one time, we were in the kitchen, you know how they tell you to talk about the: “I feel, I think, I need.” 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I started doing that with him. 9, 11 He knew exactly what I was doing because that’s what they learn. 6, 10, 12 He said, “I don’t like how you have been changing.” 16, 18 I would not argue with him.  I would give him a reason, which is really hard. 6, 11 You have to practice this. 10 AS: It is very hard. 11 LL: I tried to get my husband to go. 10, 15 I said, “The skills I’m learning are working on him. 7, 12 I’m not going around and around in these argumentative circles like you are.” 8 AS: Your husband and Ryan were arguing, but you were working to pull yourself out of it? 15 LL: Yes.  It was just funny though because we both stood there and laughed, Ryan and I, when he said that to me. 9, 11, 12 I knew it was working and I needed to keep going. 6, 12, 13 We would go on Saturdays. 19 He would go to AA and I would go to Al-Anon.  End of January until around May—he was sober for a long stretch of time. 6, 9 Him and his girlfriend had come back together. 12, 13, 19 He said, “I want to make dinner for someone tonight.” 13, 16, 19 And I said, “Oh, okay.”  Because she cut all ties, even with us. 15 She changed her phone number. 7, 16 She wanted to have nothing to do with it. 12, 13 I give her credit. 6, 12 She needs to be strong. 9, 13 I said, “Okay.”  And he said, “I don’t have any money.”  I’m like, “Oh, shit.” 10 I go, “I’m not going to give you cash but here’s where my credit card is. 6, 7, 12 You can take it and go to the store, but I need a receipt.” 5, 6, 9, 13 He went, and here I walk in and it’s Camille.  My heart was just—I was so happy. 9, 12, 17 They got back together during this time. 19 He was really trying. 16 He loved her so much. 13, 18 I kept telling him I said, “I know you do but you need to do this for yourself. 13, 14, 15 I am worried that you are back in a relationship and with her. 19 Not that we don’t love her, but because you’ve got a relationship with her and you know her you could get right back there faster. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 You mean get back to drugs? 14, 16, 19 LL: Using.  Yes.  Because she just loved him, too. 9, 12, 13 I can’t believe she did not see what was going on.  AS: She didn’t see what was going on?  LL: No. I found out later again that yeah, they would have friends over, they would smoke pot, they would take pills. 6, 10, 12, 18 Ryan wound up getting way out of hand. 16 She didn’t tell me.  It was around May I think that we started noticing again. 9, 11 We had sat Ryan down after they got back together and I was like, “Here is the deal. 10, 13, 19 Here are all our concerns.  If Camille suspects anything she will confront you.  She will tell me.  I will confront you.  We want to support you in your recovery.” 13 He was all for it and everything, but it was around the middle of May that we suspected he was using again. 8 I found out later that his friends, I don’t know what friends, dropped him off in the ER. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 Outside of Regions Hospital because he had overdosed. 15 AS: Put his body out?  LL: I don’t know the details. 13, 14, 15 Left him there.  The reason I found out was because I got an ambulance bill because even at Regions the ER cannot go outside of the building and pick up the patient. 15 You have to call 911, which I have been in that situation before. 7, 13 Where there is a guy outside Regions having a heart attack and we had to call 911. 7 Something about legal—that was May 15th.  We had suspected again so got him back into Hazelden again in June. 19 This time there was a big change in him. 8, 16 He did not want to be there. 13 He was not getting anything out of treatment. 9, 16 He was so depressed. 12 It was terrible going up there. 15 He was angry.  It was over Fourth of July weekend that Camille and I went up there to see him. 12, 19 I talked to his counselor and said, “He’s different. 10, 11, 16, 17 What is the plan for him?”  He’s like, “He’s got to want to do this for himself.” 10, 13 I’m like, “I’m sick of hearing this. 10 I’m telling you my son is going to die.  You’re telling me that my son needs rock bottom.” 13 I was “Like rock bottom is death.”  As a parent that is the one time I did lose all hope. 10, 16 I was hopeless. 10 I was sick to my stomach. 9 He was mad at me.  We got into an argument.  I started crying. 9, 11 I left.  Finally he came with Camille and I was crying and I just told him, “Ryan, this is hard for me, too. 9, 11, 12, 19, 20 I am sick to my stomach. 9 I am worried.  I am scared to death of you.” 5, 7, 11, 12 He even said too, “I am sorry. 10, 15 I am scared too. 5, 7, 11, 12 They are weaning me off of Suboxone.”  He was going to go to a sober house because we told him for sure he couldn’t come here. 6, 9, 13, 15, 19, 20 AS: He couldn’t go to a sober house on Suboxone? 6, 9 Because of that we are trying to sneak around and find a doctor that gives Suboxone and I said, “Ryan they will test you positive for Suboxone and kick you out of the sober house.” 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16 It is maddening.  That is a risk we were willing to take until we had time to find somewhere else. 6 Monty went and picked him up on Monday when he was discharged from Hazelden. 17, 19 He brought him over to the sober house. 6, 9, 18 He was so pissed off at us, he didn’t want to talk or anything. 10, 13 Monty went to help move him in. 13 That was just how Ryan was. 9, 12 He would get really pissed about something and after a day or two he would come back and talk rationally about stuff. 9, 10, 13, 19 That’s just the way he was, so we didn’t bug him and Tuesday night he did call me. 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 We talked through things and he was like, “Will you bring me my blanket and pillow and some differnt things from home?” 10, 11, 16, 19 His favorite licorice.  “I will come over after work,” because I was working in St. Paul then and the sober house was very close. 6, 9, 13, 19 I went and picked him up and we went grocery shopping and talked about things. 10, 11, 16 He pointed out over there in St. Paul, I don’t know if you know where it is, it is an old brewery they were converting into artist’s studios. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 We would talk about the future and he did seem a little bit agitated. 10, 19 I asked him if it had something to do with his girlfriend. 10, 12 She was in Wisconsin Dells with some friend and it was the first vacation she had ever taken in her life. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 He was jealous because there were guys there, too.  I know. 13, 14, 15 I’m like, “She needs to go have fun, too. 10, 13 She is working through this.  She is sticking by you. 9 She loves you. 13 You have to understand that. 9, 12, 16 You have to let go. 19 She needs to have fun.” 13 We went back, dropped them off. 14, 19 He took his stuff. 9 I just remember, this is just hilarious, I just gave her a super huge hug and he just looked so good. 9, 12 I tell him I loved him and how good he looked and he was like, “Shh, the windows are open the guys will hear you!” 10, 13, 17 I was like, “I don’t care!” 7, 10 I pulled away and part of me wanted to just take him out for dinner or something. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 I knew he was agitated. 6, 12 I know Ryan, and he just needed time. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I called him up and I’m like, “Oh, I left the licorice in the car,” and he was like, “Oh, I’ll get it tomorrow,” and I was like, “I’ll stop by after work tomorrow.” 7, 9, 10 That Thursday I had a lunch in Mears Park with two of my colleagues and we were walking back and I got a phone call from a St. Paul police officer. 6, 7, 15, 19 He said, “Can I come to your work?” 13, 19 And I’m like, “Why?” 10 All this stuff going through my head. 9 He said, “Well, your son Ryan overdosed.” 15 I said, “Okay, he has overdosed before. 15 What does this mean?” 16 He said, “Can we just come to your work and talk?” 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 I said, “Okay if this has anything to do with my husband or kids you have to tell me right now.” 14, 15 That’s when he told me. 20 AS: He did tell you on the phone? 7 LL: Yes, they actually came to Mears Park and met me and drove me to my car. 5, 7, 10, 14, 19 Part of me so still—July 10th it will be two years. 9, 20 I am angry at Hazelden for discharging him to a sober house where 1) they won’t let them have medication, and 2) the sober house was going through a transition of house leaders. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 19 Yeah, which did worry me. 11 They told me at that sober house, we talked to the guy, the lead that was leaving, and for an hour on the phone. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20 Every kind of detail he could think of. 16, 17 He had told me that during the week the guys have to be out of the house from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. 6, 9, 20 They need to be looking for jobs. 13 Which I thought, “That’s weird. 11, 12 How do you hold them accountable? 20 Are you doing drug tests when they get back?” 9, 14, 19 AS: He overdosed at the house? 6, 9, 15 LL: He overdosed at the house on Thursday at 11:30 am they figure. 6, 9, 13, 15, 19 My questions is— AS: He was alone? 6, 9 His roommate who had also been in Hazelden—Ryan was breathing really heavy at around 10:30 am. 7, 8 He was probably in the process of dying at that point.  He was snoring and so he left to go out in the commons area because Ryan was so loud.  When he came back up around 11:30 am that’s where he noticed Ryan wasn’t breathing and called 911. 7, 19 Again, why weren’t they checked on?  Him and his roommate, they were supposed to be out of the house. 6, 7, 9 I’m just pisssed because if anyone would have checked on him they would have been able to arouse him at 8:00 am when he was supposed to be out of the house. 6, 9, 12 And the stupid roommate. 7, 9 Why didn’t he try to arouse him? 9, 16 Had he used heroin? 9 LL: Yes.  Someone in the house had given him $20, which they are not supposed to do. 6, 9 He had a bus pass. 9 We had gotten him a bus pass. 9, 15 So what they think was he took the bus, made the connection, came back to the house, and used. 6, 9, 16, 19 It shows that the heroin addiction was way bigger than he was. 8, 16 He did want to get sober. 6, 13 He even said to Monty one night, “Dad, am I ever going to get better?” 15, 19 When I would talk to him, too, I was like, “Please help me understand. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 Help me help you because I don’t understand.” 9, 12, 13, 16 He just said, “Mom, it’s not just the physical craving when I’m in withdrawals. 9, 12, 14 It is psychological.  That is all I can think about.”  I said—he was so worried when they were weaning him off of Suboxone.  Because the Vivitrol didn’t work for him AS: I have heard that. 15 He’s like, “The Suboxone is so helpful for me. 10, 13 It helps with so much of the cravings.” 13, 18 He was worried, too.  Part of my frustration too is, I think him name is Marv Seppala. 6, 9 One of the directors at Hazelden. 14 I did get a hold of him and talk to him. 10, 20 I had requested all of Ryan’s progress notes and read through everything. 9 AS: Ryan releassed them to you?  LL: This is after Ryan died.  I got all the progress notes.  Every single progress note was from a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor: 9, 10, 15 “Is at high risk for relapse if discharged.” 8, 17, 18 What is interesting is the way we got in contact with him was I went to an all-day seminar. 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 It was on heroin in the community.  It was so good.  But there were people there I knew, too. 6, 12 Another director from Hazelden, a lady—I can’t remember her name—stood up there and said, which just pissed me off, she’s like, “We cannot be telling people that they need to hit rock bottom. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Their rock bottom is death.  We are now starting to use Suboxone,” which they did start using with Ryan when he was there. 9, 11, 14 “We believe in Medicaid.”  When she was done and the group got to ask questions I asked three really direct questions to them. 6, 9, 10 After I went up and talked to her and said, “I have to tell you I am so pissed off right now.” 10, 11, 14 I sat there and talked to her and she was wonderful, she was listening and here she has a son in active addiction right now. 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17 She said, “I want you to talk to Marv Seppala and share your story with him.” 9, 10, 13 He called me and was very gracious and very nice. 7 We talked through everything. 10, 11 He said, “Would you be willing to talk to these counselors?” 10 I said, “Yeah, but I want you to read through all the progress notes I read through. 13 You can contact me and you can point out the errors. 10 And you can understand why I’m so frustrated. 9, 12, 16 Why there has to be change.” 16 AS: Right.  It is not my job to be educating you people after my son has died in your care. 7, 10 LL: I know. 13, 14, 15 Now I am at the point where I’m really frustrated. 9, 12 I want that sober house investigated. 6, 9, 13 I want to hold Hazelden responsible for not helping us get him into the right place. 11, 13, 14, 20 When I told them that I don’t feel that they know about the sober houses that they are sending people to. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I’m at the point now where my grief is turning into frustration. 9, 14, 19 I’ve had two years now to attend all these different things. 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 Learn about the disease of addiction itself.  All these different resources, talking to other parents. 10, 16, 17 A lot of this was preventable. 15, 17 It was Ryan who needed to get sober himself. 6, 13 I don’t think he had enough support and tools in the places that are supposed to be—Hazelden is—there are so many errors. 6, 11, 17, 20 I think with me being in the medical field and being a nurse and able to identify those—I feel that Ryan was failed by the healthcare system as well. 7, 8, 9, 14, 16 There are a lot of things that I think we can change. 16, 17 When I share my story I am so involved in getting change to happen. 9, 12, 16 AS: Can you talk about that experience from the moment of losing your son to what made you want to keep talking about it? 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 As a mom, was it grief that motivated you? 15 Was it anger that motivated you?  How did it play out?  LL: It is a combination.  I had my second back surgery a month after Ryan died. 8, 19, 20 I was off—because this time I had effusions—I was off for three months. 8 I had a lot of time to process; to educate. 10, 17 People gave me so many different books, which were very helpful. 13, 16, 17 A month before Ryan died another young man in the area had died that Ryan knew. 6, 8, 12, 14 You would think that that would scare him. 7 His mom was actually a St. Paul police officer. 7, 10, 15 I have since been in contact with her. 10 Another boy died.  A good friend who lived in the area said, “I’m really sorry. 10, 12 I don’t want you to—but have you heard about so and so?” 13, 15 “No, I haven’t heard anything. 15 I haven’t been on social media.  I have just been isolated.” 9, 12 Here it was a friend of Wilson’s, our youngest. 9, 12, 14 He played baseball with him. 8 His older brother died of heroin overdose. 5, 15, 20 They weren’t releasing what it was, but we knew what it was. 6, 12 She was a concerned parent, too. 10, 16 She was like, “Something has to be done.” 10 I’m like, “I know. 10, 13, 14, 15 I have been trying to look into this.” 16 I had been contacting the St. Paul Pioneer Press. 10 The Washington County sheriff, the Hennepin County sheriff—anybody I could to figure out how we could get a forum. 13 I had already been working on this.  AS: This is while you are recovering from the surgery?  I saved all the e-mails and contacts and everything, too. 10 That just fueled me. 9, 12 I just couldn’t sit there. 9, 12, 13 Part of it was grief.  Part of it was anger.  So, that continued to get me to move and as a result, got me connected with the right people. 14, 18 Pete Orput the District Attorney. 9, 10 His two boys are actually in recovery. 8, 10 He fights like… 10 I love him. 13 He got me in touch with Cheif Mueller and Sheriff Hutton and Know the Truth program. 14, 15 That is when we stared doing the forums around here. 8, 9, 12 They were only gong to do one forum, and I said, “One forum is not enough. 20 You need to do a forum for each city.” 13, 20 The good thing is Chief Mueller has five kids that go to Stillwater, and he is right in that. 6, 14 He knows the statistics. 9, 13, 14, 15 So he helped fight for more forums. 13, 16 We had one at Tartan, one at Woodbury— AS: You are having them in the schools? 8 LL: One at North.  In the schools, yeah. 8, 10 I had been working with the schools, too. 8 Directly with Tartan, and the head lady at the district—she was like, “I don’t know if we can have something like that in our school. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 We have to pay for it.” 16 Because we are in Washington County she found Mueller, who said, “They don’t have a choice, Lori. 17 This is my county, this is my jurisdiction. 7 They will be holding one. 20 We just need to work on dates.” 9, 12, 13 I finally wound up getting in connection with all the right people. 14 At that time too, we were working with the St. Paul officer because we were trying to figure out, okay, what all did Ryan pawn? 13, 16 We didn’t know we were missing it until we went to go get it. 13, 14, 15, 16 We got connected with a St. Paul officer, Sandra Kennedy, who happens to live out here. 12, 14, 18 It is just weird the way it all—she was very helpful because we were fighting with the pawn shop because they were telling us we had to file charges— AS: Charges against who? 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 LL: Charges against Ryan.  AS: You’re deceased son?  LL: Yes.  I’m like, “My son is dead.” 10 I finally called her up, just was balling. 7, 8, 9, 12 She was like, “Okay, I am on vacation now. 10, 14 I’ll be back. 19 You are off on medical leave right now, right?” 6, 14 She said, “Does it matter what time I stop by?” 9, 10, 20 She came over and returned some of the things because she searched the whole area and returned some of the things. 16, 19 Some of the things must have been sold. 16, 20 I can’t find my laptop, his laptop, which makes me sick because there are pictures on there that I’ll never retrieve. 15, 16 She was really helpful. 13 She told me, “You need to come to a group called Survivor Resources in St. Paul.” 7, 13, 19, 20 It is right in the police department. 7, 14 There are other officers there that lost kids to heroin. 9 One of them was Ryan’s friend that had died the month before he died. 8, 12 That is his mom who is a St. Paul officer. 15 Thank God for that group.  It is other parents that have lost their kids. 9, 10, 16 They know exactly what you’re going through. 10, 13, 14, 15 I feel fortunate. 16 I’ve got very good friends, supportive work environment. 12, 18 We are a very close family. 18 I have so many people to lean on.  There is no way of knowing—nobody can know. 13, 14, 15, 16 These people knew and it was a group of parents who had lost their kids to either drugs or accidents. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 Some people were twenty years out. 20 We had more coming that were new. 6 It helped me to know that—honestly Monty and I walked around for six months in a fog. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Even still now I don’t remember things. 9, 14, 16 I could be in midsentence and I don’t even know what I’m talking about. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 It is because I am still preoccupied with saving my son. 9 It’s all that would’ve, should’ve, could’ve.  Just some of the things that you’re feeling that you can’t even tell anybody else because they think you are crazy. 9, 15, 16 They know. 13, 14, 15 They get it.  They helped us get through first holidays, birthday, all that stuff and what to expect and that it is okay. 9, 13, 16, 19 It was so helpful. 13 I haven’t been there for a while now because I feel like I am in an okay place right now. 11, 14, 16 My husband needs to go somewhere because he is still a mess. 9, 13, 15 Every year they do what is called Walk for Hope, Walk for Remembrance at Como Park. 7, 20 Last Monday night we went there and did that. 9, 19 My husband still can’t do it, but there is a big group of us and that is put on by Survivor Resources. 8, 9, 10, 15 I saw all the people and I went with—and all the people who lead it and I say, “I’m sorry I haven’t been there. 10 I have been doing okay.”  But I will come back and see and everything. 13, 19 I honestly could not have gotten through without… 9, 15, 16 We both went to psychologists that Hazelden, actually, recommended. 9, 10, 12 But after four or five times it’s just like I am not gaining anything anymore. 9, 12, 13, 18 She is very good.  We actually tried a spiritual healer, too. 10 We went as a group because I wanted the kids to go, too, and just know there are resources out there. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Because Monty and I were just a mess. 9, 12 We are just now within the last few months are able to help our kids because we were so lost. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 Not only did they have that year and a half that we dealt with Ryan, but now they had a whole other year and a half where we were absent and that’s not fair to them. 7, 13, 14, 20 Each one of them has gone through trying to deal with it. 13, 16 We talk about Ryan all the time. 10 It is hard. 11 Sometimes we get choked up and cry but we keep him present. 5, 7, 12, 18 On his birthday they made burritos because that was his favorite thing. 16, 19 I told all the kids, “I don’t care what you have to do, but be here.” 7, 20 I just wanted everyone to say what you miss about Ryan because I think it is important for them, too. 9, 12, 13 It was fine—we did laugh a little bit. 14 We were teary.  We actually signed—have you ever seen those floating lanterns? 10 We all signed it and said ‘Ryan’ and it started raining and we still have it, we haven’t done it. 9, 11 The kids are all struggling in their own way. 9, 16 Our twenty-three year old started drinking heavily. 6, 9, 11, 14, 20 Wound up getting a DUI last June. 9 They were always good about calling Uber. 7, 16, 17 We recognized that she was drinking and, “No, Mom I’m not,” and so thank God she got the DUI. 6, 13, 14 She has been going to class. 20 In fact last Thursday she graduated. 8, 9, 10, 19 We’ve seen such a change in her. 16 I think part of it, too, it’s just the age she is at where she’s getting old enough and she is getting more responsible. 9, 12, 20 They just bought a house. 6, 7, 9, 12 She understands. 9, 12, 16 Her brain has developed to where she understands the consequences that it caused for everybody. 9, 12, 16 She doesn’t want to go back there again. 13, 19 She’s been doing great. 11 Unfortunately Cal, the nineteen year old, well he’s twenty now, never grieved Ryan, which we knew. 6, 12, 14, 15, 20 It breaks my heart because he’s my—Cal is really quiet, but, very attuned to your feelings. 16, 18 He has been ever since he was little.  Just so loving. 9 I remember one time I was pregnant with Wilson and Cal was like three.  I was just huge, fat, I had been tired of being pregnant, and I almost started crying. 9, 11, 12 I thought, “I can’t cry with him here,” and I was trying on maternity clothes. 11, 12, 16, 17 He looks up at me—and his little cheeks—and he goes, “Mom, you are so beautiful.” 6 And I thought, “You are going to make some woman the happiest.” 9, 11, 12, 16 He is one of those kids that is really quiet and he takes everything and he started drinking more and more and more. 6, 9, 11, 14 And this girlfriend he was with, she had heroin issues. 12, 14, 15 Psychological and chemical issues. 9, 14, 15 Actually, her mother it turns out, graduated a year after me and my sister. 5, 8, 9, 19, 20 Cal recieved a DUI back in October. 19 He has all those court issues then. 14, 15 On Easter he just never comes home, which is unlike him. 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 For consumption.  Call the jail: “Cal’s in here.  We haven’t posted anything yet because he was booked a few hours ago.” 9, 11 Anyways, he gets a second DUI. 16, 17, 20 Shortly after that he is up at the park at 7:00 o’clock at night with his girlfriend. 12, 19 She calls, she is hammered. 7, 12 I said to Monty, “I can’t deal with this. 13 Cal is so drunk.” 11, 14, 15 I had to go out in the car to get him in. 7 Monty drives his girlfriend home, and during this time Cal wakes up a little bit and just unloads. 7, 9, 12, 14, 19 We had suspected.  He just looks at us with hate in his eyes. 9, 12, 14, 16 This is this kid who had—it is just pure hate. 9, 12 I suspected.  I said to my mom, “I think he blames us for Ryan’s death.” 15, 17 She said, “No he doesn’t.”  I said, “Mom, you don’t know the way he looks at me. 13, 14, 15, 16 Yes, he does.”  He was drunk and everything came out: 11, 14, 15, 19 “I blame you and dad for Ryan’s death. 17 If you would have let him come home this wouldn’t have happened. 12, 13, 19 You don’t understand. 9, 12, 16 I lost my friend. 9, 12 I looked up to him.  I lost my big brother.” 5, 8, 9 And my heart just broke. 9, 12 He went on and you know, “He came to me in a dream the other night. 13, 14, 15, 19 Told me how much he liked my art and that I was doing a good job.” 10, 18, 20 And just, God, my heart. 9, 12 Anyways, later that night, I had him lay on the couch. 16, 17, 19 I was in here doing something and Monty finally came home from dropping his girlfriend off and Monty yells at me” “Lori, get in here.” 12, 14, 19 Cal is unresponsive.  I did the sternal rub and he was just flopping and I’m like, “Call 911,” and Monty is like, “I can’t.” 9, 10, 12 Just mental block from stuff with Ryan. 9, 14 He is like, “Lori, I can’t.” 10 I’m like, “We need to get into the car now and get to the ER.” 7, 10, 13, 14 Brought him to the ER and even as a parent I’m like this is more than alcohol. 10, 15, 16, 18 I begged the ER doctor to do a drug test and he wouldn’t. 9, 14 And later, now we found out, now that Cal is in treatment, he had done Xanax that night and alcohol. 9, 14, 16, 19 Had we not found him he would have died.  I have yet to write a letter to the ER doctor that treated him that night but— AS: Why wouldn't they run a drug test? 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 LL: Because Cal is eighteen and he can, “Well, let’s wait for him to sober up and sign a consent to do it.” 6, 7, 19 Again, these ER doctors need to listen to the parents. 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17 You don’t know my son. 13, 14, 15 I know my son. 13, 14, 15 I know this is not just alcohol. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Part of Cal’s legal stuff is he had to get a chem dep. 9 He started going to outpatient treatment. 9, 11, 16 He told them he was drinking with his girlfriend the night before. 6, 12, 14, 19, 20 He had snuck over there to see her to bring her a little turtle that he found here in our yard.  [laughs]  AS: He tattled on himself about drinking? 6, 14 So he would be kicked out of the program?  LL: No he didn’t know he would be kicked out. 13, 14, 15 We had to go there and get everything and they told us. 20 And Cal is like, “I didn’t know, I was just being honest.” 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m like— AS: It’s so ridiculous. 10 LL: I know. 13, 14, 15 They recommended inpatient treatment. 9, 12, 16 Again, three week wait for a bed.  I told Monty I said, “I cannot watch him for twenty-four hours. 11, 20 I don’t have the energy to do that nor do I want to do that. 13 I don’t want to worry.” 11, 13 We called his sister-in-law. 5, 7, 9 She lives up in Nekoosa, Wisconsin out on some land up there in the middle of nowhere. 8, 14 That is where he went until his bed was ready.  He has two cousins: one six months older and one six months younger. 5, 8, 14, 20 His cousins would come down here and stuff. 5, 9, 13, 19 They haven’t seen each other for a while, but that’s where they went.  Someone called us and said, “We are able to get him here earlier.” 7 I said, “Okay he is up in Nekoosa.  We need three and a half hours, more than that, a day to go get him.” 11, 13, 19, 20 And yeah, so that’s where he stayed. 5, 9, 10 I can’t lose another son and go through this again.  AS: How long has he been in treatment? 9, 16 LL: I pick him up on Wednesday, it will be twenty-five days. 19 They would only do twenty-one days. 19 I know. 13, 14, 15 That’s another thing— AS: And he’s twenty?  He turned twenty in April. 19 Again, I have huge concerns.  When I was talking to him on the phone, I’m like, “They are discharging you on Wednesday? 7, 10, 19 That’s not even…” 15 He thought it was twenty-eight days. 11, 12, 19 I’m like, “That’s not twenty-eight days.” 10, 19 I go, “Cal, I’m really worried about you,” I said, “I’m really worried about you coming home.” 19 He wasn’t getting liquor here at all.  He would get somebody to buy it for him. 7 His counselor said, “I’m not worried about him coming home because that’s not where he got it.” 10, 19 He said, “You guys don’t want to have liqour at home.” 13, 19 I said, “You can’t hang around your friends. 12, 18 They all drink. 6, 14 Not to the extent that you do. 15 Casual drinking, on the weekends. 6, 12, 14, 19 I don’t think you are strong enough. 9, 20 I think eventually you will get there.” 15 His response was, “Mom, you don’t worry about it. 11 You don’t have anything to worry about.” 11 AS: Oh, really?  I don’t have anything to worry about? 11 LL: I told his counselor. 10, 20 I said, “That’s a red flag to me, and it should be for you, too.” 12 If he was ready to come home he would have said, “Mom, don’t worry about it. 11, 13, 19 This is my plan.  I don’t plan on hanging out with those guys for a while.” 18 Here I am frustrated. 9, 12 Right now I could see Cal going either way. 14, 16 I don’t think he’s an alcoholic. 5 I think after Ryan’s death that caused it to get worse. 9 I think he’s at a point right now where he could go really either way. 14, 16 As a parent I can’t. 10, 16 We told him too, we’ll support you in recovery. 20 My husband and I are consequences— AS: 15 Will he come back here and live? 13, 19 Is that the plan?  LL: We talked to the counselor: 10, 11 “You have a very supportive environment.  He understands this is an addiction and it was more powerful than Ryan. 9, 12, 15, 16 Alcohol is more powerful than him right now. 14, 15 They had him write a letter to Ryan, which he read in front of the whole group. 19 It was very—he just let loose and was very emotional. 9, 12, 13, 19 They’ve already gotten set up to go to intensive outpatient treatment. 9, 15, 16, 17 I guess we will just support him into his recovery. 9, 10, 12 It is really hard for us because I know the outcome. 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 Some people say, “Oh, alcohol is not as bad.”  Yes it is.  Yes it is.  My poor sixteen year old. 20 He has been through so much and seen all this. 18 Now he is sixteen and he’s going places. 11, 17 I’m like, you know, I go through the same things. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 Call parents and everything and he is like, “Mom, I’m not going to do drugs.” 10, 14, 16 “That’s what Ryan said, that’s what Jenna said, that’s what Cal said.”  Three of my four, you know? 13, 14, 15 He goes, “Mom, I’ve already been to parties where they have offered me that and I just say no.” 9, 12 I’m like, “Oh my God, Wilson, I’m so proud of you for doing that.” 10 But, quite frankly 7 I think for myself when I was a teenager and that’s a thing you try and get across. 16 I had a picture of an addict—this woman wearing a bomber or whatever.  These kids come from really good families. 13, 19 They are with these friends and their friends have done it. 12, 18 They feel safe, they feel comfortable. 16 Goes out the window, you know? 13, 14, 15 I was that age, too.  Thank God that that didn’t come because if my friends were doing it and those were my good friends and I trusted them and was with them all the time. 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 AS: You probably would have.  LL: Yes.  It is so scary, you know? 7, 13, 14, 15 It’s not just our kids. 9, 12 It’s grandma who went in for knee surgery and got hooked on Vicodin and didn’t wean her off of it and now she’s buying it from—it is anyone. 7, 14 I have hope and I’m optimistic. 9, 10 I’m trying to raise awareness and help change some of these things within our own healthcare organization, at Hazelden, at these sober houses. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16 Especially for medication assisted treatment. 9, 10, 16 If there is something out there that will help them. 13 We both thought that would’ve helped my son. 11, 12, 13, 16 We weren’t given the chance. 6 Whatever we can do to try and prevent it and bring awareness. 15, 16 Even the symptoms for other parents— AS: I didn’t know my daughter was nodding off because of heroin. 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 LL: I know! 13, 14, 15 AS: I thought she was over tired because she was a night owl and she would stay up too late. 9, 11, 12, 19 So by the next night at dinner when she is like nodding I would just tell her to get up and go to bed. 9, 12, 19 You’re frustrating me sitting here in front of this dinner that I made. 9, 13, 16 Just go to bed! 9 Of course she would get up and go to bed.  [laughs]  For a parent to know all of those signs. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 The flu type symptom, the nodding off, long sleeve shirts, spoons missing. 16 I couldn’t figure out where the frick—I would go to Target and buy spoons because… 7, 13 That is another thing about Cal because that night when he was drunk—he has talked about it in counseling. 10, 11, 14, 15, 19 He feels tremendous guilt. 12, 16 Looking back he knows he drove Ryan to dealers’ houses. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 Because Ryan said, “Stay in the car I’m just going to run in and get my phone charger that I left here,” or whatever. 7, 9, 11, 12, 17 He also saw Ryan taking spoons and knew what he was using them for and didn’t tell us. 6, 12 He feels a tremendous amount of guilt, too. 12, 16, 18 I want him to understand that even if he had told us that wouldn’t have changed the outcomes. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 The disease was bigger than Ryan. 8 AS: How do you deal with that as a mom? 13, 15 As a parent? 10, 16 Do you still feel like you could have done something more? 9, 16 LL: Oh yeah. 10 I think for me—the avenues I have taken of speaking out, being involved, and trying to make change happen helps me. 6, 12, 13, 16 It’s my therapy because it helps me continue to fight for my son even though he’s gone. 13, 15, 19 I look back now and Monty and I always—God if we would have—we were ready to mortgage the house to put him in the Hazelden fellowship inpatient program for three months. 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 But then we are like, “Okay, we spent $40,000. 19 Is that really going to help him? 13 And what is that taking away from the rest of the kids?” 9, 16, 19 It is such a dilemma.  We think about that, too.  If we had gone and went to a different sober house. 6, 9, 16, 17 If we had identified the symptoms sooner.  If we—again it is so out of our control. 17 AS: But yet as a parent— LL: 10, 16 You still feel that way. 9, 16 AS: You still think you can do something to help your child. 9, 13 LL: If I had stayed and taken him out to dinner that night because I recognized that he was agitated. 5, 6, 9, 19 Would that have prevented him from getting the money, going on the bus? 9, 15 It is all that stuff. 9 You drive yourself absolutely crazy. 7, 14, 16 I never used to have anxiety. 9, 15 I have tremendous anxiety now. 12, 14 I am still thinking about ways that—what could I have done? 9, 16, 17 It is frustrating. 9 Your emotions are all over the place. 11 There are times where I feel Ryan now. 14, 16, 18 I used to hate it when people would tell me that because I’m like, “I don’t.” 9, 10 I dream about him, I feel him now. 14, 16 I can feel happiness. 16 There are days, too, where I see Cal’s pain and I think God dang it this disease is still affecting our family. 9, 18, 19 I am angry at Ryan for dying.  We were supposed to work through this together. 6 I never know where I’m going to be when I am going to break down next. 13, 14, 15, 18 If I smell him or hear a song I completely lose it. 14, 19 It is just—our lives still seem unmanageable. 9, 12, 19 Not to the extent that it was when he was using, but we isolated ourselves back then because we didn’t want anyone to know, or we were exhausted, or we never knew what was going on with Ryan. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 We still do that now. 9, 14 We don’t care about the same things. 7, 16 The things that mattered before don’t. 12, 16, 20 AS: Those outgoing parents that you were around with everybody else’s children, you’re not that anymore? 8, 10, 13, 14, 16 LL: Nope.  Don’t have the energy.  It’s not that we don’t care. 7 It’s just that it’s not what matters anymore. 9, 12, 13, 20 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 It is weird.  It is hard to explain. 11 Some of the times even going to family functions shortly after Ryan died. 15, 16, 18 I’m like, “You guys we are going to go. 10 We are going to cry.  It is our first holiday without him. 9, 19 Let’s time box it.  If we stay for an hour and we just really need to get out of there, that’s fine.” 9, 12, 13, 14 My family understands. 9, 12, 16, 18 That is kind of how we are now, too. 14, 16, 17 We go out and do stuff but you will be sitting having dinner at a restaurant and someone will start crying. 7, 9, 11, 13, 19 That’s okay.  Let’s just go to the bathroom. 7, 9, 12 We will finish our meal and leave. 6 AS: You said people were very supportive of you.  Do you feel like your speaking out has helped other people? 13, 16 You are saying you are still fighting for your son. 9, 11 Have there been any rewards for the kind of mothering you’re doing for other people? 16, 17 Whenever I speak at those forums there are always parents that come up after and they are like, “Thank you. 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 This is what I’m seeing and at least now that I know I’m not alone and there are other resources.” 9, 13, 14, 15 I’ve had other parents contact me and say, “You know what? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 My friend so and so—this is what they are dealing with.” 12, 13 AS: Can they contact you? 10 Are you open to that? 17 LL: Yes, absolutely.  At Health Partners they did a story in our newsletter and it goes out and it hits 25,000 employees. 6, 9, 13, 19 Just the comments that I got on there, through social media. 9 They said typically they get like five hundred to nine hundred hits. 7 They had over 20,000 hits.  That tells us.  I’m like that is what I’m trying to tell people. 16 People know that people are suffering but then people may not know that their neighbor is going through this. 13, 14, 15 A big part of it is the stigma and people won’t talk. 8, 9, 10 I mean that is another thing. 16 We hid it from our family for six months. 8, 18 I have a very close knit family. 18 The first time we would make excuses and the second time he went in and I was like, “Ryan, I need support, too. 9, 10, 13, 16, 20 I told grandma and my siblings.” 5, 7, 20 He almost went white. 9 You could just tell, even for him, it was such a relief to not have to hide this. 9, 12, 15 Everyone sent him letters. 7, 19 I think the way he thought people would react to him was just not. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 That was good, too, and that showed me that quite frankly the people that are going to support you are going to support you through anything. 7 It doesn’t matter what it is. 20 The people that don’t and are uncomfortable.  Some people at work.  I recognize they can’t deal with it. 13 They avoid me and that’s okay.  I’m fine with that. 14 There are people that come up and say, “I don’t know what to say. 13, 14, 15, 19 I just want to say I’m sorry.” 9, 10, 12, 13 It is odd.  Death is odd.  Especially for a young child. 14 So yeah, it has helped me. 10, 13, 16 It has really helped me with my other children, too. 13, 14, 16 In fact, the other things that don’t matter to me—I sepnd more time, not that I didn’t before. 10, 16, 20 We were so busy running running running. 7, 9, 11 The counselor. 10 When I went up to Cal, when I went out to family, I could only go a day, not the four days. 18, 19 I had to write a letter to him and he had to write a letter to me, and he hadn’t told anyone that his brother had died. 5, 19, 20 After I read the letter, everybody was crying. 11, 19 The counselor came up, and I said, “I know you are struggling with your brother’s death. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 This has a lot to do with it. 17 I know you hate me and blame me and that breaks my heart. 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 If you can deal with that the rest of your life and you are sober and can deal with your emotions I will take that.” 6, 9, 11, 13, 19 The counselor came up and said, “Cal, I didn’t know your brother died. 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 You didn’t share that with any of us.”  There were eight of these guys and he said, “How many of you are in here for heroin addiction?  Cal,  I want you to talk to these guys. 10, 13 I want you to try and understand for your brother.” 5, 9, 12, 13, 16 He said to him, which shocked me, “Your brother did not die in vain.” 5 It caught me off guard, too.  He goes, “Lori I’m going to tell you something.”  Because Cal had to read his letter to me, too. 19 It was very apparent that he looked up to Ryan a lot. 10, 16, 17 I didn’t realize they were as close as they were. 14 He said, “If he looked up to Ryan as much as he did it was just a matter of time before he would follow in Ryan’s footsteps and eventually tried it. 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 He may have saved your life, Cal.” 11 And all this time I had never, ever, ever thought about having another child at—it didn’t even cross my mind. 11, 12, 15 AS: Have another child what?  LL: Use.  Because they looked up—I don’t know if that would happen, but it scares the hell out of me. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 It was interesting. 9, 19 Every time I attend anything I learn something more. 12, 15 I attend whenever I can. 12, 15 AS: Do you still go to Al-Anon? 9 In fact, I went back—for me it is probably just some mental thing but I can’t go. 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 I went back once by myself and hated being there because when I had been there Ryan was in the ambulance. 12, 19 And my two friends that I had met through Hazelden wanted to go there, too. 5, 12, 13, 18 They were like, “Will you go with us?” and I was like, “Sure,” and I can’t go back. 10, 19 AS: Not to that same group you mean? 16 LL: No, because it is a different group—but anywhere. 16, 17 Survivor Resources is good for me, which I should go back to. 19 I can’t go back to Al-Anon. 19 I know it is probably a mental block. 13, 14, 15 I really do, but I can’t.  I learned good tools there but it’s just too painful for me. 9, 12, 17 Because Ryan and I would laugh after at Al-Anon.  Do you go to Al-Anon?  AS: I go to Nar-Anon.  LL: I don’t know if Nar-Anon does it, but you would put a little saying out and they would pull it out and it was just funny because Ryan was telling me on the way there that I was such a perfectionist. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I said, “Maybe I am but I have to be in control of things because otherwise, for me, I feel like things aren’t getting done.” 16, 17 There are certain things. 16 That thing I had read that morning was something about you can’t control—something about perfectionists. 9, 17 I go here and I handed it to him and we both started laughing. 5, 9, 11 He was always telling me, “You work on your program, I’ll work on mine.” 16, 17 It’s just that. 9, 12 It is too heartbreaking. 18 You know we should have still been doing that. 9, 13, 14, 15 No, life had a different course. 11, 16, 17 I can’t go back, but I did learn a lot. 12, 17, 19 AS: That makes sense. 16, 17 Anything else you want to say? 13 How do you think about yourself as a mom through this disaster? 9, 15, 20 You just talked about perfection and trying to fix things. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 How do you relate to yourself as a mother?  LL: I still feel that I am a terrible mom because I couldn’t save my son. 9, 15, 16 That is a thing I have to work through.  I’m like, “Did I do something wrong? 10 Is there something I could have done better?  Am I a terrible mom?” 15 My poor daughter she is like, “Stop, Mom.” 5, 10 I just will always doubt myself. 9, 12, 16, 17 I could have understood him more. 9 I could have spent more time or spent more time with him in his art stuff. 9, 19 There is always going to be that. 16, 17 As far as the other kids I pick my battles more.  I realize that some of these little things truly do not matter. 14, 16, 20 But the things that do I am going to confront you on it. 16 There are going to be consequences.  I just told them, “You have to understand that I can’t. 9, 12, 16, 20 This is the way I have to deal with things now. 13, 14, 16 Because of what is happening. 12, 13 I can’t help it.” 13 I said, “Call me on it.”  In fact Jenna, Monty, and I were sitting in the kitchen just last week and we were talking something about Cal and I was talking a mile a minute and Jenna was like, “Good God, Mom. 9, 10, 12, 13 Settle down.  You are so hyper,” and I was like, “Am I? 10 So you know that is fair. 13, 14, 15 Call me on it because I don’t understand. 9, 12, 16 AS: You’ve kept, even through this tragedy of ongoing problems, that openness with your family? 15, 17, 18 LL: I’ve tried to, yeah. 10 I think it is important.  I don’t know what else to do. 13, 14, 15 I’ve let go of some control because I know… 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 part of it is I’ve let go of control, but I’ve set expectations and I’m trying to follow through now. 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 We lacked that I think with Ryan, which is unfortunate for the other kids too because it is like, you know— AS: An expectation for sobriety? 10, 13, 14, 15 LL: For sobriety, for honesty, if I am asking you to do something I want it completed. 9, 13, 19 I am holding you accountable. 20 It is hard because one day Cal was standing in the kitchen and he came home sometime after his second DUI. 5, 9, 11, 12, 19, 20 I checked his eyes, I checked everything: 14, 16 He even started crying. 9, 11, 15 He’s like, “Mom, please don’t do this to me. 10 I’m not Ryan.”  It just broke my heart. 9, 12 I realized that I am interrogating him. 14 I’m not coming from a loving mother it’s coming from fear.  It is hard to keep in check. 11, 12 You know, I do my best. 9, 13, 14, 15 I have slowed down a great deal since. 11, 13 I was that mom who was involved with everything with their kids. 15 Doing all the right things 14, 16 AS: Yet you still think you are a terrible mom. 9, 15 LL: Yeah, yeah. 10 AS: What does that say to you?  Do you have to think about mothers— LL:  I know. 13, 14, 15 It is interesting that you even say that because even just now sitting here talking with you I have these other mothers that come to me and they are exactly like I am. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 They have done all the same things. 16 Yet I tell them, “You know what? 13, 14, 15 You are a good mom. 15 It’s not your fault.  It’s out of your control.” 17 Isn’t that funny?  But it is hard. 11 I will always feel that there is more we could have, should have done. 16, 17 Because we are held to some standard that isn’t possible to achieve? 9, 12 LL: Yes.  That is our job as parents: to love, support, protect. 10, 13, 16 That is the thing.  AS: But when you do all of that and you still lose a child and you know you’ve done those things and you still blame yourself as if we were super human. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 LL: Exactly. 10 It is played out multiple times a day in my head. 8, 18, 19 I imagine always will be. 14, 16, 17 I don’t think I can go to therapy or anything for help. 13 It just is. 9, 12 AS: Anything else that you want to say? 13 LL: I can’t think of anything.  I mean we just miss him dearly. 9, 12, 16 There is a huge, huge, huge, huge void.  It is weird because you want to say you feel that presence that he once had here is completely gone. 13, 14, 16, 19 You knew when he was here. 6, 12 He was harassing his siblings, he was loud, he was obnoxious, he was funny, he would always try to get a rise out of you. 5, 16, 17 He was always playing his guitar. 16, 17 There is just this silence. 9, 12 It’s just hard. 9, 11, 12 I feel bad for any parent who has to go through this. 10, 16 Not even any parent. 10, 15, 16 Any family. 18 And the friends. 12, 18 When his friends were over here the other day I get it that they are struggling, too. 9, 12, 18, 19 Thank you for taking this on, too.  I had a really nice time sitting here chatting with you. 13 AS: Thank you,  Lori. "
"14","Evanson_Robin","Ian McLoone Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 30, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Ian McLoone-IM Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I am here in St. Paul with Ian McLoone at Alltyr Clinic.  Can you state your name and say you give me permission? 6, 9 IM: Ian McLoone, I give you permission. 6 AS: Thank you.  Do you want to start with your childhood? 9, 11, 13 IM: Sure.  AS: Where did you grow up? 17 I grew up here in Minnesota.  St. Louis Park mostly. 9 I was the eldest of four kids. 9 I was an overachiever throughout grade school and high school. 8, 20 I was a big athlete and loved playing baseball. 8, 13, 19 AS: Can you give an example of being an overachiever? 6 IM: I always got really good grades, was in the gifted program, was held up as an example in each class. 6, 16, 17, 20 I always had a lot of feedback like that. 16, 17, 19 Positive feedback. 13, 19 I didn’t really get in trouble.  I hated getting in trouble. 12 The first ten years of my life my family was really close and loving and secure dynamics at home. 9, 11, 18, 19, 20 I really would describe the first ten or eleven years of my life as idyllic. 9, 11, 20 My dad was a professional musician for most of his young adult life. 8, 11, 14, 20 When he met my mother he was going back to school and worked in the field of nutrition and wellness and eventually got an MBA selling weight loss programs to doctors and clinics throughout the country. 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19 He was a representative for Optifast or Nutrisystem or one of those things. 7, 8, 9, 16 Novartis was bought by Nestle. 7, 9 My mother stayed at home with us. 5, 9, 19 She was almost ten years younger than my dad. 5, 9, 14, 20 When they met he was thirty and she was twenty-one. 5 She had us: me, my sister two years later, my brother after that, and then four years later my youngest brother. 5, 9, 14, 20 AS: When were you born?  Right around eleven or twelve my mom started getting sick mentally. 9, 11, 14, 15 She started having more symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder and got into some drugs: cocaine, meth, heroin, and prescription drugs. 5, 9, 11, 14 My dad was travelling at the time a lot. 17 He would be home every weekend, but he would be gone for a couple days at a time. 12, 19 It must have been when my youngest brother was maybe four or five—I was thirteen or so—and she was spending longer and longer periods of time downstairs in the basement on the computer behind a locked door. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19, 20 I didn’t really think anything of it.  AS: Were you in charge? 17 IM: A little bit, yeah. 10 One day she was obviously very emotional and all of us kids were at home. 13, 19 She said, “Stay here, don’t go anywhere.  I have to step out, but I’ll be back.” 9, 12, 19 We didn’t see her the rest of the night and my dad was out of town I’m pretty sure. 9, 15, 18, 19 At one point one of our cousins must have come over and hung out. 5, 13, 19 I came to find out later that she was really depressed and in a bad spot and she went to Methodist hospital in the parking lot, slit her wrists—did it the right way so they would take her seriously—and went in for the first of what would be countless hospitalizations and rehabs and stuff. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 She was sick for several years off and on in rehab, half-way house, stable, fall off, rehab, halfway house. 6, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20 They kind of started to split. 9, 11, 16, 17 Something else happened and they broke up. 12, 13 She stabilized for a while. 9 AS: Did you live with your dad?  Soon after that she came out as bisexual or gay and was dating women. 18, 19 Again, she got several years of stability. 9, 20 She met this woman and they had a child together. 5 She went back to school and was working on her Master’s and was teaching. 8, 9, 19 I’m in high school and continued to play baseball. 8, 18 I dabbled in drugs and partied and loved partying and having fun, but wasn’t enough to get me in trouble or negatively impact my life. 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 20 My senior year I was the ace of the pitching staff. 9, 20 I had been on varsity for at least two years at that point. 9, 13, 20 We went down to Florida for spring training and it went really well and I played really well. 8 We came back and were playing the season opener against Hopkins at home and I started the first inning and I couldn’t get out of the inning. 9, 11, 17, 19 I was walking people and they were hitting runs off of me and my shoulder was aching. 11, 15 It hurt like hell.  I had to leave the game and sat out. 6 I saw a doctor and got an MRI done and learned I had tore the cartilage in my shoulder. 7, 12, 17 That ended my season. 12 So, I didn’t really think anything of it and I finished school. 8 I had decided to go to University of Oregon. 12, 13 I took a year off and lived in Portland to establish residency so that I could go to the U of O as an in-state student. 8, 9, 20 That was all fine. 14 Meanwhile, my mom and her partner started to fight and not get along. 9, 11, 13, 15 At one point she had a recurence to addictive substance use. 9 Her partner withdrew and took the child with her. 13, 14 At that time gay marriage wasn’t legal and she hadn’t yet adopted the baby. 5, 8 She had no parental rights, period. 10, 14, 16 That just spun her off into a bad place. 9, 11, 12 She ended up getting really sick. 12 Crack and heroin and stuff like that. 9 That was going on throughout my whole college experience. 8 My sophomore year of college I came back to get the shoulder surgery done. 8, 19, 20 I was told that if I ever wanted to play catch with my kids when I grew up I would need this surgery to fully heal. 10, 11, 12, 13, 20 I came back for my sophomore year and had the surgery. 8, 19, 20 Up until that point I loved drugs. 13, 14 They were great, but I didn’t do them all the time. 11 I didn’t do them during the day or the week necessarily. 19 It wasn’t getting in my way. 16 I remember doing the surgery and getting out and going to my dad’s house and sitting in the basement and taking an extra dose of Vicoprofen and just loving it. 6, 9, 12, 13 I had one of those moments when the clouds parted and the angels sang and I was home literally and figuratively. 13, 15, 19 After that it was pretty much off to the races. 18 AS: What year is this? 20 From that point on I would buy pills off the street from whoever I could get it from. 7, 9 It wasn’t quite full on dependence, but I had a love of opiates. 11, 12, 13 That continued throughout my junior year. 8, 18, 20 My senior year I did an internship in Costa Rica, so I didn’t really use opiates while I was there. 9, 20 When I moved home I had one semester left. 8, 9, 19 I moved into a house where the guy who owned the house and was going to be my roommate did oxycontin together. 6, 7, 8, 9, 18 I just fell way into it right away. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 Oxycontin continued throughout the school year. 8, 18, 20 In order to pay for it I had started shipping mushrooms from Oregon to Minnesota because you could get four hundred percent profit. 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 AS: What kind of mushrooms? 7, 16, 17 IM: Psilocybin mushrooms. 7 Magic mushrooms. 7 That wasn’t too much of an issue because my buddies here could get rid of them like that. 15, 18 It was so much easy access there. 6, 18 I would just overnight them in a FedEx box. 8, 9, 12, 19 I hadn’t even learned what the laws were or what was protected. 12, 15, 17 I figured it was mail and people can’t go through your mail. 12, 13 I just figured you could ship it out and no big deal. 8, 9, 12, 13 It was fine for a while, but one day I needed cash and I had been doing a bunch of opiates and was not in a good place. 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 The overnight shipping in the box I had packed was going to cost eighty-five dollars. 8, 9, 19 If I could get it into the smaller box it would only cost twenty-five dollars. 9 Being the fucking privileged idiot I was I was just like, “What could even happen to me?” 9, 10, 12, 15 I switched the packaging in the shipping store. 5, 9 Obviously the dude behind the counter saw I was being weird and looking shady and he called the 7 Eugene police department and they came to my house and arrested me. 6, 7, 9, 19 My poor roommate was coming home as they arrived and they asked him if they could search his room—because they only had permission to search my room, and they didn’t find anything. 6, 7, 10, 19 They asked him if they could search his room and he had a big stash. 7, 8, 9, 10 We both got into a lot of trouble. 17 That was going on right as I was finishing school. 8, 14 I graduated and a week later that happened. 8, 12, 13 I was out in Eugene with no reason to be there, no family, no job or anything and was just miserable. 9, 12, 18 My opioid use was spiking. 9 Eventually I went back home to Minnesota. 19 My mom had been out of rehab for a while and was dating this guy who had offered to put us up in an apartment in St. Louis Park totally paid for a year. 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20 It had two bedrooms and we would each have our own space if I would come home and move in with my mother. 7, 13, 14, 19 I figured it was my turn because my siblings had been doing all this shit the whole time dealing with all of it. 5, 12, 13, 19 It was my turn to come help. 13, 19 I did and the best thing to come out of it was that my first week I was there I was out at the Cabooze seeing a show and happened to meet this girl there. 9, 12, 13, 19 She was also into that scene of jam bands and hippies and fun. 15 I was standing along the bar and she thought I was with her friends or knew her guy friends that were there. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18 We started talking, but I wasn’t. 9, 10, 11 We exchanged phone numbers and I called her the next day and we went on a date. 7, 16, 19 Ten years later we are married and have three kids. 20 It turned out well. 19 AS: Can you back up to when you got into a lot of trouble? 17, 19 What happened in Oregon? 12, 13 IM: They let us go that day because we told them that we would find a way to snitch on some people for them. 16, 19, 20 I really didn’t have a dealer to snitch on and the people that I did know I had no interest in doing that to. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 My roommate though knew a dude who was responsible for more drugs than my roommate was, and he ended up being a confidential informant. 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 17 In return we both got light sentences. 7, 15, 19 We were charged together and we both negotiated this similar light sentence. 7, 15, 17 It still was a Class C felony, which can be expunged. 9 I had to do three years of probation here in Minnesota. 10, 20 I had to go back out there and serve a week in jail and do work release and community service stuff. 9, 19 That was a full year later I want to say. 11, 13, 20 Felony on my record really made life uncomfortable and was a big pain in the ass. 6, 8, 11, 16 I had to go meet with the probation officer every month. 8, 10, 13 It was not good.  AS: How long did you continue using when you moved back to Minnesota? 8, 19 IM: I moved back home and I continued using oxycontin for several months. 8, 18, 19 The guy I got it from one day told me he didn’t have any more oxys but he did have black tar heroin. 19, 20 I smoked it and it did the same thing that oxycontin did. 17, 18 None of the horror stories came true. 9, 18, 19 I didn’t die.  It was identical almost except that it was a fraction of the price and way easier to get. 9, 10, 16 From that point on I switched to heroin and smoked heroin for the next couple of years. 17, 20 Then I shifted over to intravenous use for the next while. 8, 9 Things got really bad.  My wife didn’t know I was doing it for a long time. 13, 14, 15 I would just lie to her about it. 9, 12 When she finally find some tin foil with the big black lines on it I told her it was opium. 6, 8, 20 That worked until she found needles and then I had to tell her I was doing heroin. 13 We would have a big fight and tell her I would swear it off and that I was going to change and I wasn’t going to do it anymore. 8, 13, 16 The next week she would find more needles. 13 We got married and then bought a house and then had our first child and the whole time I was lying and trying to hide it. 6, 7, 9, 16 It all came to a head in 2010. 19 I had been going to the methadone clinic, which was helpful, but then I just started getting heroin and mixing cocaine with it and doing speed balls and fell in love with that. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 AS: But you were on methadone? 5 IM: I was on methadone, yeah. 5, 10 The methadone would dull the heroin high, but if I mixed cocaine with it it was awesome. 5, 8 I did that for several months and then I lost my job. 8, 9 IM: I was running a food shelf for a non-profit because I was fluent in Spanish. 7, 11, 14 I was the language guy of the agency. 13 AS: You managed to hold a job, be married, have a house, have a baby? 5, 6, 9, 20 IM: Yeah, like I said I was kind of the overachiever. 10, 16, 17 It was really easy, but a big pain in the ass too. 8 It would have been a hell of a lot easier if I wasn’t putting a needle in my vein three times a day. 10, 13, 17, 18, 19 My employer had gotten suspicious and I was taking long lunch breaks and spending a lot of time in the bathroom. 6, 7, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19 I got a new job at another non-profit and within the first week they knew something wasn’t right with me. 6, 9, 12, 14 They let me go and I was on unemployment for the summer. 19 My son had been born in January and we had moved into the house earlier in November and I was on unemployment and my wife was working. 6, 8, 9 She had to go back to work sooner than she had planned because I wasn’t working. 19 I was taking care of my son half of the time because we had this other half time daycare that was essentially free. 7, 18, 19, 20 I got so sick.  I spiraled.  It all came to a head one afternoon in the summer when we had some family friends over for a barbecue. 5, 12, 18, 19 I still needed to make another purchase of heroin for a buddy of mine that night. 9, 13, 16, 19 My friends were over and the guy I was getting heroin for was in another part of the city, but my dealer came through. 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 My big plan was that I was going to pretend that I was cleaning off the grill out in the alley and my friends were in the backyard so I would just go around the garage and hop in the car, buy the heroin, and hop out, come back out, and have the clean grill and everything would be fine. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 We are sitting there and I didn’t think anything of it. 13 All of a sudden one of my neighbors walks by down the alley.  Right across from us this big conversion van is there and the door slides open and this whole swat team comes out and arrests my neighbor. 8, 9, 13, 17, 19 They subdue him and then one of the sargeants comes over and says, “You! 13, 19 What were you doing in that car? 7 You come over here. 13, 19 Get on your knees.”  There is a shotgun in my face and my friends are all like, “What the fuck is going on?” 10, 12, 15, 18 “Did you know he was doing this? 13, 14, 15 Did you know?” 13, 14, 15 They patted me down, found the drugs, and arrested me in front of my wife’s really good friends. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 I went to jail and spent a couple of nights in there. 19 My wife, bless her heart, she worked her ass off and got me an attorney and the attorney got me out.  She had even put money on my commissary so they gave me this check for forty bucks on my way out and I was like, “Cool.” 10, 15, 16 I cashed it at the bank, met up with my drug dealer, came home, and I wasn’t welcome at home. 5, 13, 14, 19 I had to leave. 6 For the next three months I spent it worming my way back into my house with my wife and then getting caught using and then having to go to my dad’s house and worming my way back in. 6, 8, 9, 16, 19 She kicked me out one night and my dad wouldn’t let me come home. 13, 19 That was the moment when I had to make a choice. 13, 15, 16, 17 He was just like, “Dude, come on man. 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 Stop what you are doing.  You’ve got a kid and a wife and things you’ve got to do.” 16 I said, “Okay.  If I go to rehab will you let me stay at your house tonight so I don’t have to sleep on the street?” 6, 7, 9, 19 The next week I did a Rule 25 Assessment and I went to Eden House. 9 Do you know about that? 13, 14, 15 AS: No. I have heard of RS Eden, but tell me more. 15 IM: Have you heard of the Synanon group? 15 They were the original therapeutic communities developed in the late fifties but mostly in the early sixties and seventies. 9, 15, 16 They break you down and then build you back up. 18, 19 King baby, hot seat on the bench. 5 AS: These are those people?  What is king baby? 5 IM: Somebody who acts like a baby but thinks they are the king. 5, 10 It is really fucked up.  Back in the day they would shave your head or put you in a diaper if you were king baby. 5, 10, 19 At Eden House they would do that back until they got in trouble for it in the seventies. 9, 15, 19 They had to tone down some of the blatantly abusive stuff, but everything else horribly abusive. 9, 11 From day one they were pressuring me to come off methadone. 5, 13, 19 They really wanted me to stop the methadone. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13 I wasn’t really sober and it was Hitler’s drug, all that shit. 6, 14 They never explained to me what the research says or science or getting my consent. 7, 15 It was just old school nonsense SynAnon bullshit. 8, 9, 12, 20 AS: What year was this? 20 I bought into it. 7 A lot of it was prison mentality. 14, 17 You have to go along to get along, but on the side people are doing drugs and smoking fake weed and doing shit like that. 14 I worked my way up in the hierarchy of the clients and was the executive client or whatever. 16 The main client.  I would be the chaperone for things, or I would lead meetings. 13, 16 AS: You were on the good side.  I was the ideal client, but I was also smoking fake weed and acting a fool and playing along but acting both sides. 10, 11, 13 One day one of the other clients had a pass and I was his chaperone. 19 We went to his house and it was pretty uneventful. 6, 9, 15, 18 At the last minute he asked me to give him a ride back to rehab. 6, 9, 10, 19 We had to be back by seven. 19 His dad said, “I’m not giving you a ride.” 6, 11 We took a bus and went back home and explained what happened. 9, 12, 13, 19 We were an hour late or something.  We submitted a UA [urin test] and they were negative and everything was fine, or so I thought. 9, 11, 12, 14 The next day was my pass and it was my son’s first birthday party. 6, 9, 19 I went home and we had a birthday party. 6, 19 Family and friends were there. 12, 18 It was a little odd because I was still in rehab, but everything was okay. 9, 19 I get this phone call midway through and the guy on the line said, “Hey, you’ve got to come home now. 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 Your pass is revoked and you’re on ban.  You come home right now.” 13, 14, 19 I was like, “It’s my son’s first birthday party and I’ve got family and friends here. 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19 It’s kind of a big deal.” 8, 13, 16, 17 He said, “I don’t give a fuck. 6 Come home now.” 14, 19 I excused myself, went home, and then I was put on the bench for the next three days. 9, 10, 19 AS: What does that mean? 16 IM: That means you sit on a literal bench out in the hallway. 13, 16 You can’t participate in groups, you can’t visit with any of the other clients, you can’t attend lunch and talk to people. 6, 10, 12, 13, 15 At the end of the day you have to go straight to your room. 6, 7, 9, 12, 19 You can’t watch television.  You’re on ban.  You’re persona non grata.  The only group that you can attend is your primary group, but all the other groups you are banned from. 12, 15 AS: This is because you came back an hour late because you couldn’t get a ride? 6, 19 It didn’t make sense. 16, 17 When the program director came in that Monday she was like, “I can’t be co-dependent. 10, 12, 14, 19 I can’t let you let my feelings about your son’s first birthday dictate how I make a decision on this matter. 9, 16, 19, 20 You have to be on ban and on the bench until I say so.”  I think that was the moment that I became utterly fed up with that model. 5, 13, 15, 19 It felt like in my heart that there had to be another way. 16, 17 Had they managed to get you to get off of methadone? 5 IM: I was tapered way down. 12, 16 Usually what they do is you taper down to thirty miligrams and then you stop for a couple of days. 9, 10, 19 Then you take suboxone for a couple of days, and then you’re done. 6, 19 I was down, down, down, down, and actually that weekend before I was supposed to make the transition off my mom came to visit. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 We sat down and she was like, “Ian, why are you so antsy to get off methadone?” 5 “Everybody says I need to get off of it and that I’m not really sober if I do.” 6, 13 She said, “Dude, do you know the science about it? 13, 14, 15 It is incredibly effective. 12 All the messages you’re hearing is stigma. 9 It’s not grounded in truth.” 8 She said, “Ian, you’ve got a baby. 5 You’ve got a wife.  You’ve got a life to take care of and a house and all these things. 6, 7, 9, 11, 16 People are rooting for you.  You have one chance to get this right and you should use every tool at your disposal and take advantage to make this most likely to be successful.” 6, 9, 10, 14, 16 I was like, “Oh, yeah. 10 I am happy when I’m on this stuff. 9, 17 It does make me feel normal and fine. 14, 16 I can sit and do things and be a human being. 13, 16 Why am I in such a rush?”  I held off on that to their great displeasure, but I stuck to my guns. 9, 11, 15 AS: How long were you there?  IM: Four months. 8 At the end of four months I moved into the sober housing that they had and would just come for groups all day. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 It was pretty much the same I was just living in a different location. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 One of the kids that was in the program got busted for drugs or something. 9, 14 They cornered him and made him write a list of all the people that he had ever heard of doing drugs or fucking around. 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 My name came up as someone who had done the fake weed. 6, 19 They confronted me about it and thought I was injecting drugs while I was there. 11, 12, 14 I did cop to smoking K2.  They kicked me out.  I was going to go into longer-term sober housing, but because that was no longer an option I was able to go back home to my wife and our kid. 6, 19 It ended up being such a blessing in disguise. 12 I just had to find another continuing care plan so that my probation officer didn’t kick my ass. 7, 9, 10, 12 I did and I did evening outpatient at Fairview and completed it and it was fine. 9, 14, 15, 19 Somewhere around there I decided I would go back to school and pursue a Master’s degree. 8, 9, 12, 19, 20 Right around that time I found the University of Minnesota’s Addiction Studies program. 13 I got into that and loved it. 13 At the end of my second semester the program director announced that they were doing an Integrated Behavioral Health Master’s program. 9, 12, 14, 20 A full Master’s degree. 9, 11, 20 I was admitted in the first cohort of student in the program, and she had gotten a grant from the state to develop a center of excellence for the study and dissemination of practice in cocurring disorders. 7, 9, 10, 15, 16 She offered me a graduate research assistant position. 9, 12, 13 That paid all my tuition, a good wage, and I had some incredible experiences. 12 AS: What made you want to go into addiction medicine? 13, 16 I just want you to articulate that a little bit. 9, 12, 13 I know it is implicit, but you talked about the Eden model and Synanon. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 IM: I had two felonies.  First of all I thought there was no way I was getting a job doing anything else, but I could get a job being a counsellor. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16 I think the experience at Eden House really made me question the conventional wisdom that was driving not just the program at Eden House, but everything that you would hear among people in recovery. 6, 9, 12, 14, 16 How AA was the only way, it works if you work it, it is one hundred percent effective if you just do what you’re told. 9, 12, 14, 16, 20 The whole time I am going to AA meetings, but I’m not able to disclose that I’m on a medication and I go to work with a sponsor and he tells me to get off of it, and it was all messed up. 10, 13 When I found the addiction studies program and got into my first couple semesters I realized, “Holy shit. 9, 14 None of that shit that people talk about in meetings and in rehab that I went to is grounded in science. 8, 10, 13, 19 It is all lore.  It is all mythology and it doesn’t stand up to scientific scrutiny.” 9, 12 That was really motivating.  As I was working in my graduate assistantship I started to become aware of some other folks in the field who were doing things. 9, 11, 13, 16, 19 That’s when I met Paula DeSanto and was just floored by her approach and the way she looked at things. 5, 9, 12, 16 That was my favorite class that I took in my whole graduate program. 20 She stopped teaching at the U, so they just asked me if I would teach that class. 9, 10, 12, 20 I will get to teach that, which is pretty cool. 17, 18 I read an article on thefix.com and this doctor was being interviewed about medications and why there is such stigma against medication. 6, 9, 10 I was reading through and going, “Good point! 11 This guy knows what he’s talking about.” 10, 13, 14, 15 I scroll down and I click on his name and look at the link of his clinic and it turns out it was in St. Paul, Minnesota. 6, 19 I said, “What the hell.  It wouldn’t hurt if I sent him an email to see if he would want to have coffee and I could pick his brain a bit.” 7, 13 I met Mark Willenbring in 2012. 5 We had lunch together and I was just enthralled and fascinated by what he was talking about. 6, 9, 10, 12 I asked if I could shadow him and hang out and learn from him. 10, 12 He ended up overseeing my clinical internships and then once Alltyr Clinic got started I started very early on seeing his patients and doing therapy and counseling. 9, 11, 12 After I got licensed I had a half a day here and the rest of time at traditional rehab. 9, 19 Over time I ended up working with Melanie Heu at Pangea Care. 12 They do culturally specific programming and different language specific tracks. 13, 16, 17 I helped to develop the Spanish language track there. 13, 16 While I was there I had maybe a day or two days a week and then over time built up my caseload here. 9, 19 I built up my caseload over there and two years ago this coming August I moved over full time here. 8, 9, 11, 20 I have been full time here ever since. 11 AS: What is the model here? 15 IM: We are an addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. 16 In the continuum of care there is a gap of services. 7, 14 If you go to your primary care doctor’s office and you screen as a heavy drinker and your primary care doctor wants to help you get some help historically they probably would just have a rebah that they could refer you to. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 The problem with rehab is that the educational and professional requirements of the staff of a rehab are notoriously very minimal. 9, 10, 19, 20 Very few doctors are going to want to refer their patient to a counselor who has got a GED and intrust their medical care to a doctor. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 Most patients don’t need or wouldn’t meet the criteria for long-term intensive rehab in a residential setting. 13, 15, 17, 19 If you have a sleep disorder your doctor is going to refer you to a sleep specialist or a neurologist or a neurology clinic or a sleep clinic. 7, 9 If you have schizophrenia your doctor is going to refer you to a first episode psychosis clinic or a mental health clinic. 9, 14 Up to this point there has not existed a medically anchored addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 We are trying to fill the gap on the continuum of services. 14, 16 We have psychiatrists on staff, we have a nurse, we have four Master’s level trained counselors, and we provide fully integrated treatment for substance use and all mental health disorders under the same roof with the same clinicians. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 20 Every patient that comes into our clinic gets assigned a primary therapist and primary physician. 6, 8, 9, 13, 19 The first in-take evaluation you spend an hour with a therapist gathering history, finding out course, severity, symptoms, and past treatment. 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 Then you spend an hour with the addiction psychiatrist where you really dig into the important stuff and develop that first initial treatment plan. 9, 12, 16, 19 If a patient needs a high level of care like a structured living setting and additional support than what we can offer in a patient clinic setting then we have partners that we can refer them to to get sober housing and LINE and IOP [intensive outpatient treatment] if necessary. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 We remain the constant in the patient’s team over time. 9 We’ve got patients that work with us for a month and patients that work with us for five years. 8, 20 It all depends, but it’s not a set program. 12, 17 All patients’ treatment plans are individualized. 9, 16 As things come up or the facts on the ground change, we change our treatment plan using the latest, best science and research to form our approaches. 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 AS: How many clients are you serving right now? 14 IM: I’m not sure. 15 That’s a good question. 6, 9 I don’t know off-hand. 13, 14, 15 We have a research assistant right now that is crunching numbers and things like that. 9, 11, 14, 16 Since we have opened it is over three hundred I would say. 12, 14, 17 AS: And that was just a few years ago? 9, 12, 20 A couple of summers ago Julie Rehovet who was the program director for the IBH [Integrated Behavioral Health] program until recently asked if I would be willing to teach a course with Dr. Willenbring. 10, 14 We taught psychopharmacology together.  They had it the next semester but it didn’t really go well. 9 The instructors didn’t really do a good job and she offered me the gig to teach that. 9, 12 I have been teaching psychopharmacology for a little while.  Like I said just recently they wanted to start teaching the synthesis seminar in client centered care—Paula DeSanto’s class. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20 I’m going to give that a go this summer and see how that goes. 6 AS: How did things resolve with your wife? 16 How did she deal with your addiction? 13 IM: It was so fucking hard. 11 I was such an asshole to her.  I really feel badly. 16 AS: You still feel badly? 9, 16 IM: I put her through the wringer. 10 She did not sign up for that.  All I could really do was work my ass off to try to repair things and make things better and be responsive. 16 I’m madly in love with her and she is the love of my life. 11, 13 AS: There must be something more there on her part too because you don’t have to stay with someone through addiction. 9 If it is your child it is one thing, but if it is your partner it is different. 13, 16, 17 There is more to you than your addiction.  IM: Thankfully. 11 She certainly could have cut me loose on numerous occasions. 9 AS: Did she find support where she needed it? 13 IM: No, not really.  She went to some Al Anon meetings and some Nar Anon meetings, but it was either WASP-y parents of folks who would talk about spending the weekend on their boat in between meetings, or she was the token wife of an addict and everyone else was there for their kids. 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19 That was really tough. 18 We have still gone back and forth on maintenance and stuff like that and it has always been an issue. 9, 15, 16, 17, 19 I got off methadone a year and a half ago, but that is always a question. 6, 9, 16, 17, 20 Is there still a part of you that has cravings? 9 Because they know now that it is really a brain thing. 13, 14, 15 It’s not some sort of depraved part of you. 17 It is an actual mechanism in your brain. 10 IM: Yeah exactly. 10 I switched to buprenorphine.  That has been really nice.  I got disillusioned going to a methadone clinic all the time.  Not because I didn’t like methadone and it wasn’t incredibly helpful. 5, 10, 12, 13 It had really minor side effects.  But the system is so over regulated. 8, 9 There are five regulatory entities that oversee methadone.  It’s insanity.  It is ghettoized.  The treatment plans you have to do are junk. 9, 16 AS: You can only get it in certain places. 11, 17 You have to come every four week and you can’t go out of town. 13, 19 Going to my primary care doctor’s office every couple of months was huge. 7, 8 AS: Could you describe your typical work day here? 19 IM: My typical work day is just back to back individual therapy sessions. 9, 12, 19 First of all we are an out of network private pay clinic. 9, 14, 16 We don’t take insurance. 6, 7 We don’t see too many people who are on Medicaid or Medical Assistance. 9 We also really don’t have too many patients that are really wealthy either.  There are a couple that I can think of whose families are very affluent.  Most of our patients are solidly middle-class working adults. 8, 20 We have some younger patients whose parents are helping them and maybe have come to Minnesota for rehab. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19 Went through the wringer a dozen times and finally found us. 18 AS: Do you have a lot of people who have been through multiple rehabs? 17, 19 IM: I want to say that is probably the majority of our patients. 13, 18 We do have a niche among patients that are on more of the mild to moderate end of the spectrum of [unclear] disease disorders. 12 They come home each night and have three or four glasses of wine and can’t stop. 9, 10, 13, 19 They feel like that is too much and they have tried to cut back and quit and have found that really difficult to do who would never in a million years leave their life for thirty days and go to an inpatient rehab program or spend five nights a week going to a three hour group or doing an IOP program. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 We have a really solid niche of patients that are working professionals, especially thirty to sixty year old women who work or have busy lives and have struggled with drinking for five, ten, or sometimes twenty years but never found a place that they felt could serve them well. 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 They will initially come in and we will develop a treatment plan which is often some combination of anti relapse medications and behavioral therapy. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 As a team we will work together and find an approach that works. 14 AS: Do people have different plans for how often they come in? 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: That too is very individualized.  IM: Completely. 19 Often times it is patient driven. 7, 14, 15, 18 If we think that they aren’t coming in enough and they are having symptoms and struggling then we will make recommendations, but it is very collaborative and patient driven. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20 If something isn’t working or they aren’t getting the support they need or are in crisis then we will refer them to Paula or a sober house and get them stabilized. 6, 9, 13 There’s noting magical about the treatment a person receives in in-patient rehab. 9, 16, 19 It is just delivered on-site. 9, 12, 13 Once people realize that it makes a lot of sense. 14, 16, 17 AS: What do you see in the future for opioid treatment? 9, 16 What do you see as the best case scenario? 9, 15 IM: Back in the seventies if you had depression you would go to your doctor and they would refer you to a psychiatrist and nobody wanted to prescribe antidepressants because they were dangerous and had a lot of side effects and there was a narrow therapeutic window. 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 If you didn’t get help from you psychiatrist then you’d be committed for six months in the state hospital and treatment was essentially fresh air and sunshine. 7, 8, 9, 13, 16 In the eighties and nineties there was the Prozac moment. 13, 15 Prozac hit the market and was the first to come of many low side-effects, well tolerated, effective antidepressant medicines. 9, 13, 19 Nowadays, if you have depression the first person you go see if your primary care doctor. 7, 9, 19 They try something and in one out of three people it works on the first try and then if it doesn’t work they try a second one and they refer you to therapy and then maybe a psychiatrist and then maybe if you’re circling the drain and doing really poorly then you’ll go to a hospital for inpatient treatment and ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] for treatment resistant depression. 9, 14, 16, 20 If you have addiction the first place you go is the hospital. 9, 11 You go to inpatient treatment for thirty days and then build out from that. 9, 16, 19 All of our treatments were all devised using samples of convenience: 6, 9, 16 those who were hospitalized in a setting who were really sick. 17 All of our treatments were developed for the sickest of the sick. 6, 9, 16 Then we say that is what addiction looks like for everybody.  That’s like looking at an asthmatic on a ventilator in the ICU and saying that’s asthma, so we need to devise all our asthma treatments using that as the model for the illness. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 Most of us are hoping to see that the first line of treatment for alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder, and hopefully eventually stimulant use disorder, as being the primary care office or clinic. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 If the initial treatments don’t work then referring for specialists. 6, 9, 16 What we need is a Prozac moment for alcohol and stimulants. 9, 13, 15 We don’t have anything that is widely adopted, easy to use, and patented so there is a big push to promote it. 8, 9, 15 We have it for opioids. 10 If primary care doctors would adopt it it could be effectively treated and managed in a primary setting with little to no stress. 7, 9, 16, 17 For alcohol use disorders we have several effective medications, but they aren’t being widely adopted partially because of the fact that there’s not a big incentive to use them. 8, 9, 10 A lot of doctors don’t know or want to find out about it. 13, 14, 15, 17 AS: They also don’t know how to deal with addiction. 13, 14, 15 It will be education and training and getting new people. 6, 10 IM: That’s what we are trying to do here as we try to spread the word about this approach. 16 Most of our patients have jobs and families.  AS: Not to mention the cost of rehab. 9, 19 There’s not just the actual monetary cost, but the cost to the family, employer, spouse, and children. 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 There are so many rings around that model that are disruptive. 15 IM: Hugely disruptive.  AS: Thank you. "
"15","Fairbanks_Adam","Kirsten Milun Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 20th, 2017 Plymouth, Minnesota Kirsten Milun-KM 9, 15 Amy Sullivan-AS AS - This is Amy Sullivan and I'm with Kirsten Milun in Plymouth at the Lunds & Byerlys at the second floor at the seating cafe area. 9, 15, 20 It is June 20th, 2017.  Thanks for coming Kirsten. 9, 15 I'm Kirsten Milun and I give my permission for you to record me. 6, 9, 15 AS - Can you start by talking about your childhood and where you grew up? 9, 10, 11 Well let's see how far back I can go. 19 I was born in Minneapolis at Swedish Hospital.  I'm going to try to condense this and give a Cliffs Notes version. 6, 16 At eight years old my parents divorced and I lived with my dad for a long time. 5, 10, 16, 20 And then I went to live with my mom in Illinois then finally lived back with my dad in Sixth Grade. 15, 19 About at that time he married a woman eight years older than I was, and they are still married actually. 5, 9, 10, 20 So that was like four years older than my brother. 5, 20 So they've been married, what, forty years. 20 AS - What year were you born? 20 KM - '63.  So I have two younger brothers, Adam and Christopher. 5, 9, 10, 14 Christopher will be forty and Adam is somewhere in his upper thirties. 9, 10 I have older siblings Steve and Heidi. 5, 20 So I would say growing up that way, gave me a sense of wanting to have a real stable childhood for my kids. 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 My parents are good people but things were complicated. 10, 16 You know, my mom, when I lived with my mom, my stepdad had abused her quite a bit and beat her. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS - Your dad did?  My step dad. 9, 12 AS - Your stepdad. 9, 12 Yeah, not my dad.  She actually went from a gentle human being, my dad; an artist, a free spirit, to someone like that because of course that's what she grew up with. 9, 10, 11 Her dad was that way. 16 So all of us, three children, the oldest ones, we really wanted a stable childhood for our kids and we didn't want to show my mom, is an alcoholic. 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 Mmm, I would call her more of a problem drinker. 6, 7, 14 Her sister, my aunt, died of alcoholism. 5, 9, 12 Literally her liver failed.  And my cousin, Michael, thirty-six, who would be my age now otherwise, his liver actually split open. 5, 10, 14, 17 I mean everyone in our family dies of alcoholism and so we really wanted to keep things to be stable. 9, 12, 13, 16, 18 I always wanted to show good like, you know, if you drink, you whisper it when they were young, and you didn't do it too excess. (4:10). 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 And just, really I kind of wanted a father who knows best...well, not really, but you know what I mean, [Jokingly] 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS - [Laughs]  KM - because it was always mother knows best. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I'm trying to skip ahead here because my kind of focus is I didn't have any dictionaries or anything like that because we had kind of a childhood that was mostly because of divorce and alcohol [sentence unclear]. 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17 Divorce isn't a problem it was how they handled the divorce.  Mom and dad were really nice to each other but it was just weird. 9, 12 And then dad marrying someone.  AS - So it got really complicated? 10 It got really complicated. 10 AS - How was it for you getting along with your new stepmother who could've been your big sister? 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 I was kind of the head of the household because my older sister wasn't quite into that. 5, 6, 9, 16, 17, 20 I was more into care-taking because I was taking care of my dad and making sure the place was always nice. 7, 11, 15, 16, 17 It's just complicated. 9, 10, 12 So she [stepmother] comes in, she would have been twenty-one. 9, 12, 13, 19 AS - You were living with your dad before he had this relationship? 6 You were kind of in charge of the house? 6, 9, 16, 17 Yes.  You know our specialties of hamburger helper and tombstone pizza [Jokingly] 13, 14, 15 AS - Yes [Laughs]  And then she came in and just as is her personality just blasted over everything. 9, 12, 16, 19 She really hasn't changed that personality at all. 16 AS - So she was twenty one when you meet her. 13 My gosh, I can't even believe that she was ever that young. 14, 15, 17 I mean that's really young. 14, 16 I just think, my gosh, that's Noah's age, my youngest child. 9, 12, 14, 17 So dad was nineteen, twenty years older. 5, 20 I probably got along best with her. 9 My brother, four years older, not so much, but we learned to live with it. 5, 12, 17, 18, 20 Of course, now it's been many, many years. 14, 20 I mean now I don't even remember hardly my parents getting married. 10, 11, 14, 15, 16 So then I got married in '86, I'm just going to jump ahead, and I'm still married. 9, 12 [Laughs].  And we've been married thirty years, thirty, thirty one years, so I've been married a long time. 20 The kids had a very stable upbringing. 9, 18 I mean Dick is just like his side of the family, everything is very stable. 9, 12, 16, 18 AS - So you did get that?  You did find that person?  Oh, yeah. 10 I should have looked for other things too, but, just saying [Jokingly] 9, 11, 12, 16 AS - [Laughs]  But you found stability KM - 9 Yeah, he was stable, and I wanted to be stable, and he was just one of those guys. 9, 12, 13, 18 So the kids' upbringing was very...  I mean we built a house in 1991 out in the country and everything was hunky-dory. 6, 9, 11, 16 So the kids were really raised, they were very lucky. 5 AS - How many kids did you have?  Three.  Amanda will be twenty nine in October.  Alex was twenty five last September if he was still alive. 9 [Unclear].  Noah just turned twenty one in November. 9, 12, 19 So I really kind of got a thrill out of being able to raise children. 14, 16, 17 I mean, I didn't realize it would turn out to be really sucky, I mean, it does. 14, 16, 19 It's not easy, you know. 13, 14, 15 It started out and Halloween I would make this special meal for them and their milk was orange and I mean, I just tried to make everything perfect. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 I really did.  [Long pause - silence] 9 The silence means Kirsten's crying. 9, 11, 15, 16 I don't mean to just randomly, it seems they just, in waves of grief, they do this. 7, 9, 12, 16, 19 AS - Yeah, well this is hard to tell this story so. 9, 11 Usually I speak a lot in crisis too so I'm kind of used to speaking, you know, but, you know. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 So kids went to Wayzata schools. 8 Everything went really well and you know the story of Alex. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS - Well I'd like for you to tell the story of Alex. 9, 10 How did that all start? 9, 11 What happened? 12, 13 What was it like when your kids started their teenage years? 9, 11, 20 What were their personalities like? 10, 16 Alex, right out of the shoot, was inquisitive, constantly making waves, you know, pushing the envelope. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS - He's the middle? 8 Yes, like he always used to tell me, ""I'm the middle child, I'm the middle child,"" and he was always, always had this shiny, like that top picture you see in the obituary. 8, 9, 10, 16, 17 AS - The letter. 19 KM - [Unclear]  He was very forgetful all the time.  Brilliant. 8 Spoke early.  Did everything early.  He's just a brilliant young kid, but, man, was he a lot of work. 8, 9, 12, 14, 17 He was a lot a lot of work. 17 He never slept much, he never took naps, whereas his older sister, at noon, she was three hours with that. 5, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20 AS - [Laughs]  Everything was predictable and all that and then came Alex and he was so forgetful that at school I talked to his first grade teachers, team teaching, and I said, you know there has to be, please work with me, this child doesn't need to but he can't remember anything. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 You know, to bring home anything. 13, 14, 15, 19 And they said, well you know we think the problem is he's so cute. 13, 14, 15 They said because he was adorable, he was gorgeous, and he just had these big long eyelashes and this big white mouth and this shock of white hair. 8, 9, 12, 16 He was so charming and he was never naughty, but man, he just. 9, 12, 15 So I'd give him a ride to school in the morning and I'd take his backpack and I'd get it ready and I'd set it in the garage and I'd say, Alexander, honey, are you forgetting anything? 6, 8, 17, 19 He'd say, no, let's go mommy. 15, 19 I said, honey, think about it, look around you, what do you have everyday? 19 AS - [Laughs]  Sure enough I'd have to drive to school leave his backpack. 6, 7, 8, 14, 19, 20 Then I'd watch him run into school, because I knew, because I'd worked it up with his teachers that we'd have to have some consequence of action. 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 Like, oh honey, I'm sorry you don't have your homework in your backpack, but now you're going to have to do it inside. 10, 14, 19 We didn't really know what to do. 13, 14, 15 It just broke my heart you know to see him running him with no fricken backpack AS - [Laughs] 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 See everyone else has a little backpack. 19 But he was that way his whole life until the day he died. 11, 16, 19 He was always like that. 16, 17 But he was very charming, entrepreneurial.  He went to the, he said I want to sell [unclear]. 7, 13 How old are your children? 14, 20 AS - Nineteen and twenty three.  Okay.  Well at that time Shinders was a big deal for boys. 8, 13 They'd go to Shinders and get baseball cards or Pokemon cards or these weird little toys that had spikes all over them. 7, 8 Alex decided he could get them in bulk. 12 I mean, this is a little kid, and Plymouth Creek, which is just this way a block, buy them in bulk and then sell them to kids for a profit. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 AS - Oh my gosh [Laughs] 17 And to neighbors AS - How old is he? 20 Grade school, so he was about third grade then, fourth grade. 8, 20 I said, you can't do that.  So he asked the principal. 10 The principal said I don't know, I think free market I would've allowed that. 13, 14, 15 So he did it and he would do it to neighbors.  He would buy baulk and he would say mommy, drive me to Shinders again. 7, 14, 15 He was just a force of nature all the time. 9, 12 Just absolutely brilliant. 8, 9 [unclear - 13:13].  Sometimes kids like that are a challenge in a lot of ways. 5, 10, 16, 17, 18 And he never stopped talking. 9, 10, 15, 20 He was a great communicator. 10, 11 In Junior High he became star student at West Junior High in Wayzata and then I don't know what happened. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Something happened. 12, 13 At the time he got to high school, 4,000 kids, and I don't what that thing was. 8 AS - 4,000 students? 9, 14 Well, in total.  AS - Wow, wow. 14 Yeah, yeah. 10 He changed and I'm not sure what changed him. 15, 16 He began instead of to always be, he was always so happy before that. 9, 16, 17 Hard, hard work, taking care of that kid. 7, 11 But always just happy. 9, 12, 16, 17 I mean, they alway used to say from, if you read his obituary, that he shimmered and he sparkled. 9, 12, 16 And he just did [crying]. 9, 11, 12 He actually had a glow about him. 10 And I'm not just saying that because my kid's dead. 9, 11, 12 Everybody knew that. 6, 12 He still had that but he had a different type of intensity. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17 So instead of getting up in the morning and watching Arthur or whatever, he was studying about what's going on in the world and, you know, what can we do, and I said, Alex, I don't know what we're going to do about _. 9, 13, 14, 15 And I didn't realize that plantation owners who now are, just, it's crazy. 9, 12, 14, 16 [Unclear - 14:30]  Alex was pretty well read. 18 And he goes, listen to this song mom, listen to this song, listen to this song, this is so interesting. 9, 15, 17, 19 It's a new rapper and he talks about the injustice of it's like [snores], I gotta go. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 You know? 13, 14, 15 And so that intensity. 13, 15 So he was kind of losing touch with people in high school because he was so intense all the time. 8, 15, 16, 17 I thought he was being, now looking back, taken over by [unclear 15:02]. 6, 11, 12, 14, 19 And he wasn't doing drugs. 14 I know it sounds like he was but he wasn't, of any kind. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 In fact, he didn't believe in smoking, drinking, or anything that would ruin his body, almost to the extreme. 6, 9, 10, 14 And he was always very politically involved. 7, 16, 17 15:34 (2 hours) 11 And I'd say well honey why don't you (unclear) and he'd go oh I'm not doing things like that. 16 So we really struggled with him and then he started to get angry. 9, 11 He seemed angry, like he just seemed overwhelmed by things he couldn't change, you know? 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And that was a marked difference.  So his dad and I, Alex wanted to go off to college. 8, 12, 13 I didn't want him to because he was so out there and he was so intense and I thought we needed to keep him around a little more even though he was way ahead academically and he could do anything. 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 I don't care how smart he is, he, for one thing, couldn't ever find his license, he couldn't ever - I mean, could you imagine a kid like that in college because they're just like [squeals]. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 Well his aunt is kind of like that. 16, 17 She is, I don't know how she did it but she pulled it together man. 13, 14, 15 He would too but his immaturity, his being a boy and they don't really, the frontal lobe isn't fully developed. 11, 16 Well, anyway, he went. 16 KM - University of South Dakota Vermillion. 13 Political Science.  He started to get into drinking a little bit I noticed. 6, 9, 11, 14 In high school he didn't care. 7, 8 He didn't even want to go out with people, he would be home with his dad and I. 13, 15, 19 We'd hear so much of ""people are idiots."" 18 It's really not like Alex.  He was also a very hard worker and all the kids have worked since they were like 14. 11 So Alex, I know as much about what happened when he got there. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 I mean, lack of access to his grades, them being over 18, he seemed to become even more intense. 6, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 AS - You had a lack of access. 6 You didn't really know what was going on. 13, 14, 15 Well, I mean, he wasn't being very forward with us. 9, 16 So he was screwing around a little bit in the beginning, how they do.  Drinking and that kind of seemed to stop. 9, 10, 16, 17, 19 But he was always entrepreneurial. 16, 17 He was always doing something to make money in addition to working a lot in school. 8, 16, 17 Then on November 8th, 2000, um.  Okay, let me back up a little bit. 19 He was very stubborn. 9 He's also very stubborn and so whenever he would get sick there I'd say, you need to go to the doctor. 9, 13, 15 I'm not a big doctor person but he wouldn't go. 8 I'd say well, Alex, you've had this sore throat forever and every time I talk to you your voice is getting more and more closed up. 10 And he says, no I'm not going to them, they're just all, you know, I don't need them to give me drugs and I can handle this, I'll do the echinacea like we always did as kids and goldenseal and whatever. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 AS - [Laughing]  KM - [Laughs]  Right, and you wonder why my kid won't go to the doctor.  It ended up we got a call at about three in the morning. 7, 12 That was during the recession.  So my husband had lost his job and insurance, so health insurance after all those years. 7, 9, 14, 15, 20 AS - Oh, yeah KM - 10 So Alex, they were gonna helicopter him to Yankton and he ended up in [unclear] so you know how sick he was, okay? 12, 13, 14, 15 So they yanked out his tonsils and he actually was very close to death because he was so sick because an antibiotic wouldn't take care of it. 6, 7, 10 And then he [unclear, 19:40].  So he was always very stubborn that way. 9, 16, 17 He didn't want the doctors dealing him drugs like that. 13, 14 Then, he was an advocate for weed. 10 We had always acted like it was no big deal, and I still think it's no big deal. 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17 I really don't.  I think medicinally it can be really good and blah, blah, blah, blah.  What we didn't know draconian (?), our kid was there. 8, 13, 14, 15 In South Dakota.  It's like Mexico.  You can see what happened to him. 12, 13 I had a hunch that he might've been selling and I just... 7, 9, 12 AS - When did you have the hunch?  Well we were visiting his dad, see this is why marriages don't stay together after something like this. 9, 12, 13 So his dad and I were with him in Vermillion and Alex goes we gotta make a stop here. 9, 10, 16 So he makes a stop and he goes behind this gas station that's closed and I was like, ""what is he doing?"" and he goes, ""why don't you let up on that kid,"" because I'm very much helicopter. 9, 10, 16, 18, 19 It was always in the kids' business. 9, 16, 17 I tried to be. 10 He was just, ""leave him alone."" 6, 9, 12 I said, ""well, what's he doing back there?"" 19 Well, sure, he was dropping off weed and whatever to a friend. 12, 14, 15 I remember him coming home from a visit and I took him by the hands and I said, Alex, run away from weed. 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 Just walk away, go the other way. 9, 16 He's just like, he always had the perfect smile, okay mom. 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17 I go I mean it Alex, I got a bad feeling. 16 Boy,  I didn't know how right I was because it was weed. 13, 14, 15 So then I got a call November 8th, 2012. 7 It was Alex.  So often things were Alex. 12, 15, 16 He goes ""mom, I'm in jail."" 15 I just remember what I was cooking and I remember how I felt. 9, 12, 17 I said, ""what do you mean? 16 how are you calling me?"" 7 We had a house phone and it was an odd number. 6, 7, 9 He said ""well, it's no big deal."" 8, 13 It was just so awful. 9, 10, 12 [makes a scream]. 16 You know, what's going on. 13, 14, 15 Then I called the bail bonds and I was going to get him out of there. 7 I don't know why but I did. 13, 14, 15 The bail bonds goes, they got your kid for drugs in the school zone and it's almost all school zone. 7, 8, 9, 14 It's almost all school zone. 8, 9 He goes, this happens all the time mam. 12 I'm a bail bondsman, this is rigged. 7 He's just like, wow, unbelievable. 9, 10, 12, 14 They had gotten his work from Belarus (?), and what they had been doing all that time is bugging kids. 15 Micing (?) kids.  AS - Kids who had other drug offenses? 14 I mean, it was a huge thing around there. 8, 16 ALex would talk about it all the time. 10 Kids were always going to the pen. 16, 17 AS - Like the penitentiary? 15 That's where Alex was.  He had a problem with the justice system and yet he's selling pot. 7, 8, 9, 12 He'd come home and he'd say, man, it is a dirty business, and these are privatized institutions. 9, 13, 19 I'm just like, well, I guess you shouldn't go there, I mean, I don't know. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I'd just get tired. 9, 12 AS - Did he stay in school? 8, 9 He was staying in school but I mean he would talk about... 8, 9, 10, 16, 19 I was hardly listening in those days because he had so many issues that needed to be addressed; world hunger, I mean, pick a problem, Alex, and then let's focus. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 But he really had a problem with the justice system because he saw so many kids going away and they were working for pennies that make Asaba Airlines (?) richer. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16 AS - And at this point, how old is he when he calls you in jail? 7, 20 When he called me in jail he had just turned 21. 7, 9, 12, 19 Because they waited until he was 21 so they could get a bigger sentence. 7, 8, 15 AS - To nab him?  Oh yeah. 10 They knew he was selling to friends, friends were selling to each other. 6, 7, 12, 18 They had been micing kids.  AS - What do you ""they"" had been micing?  The police? 7 -The police and the state, and even there it was going to be a grand jury. 7, 9, 15 The state commissioner, what do you call it? 7, 9 AS - Like an investigation? 9 State's attorney, thank you. 13 I mean, but we're finding this out later. 16 At first, I was like, what the heck, ridiculous, right? 9, 10, 14 It turned out that as we get deeper into it, at first I call Alex's other aunt who is a judge under Dayton in St. Paul. 7, 9, 19 She says to me, ""Kirsten, he's going to get a slap on the hand. 9, 15 I mean this is not good, this kid, what the hell is he doing?"" 16 Then she and her husband who is also an attorney, they read through the statutes and how things work in South Dakota. 9, 15, 16 They called and said you got to get him a lawyer and you got to get him a good one because they got him. 7 It just snowballed. 8, 9, 12, 14 It turns out as they said, they had miced him up, and all the other kids that this had happened to. 12, 13, 19 They caught a friend of his and they said if you turn somebody in, just as they asked Alex, well then we'll let you go. (26:02) 9, 10, 12, 19 Alex was a good friend and was buying weed from Alex. 7, 12 So they got him on that.  They said to Alex too, if you want to turn someone in we'll let you go too. 13, 19 Of course  Alex wouldn't do it.  His aunt said, Alex there is no honor among thieves.  He's like, Patty, these are just kids like me, people like me, and I'm not gonna do to them what they did to me. 9, 10, 12 He said, besides that, if I did turn someone in, which I wouldn't, then when I got to some type of jail, I'd really be screwed for narcing on people. 15, 19 But I'm like, what are you doing? 10 So this guy had to be convoluted when the discovery came out. 19 See now all of this is sealed to him. 14 When this discovery came out, AS - You can't access this? 6, 19 No that's all (unclear - 26:59)  AS - Okay, that's another story. 9 It turned out that they also tried to get him to sell narcotics. 7, 10, 15, 19 Alex was always anti-narcotics because they saw what it did to the kids in the town. 15, 16, 17, 19 See, I didn't know what was going on. 13, 14, 15 I didn't even know about how heroin was everywhere. 13, 14, 15 By the time  Alex died, I had no idea that he knew. 6, 11, 12 They have him on record, on mic saying, I don't do that. 6, 11 So they're really trying to set him up and trap him. 16, 17 Some kids might have said, I guess I could do that, because they're just stupid kids. 9, 10, 12 But he wasn't that stupid and he just said no. 9, 12 Just weed. 9 Anyway, they picked him up and hired an attorney, and a really good one. 12, 16 So he got picked up in November and then in April was the in front of Judge Eng.  AS - That's Glen Eng.  Yes.  Before that, we had really been doing our due diligence to have people, everybody that Alex knew, whether it was a professor, people he grew up with at church, all of his jobs, everyone. 6, 12 I mean no one could say a bad word about this guy. 16 He never had a prior, it's in the article, in his life. 11, 15, 19 So we got there and the attorney said, you know, I've worked with Eng a long time and he is a hard ass, but, you know, I think he'll be okay, you guys have written all the letters. 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 My letter was just like [makes fake scribbles while making the sound of a smothered scream] - I had every picture. 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 As a kid he never did anything to hurt, he only wanted to help people. 12, 13, 15 Yeah, he was stupid to do what he did and arrogant. 9 AS - He was selling pot. 7 That's all they caught him with.  That's all he ever did.  There's no question about that. 6, 9 So we got there and he goes, you know Alex, if I can get the transcript you'll be able to see that. 7, 13, 14, 15 He says, you know Alex, a lot of kids come here and they have nobody with them. 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 You have everybody behind you and you come from a state where they think pot should be legalized. 9, 13, 19 I don't think Minnesota ever said that.  He goes, so I'm going to send a message, Alex's aunt grabbed my leg, back to Minnesota, and I'm going to put you in the state max security penitentiary and then people were sobbing because nothing good comes from that. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 19 For a period of whatever it was, three months, I think he got a month, and then move you to another place. 8, 11 One day in there is bad enough. 19, 20 He was a good looking kid, he wasn't a very big guy, and he wasn't as tough as he thought he was, and he never really thought he was tough but... 8, 11, 12, 15, 18 And then he said you'll be on probation for five years after that. 10, 20 You can't be in a bar unless they're mostly selling food. 5, 7, 9 I mean, nothing. 16 He never had an alcohol problem except for when he had first gotten to drink, other than that he got home for Easter he'd have like a half of beer and it would sit there and get warm. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 That was my big thing is that my whole family - there are a lot of alcoholics - so I was just grateful that none of my children are alcoholics. 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 That's what I was looking for.  Alcoholism addiction.  Not the other thing.  I didn't even know about it. 13, 14, 15 And so he said, if you're so much as even with somebody who has pot or has something (unclear 30:44)... 15, 18 He says we will pick you up wherever you are and send you to the state pen for 17 year, no questions asked. 6, 9, 10, 12, 20 You'll go from that point to the pen.  Alex developed, you know. 13, 14, 15, 16 You can't live like that.  Imagine getting out of there and then always worried that, you know. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS - Within those five years you mean? 16, 20 So he developed shingles. 16 Terribly difficult. 20 It was so sad to see that little boy, he was a little boy to me, he was so bright, shiny, and loving. 12, 14 He was dressed real nice and he admitted it was wrong, it was stupid. 9, 14 If that's the law, whether you agree with it or not, you follow it. 12 That's where we brought him up. 9, 18 He's sending a message back to Minnesota. 12, 19 So they took him away and I made a big scene because I wanted to see him. 8, 12, 13, 16 They said, well, you can't see him.  He'll go to the pen.  I went crazy so they let me see him, and he comes out and his eyes, AS - You went crazy like sobbing? 13, 14, 16, 19 Crying?  Yelling?  I just said I'm going to see my kid. 9, 12 I was crying, I'm going to see my kid. 11 There was no way I wasn't going to see my kid. 16 That was not going to happen. 12 So I saw my kid.  Not his dad.  But anyway, Alex came out, his eyes were just red. 9, 12, 14, 16, 19 He was so scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 I mean imagine, at 21, you're going to go to max security. 16 He knew what happened there because he knew other people who had gone. 6, 12, 13 Yet he continued to sell crack. 7, 18 That's that frontal lobe - I'm stupid and arrogant. 9 AS - Or, I'm somehow untouchable. 15 It won't happen to me. 12 It was crazy. 16 The sentence was three months but they gave him one month. 7, 8, 15 AS - So he got out after one month. 8 He got out in July actually. 10 No, he had one month at the penn and then they moved him to a place out in Yankton. 8, 11 AS - For how many more months? 8 Until July.  So three months total. 8 The problem is, where I met him where he was detained it was like a Barney Fife jail, you know, Andy Griffith. 5, 13, 14, 15 They tried to put him in there. 10 AS - For three months! 8 Right, which would've screwed up everything.  It wouldn't have killed him but it would've messed school up, it would mess his job up, he could not pay his rent. 7, 8, 16 I get it.  Or they could put him in there and let him out. 10, 19 Or if they wanted to just put him in that little jail cell and he could just read and do push ups. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 Not a county thing but it has to be the pen. 7 Then we had to drive home from Vermillion, South Dakota, and we were, all of us, with caravan cars. 7, 14, 19 It's unspeakable, the fear and the anxiety that he must have felt. 17 As a mom, that's what you're worried about. 15 He knew what they could do to him. 6, 12 So then we're going to go to July of '13.  That's when he gets out.  He was happy to get out. 17 In the meantime, we visited him. 12, 13, 16 We couldn't visit him at the pen but we could at the other place. 11, 12, 13 He was just decidedly different. 9, 12, 16, 17 He just [silent]... 9, 12 any life that he had was just gone. 9, 11, 12, 19 He stayed there, AS - He stayed in Vermillion? 5, 9 Yeah, and so all he could do then, was work.  School was fucked, right? 14 No school. 8 So he worked, he worked 70 hours a week. 11 He worked at Polaris (?  35:00), he worked at the lumber yard.  AS - Did he want to come home? 13, 19 AS - Did he want to come back here? 13, 19 Yes.  They wouldn't let him. 19 KM - South Dakota.  AS - He couldn't come? 13, 19 Oh because he was on probation? 10 They do what they want to do. 13 He's going to live there otherwise they'd have to move the whole probation thing here. 10 So Alex had a girlfriend who has never even smoked a cigarette in fact and she was going for juvenile justice. 9, 10, 12, 15, 17 She now works here in the cities in Hopkins with Big Brothers Big Sisters as a counselor. 9, 10, 14 Anyways, they were allowed to move back when she got out of school. 8, 16, 17, 19 Then May 29th, 2015 was when they moved back to Minnesota. 8, 19 Then we could get more of an eye on what was going on. 16 Before that she would call us in December of say '14 and she'd say, gee, Alex had mono. 7 Really,  Alex had mono?  I said, well go to the doctor because he is under our insurance. 7 You don't know what happens when they go to the doctor. 12, 13, 14, 15 Then he'd just keep saying how tired he was all the time. 9, 11, 12 I'm saying, not before that, but December of '14. 11 No clue.  I'd come home on (? 36:30), and I'd say, Alex, how can you still have mono? 9, 13, 19 How can he still be tired? 9, 12 He'd say, mom, lots of people have mono for a long time. 5, 15, 17 Yeah he falls asleep all the time and he's sitting. 7, 13 I'm like that's so weird, I wonder if he has narcolepsy. 15 Remember he was having drug tests too all the time, right? 9, 14 AS - At Polaris?  No, it's part of his probation. 10 So of course he had urine tests. 9, 19 So drugs weren't part of our thought process. 11, 12, 14 Also, he didn't do drugs. 14 AS - According to your thought process. 11, 12 KM - Right.  And not until prison where there's more drugs than he knew what to do with. 6, 12, 14 We got a call one day saying you got to do something about your son. 7, 11, 19 This is Hillary.  I said, what's going on?  She said, well, they sent him home from work because he was walking around with his eyes closed and drinking out of people's Coke cans and stuff. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 19 They said, Alex, there's something with you.  There's something wrong with you.  So I set up a doctor's appointment but he wouldn't go for that. 17 He's like, mom, she's making a big deal out of it. 8, 10, 13, 15 It was just one ridiculous shit after another. 9, 12 We kinda got it down to PTSD. 16, 17 That was our focus. 15 Get him home, get him home, get him home, get him home. 19 He was so excited to come home. 13, 19 He had landed a job as the lumber yard manager at the Home Depot in Maple Grove, because he had come down to interview for it and had permission to do that. 6, 8, 13, 19 That was a good paying job. 11, 16 He said, boy, and he had a suspended sentence. 7, 12, 15, 19 So in other words if anything happened, then the sentence would go on his record. 6, 7, 12, 13, 15 If he stayed clean, then it would be suspended. 5, 9, 12, 19 Home Depot, they were glad to have him.  He had a lot of experience. 17 He was a brilliant kid. 8 He could look at the plans to a house and figure out exactly almost to the penny. 6, 9, 10, 13 But then, so they get back and he's up and ready to go. 19 I mean, they had rented a house in Medina and he's ready to go and he gets there at 6:30 in the morning or whatever time at the lumber yard in Maple Grove, and they said, well there's a problem with your background check. 6, 8, 9, 16, 19 And Alex just ""hoingggggggggg"" (? 9, 12 That really sent him I think into a tailspin. 7 So, legally, they can't even do that but we didn't even pursue that because all these problems were popping up over the summer. 15 So he got another job at Acme Tools, right away. 14, 16 Everyone in the family and all parts of the family will say that he would be the one to become this and do that, and he here's like look at me, look at what I do, I'm working for some tool place. 11, 13, 18, 19 I said, Alex, all work is good work.  You're only however old and you'll work your up and do everything fast and you can go to school. 8, 9, 20 But he had this probation thing over him all the time and remember, we didn't know it, but he was doing drugs, and that would send him for 17 years. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 So he was always like this. 16, 17 AS - Right.  Oh, we was doing them so it made him a nervous wreck. 16 That's why he was falling asleep. 7 We just didn't know it. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 It's like 10 Alex, you're good to go.  It's just, you're in Minnesota now. 9, 12, 14 AS - Yeah, everything's great honey. 11 Minnesota's great and they're not as weird as South Dakota. 11 He said, yeah but... 10 And I said, Alex, for God's sake, everything is going to be fine. 14 Yeah, unless you're doing opioids and they catch you. 10 It was the summer of just ups and downs and Hillary called me one day and said, 7, 9, 12, 19 Alex didn't go to work.  That's unheard of. 15 Alex never missed work. 15 Ever.  She said, I don't know, you better talk to him. 10, 13, 14, 15 He came over, and I said, what's going on? 19 Why are you missing work? 16 He said, mom, I just, I was just so tired. 9, 12, 15 He said I'm really having trouble sleeping. 7 And it's like, oh, well, we're already sending him to a psychologist who couldn't do anything for him. 9, 10, 12 It's like, okay, but you miss work again... 10 That guy, he's like, I know, he goes, I can't believe I didn't go to work. 10, 13, 14, 15 I said, you've never been tired. 12, 15 You wouldn't even sleep when you're alone. 7, 15 And he's just kind of looking at me like you know, I want to tell you but I can't. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 That kind of look. 16, 17 I know it now. 13, 14, 15 Now I know. 13, 14, 15 One day, I was home in the afternoon and he says, mom, I'm home early because they're re-doing the floors, can I come over? 13, 15, 19 And I'm like, sure! 10, 15 Then he's just sitting there like this [makes slumping noise with body] [silence]. 9, 12, 13, 16 I'm like dude, do you want to talk to me or do you want to talk to mom? 10, 13, 15 He's just looking at me for a long time and then he looks outside. 9, 12 He said nah, I gotta get going.  He was going to tell me.  He had a lot of time to work through what he was going to tell us. 17 He asked his dad to go on a boating trip down the river. 7, 10 He couldn't go overnight. 8, 19 Probably because he couldn't do drugs, right? 14 Dick said all day long 19 Alex was just like he wanted to say something but he never did. 9, 12, 13, 15 We heard later from Hillary because Hillary knew before we did. 6, 12, 15 So, anyway, it was just that kind of summer. 9, 12, 16, 17 We tried to do fun family things - let's go to this winery in Delano. 10, 16, 18, 19 Yet then Alex would get going on this spiral of [silence] how bad the world is. 15 Like he did when he was sober and not using, only now it was just really convoluted. 6, 9, 12, 14 We were all just like, oh my God, just want to go home. 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 He gets out of the car and he goes I'm sorry, I ruined everybody's night. 7, 10, 19 We're like, dude, you didn't. 10 I say dude because he did.  You didn't ruin everyone's night. 19 He's all teary-eyed, right? 14, 16 In a way I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy because I'm like, can you come on? 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 You know? 13, 14, 15 Can't you just find something good about the world? 9, 12, 15 He wouldn't just feel this PTSD. 9, 12, 16 We were just getting so...this is not our child. 9, 12 AS - Was he diagnosed with PTSD that you know? 13, 14, 15 I mean, we sent him to a psychologist but everything is secret. 7, 9, 16 He was of age.  We didn't go to the psychologist with him. 9 But we assumed because Alex would say things like, I wonder if the guy in prison is the guy I am. 10, 16 I said, well what does that mean Alex? 16 I said, did you have sex?  Did you have to have sex?  Because that's not uncommon.  He goes, but a lot of people did. 17 Now I don't know how to believe him because he was lying about other things. 13, 14, 15, 16 He goes it's just that I'm smarter than most. 9, 12, 20 I was able to get out of things, but I don't like the way I had to do it. 10, 16 I'm just like, it's a month. 8, 9, 10, 12 A lot can happen in a month, in a day in there. 8, 12, 17, 19 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 I mean he's spending one day there. 12, 16, 19 Much less 30 days. 19 It ruined him, of course.  It ruined him.  For whatever happened there, I don't know and we'll never know, because we never got it out. 12, 13, 14, 15 For as much as I speak in public and can write, for some reason, telling this story is so overwhelming that it's hard to string sentences together properly unless I have, you know, an agenda, notes, and an audience. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 His behavior would get more bazaar.  We had planned a family camping trip in Taylors Falls September 17th through the 19th or something like that. 8, 18 We were all really worried, what's Alex going to be like?  A month before he died. 8 But he was great. 11 I mean, he was great. 11, 16 I have pictures from that weekend. 12, 19 He was smiling.  Well, smiley-er.  We have a lot of great pictures. 11, 17 His sister has a picture from that weekend where 5, 9, 12, 19 Alex is standing on a cliff in Taylor Falls. 9, 12 He's just standing there like this [makes a pose], and he's looking up to the sky and the sun is on him and his shirt. 9, 12, 16 I mean it was a good weekend. 12, 16, 19 We all just went [must make a pose or maybe shrug] because two weeks prior to that was his 24th birthday, and he came to our house. 6, 9, 12, 16, 19 I had all of his favorite foods.  He used to be such a great guy but he [begins crying] showed up and he had really weird clothes on. 7, 9, 11, 17 It's like he had these long sleeves on, of course, you know? 13, 14, 15 It was like this weird argyle sweater, these weird pajama pants.  I mean this guy was kind of a styling kind of guy normally. 9, 16, 17 He walked in and he just had this look on his face. 9, 12, 17 He looked at me and I'm getting ribs out of the oven, and I said, hey, you didn't have to dress up for us! 13, 14 Then he got furious.  He said I told you she'd say something like that. 20 I said, Alex, I was just kidding. 9, 12 He was horrible. 17 He didn't eat his food.  He was rude.  This is not my son.  So we really thought this kid has gone off his....this kid needs Prozac or something, I don't know. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 It was just a horrible day. 9, 12, 17, 19 So a couple weeks later is when we went to Taylor Falls and that was fine. 14 So, mmm, it turns out though, I will say after the fact that Hillary knew. 6, 10, 11, 12, 19 No I better wait on that.  I'm going to mess up my story. 9 They live in this house in Medina. 6, 9 He has got a good job and she has a good job but he's often calling us saying he always wants to be with us on the weekends. 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 Probably so he won't use. 9 It's probably mostly opiates at this point. 9 I kept trying to tell his dad, you know, there's something wrong with your child. 13, 14, 15, 16 He only lives a mile and a half away in Medina. 16, 20 Why don't you go and build adirondack chairs for them? 12 He's just like, I'm not doing that, I'm not going to babysit a 23, 23 at the time, 23 year old. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 He just couldn't understand it. 9, 12, 16 I said clearly he's traumatized.  Clearly, whatever happened to him there is ruining him, you know. 12, 13, 14, 15 I saw Alex all the time.  I kept going over his finances with him and like he had this big calendar, which I still have at home put away. 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 Look it Alex, by this date, this will be paid off, because they were doing pretty good financially. 18 By this date, and by November 2nd, you'll have no more, you'll have paid ahead on this.  He would just look at me like [silent]. 9, 12 I said, well isn't that exciting?  He would just shrug his shoulders. 9, 12 I'm like, listen piss ass [hits table] 9, 10, 15, 17 I'm doing your bills with you.  Well what it was was he wanted to say I'm doing drugs and that's where my money is. 12, 13, 14 I kept saying, well, I don't understand. 9, 11, 12, 16 So he's just looking at me. 9, 12 So I did actually have November 2nd circled as that will be the end for you, that will be it. 10, 12 You won't have any school this, school that. 8 November 2nd is actually when his funeral was. 10 AS - No way. 16 Yep, and yet I have that circled and written that, you know. 13, 14, 15 That's unbelievable.  I mean, it's incredible. 12, 16 That's an aside, but.  AS - Had he asked for help with his bills? 10, 13 Groceries and stuff. 9 I was beside myself but it was always some weird story. 9, 16, 17 Well, Donny was really helping us out when this happened. 12, 13 It was just always some weird story. 9, 12, 16, 17 AS - They were always asking for something until you finally got to the point where you were like, hey, well let's sit down and figure out your bills. 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 I can help you. 13 Right, right. 14 Yet somehow, things were still weird. 9, 16 I mean, they were coming up short. 16 I just couldn't figure out what was happening but it was always, well, you know, Donny... he was getting really good it. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 So and so, John wanted this. 12, 13 Then I helped him out but he was going to pay me back. 13, 16, 19 He was like, I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today type of thing, you know? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 So then, [sighs] the final straw for me was October 22nd, I can't be sure of the date, where Alex called and he says, hey, I need to get for a part for work, can I get sixty bucks from you? 7, 9, 13, 15 I'm like, first of all, you should have sixty bucks. 9, 10 Secondly, they don't send a 23 year old or 24 year old out, they would have a company card. 7, 12, 20 You're going to buy a part? 7 AS - For the company?  AS - They don't have you ask your mom. 15 Well he goes, they probably just forgot to give me a card. 6, 7, 9, 12 I was just like okay Alex, this money thing. 9, 12 He was adamant though. 11 He goes, mom, are you gonna do this or not because I need to get over to Fleet Farm? 13, 15 I said, well how about this, I'm going to have your dad go with you and Dick's in the back going [gestures], I'm not going to Fleet Farm, I'm sick of this, sick of this crap all the time. 9, 19 He's like no, dad doesn't need to go. 13 Just tell dad to meet me at the Wells Fargo atm. 9, 13 I'm like yeah that's going to happen, right? 10, 12, 14 [Sarcastically] 7, 9 He's just like sixty bucks. 9, 12 I need sixty bucks. 13 So, I hung up the phone and I said Dick, go over to Wells Fargo and get the money and say okay, we're going to go together. 7 Dicks says okay.  He's sick of me being paranoid. 7 I'll never forgive Dick for this. 6, 15 So he comes back and I go, what? 13, 19 He goes well of course when I took the money out then he got a text on his phone that said nevermind they got someone else to get it. 7, 15 Alex is really quick, right? 14 But his dad believed it and left.  Well he didn't get the money for Alex.  AS - Oh he didn't give it to him. 6 He went up there to get the money because I wanted, I said you follow him and you go where he's going. 12, 13 AS - That's what you wanted him to do is follow him, okay. 12, 13 As soon as Dick told Alex that when they got there, 20 Alex just oh, got a text, I don't need to go, because he knew the ruse. 6, 9, 12, 13 AS - Dick told him he was going to follow him? 12, 20 Well Dick said I'm going to go with you.  Dick said if you're going to take my money I'm going to go with you. 6 Then Alex realized he can't do it. 14 All he wanted was sixty bucks to go buy. 7, 12, 13 That's all he wanted and that wasn't going to work. 12, 13 So Dick comes home and I said, well what happened? 12, 13, 19 He said, oh well, he got a text from work, he didn't have to do it.  I said, and you believed that?  Why would I not believe that?  I mean, what could be, remember he's not thinking drugs. 14, 16 I even took him down to the courthouse to get drug tested a lot. 6, 9, 14, 15, 17 Not that the government (unclear 53:00).  So, do you understand why we didn't think drugs though? 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 AS - Yeah, yeah, because they were clean. 10 Yes, he always passed his tests. 9, 16, 17 Always. 16, 17 Always. 16, 17 Opiates wasn't on our radar.  Then I call Alex and DIck's like fine, call him. 7, 14 I'm sick of this.  So I get on the phone with Alex and I sit in the car that I have now, in the garage, so people in the house can't hear me and I said, well, what's going on? 6, 7, 9, 13, 14 I said that's bullshit Alex.  I pushed him, I pushed him, I pushed him.  I had to push him a good twenty two minutes. 7 I said, you know what, I'm going to go to Acme Tools to your boss, Scott, who really, hey everyone likes Alex, and I'm going to say, tell me about that part you needed from Alex. 10, 13, 14, 15 He just sat there and when he just sat there I knew something was coming. 6, 9, 12 He could've said you go do that, everything is fine mom, but he didn't. 14, 15 I go, Alex, tell me.  Tell me!  He goes, I'm doing opioids. 10 I was relieved because I didn't know. 13, 14, 15 I just didn't want him to be bipolar. 9, 12, 13 So I thought, well opioids... you're doing what? 10, 11, 12 AS - You just didn't want him to be bipolar? 9, 12, 13 AS - Yeah you didn't want it to be a mental illness. 13, 14 When you heard that you were... 15 Right, I'm like well that, now that we can deal with. 10, 13, 14 I mean that's how I thought. 11, 12, 16 I am not kidding.  Now this is a person who grew up, I didn't have addiction issues, but I did mushrooms, I did acid, I did all the 1970s things and I lived to tell about it. 7, 14, 15, 16 The only people that did heroin was um, and not opiates, I didn't even think that would be fun, would be Janis Joplin. 15 Remember she died from it and it was just kind of a thing, like ooh, weird, heroin, for street people. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 I watched the news and I'm an informed individual but I didn't know about that. 6, 13, 14, 15, 17 So, I said, well what do you mean? 16 He goes, you know, pain pills. 13, 14, 15 I go, pain pills?  Opiates.  He goes well they had them a lot in prison. 17 There's no better place for drugs like the prison. 11, 14 Then he didn't over elaborate because I was drilling him. 14 I said, are you kidding me?  I just let him have it that night. 9, 12, 19 I wish have I wouldn't have except I was so mad.  I said, Alex, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired. 12 I was so mad at him.  I said you risk seventeen years of your life for that? 11, 20 Now that should've told me right there that's a terrible addiction, right? 14, 15, 20 But he's like, I'm so sorry mom, I'm so sorry. 10, 15 Then I calmed down and I said well.  What I should've done was picked him up and brought him to my house. 6, 9, 18 I said well right away in the morning we're going to go to the doctor. 14, 16 I said, well, opiates, how bad could it be?  Right away we're going to go to the doctor. 16 The doctor he had been going to through the summer that knew he was a heroin addict and never told us. 6, 12, 15, 20 AS - What doctor knew? 6, 12 KM - Doctor Graus AS - His physician knew? 6, 8, 12 Well, the plot thickens. 17 Remember he's over 18.  He's like so we're going to see Doctor Graus in the morning?  I said, yes! 14 We're going to go sit out there and wait. 13 We're not going to get an appointment.  He calmed down, he said I feel so much better. 16, 18 I said you know it takes a village, you know the saying Alex, we're going to make this a village problem. 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 We're going to tell your grandma and grandpa. 7 I mean, it was so hard to tell his grandpa who was so proud of him that he went to prison. 7, 11, 16 His grandpa just couldn't get his mind around it, you know? 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 So proud.  Now to tell him this, I said everyone.  Aunt Heidi, Uncle Steve and Cathy.  I said everyone.  No secrets.  Which is what I go on today. 19 There's a no secret policy.  That's what I'm trying to preach. 13, 16 He goes, yes. 14 Yes.  I really want help. 13 By that time, Dick has sauntered out to the garage and heard me talking and he's like this [poses]. 10, 12, 15 He goes I can't believe this.  I mean, I was so mad. 16 Then the next day, we got him into the doctor. 19 Dick went first and stayed with him. 5, 9 Waited for hours. 11 They did a whole thing, you know. 13, 14, 15 AS - An evaluation.  Right, an evaluation.  Dick said I'm going to work and then I could come and take over. 6, 13, 19 I figured it was all out there so I didn't need to, I didn't know there were any secrets, so I didn't go in with him the second time. 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 It was an all day thing. 19 Now I know why it was an all day thing. 13, 14, 15, 19 He was trying to get not methadone but vivitrol. 16 Alex tried to talk to me about vivitrol and now I know what it is. 10, 13, 14, 15 He goes, mom, on his own he's looking for vivitrol, vivitrol, whereas methadone of course is an opiate as well. 15 I mean everyone has their opinions. 16 Alex felt that vivitrol was a go. 17 AS - So the doctor's trying to find? 16 Apparently the doctor is trying to find it and he couldn't. 10, 16 Now I know why. 13, 14, 15 There was only ten doctors in Minnesota that could give it out. 6 So he released Alex with Xanax, and Xanax it turns out exacerbates whatever drug you're on. 14, 19 He wasn't educated enough in the drug stuff, nice guy though, to know this. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 He didn't take the twelve, the fifteen hours certificate to give out methadone. 5, 6, 10, 11 They can push pills, um, vicodin stuff like crazy, but they can't give you methadone. 6, 9, 16 So he didn't ever take us aside all summer long and say, because he also know Alex's grandparents. 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 He could've slipped us a note that said, hey, look into something else than what you're looking into, it's not PTSD. 13 But he kept it to himself.  Alex came out of there. 19 He was a little busy on his phone, obviously still looking for it. 7, 9 I just did not know what he wa talking about. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 So I said well let's get you something to eat. 19 AS - Is he in withdrawals yet? 14 Yes, he had withdrawals but he by that time was getting better. 14 I got him a malt.  Took him home, got him some epsom salts, for a nice epsom salts soak. 19 AS - Yeah [laughs] that cures everything.  Yes, it cures everything.  He seemed happy. 17, 19 Alex seemed happy. 17, 19 Maybe he thought he had gotten through the worst part of what this would be, this would be the heroin. 9, 11, 12, 15 So I said, Alex, we're going to get you in narcotics anonymous. 15 He's like, no. 10 Mom, there's nothing but druggies there. 14 That'll get you in a worst place. 9, 11 I said, whatever.  So the next day was Friday and he went to work. 19 He almost never wanted to miss work. 9, 12, 13, 15 I still have his texts, you know. 9, 13, 14, 15 He said feeling much better. 16, 18 My legs feel stronger and the diarrhea is not so bad. 9, 16 He said I'm doing pretty good. 18 I said, okay, do you want me to bring you lunch? 6, 13 Acme Tools is off of 494 in Rockford Road.  He said, sureeeee. 15 So it was raining that day, October 23rd, I mean pouring. 16, 19 So he was forced to run out of work and get into my car. 7, 11 He looked good.  He looked real good and plus he had the weight of the world off of him because no more secrets. 15, 18 Remember part of the secret is going to pen for 17 years because that's a violation of his parole. 20 He knew he was going to get through it with us I thought. 6, 11, 12 He bounded out and got into the car, and he gave me a hug, and he was a very loving person. 7 He goes, thanks mom, I love you. 13, 15 He runs up, last time I ever see him alive, right? 9, 11, 14 Runs up, turns around, you know, that kind of thing. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 So later that night Dick gave him a ride home because Alex had cracked up his car I forgot to say on October 8th. 6, 7, 19 He died on the 24th.  But on October 8th, on 116 in Corcoran, he had a telephone call and he said it because he was leaning down to get Gatorade, probably fell asleep. 7, 15 AS - Or was nodding off.  Right, right. 14 So his dad picked him up Friday night, October 23rd, from work and they had talked about heroin. 10, 11, 19 And oh oh oh, in my talk with Alex, I had asked him, when we had that big talk about him coming clean, I said have you ever tried heroin? 8, 10 I only say that because a teacher I know in Florida said heroin is really a big thing you might want to ask this kid. 8, 13, 14, 15 Alex was just like no [with emphasis]. 9, 12 I do not mess with that shit.  He said that stuff will bring you down fast. 9 I'm like oh okay. 10 So x to heroin, no heroin right? 14 I just believed it even though he lied for months about the other stuff. 8, 9, 12, 15 Then, so his dad said yeah they were talking about heroin and then Alex said, dad, people only die from heroin if they want to die from heroin. 10, 13 That's the only way you die from heroin. 16 Alex was not familiar with fentanyl or (unclear 1:03) and all that. 9 That was new in '15. 6 So when he did die his dad lived with the fact that he... 10 AS - He had just told him that that day? 9, 12, 19, 20 That night. 19 Then he died that night. 19 He told him that at 5:30 on Friday night. 19, 20 Alex thought he knew everything in the world. 6, 11, 12, 15 They had talked about opiates and heroin. 10, 11 Dad,  nobody dies if they want to die from heroin, that's what happens. 12, 13 He was so clueless because he had been doing pills and switched to heroin, well, when he moved here anyway. 8, 16 So then, I called him at 9 o'clock at night. 7, 19 I called all the family members, oh we are just so relieved it's just these opiates. 7, 9, 12, 18 God, I can't even believe it. 15 So I called him and I was real chatty. 7 His girlfriend was at work and he was distant, busy. 9, 12 He said mom, I got something cooking and I go well, you have a cellphone, they don't have words on them. 7, 15 I went on to say you know how lucky you are, you know what could have happened October 8th. 12, 13, 14, 15 Now you definitely got someone looking out for you.  He's like yeah, yeah, yeah, mom, I have to go. 10, 15 So I hung up and then sometime we believe it was about 2 in the morning, because they had a four bedroom house in Medina, and he told Hillary, I'm going to sleep upstairs because I still have the leg shakes from the withdrawal. 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 20 He didn't, she should know that, but she wasn't very tuned in. 13, 14, 15 She remembers that at 2 o'clock she heard a big boom and she sat up. 8, 15 She heard a big thump upstairs and that's when he fell. 8, 9, 15 So the next day his brother Noah who was nineteen at the time, my youngest, had to go. 5, 9, 14, 19 I was supposed to pick Alex up but I wasn't going to be home. 6, 19 I said you know what, you can pick your brother up. 5, 13, 14, 15 Here's a bunch of sweet rolls for him, and you take him to work. 6, 9 He was like, oh my God, he crashed up his car, what an idiot. 7, 10 You know that kind of thing. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Oh I know why I couldn't. 13, 14, 15 I was going to go out with a friend to the general store in Minnetonka and we were just going to have a chick thing you know. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Just drink some coffee. 6, 9, 14 So she picked me up at 9:20.  Time matters. 20 And Noah was going to pick him up right around that time. 14 So we're driving and at about 9:30, my friend remembered this. 12, 14 I had a pain that felt like someone was cutting my head off with an axe. 17 I'm like oh my God, oh my God.  She said do you want to stop? 9, 10, 13 I said, I don't know, something is just, I don't know if it's a blood clot. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 She's stopping the car, she pulled over, and then it just went away. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16 She remembered that later. 12 That's exactly the time that Noah called 911. 7, 10 Needless to say, I've gotten much more ethereal and it's actually pretty amazing. 10, 15, 18 But I know now. 13, 14, 15 But Noah, why Noah?  So he drove up apparently now we find out, and he's waiting, and he goes Hillary is cooking. 7, 10, 14, 16, 18 She's cooking Trader Joes crescents, Alex's favorite.  She says, you know what, why hasn't he come down yet? 13, 14, 15, 19 So Noah sees her run up the stairs, it's like those farmhouse stairs, and she stops. 6, 9, 10, 11 She races back down and the dog's acting funny all morning. 10, 19 She said, I think he's dead.  Noah's like, what? 10 Noah runs up stairs. 9, 11 She says all she could hear is Noah say, and it's just the worst voice, oh Alex. 9, 12 Then she went up and she said she could tell the room was vacant. 7 It was just vacant. 9, 12 Like his soul, she said she had never witnessed that. 15 She's never a big believer in souls and she said he was just an empty shell. 8, 9, 12, 15 He had rigor mortis by then and he was curled up, and he had blood out of his nose, and he was purply because all the blood. 11 You know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 So she said that Noah, and I've told this story a lot, picked him up because he didn't move, he was just like a frozen thing and just rocked him and just said I'm so sorry Alex, I'm so sorry, you were a good big brother. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17, 20 I'm so sorry the last words I said to you were fuck you, because they were. 9, 10 Noah was angry at him.  Alex had asked him to play video games and Noah just said fuck you. 9, 10, 12 He just rocked him and rocked him. 9, 12 He said they called 911 and everything went to hell then. 7 The drugs squad came. 14, 19 They tore everything apart. 20 Everybody was hysterical. 9 AS - They tore the whole house apart? 6, 9, 20 Oh yeah. 10 I mean because clearly he had needles and heroin. 13, 16 So they went all nutso about it and they're shaking her down.  She's never, seriously she's like the Virgin fricken Mary, and she's about this tall. 15 But Noah took totally over and and he said you are not to call my parents. 7, 10, 16, 17 I wasn't home. 19 He said, until Alex is gone out of here because they'll run over. 11 I couldn't have handled that.  I don't know how Noah did. 13, 14, 15 I don't know that he does. 13, 14, 15 He said and I want a chaplain. 13 AS - And I want what? 13 A chaplain of some kind. 16, 17 When they went over to tell.  He didn't know where I was but his dad was washing windows while I went out and had fun. 13, 14, 15 AS - Because this is a Saturday morning? 19 It's a Saturday morning, October 24th. 19 Now there's Dick's point of view that he sees a big red truck, should have been the chaplain, pull up, and squad cars, and Noah. 7, 8, 12 He says oh my God because Noah is just... 9, 12 AS - A square KM -  Oh my gosh. 17 There's nobody squarer in the whole world. 15 He said, what happened? 12, 13 Oh my gosh, what happened? 12, 13, 17 Did he hit somebody?  He said I was holding the stuff washing the windows and they all walk up and Dick goes, let's have it, and the police chief says you know, do you want to tell your dad something, Noah? 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 And he told him, and apparently now, he said Dick just walked around like this, just all around the yard. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 Just all around the yard forever. 9 Then he had to call me. 7 They said you have to call your wife. 7 Can you imagine having to call me? 7, 14 I had no idea. 11 I thought I just saved my son. 9, 11, 12 Oh I had taken care of that one, you know. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 So we're shopping around. 8 I had a basket of early stocking stuffers. 9 I just thought I would pick up some stuff, you know. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Her phone rings and she says, oh, okay. 7 My phone rings first and it was Dick. 7, 9 But he always butt dials, which is what he actually did. 10, 16, 17 Then when Dave called, her husband, she says they screwed it up. 7, 15 The plan was that they were supposed to say Nick needs help you gotta come home right away. 6, 13, 14, 16, 19 Nick being her son.  Then I wouldn't panic.  But she just said something bad happened to Alex. 9, 12, 13 My mouth was dry like a desert. 14 It just went [slurps]. 9, 12 AS - Immediately.  - Mhmm.  So I tried to call Dave and Dave answered, her husband. 7, 10, 12, 15 I go, what happened? 12, 13 He said I don't know but it's not good. 13, 14, 15 I think at first I was thinking drug thing and then he's going away. 9, 14, 16 Then I kept calling Dick and no one would answer which is very typical of him, and immediately, I had immediate diarrhea. 7 So I don't know, somehow we got up to her jeep. 13, 14, 15 I mean and everyone was still shopping. 9, 16 My basket dropped you know? 13, 14, 15 So we're driving, and I'm [makes clicking noises] calling, and calling, and calling. 7, 14, 16 I just wouldn't let up. 9, 12, 19 So we get about to Carlson Parkway in 494 and I hear, hello Kirsten. 9, 15, 16 I mean, that's how he said it, like, hello Newman, you know that kind of thing, you know? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I start screaming at him into the phone. 7, 9, 11 Tell me what happened! 12, 13 Tell me what happened! 12, 13 Tell me what happened! 12, 13 And he just says Noah found Alex and he has passed away. 9, 12, 16 Of course by then, I knew, I knew. 6, 12 And so, I mean, but how? 16 AS - Was Dick waiting for you to get home? 19 Do you think that's why he wasn't answering?  He was scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 AS - Yeah and he just wanted you to be there? 9, 12, 13 And the chaplain and everyone would be there.  I remember looking up at her sunroof and just screaming a blood curdling. 9, 11, 12 She grabbed me like this and she said, I remember, because she and I always thought what if one of our kids ever died, it's like our worst thing we talked about it all the time. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 I mean, oh my God, could you imagine? 14, 16 She says that's impossible it's only because we're always talking about it and they're just saying that! 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 It wasn't rational at all.  So we get there and there everybody it.  Noah grabbed my hand and I don't even remember what Dick was doing. 15 Everyone is outside.  And all my neighbors knew before I did. 6, 12 Before Dick did.  They knew in the morning. 6, 12 AS - How did they know? 13, 14, 15 Because Hillary had two jobs.  One of them was working with the kids.  The other was at the Cove in Wayzata.  And she called in in the morning and said my boyfriend died I can't come to work. 7, 12, 13, 19 Well, our neighbor's kid cousin worked there and they're like, Alex Milun died? 5 So they called everyone on the block. 7 AS - Oh my God.  KM - So they see Dick out.  AS - They see him out there washing windows and they already know? 13, 14, 15 KM - Mhmm.  Hours before.  They've known 10, 13, 14, 15 Alex since he was born.  They were hysterical and yet they knew, they said, don't say anything. 6, 9, 12 So can you imagine for their sake? 14 It was just. 9, 12 So, Noah AS - What is the Cove?  It's a restaurant on Lake Minnetonka. 7, 9, 19 So Noah grabs my hands and he holds on to them, I think it was like an hour, and he wouldn't let go. 19, 20 I mean, it was like, this is the guy who won't even touch me normally. 10, 15, 16 He just said it's true mom. 9, 12, 15 I said no it's not.  I said that for a few days. 19 Because if it was, I would've known it. 10, 13, 14, 15 Because if your kid dies, we've all heard about it, you know when your loved one dies they visit you. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS - Oh right, you wake up in the middle night. 8, 14, 19 Not me I was just [hums], getting ready, and all that time my kid's dead in a bed. 9, 12 A mile away and I had no idea. 11, 16 So I kept saying I believe that. 11 The poor chaplain.  I feel bad about it. 16 I pushed him out of the way. 16 I remember going like this, I said, excuse me. 9 I know, I mean not pushed him, AS - You just moved him out of the way KM - He looked like Father Mulcahey, that kind of chaplain. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 And then I said it all, and then when Noah said there was needles. 13 It was just a horrible thing. 9, 12, 17 We had to go find his sister Amanda. 5, 9 She wasn't talking to me. 10 She was mad at me because we had gone to something, a night together, and I had fallen asleep. 7, 19 I was so exhausted from Alex. 9 We had to go find her and she wouldn't answer.  We had to finally have her work call and say there's an emergency, you need to call your mom back. 7, 13, 15, 19 So we're all driving to her apartment at the time and she's sounding like a kitten got hit, you know. 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 We just can't believe it. 9, 12 AS - What do you mean she sounded like a kitten? 10, 15, 16 [high pitched meow] 8 She is after we told her because nobody had any idea. 11, 20 Except, I asked Hillary, I said, you know the conversation I had with Alex a couple nights before he died? 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Then I called her and I said, how long have you known? 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 And she says, only a week.  AS - No it wasn't a week.  Lover of my final child.  It turns out now that she saw pills in his ashtray in Vermillion. 14, 19 She'd always say pills. 16, 17 She'd say, what do you have those pills for?  He goes, oh a buddy of mine has a back ache. 19 She would accept it.  She also found syringes once they moved here, next to the bed. 8 And she goes, well somebody had diabetes or, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS - Oh that's what he would say to her.  KM - Syringes?  Pills?  I love her to death but I think we could have saved him had we known that she was finding pills. 10, 13, 14, 15 Then I would've stayed in Vermillion. 5, 9 I would've driven down there. 7, 14 Now that I know better, you never, never, let an addict...you bring him in and you take him home and you watch him like a hawk until you can get him help. 6, 13, 14, 15, 19 Here he was feeling real good and the last text he sent on his phone which now, remember Alex's cases, the first case was tried federally for the dealer to go to jail. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 AS - No, I didn't know that. 13, 14, 15 The first case ever in the country tried federally. 9, 10, 11, 16 So on December 21st they caught the guy because of Alex. 9 You know 13, 14, 15 Alex was very good at covering his tracks but for some reason, he left everything on his computer and on his phone, when he would normally erase things. 7, 10, 16 It's like he maybe knew he was going to die and his higher self just said, hey you gotta catch this guy. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 They were trying to identify this guy named Red and they were finally able to do it because of Alex. 5, 6, 16 They even had Alex's name all over the TV December 21st, which was two months after Alex died. 6, 8, 9, 15 Yep.  They caught him right away because of Alex. 14, 16 So Alex would've been really proud of that I have to say.  His name is Jamie McClellan and it was laced with fentanyl of course, that's why he died, it wasn't the heroin. 6, 9 He [sighs] that was on his grandma's birthday, December 21st. 7, 9, 19 So a lot of things were missed. 16, 17 AS - Where was his dealer? 13 Here in the Minneapolis area?  - Maple Grove, where they have no drug problem [sarcastic]. 9, 14 Try and speak at their high schools and they won't let you because they don't have a drug problem in Maple Grove. 8, 14, 19 Neither does Minnetonka so don't even think about going there to speak. 15 AS - Yeah, nobody from there has died.  And none of the kids there do drugs. 14 AS - And none of their alumni have.  Full of sarcasm.  [laughs]  Absolutely, I mean, I never thought you couldn't speak. 11, 12, 15, 16 I spoke at Wayzata and Eden Prairie but, and then they don't want they go, okay we'll let you do this but they don't want to advertise this very much. 13, 18, 19 Then that's when I heard that the superintendent of Minnetonka said that's not gonna happen here, so we're gonna make it happen there. 12, 15, 16 How dare he with kids dropping young people dropping like flies. 14 It's all about money.  Everything is about money.  AS - How is it about money?  Well, they can't recruit the kind of athletes they want and people don't maybe want to move into the district, right? 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 So, that's Alex's story in a short version of it. 9, 16 AS - So is this guy, Jamie McClellan, he's arrested on December 21st? 9, 19 He was arrested on December 21st and had a hearing and all that. 9, 19 It was such a strange. 7, 9 They could have put him away forever, for life, but believe it or not, you wouldn't think that's possible but even though they couldn't introduce, what was it a trial with peers, and even in front of the judge they couldn't introduce fentanyl. 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 That wasn't this long ago!  Because heroin is in and of itself deadly.  Right?  So if it was a trial you can't introduce it being fentanyl or carfentanil. 7, 9 But now you can because carfentanil, you're dead when you touch it. 7, 14, 15 So these dealers are, you know, killing off their own because there's always another one around the corner. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS - Yeah and people who use opioids want stronger stuff. 9, 10, 13 That's what I've heard. 15 They kind of flock to it. 16, 17 Well, but it almost always kills them now. 7, 9, 14, 16, 17 You don't usually get a second chance with heroin. 10, 20 So like Philip Seymour Hoffman, it finally took fentanyl to kill him. 7, 9 His was fentanyl. 9 So it hit other places before it hit here but Alex was a batch of like, a bad batch, that had come in that weekend. 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 So they were dying [repeatedly hits the table to mimic people dying] they were just dropping all over that October weekend. 9, 12, 14, 19 Red warned him, he goes, be careful it's strong stuff, it's good stuff. 7, 9 Alex's text before he picked up his drugs were, everyone knows now. 13, 14, 15 Even my girlfriend and parents. 10, 12, 16 I got to have one last high and then I'm done, done. 8, 9 The guy wrote back and he said famous last words from a junky dude. 9, 19 All of that is on Alex's phone which the defendent see (?). 7, 12 The attorneys still have it so we had hearings and all of this stuff. 9 It couldn't go to trial because, I won't name his name, but he didn't want to testify and when you're a junky and you don't want to testify, what do you do? 6, 9, 13 You do heroin and revive with narcan because then you can't be a witness. 15 He would've been the guy to absolutely without any doubt say I saw this transaction. 7, 10 Even though there isn't any doubt, you know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 AS - But did this guy get convicted?  He did, but he got 15 years instead of life. 9, 11, 20 Also, he wouldn't have.  The boy's name is Mike Evgen and he lived near us. 6 He wouldn't have lived on the street because they would have taken him out. 6, 9 This is a cartel thing this isn't like, you know. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 So he'd rather just go by and lethal injection of his own. 9, 12, 13, 19 AS - Is he still alive? 9 He is and it's amazing. 15 I don't think he knows why. 13, 14, 15 So Alex's attorney put him in prison so he could sober up and make him testify. 6, 9, 10, 16 Then, for October 8th.  So he got out on the 6th and overdosed on the 7th. 15 So I knew that wasn't going to work. 6, 12 I had told the federal prosecutor, I said I do not, because they say how do you feel about this and that? 16, 20 I said, I do not want him to be brought. 9, 13, 18 They are going to do what they do but I don't want this kid, 23, I don't want him to be a witness. 13 I just don't. 9, 12 He's an incredible junky and most all of his friends have died, and they think he just wants to die. 9, 11, 12, 13, 18 His parents were junkies too. 10, 16 AS - You think he wants to die? 11, 13 Oh yeah. 10 Everybody knows his dad. 13, 14, 15 On the news they kept saying, Alex Milun's good friend and it's just like, uh-uh, this wasn't AS - Wasn't his good friend 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 It wasn't his good friend at all. 12 It was just Mike. 9, 12 Yet Mike keeps just not dying but they have a ton of narcan, which I think another problem with this another pharmaceutical boom is narcan and they just keep reviving him and every other junky. 9, 12, 15 It's a bandaid. 15 It's another money maker. 16 Now, he's appealed in that September.  Mike's family doesn't know this because Mike had just, you know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 I think they're going to call in. 7 AS - Who has appealed?  This Jamie?  I didn't think he could when he plead.  I did not think he could do that.  I guess federally you can. 10 AS - He plead guilty?  Plea deal. 13 So he could have you know gotten 20, but he had a plea deal, 15. 13, 14, 15 Now he is appealing it.  I know they'll call in Mike because I was there in January when the judge was (unclear 1:26:48). 7, 13, 14, 15 AS - What's the county? 7 Anoka?  - Hennepin.  But he's also got charges in Anoka. 17 Murder charges. 17 I mean, this guy. 16 AS - Is that because of the dealing? 13 KM - Mhmm.  The thing is, an important thing to know is that now, the people that they're catching, 10, 13, 14, 15 Alex was the first person to be tried federally, but since then there has been others. 9, 10 These guys aren't addicts and that matters. 20 McClullen isn't an addict and neither was Colleen Ronnei.  AS - Beverly Burrell, I went to one day of her trial. 19 Okay well Colleen's a friend of mine and she's lost Luke and she is the one that was at the Eden Prairie police. 7, 9, 12 Saw that story? 9 [grunts] 11 AS - You met her after Alex passed away? 5, 16 I think it's important to note these dealers are rich. 13 They aren't addicts.  I would have a different feeling about them. 16, 17 They're just rich. 9, 12 Otherwise McClullen wouldn't have $400,000 stashed away in Plymouth in a warehouse, in a storage facility. 6, 9, 16 And Beverly she's not an addict.  Whatever her name is. 6 So the fact that they're doing this not to feed their... 10 I mean 16 Alex could have sold heroin but he didn't do it. 20 But these people aren't addicts and that's why it makes them extra dangerous. 16, 18 They're doing it and they don't care who dies. 7 Seeing McClullen stand up there and cry, and he's a big ass, tough guy. 8, 9, 12, 18 He actually said this, you know, my kids with food stamps, and we go to the gas station and buy candy there [mocks a crying voice], which I didn't even think you could do with food stamps, we had to get candy with food stamps. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 At the gas station. 9 He actually said that. 10 I wanted to be like, well how about taking some of your big stash at the time and giving them some lunch. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 This guy is just an idiot. 9, 12 Then of course you get the mother in your face screaming at you.  His mother.  AS - That happened to you? 12, 13 In federal court.  Mhmm.  They allow it.  They keep warning her. 12 You're going to have to leave. 6 It's like, no, you get one chance. 10 Then outside the courtroom in my daughter's face, ""your son, your brother, nobody told him to put that in his arm,"" you know that usual stuff. 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 It didn't bother me but it really bothered Amanda and she never went back. 12, 15, 19 So that kind of clammed her up. 16, 17 AS - How is your family now? 14, 18 KM - Screwed up.  I'm constantly doing this. 9 AS - You're talking about it. 10 Talking and writing and I even got, you know who Peter Yarrow is? 13, 14, 15 Peter, Paul, and Mary.  When Alex died, I put on one of my favorite songs of his is the Great Mandala. 10 Alex also liked Peter, Paul, and Mary because he was like his mom. 10, 15, 18 I've always really liked Peter Yarrow. 10, 16, 17, 18 So I reached out to him and he got back to me. 13, 19 He wrote me a beautiful, beautiful letter and also read about Judge Eng (drugs ruining? 6, 14, 19 1:28:00) and all that kind of stuff. 9, 16, 17 So I want him to work with me on raising, my mom says he's an old man what's he going to do? 13, 15, 20 I reached out to him because I admired him on so many levels. 12, 13, 20 I grew up harmonizing with him and I just think this song, the Great Mandala, if you tweak the words a little bit. 9, 12 If you don't know the song, look it up with he and Richie Havens. 13, 14, 15 [sings] ""take your place on the great mandala."" 6, 11 You got to listen to it. 9, 15, 17 So he has been very gracious.  Someone asked, well what do you want to happen? 10, 12, 13 Well, what I'd really like to happen is the same thing that has been done with Stand Up to Cancer. 10, 12 I want it televised, not for money. 13 I don't think Stand Up to Cancer is, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 But Stand Up to Cancer, we all know that there's cancer and funding is pretty good for cancer. 13, 14, 15, 18 They might have a problem with doing it but what about this?  Stand Up for Awareness.  No more shame.  So if you get people like Peter Yarrow because nobody knows who he is, but AS - He knows a lot of people KM - Sure, and he's a master. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20 His heart is so good.  It's always in the right place. 11, 14, 16, 17 I just think if we could get a Katy Perry or Russell Brand. 7, 9, 12 He's a recovering heroin addict.  Just say in the spotlight this is what I know and this is what I've been through. 9, 13, 14, 15 I lost a brother, I lost a friend. 5, 9, 12 Just make it, I hate to say, hip. 9, 16 I'm sorry but that's what Hollywood does. 10 They make it so it's cool to talk about things. 10, 16, 17 No more shame.  It's not to drum up money. 14 That's what I want and that's what I'm going to materialize for myself. 13 I mean, why isn't anyone really talking about it? 10, 16 I mean, you might say well I think they are because I just heard this on the Today Show. 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 AS - Well and there are so many articles in the paper now about the opioid crisis, the opioid crisis. 14 You know you're constantly hearing about it but we're not, nothing is happening around the shame and the stigma around it. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 We're just hearing about the terrible statistics. 9, 12, 15 It's like HIV.  There's really, really, really, incredible parallels around the gay community and the death and trauma that they were dealing with before anyone recognized it. 12, 13 That's so funny.  Exactly. 10 It still has a certain amount, but at that time. 9, 18 I remember.  AS - Yeah we've come so far with the gay community and education around HIV awareness. 10, 13, 19 Oh yeah. 10 Yet, as I said last August at a talk, I said, you know, Vietnam, this is killing tenfold any of the people than what happened in Vietnam. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I know that's not a very current reference but you know what I mean. 13, 14, 15, 16 I think the shame.  Also there was shame in Vietnam.  This country is founded on shame. 11, 16 I'm kind of I guess what really tuned me into the shame and the first time I realized it was shame was Channel 11, remember I did that piece on Channel 11? 9, 10, 14, 16, 17 When Lindsey Seavert called me and I was happy to talk to her. 7, 10, 17 First she messaged me. 9 First I said, oh I'd be. 9 She says oh well I just can't get anyone to talk because, well I assumed it was you know why, to be on tv, that's not easy to do. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 This aired May of '16. 12 AS - And she said she couldn't get anyone to talk? 10 Well here's why.  If this doesn't break your heart, nothing will. 18 Well we found a ton of people but they can't talk to us because we got their names from the coroner's reports on death, but they've told their families that the kid died of an aneurysm, a weird heart problem, the flu. 6, 10, 20 Everything you can think of except for that.  I said I will not let him be on the other side of the veil. 19 I've seen that since now. 14 People have died on the block that I live in.  Someone's 49 year old friend died. 12, 20 So that's older. 5, 20 Nobody knew he was an addict. 6, 12 He hit a tree out West here. 9 He was a fireman. 15 There was a ton of people at the funeral.  Somebody confided in me, his other friend Paul, and said I've known his family my whole life, I feel like they should know. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 I said I do too.  But they didn't do it at the funeral and I don't know. 13, 14, 15 So hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people and they all said it was a freak accident. 7, 12, 14 So talk about shame but to bury that many kids. 10 I know I shouldn't judge on it but I'm going to. 13, 14, 15 I can't imagine. 14 It would have been easy for me to say except for if Noah hadn't found him dead.  If most people, Colleen, Becky, find their kids themselves, or, they could have said, oh he had a heart problem we didn't know about. 13, 14, 15 It would have been very easy to do.  I can't believe that.  That's heartbreaking. 18 AS - Are you talking about their ability to speak out about it? 10 Not their ability, their shame to speak up.  Imagine lying.  AS - Oh the other people versus the women that you've met, the moms you've met. 5, 15, 18 KM - Right.  That's changing. 16, 18 That is changing. 16, 18 That's because now they're incorporating it in the obituaries. 14 AS - There are more people speaking up. 16 And that's a personal choice. 16, 17 We didn't think to put it in Alex's but we did make it part of the funeral. 10, 16 Addiction.  I think that's about the saddest thing I've ever heard. 9, 12, 15 So we continue to say that we're proud of Alex.  That article that I wrote, somebody saw it in the East Coast who runs a federal opiate symposium, and they may want me to speak there in the fall. 9, 11, 13 Any mom could do it. 15 AS - So when you talked about the article are you talking about the article to Judge Eng? 10, 11 Or are you talking about something else? 10 Yes.  The article was the newsletter. 6, 13, 19 I had to pay for that thing to be in the newspaper and I had to change the ending to make it nicer. 6, 12, 13, 16 AS - [laughs]  You can send me your original. 12 Well, it was just something to the effect of if there is a judge then you're doing great. 9, 11, 12 I'm sure the flames will be licking your ass. 15 So this little South Dakota woman said, she goes, ""this is a family paper, could you say licking his behind or backside?"" 18, 19 I'm like no I'll just change it. 9, 12, 16 It would ruin it if I said your backside. 19 You need to go after awareness first. 9, 13 Awareness and stigma and shame. 9 Then it is big pharma, because once that's talked about then the large, huge platform, then big pharma, it's so ridiculous. 8, 10, 11, 17 The common denominator between, oh kids have so many problems now, well they weren't dead in 1979. 14 Now they're dead.  Well because it's all about money.  Now we have opiate induced constipation pills. 9 Narcan too, can't leave Narcan out. 6 AS - I have a different opinion about Narcan but we can talk about that more off. 10, 16, 17 How do you feel about that? 16 Okay.  Well, obviously we do need it and we do need it in our high schools and things like that. 8, 13, 16 It can make a lot of people live. 16, 17 What I'm saying is we need it. 11, 13 We need it in gymnasiums, we need it in stores, but we don't need it pedalled. 5, 9, 13 Their foundations, what their foundation is it's hard to say, but they raised like $333,000 for Narcan and I'm saying, this is a bandaid. 5, 11, 15 This is what this country does. 11, 16 So we need Narcan but we don't need it to be a bandaid or an answer. 13, 15 We need reform. 13, 17 You can't legislate your way out of this you have to go to the people. 16 Somewhere  Alex got some of this, but they all have their hands and they're naming Amy Klobuchar.  So it's like [sighs], why Amy Klobuchar? 10 I mean, please. 16 Wellstone, he wouldn't have. 9 Sanders, you know, he wouldn't have. 13, 14, 15 So you have to go to the people like with everything.  You have to go to the people to effectively change. 16 AS - From the ground up. 8 Then, after that, prison systems. 8, 9 Just knocking them out one at a time. 9 Would I have done this if my kid hadn't died?  I got to be honest. 9 I just wouldn't. 9, 12 I don't even know if you'd be writing this. 13, 14, 15 AS - Right, you're right, I wouldn't. 14 But it's not like we're trying to be selfish because it's not like we got pancreatic cancer and I'm on a crusade to somehow, somebody, quickly, find pancreatic cancer pills for me. 9, 10, 12, 16 AS - Because it's a larger social crisis and problem.  Yes, of course.  I can't stand it. 9, 12 Every time I see a little face.  Or on Facebook the other day a grandmother posted a picture from Hibbing. 7, 9, 19 Her 14 year old grandson that had died. 7, 20 He was in the hospital.  She said, this is the last picture I'll have ever have. 9 Rock on, grandma. 7 AS - He died of?  - Opiates.  AS - Opiates?  It hit me.  Oh yeah, yeah. 10 14. AS - Yeah, I've noticed that lately.  The grandma said that he had a small amount of opiates in his system. 7, 8, 9, 18 Okay, that's not going to kill you, but whatever. 7 Without asking her son or anything she put it on Facebook, saying this kid was killed, you know. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 It was shared a billion times. 12, 18 But this is what we need. 13 This is the face.  If I could, when I went to go see Alex in the morgue, and that'll be in that piece.  Did you see the piece on Channel 11 at all?  AS - I might have a few years ago. 20 No this was just a year ago in May. 9, 12, 20 Alex died in '15.  AS - Was that when they did a whole series of stories? 9, 18 - Heroin.  AS - Oh yeah, I did see it. 10 I found you through other, through the letter. 19 I saw the letter. 19 KM - Okay.  But I almost took a picture of him and everyone went, ""No!"" because obviously I was in shock. 9 To see your child like that, and as I said in the piece, his little eyelashes were the same ones when he was a baby. 5, 16 And that haunts me, [cries], and I don't want that for anybody else because to me they're all Alex. 13 I just, I can't take it anymore. 6, 9, 12, 13 That's why doing this thing is not an option.  It often is for men, in a way. 12, 15, 16 I'm sorry to say. 10 There are few represented as [unclear 1:43:29] but most dads are absent. 7 I don't know if it's denial. 13, 14, 15 I don't know what it is. 13, 14, 15 I admire women even more than I did before. 15, 18 They're amazing. 15 It does something about our society.  They step back, they step out, and we need more dads. 9, 12, 13, 19 Remember, he's a good dad.  He's a decent person.  AS - Right and think of their privilege in our culture, if they stepped forward. 9, 12 White men, middle class to affluent white men, stepping forward about this issue. 8, 9, 12, 15, 20 They have a little more.  They don't get accused of being overly emotional. 9, 13 Oh your kid passed away so therefore you're acting emotional. 10, 13, 16 That's why she's on this new campaign. 6, 8 They don't get accused of that. 9 Or maybe it's menopause. 9 It's not your period anymore. 13 Do you still get your period? 9 I'm just like mom. 9, 12, 15 My mom's like I want my old Missy Kissy back because that's my old nickname and I'm just like, ""well she's gone, so get over it"" Many of our marriages (unclear 1:44:55) doesn't set too well when you're in the forefront. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20 We all understand, us thinking women, that everybody has a different way of grief and not everybody is going to advocate. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 I understand that, but to be like, so how did the hearing go? 9, 10, 12, 16 AS - Oh to not even be supported in that way. 15, 16 Well, like my women friends are supportive. 12, 18 AS - But I mean in your marriage. 16 After Alex died, if there was any hope. 10 Not it's just kind of disdain. 9, 12, 16, 17 I think a lot of women are feeling that when they try to get their boyfriends, husbands, ever involved. 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 Sad commentary.  I think, as I said, behind every movement that there has ever been, there has been masses of people behind it.  It's not legislation.  In this case the masses of people are dead ones.  AS - Right.  So who is going to advocate for them? 10 So we are there for our children and our children's children. 14 The madness of people not even realizing that this is all. 15 You know who you should talk to is, you know who Chris Johnson is right? 10, 13, 14, 15 AS - Yeah, I've interviewed him. 6 KM - I love him. 13 He's different. 16, 17 I love his engineered epidemic because it's true whether you want to believe it or not, that's what is going on here. 12, 13 Even when Alex tried to tell me these things, it's like, how could he know more than I did? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 Maybe I was just too... 9, 12 AS - Yeah but he wasn't telling you that he was using.  No AS - He was talking around it. 10 Around it but also about that he was writing letters about the prisons way before that. 8, 16, 19 Then when he was on probation he wanted to write more letters and I said no, no, no, no. 10, 12, 13, 19 Then he realized that would be dumb. 14 So now I'm his voice. 14 For those who can't speak anymore and yet he speaks. 13 He does speak.  So Alex has shown himself so many times. 18 AS - That's powerful, Kirsten. 9, 15 That is really powerful. 15 It's funny how you can shake your religious dogma which is what Alex did before he died. 10 He became more spiritual. 5, 19 I was always like, ""well, what do you mean you're not going to go to church on Christmas?"" because I just. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 But I realize now that he was right about all that, that kind of dogma. 10, 14, 16, 17 Who puts more shame? 10 I mean, religion is man made obviously, and that's part of the shame of everything is coming behind these man made religions. 16 That's where a lot of shame comes from. 13, 17, 19 Whether it's gay rights, it's all judgement. 14 So I'm way more spiritually connected to God than I ever was before. 16, 18 Oh yeah. 10 I mean, I get it, you know. 13, 14, 15, 16 Thank you Alex!  Although my step mom thinks I'm probably going to hell. 9, 12, 15 Probably was anyway. 16 So in a way that is something I feel on a larger scale here, not to get too esoteric, but a vibration, I'm just going to say it, raising the whole vibration of this country, this kind of thing, this kind of Trump. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 The Cheeto.  He had to get in there, he did, to change, for people to go, ""oh my God! 16 Look what happened!"" 12, 13 He had to get in there.  I'm not going to freak out about that.  We're going to make the changes and be the people we need to be to fight fights, this needs to happen because we always have another election. 12, 13, 16, 17 So this is what happens. 12 So I think that the nation, on many, many levels in the next five years is going to wake up in a way we've never seen before. 15, 16, 20 People are waking up.  I mean, they're literally waking up to what's really going on. 16 It's ugly, and it's horrible, and I won't say that I don't wail, and lately, a lot, but when you look at the bigger picture, it's an amazing thing. 8, 15, 17 It's almost beautiful. 6, 9 I mean, to be a part. 16 That's really taking yourself out of the picture and trying to look at it. 16 That's the only way you can really survive. 16 Or, you can go into your little, sit around and watch tv, and drink at night, and go to the bar. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 19 That's the story in a nutshell. 9 AS - Thank you.  You're welcome. 13, 19 Good luck editing that everyone. "

AS: First thing I need you to do is state your name and that you give me permission to record this interview. 6, 9, 13 MO: This is Michael O'Neill it is January 19th.  I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this interview. 6 AS: We're sitting in my home, 1942 Irving Avenue South. 13, 19 Also present is Zachary Mallet. 7, 19 Did I say it right? 14 ZM: Mallet. 19 AS: Sorry.  Mike we know each other and so I'm going to do my best to not presume in our conversation. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 You can tell me things you've already told me before. 16, 20 In my questions I'll make sure I do my best to make it clear for the purposes of this recording. 6, 9, 15, 16 What I do with parents is I start with their own childhood and their early adulthood and some of their early parenting experiences. 9, 10, 11, 16 I basically want you to tell me a condensed version of your life, keeping in mind where addiction or other issues you can kind of see. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 MO: I was born in Ohio in 1963.  My dad knew that Youngstown, Ohio was not going to have a future for his very large family. 6, 9, 12, 18, 19 I was the twelfth child born to Catholic parents. 10, 16 My dad just had the foresight to see there wasn't going to be a future there for his family so he took a big risk and moved to Southern California which not many people were doing at the time. 8, 9, 12, 18 A lot of people were doing it but most people were like, ""Who wants to go live in that god awful desert? 10, 11, 13, 17 There're no trees.""  I moved out there. 8 Honestly growing up in Orange County in the 1960s and 70s was dreamy. 7, 9, 14, 17 I say I grew up in sunshine.  I remember lolling around on the floor in sunny windows. 8 I had two very functional parents. 10, 16 I went to a good Catholic school which was a good experience. 8 It was also a tough experience. 18 I learned a lot about shaming. 12, 17 I learned about control that I didn't like. 10, 12, 17 I grew up with lots of brothers and sisters that I got along with well and loved dearly and did lots of things with. 5, 9, 13, 16, 17 I had lots of friends. 5, 12, 17, 18 I just had tons of friends ever since kindergarten. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 Life was pretty good. 18 It was good to be me.  I got to spend my summers at the beach and it was easy. 12, 19 I never saw anything but pretty much middle class function. 8, 15, 18, 20 There were a few kids that went to my school that definitely had more challenges than I did. 8, 10 I wasn't that tuned in on it.  There were kids that didn't want you to come over to their house. 6, 9, 13, 19 I started to notice as I got older, I have lots of older brothers and sisters up to twenty years older than me. 5, 9, 11, 17, 20 They were long gone by then.  Some of them were moving out at sixteen because of all the kids in the house. 6, 9 That my house was a refuge for a lot of my older brothers and sisters, they had friends that they were with all the time and they spent a lot of time at our house. 5, 6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20 I didn't understand. 9, 12, 16 Some of these women were like other sisters to me they were around so much. 5, 8, 9, 18 They kind of helped care for me. 7, 13, 16, 17 I didn't know that they came from really tough houses and our house was a haven. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 My mom was a gracious, giving, loving person. 11, 15 The holidays there were anywhere from forty to seventy people in our house at the holidays. 6, 9, 19 So many of them were these older teenagers who basically home wasn't a good place. 5, 7, 11, 18, 19, 20 My mom had gifts for them and she'd cook for them and she would talk to them. 10, 15 She would counsel them like a healthy adult would which they didn't have access to. 6, 14, 18 I started to become more aware of that later on and I actually really admired that. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 That people looked up to my family and that, ""You're so lucky"" and stuff. 9, 18 There was definitely a culture of drugs and alcohol in my family. 14, 18 My dad drank but not a lot. 7, 14, 17 He would drink nightly when he got home from work but he would drink a little bit and have dinner. 6, 14, 19 He'd have a drink, he'd have dinner, he would maybe have another drink after dinner maybe not, then he would read the paper and go to bed. 6, 9, 14 He ran his own business. 7, 9 My mom was a little bit of wine on a Friday night, that was about it. 15, 19 Older brothers and sisters drank a lot. 5, 7, 9, 14, 17 Some of them couldn't finish a beer if they had to in a night. 19 Others couldn't have less than ten beers.  I definitely at a young age started to see drunks in my house. 6, 9, 11, 14, 15 Either my brothers and sisters’ friends, this is the 1960s, early 70s, lots of marijuana, lots of alcohol and no doubt other stuff that was going on that I wasn't keen on or aware of at the time. 5, 9, 12, 17, 18 I became very attracted to it when I was in junior high school. 5, 8, 10, 19 I knew it was a matter of time before I was going to enter that arena. 6, 12, 20 Sneaking a drink here or there at a wedding was one thing. 6, 14 At my thirteenth birthday I smoked pot for the first time with my sister. 5, 9, 17, 19, 20 I couldn't wait for it, just couldn't wait. 9, 12 It was just kind of dark and mysterious and lovely and away I went. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 Probably the most regrettable choice of my life was using drugs and drinking alcohol when I was a teenager. 6, 11, 14, 17 I used excessively in high school. 8, 9 I smoked pot pretty much on a daily basis all throughout high school. 8, 17, 18 I drank pretty much every weekend, definitely to excess. 7, 12, 14, 18, 19 I got kicked out of high school. 8 Easily one of the smartest kids, just natural ability, things were easy for me. 9, 12, 16, 20 I could test out with “As” on everything but couldn't finish assignments, I couldn't stay in class. 9, 20 I just was bored out of my mind. 9, 12 I really wasted a lot of really good opportunities because I was way more interested in partying. 6, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 I got into the business world. 9, 15 AS: No college? 8 MO: Just a little bit of junior college. 8, 9 I liked it but I had to go make money. 10, 16, 18 It took a lot of extended focus. 12, 15, 17 Paying attention was always a challenge for me. 10, 15, 16, 17 Off I went into the business world. 9, 15 All I can say is I was lucky.  I got into cocaine way too much in my early twenties. 16, 18 I never stole or anything like that but spent too much of my own money and lied a lot about it. 9, 15, 17, 18, 19 I didn't like that I was always having to justify. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 I didn't like that. 10 My friends and I were always lying all the time about our lives. 12, 16, 17, 18 ""It was free tonight."" 19 AS: You were lying about how much money you were spending. 12, 18, 19 MO: You were stealing from yourself is what you were doing. 9, 10 AS: You would have to justify it to other people. 9, 12 MO: ""This one was free tonight because I did this deal for this guy and I helped him find some other people."" 13, 16, 19 You just knew everybody was lying and you knew you were lying and I didn't like that. 6, 9, 10, 12 Cocaine was a problem.  The real problem was the alcohol that went with the cocaine because of the high, the amphetamine high and then to neutralize. 8 I've had hangovers for like three days before from cocaine binges and the alcohol. 10, 19 I could feel my kidneys just aching. 9, 12, 16 In my mid-twenties, maybe it was my frontal cortex came along, I was twenty-three and I had a horrible experience with cocaine one weekend and I just stopped cold turkey. 9, 10, 12, 17, 19, 20 I just said, ""I'm done with that."" 9, 12 I knew enough to stay away from the people that I used with. 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 Pretty soon I was used to not doing it and I was okay. 9 I still drank alcohol but not... 7, 9, 14 It was just weird. 9, 12 My brain was changing and I was just less interested in partying like that, I just was. 6, 9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19 I was lucky because a lot of the people I grew up with are dead, are locked up, are institutionalized or basically still live at their parents’ house in their fifties. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 Their lives never changed. 15, 16 I love those guys dearly but I just knew I couldn't be around them. 6, 9, 12, 13 I got lucky.  AS: When you say the business world what were you doing? 9, 15 MO: I was doing promotional marketing.  I was going around the country and anytime a big company was going to introduce a product to the market there was a giant assault on Peoria or whatever. 8, 11, 16 Coupons, and billboards, and newspaper fliers, and coupons, and ads on TV. 5, 6, 13 We would show up with the samplers in supermarkets. 12 Sampling yogurt, or bacon, or paper towels, or Nestle Quick, in thousands and thousands of stores across the entire Midwest. 5, 9 It was fun.  AS: They would fly you here?  MO: They'd fly me there and I'd be in a market for anywhere from two weeks to six weeks at a time.  Four weeks in El Paso, Texas was the longest summer of my life. 9, 11 It was good.  I learned a lot. 12, 17 I got into that business. 9 I got into HR and I was doing training.  Part of it I really liked. 10, 18 I liked the development, people development. 10, 16, 18 Part of it I didn't like because mostly I had bosses who were just crappy. 9, 10, 12 They just weren't very good leaders at all. 9, 12 Some of them were really smart about business but that didn't really matter. 9, 20 The ones that I did like were few and far between. 10 I was kind of interested in that. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 I had a big triggering event for me. 8, 15 I hired a young woman who was really terrific, just fantastic. 9, 12, 14 I was so proud to have her come join our team. 13, 19 The day she was supposed to show up she didn't show up and I was pretty pissed. 6, 18, 19 I made a bunch of phone calls. 7, 9, 16 The next day I found out she was hit head on and was killed the week before. 7, 19 She was pacing herself to see how long it would take her to get to our office. 6 She was hit.  She was a newlywed. 6 I was devastated, just devastated. 9, 12 I didn't even really know exactly what was going on but I was bereft. 10, 13, 14, 15 Not long after that I went to the food marketing show in Chicago and I went and saw some improv theater and I thought, ""God that was awesome."" 11, 12, 20 Somebody in the group who I didn't even know, I had just met them said, ""You know what? 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 You'd probably be good at this.  You should move to Chicago.""  I'm like, ""I can't do that. 10 I'm going to be a vice president.""  I think a week later I gave a two weeks notice and I moved to Chicago and went and studied improv theater for three and a half years. 8, 9, 20 Best move I ever made in my entire life. 9, 11, 16 I moved to a big city, learned a lot about me, learned a lot about society, getting on stage doing improvisation and you will find out who you are. 8, 9, 12, 17, 20 It will tap into all of your darkest fears. 9 Seriously.  It will tear at you and you will find out how much you spend time in your head and how much you were trying to protect an image. 12, 16, 18, 19 It's an amazing equalizer. 15 I got to watch some ridiculous talent in Chicago at the time.  Amy Poehler was one of my classmates. 20 AS: Were you at Second City?  MO: Yes, I was a student at Second City. 9 Steve Carrell was one of my teachers.  I used to watch Stephen Colbert on a pretty much nightly basis. 9, 18, 19 He was a remarkable talent, not entirely brilliant but he was just so brave. 8, 9, 12 I'd just watch a person fail, and fail, and fail, and fail and then take off like a bird. 6, 9, 12 That's a rare thing.  Tina  Fey was just about a year behind me in the classes. 8, 9, 12, 20 It was an awesome group of talented people that it was great to be around, thrilling to be around. 8, 11 Artistic people and people who really gave a damn, social activism that I didn't grow up around in the very white Orange County, California. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17 I met my former wife in Chicago. 5, 17 We got married and knew we weren't going to stay in Chicago because we'd end up out in the 'burbs and we didn't want to. 6, 9, 12, 13 We moved back to Minnesota where she is from and I really liked Minnesota. 8, 10, 18, 19 In '97 we had a son.  My son Devin was born.  It was just everything I've always wanted. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 I've grown up around tons of children, nieces and nephews, and I've always enjoyed children but I knew I wasn't a very mature young adult. 6, 12, 14, 16, 17 I didn't want to get married or have kids when I was young. 13, 14 Here I was at thirty-four and I had my first child. 9 He was just delightful. 9, 12 He was just a lovely little guy. 9, 12, 13 I was just madly in love with him, we did so much stuff together. 9, 12, 13, 18 His mom was way more into labelling. 15, 16 ""He's a spirited child.""  He's just a kid you know. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He got along with everybody.  Every kid liked Devin. 10, 18 He just followed along. 9, 12 All through school every review of teachers was, ""I wish I had ten Devins in every class."" 8, 20 That being said, it's like, I wish he would say more. 10 He plays very safe.  he doesn't say much. 18 He's compliant. 8 He's a nice person.  There's no problems with him ever, at all.  He seems to hang around the good kids. 16, 19 They seemed to guide him. 19 He was kind of a follower. 12, 16, 17 Attention deficit like me, no doubt about it. 15 No hyperactivity at all. 10 He had a really hard time paying attention to just about anything. 9, 11, 12, 15, 16 He grew up in Montessori which is very self-directed.  He would find the path of least resistance constantly. 9, 14 ""Can we just go do nothing? 9, 12 Awesome.""  AS: Again today? 19 MO: They would reel him in on that.  His sister 5, 9 Anna was two and a half years younger than him. 5, 14, 20 They were super tight. 12 They did everything together.  They were just in each other's shadows. 9, 12 She adored him. 12 She wore his hand-me-down Buzz Lightyear shoes and underwear and she said, ""I'm not a gore."" 20 Girl.  ""I'm not a gore.  I'm a boy.  It's not a ja-jina, it's a peen.""  I was like, okay I've got a trans daughter or a son or whatever. 5, 7, 10 Your choice, kid that's cool 17 Those two were very tight.  She was very self-directed.  She was her own little boss.  She just knew what she wanted and she thrived in Montessori. 6, 9, 12, 13 Devin didn't.  Devin's mom, Anna's mom, Amy is her name, Amy and I are definitely two different people. 6, 15, 16, 17 Whether times were good or bad it was kind of a constant stress between us. 9, 16, 17, 18 It was hard being married. 11 We really like each other, in fact we loved each other very much but it just wasn't going to sustain. 9, 10, 12, 13, 18 We were just wired so entirely differently. 9, 12, 16, 17 In 2010 we separated and got back for a short amount of time but it just wasn't going to work. 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 I moved to Denver, Colorado to separate ourselves. 8 I knew divorce was just impending and I just wanted to get away from...I just had to go heal up for a while and get away from all this. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 I was traumatized, not that I wasn't going to be married anymore—that was actually kind of a relief. 10, 13, 16, 17 Not that she's a bad person, but it was toxic that we were together.  Just traumatized that I wasn't going to be under the same roof as my kids. 9 That was horrid.  That I wasn't going to be there with them and have dinner with them and make them breakfast. 9, 16, 18 That was terrifying to me.  Probably the biggest trauma I'd had in my life up until that point. 8, 9, 11 They were just too young. 9, 12, 14 I knew I wasn't going to make their lives more toxic by having them tolerate parents who didn't get along. 6, 10, 12, 16 AS: How old were they at that point? 20 MO: Devin was thirteen, Anna was ten.  I was in Denver, Devin just started eighth grade at the public school and his mom called me and said, “Hey are you sitting down?” 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20 I said, “I am as a matter of fact, I’m in my car. 7, 10, 20 “Devin’s been kicked out of school.” 8 “Okay.  What happened?” 12, 13 “He was selling pot from the bus.” 7, 9 Day one.  Day one of eighth grade he had marijuana and he sold some marijuana to somebody on the bus and of course thirteen year olds leak the story. 9, 20 Maybe was he fourteen by then?  Doesn’t matter. 20 He got kicked out of school. 8 They interrogated him, it was not okay the way they interrogated him. 16 It was sort of no amnesty at all, you’re out. 9, 17 AS: No tolerance. 7 This was a public school? 8 MO: It was a public school. 8 He went back to the Montessori school for eighth grade which he was miserable about. 8, 19, 20 It’s like, “You know what? 10, 13, 14, 15 You are totally in charge of this having happened.” 12, 13, 17 We tried as much as we could to talk about, and we got divorced that fall, to talk about divorce and having talked to counselors. 5, 10, 11, 18 He was pretty surly, pretty pissed off. 18 He was a pissed off eighth grader. 20 “I don’t care about the divorce. 7 It doesn’t matter. 20 It’s okay.  It’s okay.”  I figured it was a problem but he just said, “It’s okay. 9, 12, 13 It’s okay.  Just shut up. 9 Leave me alone.”  He got through eighth grade and was starting to hang out with some older guys who just were not very positive elements at all. 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 He’s always been a follower. 12, 16, 17 Groups of guys hanging out wanting to cause trouble want to find followers. 9, 12, 13, 18 They always want to build their pack. 13, 16, 17 They were just kind of lost souls, if you will. 9, 12, 16, 17 He was probably smoking cigarettes with them.  At the time, I find out later that’s when he started to actually eat OxyContin. 9, 10, 11 He was eating Oxis, occasionally.  They started out free of course. 9, 11 Smoking pot here and there but for the most part we didn’t find, he never came home drunk, we didn’t find and paraphernalia on him. 11, 14, 15, 19 We thought we were, because both his mother and I had had experience with youth drinking alcohol and using drugs that we’d for sure know. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I think he knew enough that we were savvy so he was pretty discreet about his use. 6, 9, 12, 18, 20 As far as we know no heavy use in eighth grade. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 Freshman year was pretty much just disastrous, just barely enough, path of least resistance just enough to get by. 5, 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 He swam, he was a swimmer.  Sophomore year same thing, just barely enough to get by. 5, 9, 12, 20 Interestingly enough a counselor at school, this is telling because it kind of shows up later, a counselor at his school happens to get a hold of Devin’s academics and it wasn’t his counselor, it was a different counselor. 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 I don’t know how this happened or who this guy was but he was an angel if you ask me. 12, 13, 14, 15 He said, “Hey come into my office. 13, 19 You’re actually a smart kid. 10, 20 Based on what I can see here you’re smart enough to be an AP student next year.” 9, 20 He did because his best friend is really academic, scholarly young man. 9, 12, 14 Devin says he didn’t know what that was. 13, 14, 15 “You know what? 13, 14, 15 You can be an AP student next year if you turn this around the rest of this year. 9, 19, 20 What do you want to do about that?” 13 It’s interesting all of his life we’d been saying, “You can do better. 9, 11, 19 You’re smarter than this.” 20 It’s just like Charlie Brown’s teacher, “Wamp, wamp, wamp.” 9, 12 A stranger happened to see something that he thought was promising and all of a sudden it kind of took hold and Devin worked hard that second half of his sophomore year. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 He got into AP classes his junior year. 8, 20 AS: Was he in a public school by this point? 8 MO: He’s in public school. 8 He’s in Chaska High School which at the time was huge, it hadn’t split yet.  It was an enormous high school. 8 It had lots of wealthy Chanhassen kids, farm kids from Carver County, lots of Latino kids from down by the river. 5, 17 It was a pretty diverse mix of a very very large high school where you can get lost. 8, 9, 18 You can hide out in a big school like that. 8 His junior year he was taking AP classes. 8, 20 He had to hang out with kids who were good AP students. 9, 14 He had to follow them and learn how to study and learn how to do homework and learn how to prep. 9, 12, 19 He struggled mightily with all the courses, especially the AP courses but he was passing them. 9, 20 His junior year his swimming was great. 8, 11, 20 By springtime he was really fit and I’m like, “Yay! 10, 14 We raised a good kid.” 5 We were kind of cocky about it, I was. 16, 17 AS: Are you back here at this point or are you still in Denver? 9, 19 MO: I’m living in Chaska with my fiancée Priscilla. 6, 8 She was living with me in Chaska. 6 That junior year Cilla and I got married up at Lake Superior. 8, 20 Devin was there with his sister and Cilla’s two grown children. 5, 9, 14, 17 Cilla’s two grown children and my son smoked pot that weekend up at that rented house we were at. 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 No big deal, seriously not a giant big deal that teenagers smoke a little pot. 8, 13, 15, 18 In the spring his mom found him smoking dope in the house and we confiscated some buds from him. 6, 9, 10, 15 Then all of a sudden it was interesting he started to get pretty surly. 9, 11, 13, 18, 19 A very gentle, compliant, nice young man was all of the sudden showing a nasty side of him. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14 It was uncomfortable but it was also like he was expressing himself.  He kind of wanted to create his own space and keep what was his. 12, 13, 16, 17 Basically he blamed us. 7, 17 “There was no problem until you caught me.  Everything was fine.” 14 “It was a really good springtime until you caught me.  So I’m not the problem, you’re the problem.”  Oh okay.  We started to sporadically test him and he was testing negative with urine analysis. 7, 9, 11, 19 That summer he was working at a restaurant and he really liked it. 7, 9, 10, 18, 19 They really liked him and he was making money and he was making friends at work. 10, 12, 18 His high school buddies and he was hanging out with some older kids and meeting customers. 5, 8, 9, 13, 18, 20 The diner busboy and waiter and cook and all kind of aprons at that place. 9, 11, 16, 17 It was a pretty good summer overall. 18 There were a couple things we were starting to just notice a change. 9, 11, 12, 16 He was becoming more of an adult for one thing.  There was a bit of a darkness that was starting to show up. 9, 11 It got my attention and it got his mom’s attention. 15 Sometimes it was him being sort of a brooding seventeen-year-old and other times it was weird, there was a transformation going on there. 5, 7, 17, 18, 20 I had a brand new marriage. 6, 7 We rented a beach house in California in August and the morning that we were to go I found Devin spaced out in the kitchen, no in the basement, gaming at six in the morning or five in the morning. 6, 9, 16 We had to get on a plane pretty soon. 13, 18 He was tripping really hard. 11 We didn’t know what was going on and we didn’t know if we were going to be able to get him on a plane or not. 13, 14, 15 Ultimately we found out what he did was he ate a bunch of Ambien and then if you stay awake, if you don’t fall asleep it tries to put you to sleep but if you can stay awake through that it’s like a Quaalude, you don’t fall asleep you trip. 7, 9, 10 He was tripping and he doesn’t even know how much he took. 13, 14, 15, 18 It was not a good sign at all, that he was experimenting.  The internet had loads of methodologies out there. 5 He started his senior year at Normandale [Community College]. 9, 11, 20 He was a PSEO student, is that what they call it? 7, 9 AS: Yes.  MO: He was going to start to chop away some college credits. 8, 9, 11, 12, 16 Things almost immediately got dark. 9 Things started to really get bizarre. 9, 11 He had his own car so he was commuting to school. 7, 8 It was a lot of mysterious behavior. 9, 17 Lots of, “I need to bring something to my math teacher at nine o’clock at night.” 13, 19 Really?  If he says he does, he does right? 14 His mom just got married. 9, 12, 15 So she was in a brand new marriage. 6, 7 I was in a new marriage. 6 Amy calls and says, “Hey are you sitting down?” 7, 13 Tell me what’s going on.”  “Devin’s been fired from his job.” 12, 15 “He stole five hundred dollars cash, taken it out of the till.” 6, 9, 18 AS: From the restaurant? 7, 9, 19 From the restaurant. 7, 9, 19 We called the guy who fired him. 7, 12, 15 Devin was devastated. 9 He was just demoralized. 9, 12 He was just dropping into a hole having been caught doing this. 9, 12, 14 It was interesting, the guy said, “Hey I don’t know what’s going on with him but six months ago he was our best employee and everyone loved him. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 Customers, employees, bosses. 9 Couldn’t pick a better guy.  Six months later he’s the fucking worst. 8, 9 We were ready to fire him anyway. 15, 16 He’s just awful. 9, 10, 12 This is a firable charge. 17 We could actually press charges but we’re not going to because I suspect there’s something definitely wrong with your son and you should check what’s going on.” 10, 17 As soon as I got off the phone I called my wife who was at work and I said, “Do you have cash here at the home?” 7, 19 She did, she had several hundred dollars stashed to give to her sons for birthdays and stuff. 6, 9, 19 That money was gone. 19 We started to find close to a thousand bucks had already been… 9, 11 He just said it was cigarettes and gas money which was bullshit. 9, 12 My wife works at a family practice clinic. 10, 14, 18 A physician in her clinic, Dr. Levy, is an addiction specialist. 8, 9 She was telling him about these patterns and he said that was really telling.  He asked her, “Does this guy Devin have any felonies.” 10 She said, “No, I don’t think so.  He said, “I assure you he’s engaged in felony behavior. 15 I assure you.” 15 I called Amy and told her that, Devin’s mom, we started to circle the wagons around a…we didn’t know he was a heroin addict. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 He’s a poly-user but he had started to go from eating, snorting, smoking Oxi to snorting and smoking heroin and finding out it’s cheaper and much more effective to shoot it. 9, 11, 18 He was shooting dope.  He was dealing. 13 He was dealing club drugs. 13, 14 The entire southwest metro my son was the dealer. 5, 7, 9, 13 He was the big connect for all the schools down there which was very demoralizing to me. 8 Things came to a head. 19 We really started to circle things up pretty tight on him. 9, 11, 16, 18 He was very vicious.  It was very dark because we were cutting off his…  when you cut off an addict’s supply it’s like you’re cutting off his air.  He was getting incredibly mean and really dark. 12, 16 Turns out he was terrified of the heroin but he couldn’t quit.  He tried to quit on his own. 10 He was going through horrible withdrawals and then he would go and score again. 14, 17 It got to a point where he forged a check, drove to Minneapolis to go score, he went to go just by a couple of premade syringes to kill himself. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 He was going to kill himself with heroin that night. 7, 19 He gave a couple guys a hundred bucks and those angels flew away, they just took his money and said, “We’re not going to get him anything. 7, 9, 12, 16 We’re just going to take the money for ourselves.” 6, 9, 12 They didn’t give him anything. 6 He ended up overdosing on DXM which is just over-the-counter cough medicine. 9, 12 That’s all he could get.  He was so desperate which isn’t lethal. 19 It could kill you if you took enough. 7, 20 Basically it put him into Hennepin County Medical Center, he was in the emergency department for overnight and then spent four days in the ICU. 7, 8, 10, 19 We were just devastated that our son was as sick as he was. 9, 12 AS: He had done cough syrup but he was also in withdrawal. 14 MO: Oh yeah. 10 AS: So he was in opioid withdrawal. 14 MO: He was in opioid withdrawal and then took all this over-the-counter DXM which really messes with your blood pressure. 11, 14, 15 He was in Hennepin County Medical Center and circling the drain but mostly terrified, mostly so scared, very very sad. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14 AS: When was this Mike?  MO: This was November of 2015.  We got him into Hazelden.  He did the outpatient. 9 You’re under the illusion that twenty-eight days sleep is going to shine him up and take some of the dents out and he’s coming home. 6, 7, 19 He was just clean, that’s really all he was. 9, 12 He was surly.  The Twelve Step didn’t mean anything. 16 Instantly right off the bat he was saying, “I’m just going to go back to smoking pot and drinking because that was fine. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19 That’s not a problem.  I’m just not going to do heroin anymore.” 9, 12, 13 “You can’t do that now.” 14 I’ll be fine. 14 Just leave me alone.” 6, 9 Happened to find out that this was where the anger really started to come up, he was dealing directly with gangs in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Russians and Latin Boys. 8, 9, 11, 13, 19 He had carried a series of weapons, one, two, three pistols including a cop killer, including a forty-five with cop killer rounds. 7, 8, 9 Those rounds would go right through a vest. 8, 9, 14 Found out that he’s been shot at, found out that he has shot at people. 15 He was hanging out with the gang and he threw a pistol out the window. 9, 15, 18 He fired some rounds at boys who were in a neighborhood, in a neighborhood! 8, 12, 15 He robbed a person at gunpoint.  He robbed a couple people on the street at gunpoint. 9 AS: When did you find all this out?  MO: Just found out about all that from debriefing and Hazelden. 9 He was still a minor so we had access to his interview records and stuff. 6, 7, 9 AS: He was seventeen? 15 MO: He was seventeen. 15 He was seventeen doing horrid felonies at great risk to kill himself and kill other people. 7, 11, 15 That’s when my rage really came up. 19 I was just unbelievably distraught that my gentle son who basically had to quit football in seventh grade because he couldn’t hit a guy—it wasn’t him. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 20 That’s why he switched to swimming.  He’s just such a gentle soul and here he is doing very dangerous drugs and making life very risky for other people. 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 I was just really distraught. 9, 12 Along the way I knew and I remember hearing something at Hazelden at the family program about find a family program. 6, 12, 16, 18 Find a NarAnon or an AlAnon therapy group.  I knew enough about recovery because two of my brothers, two of my oldest brothers, had been in recovery at that time for almost fifty years in AA. 5, 6, 9, 12, 20 I had lost a sister, one of my sisters. 5, 9 This year will be ten years. 20 Dead from alcoholism. 12 Zero treatment just drank herself to death. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 I knew that I needed help because I was in so much torment between sadness, anger, sitting on top enormous fear, a brand new marriage, a daughter the good kid, the proverbial good kid, who was getting ignored, the stress between Devin’s mother and I. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 18 She found an AlAnon meeting and I found a NarAnon meeting. 13 Learning almost immediately, one of my friends came up to me, one of the dads, and said, “This is going to unfold for a very long time.” 9, 12, 18, 19, 20 Which was stunning to me, it hurt because I knew he was telling the truth because his own child had been in addiction for a number of years. 6, 9, 12, 20 I started to get better at accepting the brutal reality. 9, 11 Having people say things like, “Hey the good news is he’s young. 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 It sounds like you caught it early, that’s great.” 10, 11, 16 The challenge is he’s young. 10, 14 They think can outsmart this brutal disease, their healthy, their bodies are fairly healthy and they can bounce back from drug trauma. 14, 18, 19, 20 You’re kind of like, you know it’s tough. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 One of my friends told me the anger that I had about the terrible violent violations that were going on, “Use that energy when you go to set boundaries. 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 Don’t bring the energy to the meeting but bring that energy like here’s why it’s important that we set these boundaries.” 13, 17 So I started to find out very quickly that this wasn’t a problem that was going to get solved, very quickly. 9, 11 Nobody was there to tell me what to do.  I just showed up and kind of just shut up and listened, feel safe and having a safe place to tell your story and what it’s like to feel like this in learning from other people who have been doing this awhile that there are ways to navigate this. 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 This was really important to find out.  I wanted to fix it and it wasn’t going to get fixed. 12, 13, 16 Having another dad walk up to me and telling me that relapse is predictable in young addicts, it’s extremely predictable. 12, 14, 18 Most addicts do relapse after treatment number one, especially young addicts. 9, 14, 16, 18, 20 You have an opportunity to prepare for what you’re going to say, how you’re going to stand, your tone, everything. 9, 12 What he said was, “Don’t do what I did.”  He blasted his son when he relapsed and he made it worse. 9, 16, 18 Just other things I learned along the way was, for me, again everything I learned there I just stole shamelessly from other people what they said. 9, 12, 16, 17, 18 Not the first time I heard it, a lot of times it took a couple times to hear it. 9, 15, 17, 18 AS: It’s not stealing. 9, 10 MO: It’s borrowing shamelessly.  Shameless borrowing.  AS: That’s the whole point.  MO: Exactly. 10 I’d hear something ten times and on the eleventh time it would crystallize. 9, 15, 18 Of course you plan and you go deal with this, the enemy always gets to vote. 13, 16, 17 You would start to learn very quickly that you have to learn how to be resilient and not go off. 9, 11, 12 One of the things I noticed when I was interacting with this addict and he was now sober but he was not in recovery. 6, 10, 14, 16 I was more scared of me than him. 5, 7, 11, 12 I was so awful in how I would interact with him and he wasn’t doing what I expected. 10 AS: Can you back up a little bit and talk about how you approached fathering. 5, 10, 19 We don’t say fathering very often but how you approached it and then what his addiction changed in you and how that rage kind of manifested? 5, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 I don’t have the sense that you were an overbearing and unreasonably demanding father. 5, 17 If you could just talk about what kind of a father were you? 5, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 Where did that rage come from? 13, 19 MO: Mostly I’m a pretty gentle soul. 9, 11, 18 I’m a bleeding heart.  I like to have lots of experience but I don’t like to ruffle things too much, maybe. 5, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18 Some people would say I’m very much a ruffler. 18 I kind of say what’s on my mind. 16, 17 Living in Chicago changed my heart, changed my mind about the way I saw the world. 15, 16 Life wasn’t lily white Orange County; it was challenging, it was troubling, it was a lot of people. 7, 17 I had enormous exposure to the gay community and to Jewish people and people from all ethnicities. 14, 15 It started to really change the way I saw the world and how I wanted to be in the world and of course how I wanted to influence my children. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I had no belief that I was going to affect how they saw the world. 15 They’re going to choose it for themselves.  I grew up with pretty conservative parents who probably, my dad definitely wanted me to be like him which never worked for me. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 With my children I definitely had a very experiential, way way way less about stuff and way more about experiences. 9, 14, 16 Kind of like the Canadian model or the European model. 8, 15 I’d rather that they do things than have things. 16 I was definitely outspoken politically, talk about how it’s not okay to not treat people okay. 7, 10, 16, 19 We grew up in very white, my children grew up in very white Carver County and Chaska. 14 Extremely Christian, extremely white, extremely conservative. 8, 9 I likened us to being blue eggs in a very red nest. 9, 10, 12 There weren’t a lot of us out there. 17 I would challenge some of the norms out there in thinking. 10 My children saw the city a lot. 14, 17, 20 We went in to the city a lot. 17, 20 Including walking around and seeing things like homeless people and people who were acting completely bizarre on the street. 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 19 I was like, “I’m not there to judge those people. 10 That’s a person who has problems.  That’s a person who needs help. 13 That can happen to anybody.” 12 I didn’t want to shelter them from the way the world is or the way the world was. 13, 15, 16 I really wanted them to see the world and not have to go to a Minnesota school and marry somebody just like you and live in a neighborhood like this. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 God forbid you would do that.  The reason I liked living out here was there was just a lot of open space. 6, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18 That was the experiential part.  I couldn’t care less about the neighborhood but I loved the trails and the open space and just lots of nature and water and cool places to be with my kids. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17 For the most part I’d try to be as conversational as possible, not too punitive. 12, 16 Time outs, there were times when those freaking spaced out little kids needed a time out more for me or for their mom than for them. 13, 15, 18 AS: That’s what I used to say. 9 MO: They grew up in Montessori.  If you turn their room into a cell they’re not going to like going into their room. 7, 19 If you get punished in your room you’re not going to have a lot of joy in your room. 7, 17 I grew up in parochial school where you were basically told you were a filthy, awful sinner and you weren’t to be trusted so good luck. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 20 Montessori was like, “Why don’t we give them one hundred percent trust? 6, 9, 10 Trust them one hundred percent at the beginning and then they get to demonstrate whether they can keep the trust. 9, 12 To the extent that they violate it we reel them in. 15 There’s a consequence for violating the trust but we start to give them opportunities to reel the slack back.” 6, 9, 11, 19 Some parents out there in Carver County were like, “No way!” 10, 16 I’m like, “Yes way. 10, 16 That’s exactly how I think you should treat people, trust them. 9, 10, 16 Trust them and if they don’t present that they’re trustworthy then you have to keep them close, then they have to start to show up differently. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 I want them to learn that early on.” 12, 13 That was really my methodology. 5 I spoke very openly, before my son and daughter were even ten we were talking about drugs and alcohol. 5, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19 I talked about the disease in my family. 10, 11, 18 I talked about my own experience and I talked about my own regrets. 10, 11 I knew enough about brain science that their little brains, if they can get through their teen years without experimenting, especially any sort of heavy use the likelihood of addiction drops dramatically. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20 Addiction is a really tough illness. 14, 18 I said, “Your Aunt Eileen is dead now. 14 Those people downtown, they started early. 9, 11, 19 I started early and I wish I wouldn’t have.” 9, 11 I was really transparent about my own use. 7, 9, 10, 16 I probably sounded like Charlie Brown’s teacher to my son as he started to get older. 5, 9, 10, 11, 20 “I’ll be fine. 14 I’m just going to experiment. 9, 12 I’ll be fine.” 14 I was angry about that, that he went as far as he did even though I told them about it. 15, 20 Somehow that made it a pact. 10, 16 My wife now, Cilla, she’s like, “That doesn’t mean shit coming from a parent.” 10, 14, 16 It really doesn’t.  A teacher would have way more impact, a physician could have way more impact than your actual parent. 8, 10, 16 You mean well, you intend well that doesn’t mean you have influence over their lives. 12, 15, 16, 20 You have an enormous amount but the stuff you really want to have it’s so hollow. 9, 13, 18 Right?  “You could do better; you could do better.”  Then some counselor comes in and says, “You could do better” and all of a sudden he did better. 10, 13, 19 Kind of humbling.  AS: Can you describe a moment where you felt like you were kind of out of your body with your anger? 13, 15, 16, 17 I feel like there’s a point for a parent where we just can’t take in what’s actually happening and how we respond to that I think says a lot about addiction. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 MO: The combination of the violence and the potential violence and the weapons and dealing. 13, 15 I knew there were probably parents who would gladly, if they could have, they would have shot my son right in the head. 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 If they would have known that he was the one who got drugs into their little kid’s hand they would have shot him right in the head. 10, 13, 14, 15 Part of me couldn’t argue with that as a parent. 10, 16 That was the stuff that really like, “I thought you knew better. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 We’re gentle people. 11 We move away from fights.” 16 I didn’t watch football. 8 I grew up watching football but it got to a point where I’m like, “This is so stupid. 8, 9, 10 This is just such a stupid waste of time.” 9, 12 Fairly passive people.  For him to engage in stuff with such ease it seems like, there was a lot of identity stuff that went on for him. 9, 10, 16, 17, 19 Where he wasn’t a star athlete or a star scholar. 9, 19 In his interviews he said, “Basically I became one of those drug people who get things for you.” 5, 6, 7, 14, 16, 19 That was a power, there was an identity that he really relished that he was seen as the guy to go to. 15 That was the value that he brought. 9, 18 At that age it makes sense. 16, 17 I’m not going to argue with his logic.  It made sense for him to do what he did because it gave him an identity that he couldn’t achieve through other methods. 5, 16, 17 Really just absolutely inside out challenged that he could have done that. 9, 10, 12 I was at the point, I’ve said this a lot and I’ll say it again, you get to the point where I would choose to have him die than to kill somebody. 7, 17 I choose to have him die than to harm somebody irreparably.  Than to have those parents standing in my driveway threatening me or screaming at me because my son drunk or high either ODed with somebody or he drove over them drunk. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 I got to that point.  I felt horrible feeling that and saying that. 11, 16, 17 It was interesting having other parents go, “Oh yeah. 9, 10, 16, 19 Totally identify with that.  I don’t like it but I totally identify that feeling where your own child you’d be better off if they were dead and not harming.” 10, 16, 17 I started to really wrestle with that kind of stuff. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 That identity of I’m the dad, he’s my child.  When I went through divorce, identity is powerful stuff. 9, 15 My wife, my house, my children. 6, 9, 14 I really struggled with it through addiction that one of my fellow parents is like, “She’s an adult I birthed a long time ago. 9, 10, 15, 16 I try not to refer to her as my daughter, as my kid anymore because it’s too hard.” 5, 11, 13, 16 Your daughter? 5 MO: No this was one of our friends of NarAnon. 12, 18 That I have to start to separate from this parental thought that this is a little kid that needs me. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 That will pin you and put you into such great sadness and such confusion. 10, 11, 12 I remember what it’s like, my parents, I don’t need you to do those things anymore. 10, 13, 16 I did actually. 10 I didn’t think I did.  It was important that I started to establish some of my own space. 9, 11 When he was sober, he was sober ninety days at Hazelden not for twenty-eight. 6, 19 Almost ninety days and then off to sober living. 6, 9, 19 He was just sober; he wasn’t in any kind of recovery at all. 6, 9, 12, 16, 17 Sober’s tough and it’s so dangerous. 18 The way I liken it is you’re just standing on the edge. 9, 10, 12, 16 You can step off, one bad thing can happen and you can step off or your close to the edge and ultimately there’s prelapse. 9, 12, 18 You don’t just relapse. 9, 12, 18 Generally, people it’s planned.  They just walk over to the edge and they just wait for the trigger to happen or that moment or that safe space and they’re going to use again. 9, 12, 13, 15 Sober definitely wasn’t, I knew it was dangerous. 6, 12, 18 He had no idea what recovery was and no interest in going through the vulnerability of sitting in meetings and telling the truth. 9, 11, 13, 19 Basically it’s you’re going to strip naked in front of everybody and you’re going to do some spins and some yoga in front of them. 7, 9 Seriously, I’m sure he thought, “If that was an option I would have done that instead, naked yoga in front of everybody rather than telling the truth that I’m a fucked up person. 9, 11, 12, 15 I’m confused, I’m sad, I’m angry, I want to kill myself, I want to be a better person.” 7, 9, 12, 13 That’s really hard especially for a fairly stoic seventeen-year-old who’s got a lot of image to protect. 9, 11, 17, 20 Part of me got it and part of me was so frustrated that he was doing nothing about it but he was sober. 6, 9, 12 He had a sober summer back at his mom’s house, his mom’s house and my house. 6, 9, 15, 19 He worked temp work and he was sober and we had him pee in a cup. 6 He got into Step Up at Augsburg, the sober college program at Augsburg which is renowned. 6, 8, 14 They have administrators come from all over the country and actually from overseas to say, “What are you doing and how are you doing it because we’re interested in creating something similar at our university.” 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19 I’m going to go back in time for a second. 19, 20 Christmas, I think he was about three and a half years old, budgets and I don’t want my kids to have a lot of stuff I want them to get things that are necessary and fun but let’s have experience. 9, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I’d rather go sledding on Christmas than sit around opening gifts. 8, 9, 13, 17 Amy’s parents are well to do and he’s their first grandchild and they can do whatever the hell they want. 7, 9, 10, 13, 16 So they brought over a barrel of gifts. 5, 9, 18 He was excited about these gifts under the tree and then Christmas Eve there’s an enormous amount of gifts and they’re all his to go through. 9, 18 I’m sitting there probably having a beer, watching my son open gifts. 13, 17 He would rip open the gift and then get the box open, we’d maybe have to cut a little bit of tape, we’d open up and he’d look at what it was with these wild eyes and then it’d fade and he would just throw it to the side and he’d go to the next one. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 It was the same every time, wild eyed, ripping things open. 16, 17 He’d see it and then it would just fade and he’d go to the next one. 9, 12 I just sat there thinking, “Oh fuck. 9, 12 I’ve seen guys smoking crack cocaine and it’s the exact same body language.” 10, 13 AS: You thought that when he was three and a half? 11, 12, 20 MO: Yes.  It hit me like a bolt.  I talked to his mom about it later, “He was just excited.” 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 “I know he was excited.” 13, 14, 15 I didn’t really dwell on it but I never forgot that. 15 That what I saw was exactly what I’ve seen people smoking crack cocaine do. 10 It’s never enough and they just keep going. 9, 12, 15, 20 It was chilling.  I went, “Oh my gosh. 17 He’s got the chip.”  AS: So he’s at Step Up.  He’s at Step Up and we’re at orientation and there was a student panel that got up there. 9 It was great. 11 One kid’s like, “Hey. 10 Ten schools 8 I think I dropped out of. 14 Pretty much I was planning where I was going to do suicide and how was I going to get it done because I’m an addict and every time I go to college there’s just drugs and alcohol everywhere and I’m a fuck up. 8, 9, 12, 14, 18 I found this school and I’m like ‘Okay whatever I’m desperate. 8 I don’t care anymore.’ 7, 13 I got to Step Up.”  He has a 3.9 now, engineering. 14 He’s like, “I love my life. 10, 11, 13 I love my smart brain. 13, 20 I love recovery. 13 This is so awesome.”  Everybody is just like, “Yes! 9, 10, 12 My kid’s going here.”  AS: They found their poster child. 9 MO: Yes.  Another student got up there and said, “So people will want to know what do we do when we’re not students? 9, 13, 14, 15 Most students when they’re not students they are partiers. 9, 14 Here’s what we do we go bowling, we go clean graffiti off walls, nasty graffiti not the art stuff, we go read to the Somali kids. 9, 14 They read English to the Somali kids and they read English back to us. 19 We do yoga, we go to the gym, we go to meetings, we scoop food, we bring coats to homeless people. 13, 19 We’ve got so many things you can do and we do it in groups. 16 I’m like, “Yes! 10 Great!”  Then this young lady said, “So here’s what happens every year. 12, 14, 20 There are going to be some of the students who are like, ‘This is so stupid.’ 9, 14 They’re not in to recovery.  They’re not into service work.  They’re not into helping people. 13 They’re just very selfish and miserable. 9, 12 They’re going to try to recruit and find other people who think this is stupid.” 9, 16 Amy, Devin’s mom and I, look at each other like… 15 Sure enough that’s who he hung out with. 20 He was smoking cigarettes and hanging out under the bridge with kids who just were sober Step Up students. 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 It wasn’t in our control. 17 I’d learned enough at this point. 12, 17, 20 There’s nothing I could do about that but hope he’s doing okay. 10 Pretty soon his grades started to get dodgy. 9, 11, 20 There were some gaps in some of his stories. 9, 18 AS: This is just the first semester? 9, 12 MO: First semester. 9 He started in September in October one of his best buddies that he hung out with, this kid relapsed on a Monday night. 9, 11, 18, 19 He went and used on a Monday night. 9, 19 He got kicked out of Step Up but was still an Augsburg student. 9 On Wednesday another one of these Step Up students used with that kid who just relapsed. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 Now that kid’s been kicked out of Step Up.  Then we called Devin or sent him a text that said, “Stay the fuck away from Michael. 7, 16 Stay away from him. 16 He is so dangerous right now.” “I’m fine. 14, 18 I’m fine. 14 It’s cool. 17 No problem, no problem.”  On Friday night Devin used with Michael. 9, 19 They used synthetic Xanax from China. 9 Just lab pills that they bought online. 6, 7, 9 The kid that he was with, Michael, he flatlined at Hennepin County Medical Center. 6 He overdosed. 15 Devin only took a half of dose but had a pretty bad night. 18, 19, 20 He prelapsed and then he relapsed and he was kicked out of Step Up. 18 AS: Did Michael live?  MO: Michael lived and just basically went—he’s still an Augsburg student. 7, 9, 11, 12 Just back to school, just living in the dorms, “I’m fine.” 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 19 He’d been through a lot of trauma in his life. 11, 17 His mother died when he was young and his dad’s a high powered downtown workaholic attorney. 8, 12, 14, 15, 19 Michael was just kind of a problem. 9, 12, 16, 17 Devin was now commuting from his mom’s house and my house and enormous stress as he is now a college student at Augsburg. 6, 8, 9, 14, 15 Academics were just falling apart all around him. 9, 12, 20 Then he disappeared on a Wednesday night in October. 12, 19 No, no in November.  It was early November.  He disappeared and he went off and we found out through phone records that he sold his laptop, sold his speakers, bought a pizza and stayed in a hotel in Wisconsin. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 20 We figured he was probably on his way to Chicago. 12, 13, 16 We didn’t know what he was doing but he went to Chicago and binged heavily with hundreds of dollars in his pocket. 12, 13, 14, 15 Crack cocaine and that synthetic Xanax stuff. 9 AS: He tried that again? 10 MO: Yes, you have no idea. 11 The chemist who made it probably doesn’t even know what’s in it. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 It’s so unspecific and so deadly.  He was on Vivitrol so we knew he probably wasn’t taking opiates because it’d be worthless. 6, 12 He just did a huge amount of drugs for several days and came home, limped home after four days. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 I’ll be honest with you. 9 We’ve never gone through this before, my son’s never been homeless, he’s never gone off on these disappearing acts, he’s never overdosed on opiates as far as we know, as far as he knows. 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 He never lost his breathing. 9, 15 We’re really lucky.  We had very very few like the long traumas so many of the parents have been through. 10, 16 We were lucky.  He’s a very dangerous user. 9, 18 He went and used excessively. 9 Enough that he could have killed himself or killed somebody else. 7 You’re driving around just… 8, 9, 12, 14 AS: Was he in touch with you during these four days? 15, 19 Just waiting, contacting all of his friends. 9, 10, 12, 18 I went through his phone records and contacting everybody like, “I’m sorry. 6, 7, 10 I don’t know what to tell you. 13, 14, 15 I’m sorry.” 10 It’s like, “If I hear from him I’ll tell him that his parents love him and want him to come home.” 10, 13, 16, 19 He started to pop up some messaging on Facebook popped up. 9, 11 Like on Saturday morning, “I just needed some time to myself.” 9, 12, 13, 19 He came limping home and went to detox at The Mission out in Plymouth. 10, 19 In those days that he was gone I remember getting dressed in the morning, I remember looking in the mirror and going, “Wow. 14, 19 Are these the clothes I’m going to have on when I go to the morgue? 17 Am I going to have to identify his body wearing these clothes right now?” 14, 17 Just a random thought. 7, 9, 11, 12 It was a very poignant thought. 11, 12 His mom’s not going to identify his body. 15 That’s not his mom’s job that’s my job. 15 Or am I going to see him in a county jail somewhere or am I going to see him in the press? 7 Is a horrible thing going to happen? 12, 17 Are these the clothes I’m going to wear when I’m going to be with him. 17 Saturday he fortunately limped back. 19 No money and I said, “Devin, how are you?”  He said, “I’m chill.”  It just hit me like right in the spine, the fury in me that he was chill after what we went through for several days. 9, 12, 14, 19 I had to leave. 6 “See that’s the fucking problem.  Dad doesn’t know how to talk.” 10, 13, 14, 15 I just went out to the car because I wasn’t going to sit in there because I was going to say horrible things and I had nothing to say if all you are is chill when I went to give you a hug. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 I get that he was so addled at that point that he’d done a crap load of drugs, way more than we thought. 11, 12, 14, 16 We just thought that he smoked crack but he’d done a huge amount of drugs. 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18 It was go time.  It was like something has to happen now, what are we going to do? 12, 14 We started looking at options. 7, 9, 11 Hazelden, we weren’t interested in going back to a center that was very good about education and comfy and stuff. 9, 10, 11, 19 I thought the middle of the Yukon was a good idea at that point. 8, 11, 12 Let’s go put him in a harsh fucking place, have him struggle. 9, 10, 11 The Retreat was an option. 16 Then we happen to find out that treatment in California was an option. 9, 12, 16 California is different. 16, 17 There’s just some wrangling out there if you’re covered by insurance and then you can actually end up in sober living covered by insurance if you’re doing outpatient. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 It’s not totally legal, it’s not totally straight up but they bend the rules. 6, 9, 12, 17 We’re like, “We’re okay for bending the rules. 10, 12 Any means necessary.” 16 I had a conversation with him, not a lot, we didn’t have a lot of contact because he was just so apathetic. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 I had to set a boundary. 17 “Until you can identify or demonstrate active recovery I don’t want you at or around or near my house.” 6, 9, 10, 13 I wanted to get into lots of details about what active recovery looks like but I don’t know what it looks like because I’m not an addict. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 That’s all I had to say.  If he starts to use again he’s going to start to hang out with dangerous people again. 9, 11, 18 I don’t want him anywhere near my house or my wife or my dogs or my daughter. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13 His mom didn’t set that same boundary and that was her choice. 15, 17 That’s what I said to him.  My hope was maybe he’ll want to go find out what active recovery looks like. 9, 10, 13 He went to treatment in California. 9, 16 It was pretty scary. 7, 18 He was actually presenting schizophrenic hallucinations, schizophrenic presentation. 7, 10 Active hallucination not only voices and sounds and light but visual. 10, 16 He was seeing things. 16 They said, “He’s just so toxic still.” 9, 12 He already detoxed but all the shit in that Chinese stuff is a mess. 9, 10 We don’t know a lot. 13, 14, 15, 17 They did a good job with him.  I didn’t like them but they did a good job with him. 10 AS: The treatment center? 9, 16 MO: Yes, they really work on the co-occurring condition stuff. 9 They really get into, “Who the fuck are you?  What’s your story? 9 Who do you think you are?  What do you want to do with this stuff? 9, 13 How do you want to turn out?” 13, 19 They really get into digging in and cornering you.  It’s not gentle like Hazelden. 11 It’s pretty fierce. 18 Just from what we heard, he actually expressed in a moment of clarity, “I want to be a dad. 9, 10, 13, 15 I want to see the world. 13, 15 I want to go to school. 8, 13 I want to have a successful life.” 11, 13 Then he said, “I’m terrified I’m never going to have that stuff.” 9, 15 They said to him, “Well if you use the way you use you won’t. 9, 16 We see thousands of people and you won’t.  If you use the way you use, you’ll put your brain into a state where you won’t have any of that stuff. 9, 10, 16 That’s not a threat.  We see it a lot. 17 Pay attention.” 15 He got bounced out of there and went into sober living just about a year ago. 6, 9, 12, 20 Right here it’s the middle of January and he been in recovery ever since. 8 He found a sponsor.  He had kind of a bullshit sponsor, just a path of least resistance sponsor. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 Somebody probably said to him, “Dude that’s not a sponsor, get a real sponsor.”  He had the guts to go up and find a sponsor who had what he wanted and basically the sponsor told him what a lot of good sponsors tell a lot of good people in recovery. 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 20 “Shut up and do what I do.  Don’t think.  You’re thinking got you into this place so stop thinking and do what I do. 9, 10, 11 You’re going to copy everything I do.  You’re going to call me. 7 I’m not going to call you. 7 I’m not going to put up with any bullshit. 10 You’re either in recovery or you’re not in recovery.  If you’re in, you’re in.  If you’re not, you’re not.  I’ll figure you out very quickly.” 9, 13 This is a veteran. 7 AS: A war veteran or a recovery veteran? 7 MO: No, this guy’s been in recovery a long time.  Devin was doing old school AA Los Angeles Hollywood recovery. 8, 20 NA is interesting it’s got a lot of war stories. 9, 17, 18, 19 People go to NA and they tell lots of the drug war stories. 5, 9, 14, 17, 18 Young people thrive on it but it doesn’t help. 13 You go to a meeting and listen to people tell war stories all night. 9, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 It was so bad.  AA is more about recovery, old boys. 8, 20 People who’ve been through shit and lost everything. 9 AS: I’ve heard people call them old timers. 7, 15, 20 MO: Old timers, lots of veterans, the old guard. 5, 7, 17, 20 Devin found an old guard. 20 I don’t know if the guy is twenty-eight or sixty-eight. 13, 14, 15 It’s none of my business. 9 I think his mom met him last night in Los Angeles which is really huge. 5, 9, 15, 19 AS: Amy’s in Los Angeles.  MO: He got into recovery and he worked for a sober living company and he’s doing remarkably well. 6 I’d say he’s healthier now, he hasn’t been this healthy since he was twelve. 14, 18 He’s a different person altogether. 16, 17 He’s healthy, he’s well. 14, 18 I’m wildly grateful and also very realistic. 9, 17 He’s only nineteen and a half. 20 Long term recovery starts after five years. 9, 11, 20 You’re a toddler, you’re not a toddler until five years, you’re just crawling around. 8, 9, 12, 20 It’s very humbling.  This sponsor, remember I said that counselor in high school told him the things I told him and it made sense to him. 8, 10, 16, 17, 20 The things that sponsor is saying are things I’ve probably said or could say or would say but it doesn’t mean shit coming from me. 11, 16 His recovery has nothing to do with me and I’m okay with that.  It’s not my business at all. 9 My recovery is my business and what he does and chooses and who he hangs out with is his choice. 9, 17 Right now I’m just a lucky guy. 9, 12, 14 AS: Could you talk just a little bit about what you mean by your recovery? 9, 10, 12, 16 When did you realize that you had something that you had to recover from? 14 MO: I said I got into NarAnon while he was in his first month in treatment. 8, 9, 16 This was not unfamiliar.  I had actually been to AA meetings with one of my brothers years ago. 5, 10, 13, 20 I was stunned at the stuff I heard. 9, 15 Those were real people.  His mom was familiar with recovery and a lot of people in recovery. 15, 17 I was like okay I guess I’ll go to this thing. 10 I thought it was going to be miserable. 11, 12 I really thought I was going to walk in with a bunch of people on…they were hugging people and sharing baked goods and talking about, “Yes! 9, 10, 11, 12 She got arrested last night. 9, 19 Yay!”  Everyone’s all excited about someone getting arrested on a felony. 9, 19 I’m like, “Who are these people?” 10 I started to realize that there were these healthy people who had it way worse than I did. 9, 11, 14, 16, 18 I didn’t know they had it worse. 13, 14, 15 My son was in trouble but these were people who’d been dealing with this for a long time and they weren’t miserable. 13 They were scared, they were very challenged, they lost sleep at night but they were getting back to their lives. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 I see things in pictures, I always see everything in pictures. 16, 17 That’s kind of the way I see the world and the way I try to communicate the way I see things. 10, 15, 16, 17 It’s like you go to the edge of the forest and you have this little tiny machete on your skinny little arms and you think you’re going to chop through this thing to figure out how to fix this thing and you’re just not going to. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 You don’t have enough energy and it’s just too thick, it’s too brutal. 9, 12, 20 There are elephants who know the trails. 13, 14, 15 You just got to go get behind the elephants like my son has been told, “Get behind me.” 9, 12, 20 I just kind of learned to get behind other elephants. 9, 12, 16, 17 Mostly moms, not a lot of dads in recovery unfortunately but mostly moms who kind of know the path because other people had created it. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Who knows where the path was initially created and it doesn’t matter. 13, 14, 15, 20 There’s a path. 14 There’s not one path, there’s lots of paths but I kind of stopped trying to chop my way through this thing and started hanging out with people who knew a lot more than I did. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 I started to find out I had a lot of stuff to work on. 9, 11, 17 My son didn’t bring my sadness, my rage, my terror to me it was always there. 12, 16, 17 It just got uncorked. 9, 12 Own your shit as they say.  Everything I was feeling was mine. 16 I’d get challenged and sometimes I’d actively challenge in a meeting when somebody blames that other person for the things they’re experiencing. 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18 I try to do it gently but that’s your stuff. 9, 16 That’s your stuff. 9 I guarantee there are addicts who get well and then there are family members and parents who don’t get well and go bat shit crazy. 7, 10, 16, 18 The addict’s like, “I’m doing okay now. 10, 14 What happened to you?” 12, 13 One of the best things you can do, as I learned and borrow shamelessly, is just work on your own recovery. 9, 12, 16, 17 The best way you can support them in your recovery is to be working on your own recovery so you don’t go off like that person that terrifies me. 9, 16 That furious, raging, spitting, angry Irishman.  It’s the Wizard of Oz, behind that is this terrified person back here behind the curtain. 19 Work on that guy because it’s not just going to be my son’s addiction where these things happen. 9, 12, 16 It’s going to happen in traffic, it’s going to happen with my in-laws, with my wife, with colleagues and clients, and somebody that I bump into on the trail. 12 I could actually be better at a lot of stuff. 9, 10, 17 It really has nothing to do with my son’s addiction.  That’s incidental.  Sometimes I feel okay. 5, 16, 18 It’s interesting, I’ve missed only two meetings in only two years. 9, 13, 19, 20 Last week I’ve been sick otherwise if I have work, something else planned or booked I go. 9 I just try to show up there for humility and inspiration, which I get every single—I got a lot of humility last night. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 This is just what I noticed is every time I go to a meeting if I’m paying attention I will hear things I’ve never heard before. 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 I might because I went in the right way I’m going to think things I’ve never thought before which in turn will lead me to possibly do things I’ve never done before, possibly. 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 That doesn’t mean I just get it and go. 9, 12, 16 A lot of the stuff just goes in one ear and out the other. 9, 12, 17 “Well that’s really interesting.” 9, 19 But I don’t use it. 9 Sometimes it actually penetrates and I go and do something with it. 5, 10, 18 It doesn’t work exactly the way I thought it would but it works in a way that I can learn from it. 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 All these different experiences along the way. 16, 17 It’s just a lake. 9, 12 It’s the lake I go to so I don’t feel so horrible, so worthless and I don't blame myself. 16, 17 When you're by yourself it's like man the best of me does not come out. 9, 13, 19 By myself with my dogs on the lake I'm actually in a pretty good place. 10, 11, 12, 18 Sitting by myself in a chair looking out a window, pulling at my skin, my best thoughts are a long way off. 9, 11, 12, 16 It's my worst thoughts, my shadows like I've got this I'll take over right now. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14 It just kind of spills. 9, 12, 16, 17 There's so many people that just do that and that's the heartbreaking thing for me. 9, 12, 18 I want to try to change that to get more people off of their butt. 13, 16 They have every right to sit by them self but they also have an opportunity to go hang out with people and heal and learn. 12, 13, 14 An addict alone, you're in dangerous company as they say. 18 Same with a parent, same with a spouse, same with a brother, same with a daughter. 5, 9, 10, 16 When you're sitting alone you're not helping yourself. 13 The only way things have been figured out since the dawn of time has been community, people sitting in circles and talking about what's real. 10, 12, 13, 16 White people brought clipboards and said, ""We'll call this therapy."" 5, 7, 9, 18 The brown people are like, ""We've been doing this shit for thousands of years with no methodology other than sit in a circle and tell the truth."" 5, 10, 13, 20 I'm just a big fan of it. 8, 9, 12 I really am.  AS: Can you talk about what you're planning, when you're just talking about wanting to help other parents. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 Can you talk about what your thoughts are about what you want to be doing in the next few years? 10, 11, 12, 13, 20 MO: I'm working on a plan right now with a colleague, a fellow parent of an addict who just lost her son, right before Christmas. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 I'm actually heading over there right after this meeting to go talk a little bit about this stuff. 9, 10, 13, 14 Ultimately what we want to do is help, we want to facilitate and accelerate the process for people to learn that there's a lot of work they can do to help themselves. 12, 13, 17 There's three ""Cs"" that they talk about in addiction. 10 You didn't cause it, this is interesting for the addict to know and certainly for the family members. 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 I didn't cause it. 9 I cannot control it and I will not cure it. 17 There's a fourth ""C"" that I really gravitate toward. 20 It's really important and it's controversial, some people don't like it, but there is something called contribution. 7, 10 I can contribute the way I show up, there's no neutral, I'm adding to the mix. 16 I'm either helping to improve things by working on my own recovery and learning not to engage where I don't need to engage or I'm exacerbating things by bringing my rage. 12, 13, 16 By trying to control I'm adding, I'm contributing, I'm exacerbating the injury. 16, 17 AS: The contribution can be positive or negative? 13, 14 MO: Contribution is neutral but you're always contributing. 16, 17 Are you aware of how you're contributing?  AS: Which is different from the other three? 16, 17 MO: Yes, absolutely.  I've heard parents say, ""I'm going to bring them home and we're just going to love him up. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 We're going to cook his favorite meals and we're going to watch ﻿Home Alone ﻿and I'm going to buy him some socks."" 7 The addict's like ""Okay.  Fine with me.  I'll just sell those fucking socks."" 7, 9, 12 Or, ""We're going to punish you.  We're just going to make it really difficult for you to do anything."" 9, 12, 16, 20 Okay.  Bring on the shame.  I have an idea that we can help more people if we can get in front of audiences and just help them understand that there is a different experience if you're willing to lean in just like an addict has to lean in to their recovery. 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 You can lean in and go find a healthy group. 14, 18 There's nothing we can say or do that will change anything for them. 16 We just want to try to invite people to find a community where they can sit and have this stuff happen that just happens. 9, 12, 13, 16 I'll be damned if anyone can say exactly how it happens. 10, 12, 13 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I don't know if it's realistic or not. 9, 13, 14, 15 I'd like to make a living out of it. 6, 10, 16 I don't know if there's a living to be made out of it. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 I do know that I have enough resources and energy and skills to be able to impart to some people who are terrified that it doesn't have to keep feeling this way. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I don't mean just going to Anon because Anon's not healthy. 9, 12, 14, 16, 18 You can have a different experience, you can protect your marriage, you can protect your finances, you can protect your spiritual life, you can protect your other relationships with other family members. 11, 16, 17, 18 All of that stuff, every bit of that can go away if you're not paying attention. 9, 11, 15, 16 While you're trying to rescue somebody who doesn't want to be rescued. 13, 16 You'll go right over the falls with them and you don't have to. 14 You can get out.  Say, ""I'm going to climb down.  If you're down there on the side of the river I'm going to come down and help you if I can but I'm not going over the falls with you. 13, 19 Those are those pictures I sent right? 7, 14 It just breaks my heart that there are people sitting alone. 9, 12, 13, 18 Either afraid to share because they think they're going to get judged, they might.  They may have some family members or community that they're at risk in. 18 The dads, I'd love to get more dads to show up because they spend a lot of time very angry, deep in their grief because they can't fix something. 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 That's a big problem. 8 Then you got new problems. 6 All of a sudden your family's feeling something that really has nothing to do with the addiction anymore. 13, 16, 18 It's all my own beast, my shadow has shown up and everything else in my life has become a mess. 9, 11, 13, 19 If I can help people learn how to turn down their noise, help them learn how to do it them self. 12, 13, 19 I have no experience, I just have an experience learning how to turn down my own noise and be like, ""This is nice. 9, 10, 12, 19 I can still hear it."" 9 AS: But it doesn't overtake your life. 6, 11 MO: It doesn't overtake my life. 6, 11 What else?  Anything else?  AS: Do you have anything else?  MO: I'll say what one of my friends says about this. 12, 18 She has two addicted children. 14 It's not good.  Here's what she says, ""I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 9 No way. 16 It's way too hard."" 11, 16 She also says, ""I wouldn't go back to the way it was before. 16, 19 Speaking from a selfish place."" 11 Not selfish in a bad way. 16 She's a better person and she knows it. 13, 14, 15 She feels that she's a better person having... 16 And learning a lot about herself. 12, 17 Just the little petty stuff she used to really get wrapped around the axel. 9 It doesn't matter anymore. 13, 20 She's walking with a different grace. 15, 16, 17 Imagine that.  It's like the cancer patient that's like, ""This is going to kill me but man I have learned so much about me. 7, 10, 12, 17, 18 I'm a better dad or I'm a better family member. 18 I'm a better human having been shown that I'm going to die soon.""  Wow.  I'm so grateful for the exposure to the lovely friends. 12, 13, 15, 18 Heartache, I'm going to experience things I don't ever want to experience again. 13, 16 Lately and I'm still in it. 9 I don't like it at all, I hate it. 10 It's kind of a number games when you're in a community of addicts. 10, 16, 17 People die or people's lives come apart. 13, 19, 20 It's really hard. 11 In the meantime, they can do things to make things better. 16 AS: That's right. 14 There's definitely an intensity to this particular path that we're on. 13, 14, 15, 18 MO: Either way, intense joy. 15, 16 One other thing I discovered a couple years ago. 12, 20 When I was in really deep sadness, out on the lake with my dog. 10, 12 You get sad and your posture changes. 9, 12, 16 Your head goes down.  It's just evolutionary biology. 9, 12, 15 It just kind of keeps us close to home. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 It's interesting. 9, 19 My head was down a lot. 17 I was crying I was so scared. 5, 7, 11, 12 I was so everything, mostly just scared. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 I just look up at the sky and the sky was brilliant. 8, 9, 12 Clouds kind of tumbling through and brilliant winter blue. 8, 16, 17 I realized my son's under the same sky right now. 14 Not very far away at all, he was actually right here in the Twin Cities. 10, 14, 16 I'm a pagan.  I'm a born again pagan.  I was raised Christian but I'm a pagan truly. 5, 8, 9 That's my church.  The sky's kind of this palette that day or night I just kind of look up whether it's starry or cloudy or grey. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 There's no bad sky.  All the people I love are under that sky. 13 Little things like that kind of bring me to the lake. 16, 17 There's a lake story in here somewhere but it kind of helps, it lightens things for me. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17 When I look up at that sky and those lovely people I love and the people who aren't here anymore, they also used to experience that sky too. 9, 13 It helps turn down my noise a little bit. 13, 19 And just keep walking. 9, 12, 15 That's enough. 20 AS: Thank you Mike.  MO: You're welcome. 13, 19 Thanks for listening. 9, 15, 17"
"17","Gardner_Carson","Ann Perry Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer July 6, 2016 Minnetonka, Minnesota Ann Perry-AP Amy Sullivan-AS AP: We’re going to go there and celebrate.  We got to know her and she said, “I was just at a drug task force meeting and Spencer’s name came up.” 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 She said, “There’s a huge investigation going on between Carver County and Anoka County.” 9 He died in Anoka County in Columbia Heights.  “There’s some inter-relationship with everything.  Do you mind if I give your numbers to the investigators?” 6, 9 I was up at the cabin and Dean said, “Absolutely, but Ann’s been talking to the Anoka County investigator.” 9, 10 Then I heard two weeks ago, I’ll have you read it. 15 AS: What, to think about the investigation? 9 AP: Yes, what if they find somebody?  Spencer probably would have known this person or asked him to buy heroin. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: Don’t you think they’re just looking so that they can bust somebody? 9, 12 AP: I think they’re to go as high up the ladder that they can. 8 Does it affect me as a mom? 15 AS: I don’t know if it’s going to affect you as a mom at all. 13, 14, 15 It’s so confusing because it’s our child’s addiction.  AP: He said, “I really want to find this person that made Spencer accessible to his addiction.” 6, 13, 16 There’re lots of people who make him accessible. 5, 6, 16, 17 I was always so fearful of the public safety people. 16, 17 What do you mean? 16 AP: Just because they’re looking for the glory of these big drug busts. 8, 9, 14 I just remember that when they had the Hennepin County heroin town hall meeting. 9, 12, 13, 19 AS: When we went to that, you and me and Kim.  AP: When they threw away all our Nar-Anon flyers. 15, 16 We were just starting the Nar-Anon. 9, 11, 12 We ran off fifty copies of the flyers for our meetings and thought there might be some parents there. 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 AS: Yes, there were a lot of parents there I think. 10, 16, 17 AP: We asked at one of the tables if we could display these. 10 The woman said, “Well let me check with the sheriff to make sure it’s okay.” 15, 16, 19 When it was over we went by the garbage can and there they all were.  They hadn’t even been put on… 10, 15 AP: On the table.  AS: Then they made us all sign in and wanted to get our email addresses. 12, 13, 14, 16 AP: Andy Luger says if you just keep your kids in sports and talk about it around the dining room table. 7, 9, 10, 12 Here were the four front rows full of parents with dead children. 10, 11, 14, 16 How insensitive can you get? 13 AS: That same message came from someone who spoke from Teen Challenge. 19 You needed to have dinner with your children. 13, 14 I remember looking at you and Kim.  AP: Well that didn’t work.  [laughs]  AS: Where we are at right now, our kids aren’t in seventh grade anymore. 13, 14, 15, 20 This isn’t the DARE program.  AP: Hopefully they’re past that message. 11 AS: I’m not sure they are. 15 If you want to just read that release form. 9, 12, 13, 17 This is Amy Sullivan it is July 6, 2016.  I’m at Ann Perry’s home in Minnetonka, Minnesota. 19 She’s folding laundry and we’re sitting at the kitchen table. 13, 14, 20 The electricity went out last night in a huge storm, so there are generators going all over the neighborhood here. 8, 9, 19, 20 Ann, would you state your name and say that you give me permission to record this? 6, 9 AP: Yes, Amy.  My name is Ann Perry and I give you, Amy Sullivan, permission to record this interview. 6 AS: Thanks.  Let’s start with your childhood, where you were raised, what your childhood was like, your early adulthood, parenthood. 5, 9, 10, 11, 16 You can just keep going and I’ll ask questions as I need to. 6, 9, 12, 13 AP: I was born in 1951.  I’ll be sixty-five at the end of the month. 8, 12 I was the second of six children. 14, 20 I was born in Wisconsin, but my parents moved here, I believe, when I was two. 8, 10, 16 My father fought in World War II. 5 He was a very young recruit or enlistee. 9, 14 I think in 1944.  He was put in a division that liberated a lot of the concentration camps in Europe, which has some bearing on what I’ll say later. 8, 10, 17 He has a half-sister that’s five years older than he. 5, 9, 20 His parents were very close to me growing up. 10, 16, 17 I’d often go and stay with them during the summertime because of the number of children my mom had. 9, 12, 14, 15 My mother grew up in Wisconsin.  My father grew up in Wisconsin. 5 They met in high school. 5, 8 She went to college and she became a nurse during World War II, but she never practiced because the war ended afterwards. 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19 She grew up with a degree but never using the degree in her professional life until later. 11, 15, 20 Early on in my childhood my dad became an alcoholic. 5, 11, 19 I think a lot of it had to do with the trauma he experienced in World War II and what he saw in World War II. 17 That’s probably not the only reason.  He probably had some alcohol addiction in his family, too. 18 It was very difficult growing up in a family, especially with six kids, with an alcoholic. 5, 17, 18, 20 My mother often put me in the position of being a parent. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 We would find my dad passed out on the floor.  She would have me run up and get a doctor. 11 I often found myself having to take care of her because she was always wimping out for things like that. 6, 7, 12, 15, 16, 17 I had a real strong relationship with my oldest sister until she got into junior high. 5, 8, 9, 20 Then she became very distant from me. 5, 9, 19 I always kind of feel like I raised myself. 5, 16, 17 I grew up by raising myself.  It has its good and bad traits about it.  When I went to high school I became very wild. 5, 8, 17, 19 I got suspended from school once. 8, 12, 19 I drank, smoked pot and hash. 7, 14, 17 Then I went off to college. 8 I wasn’t really a serious student until I was probably a junior. 8, 9 Then I became very interested in history and geography. 5, 9, 11, 19 I got a double major. 18 Then a girlfriend and I went to Europe, we hitch hiked around. 8, 12 It was so much fun. 18 Then I came back and didn’t really know what to do. 13, 14, 15, 19 First, I got a teaching degree and in student teaching discovered that I really didn’t like teaching kids, middle and high school. 8, 9, 10, 12, 20 One of my professors taught an urban planning class. 20 I took that and became enamored with it. 5, 12, 19 The head of the department told me about an urban planning master’s program down in St. Louis. 9, 20 I didn’t know a soul, probably the best thing for me. 9, 13, 14, 15 I was registering for classes and I met my husband Dean. 5, 8, 9, 15, 20 I was dating somebody else.  We just became good friends, it was a two year graduate program, and we just became good friends. 5, 9, 12, 18, 19, 20 Then the second year he asked if I would move in, just as friends. 9, 10, 12, 18, 20 I did and I think there were only two women out of the program of eighty people. 18 This was before women got into college and did things. 8, 16, 18 AS: What year is this? 20 Do you remember?  I graduated in ’77. 8 We got married a week after; my mom planned the whole wedding. 15 We all said we’d go where the first job was. 9 That was when affirmative action was really big. 8, 10 Being a white female, I didn’t have any problem getting a job.  I wanted to go back to Minnesota because I loved it. 12, 13, 19 Dean was from Valparaiso, Indiana. 8 We both moved here. 8 Dean had a terrible time finding a job, being a white male. 15 He eventually did, and I think we were married four years before we had Spencer. 15, 20 I had a midwife and it was great. 11 I’ll never go through childbirth again though without having drugs. 11, 14, 15 [laughs]  Spencer was born, and I worked for the City of Minnetonka.  Dean worked for the City of Rosemount.  We lived in South Minneapolis.  We decided we should probably move close to one of our jobs. 12 We found our house out in Minnetonka. 6, 9 AS: That’s this house? 6, 9 AP: No, it’s another house close by. 6, 9 We found a wonderful daycare, it was a family daycare. 7, 18, 19 It was a little hobby farm and all the kids got to bottle feed the little lambs. 17 It was wonderful.  Spencer, he had a wonderful childhood. 11 We held him back, he was a summer baby. 5, 19 We put him through when he five, should he go to kindergarten or not? 10, 15, 16, 17 They recommended that he did, which was a mistake. 6, 9, 12 He didn’t do well socially his first year of kindergarten. 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 At the family daycare the family daycare mom, we became very close friends, our families; had a son who was about a year older than Spencer. 5, 7, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20 Spencer was terribly bullied at that daycare. 7, 18, 19 We ended up taking him out and switched him over to a different school so he wouldn’t have the stigma of being with the same kids for a repeated grade. 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 20 Spencer always kind of resented us for that. 7, 16, 17 Even though in later years he’ll admit how terrible the bullying was. 11, 15, 20 I never knew about it and Spencer would never say anything about it. 6, 12, 15 He had a wonderful elementary school. 8 Although he wasn’t the best student, he was always very smart. 9, 16, 17, 20 Red hair shenanigans, always played sports. 8, 12, 16, 17 He loved T-ball and baseball. 8, 13 He was in Little League.  He and Dean were in the Y Guide program.  He always had a problem; he would never want to stay over at other people’s homes for the night with other kids. 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 One time he spent the night with a good friend. 12, 19 He ended up walking home because he didn’t want to be apart from us. 12, 13, 15, 19, 20 He was always very close to us. 16, 17 Both of our jobs, being in the public employment, you had a lot of night meetings. 13, 17, 19 You had to hold meetings when people were done with their jobs during the day. 13, 19, 20 I was gone a lot, Dean was gone a lot. 17 In our parenting we would always make sure we’d always schedule our meetings so the other person could go and be there. 10, 13, 15, 16, 17 We were gone and I always felt so guilty for that. 16, 17, 19 I love my job. 13 I had a boss who was absolutely wonderful.  He would push me so much to do as well as I could. 18 That kind of overcame some of the guilt of mothering. 16, 17, 19 Growing up out in the suburbs you didn’t have a big network of working moms back then, like you do now. 8, 14, 15, 18, 19 My network of working moms were people in the daycare, either work or in daycare. 7, 15, 18, 19 It still remains strong today. 9, 19 We still get together for daycare mom group meetings. 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19 I know your transcriber can’t see but I want to show you pictures. 7, 13, 14, 15 It’s just in the other room here. 7, 9, 12 Shelley and her cousins and my sisters put these boards together for the funeral. 5, 9, 10 This was his childhood. 11 There’re pictures of him as a baby with his cousins. 5 I made all his Halloween costumes, wrestling, swimming. 9, 16, 19 AS: Oh, look at that red hair. 12 AP: He was a very sensitive, shy boy. 13 He just loved doing things. 9, 12, 13, 16 I’m going to cry.  I’m going to get the Kleenex box.  That’s okay.  This is very good for me to talk about this. 10 This was up until probably junior high. 8 Slip n’ slide, baseball. 8 How could this kid become addicted to heroin? 13, 19 You look at these pictures.  I kept thinking, “Is it because I worked so much?” 18 Then back when he, I think he was entering seventh grade, the city manager left to become director of the League of Cities for Minnesota. 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 A new city manager was hired where I worked. 6, 12, 20 He just didn’t have the values that the previous manager had. 9, 12 I just thought, “I’m not willing to work this hard for somebody that doesn’t have the same values that I do.” 9, 11, 12 I thought, “Well I’ll take some time off. 6, 11, 12 I’ll be able to spend time with Spence.” 12, 19 I was really worried about him.  AS: How old was he at this point? 20 AP: He was twelve, thirteen. 20 Getting to the point where he could probably come home from school on his own. 8, 13, 19 AS: And get in some trouble?  AP: I was so worried about that.  I took time off and Shelley, his sister, and I drove him up to Camp Menogyn. 5, 7, 9, 14 He and another friend went there and Shelly and I were going to camp and drive around Lake Superior. 7, 8, 12, 14 We ended up having car trouble and never made it. 7, 12, 15, 16 I did okay.  AS: At home? 19 AP: At home. 19 I was sort of rattling around the house. 6, 9, 17 I thought, “I just am not being stimulated.” 9, 11, 12 I was getting crabby.  I went back to work; I did contract work then went back to work full-time. 10, 11, 19 Then he started middle school. 8, 9, 11 AS: Spencer was born in 1981.  AP: In middle school through high school pictures—it was called junior high back then—it was seventh, eighth, and ninth grade. 7, 8, 15, 19, 20 In eighth grade he got caught in school. 8, 20 He had put some booze in a water bottle and he got caught, he and another friend. 6, 10, 12, 17 That was really his first foray that we knew, of him using substances. 6, 9, 12 Dean and I always drank in front of him. 7, 14, 16, 17 We didn’t drink a lot. 6, 14, 17 AS: It was in your house. 6, 9 AP: Then we found a bottle of vodka that had been refilled with water. 6, 17 Then at fifteen or sixteen we caught him with his good friend John, his parents are the ones coming from Montana today. 10, 12, 16, 19 I think he’s in one of these pictures.  AS: Is this Dean?  AP: That’s Dean and Spence.  They look so much alike. 10, 18 Every summer we’d go up to Ely to a camp called Camp Van Vac. 7, 8 It was just kind of stone cabins. 9, 12, 16, 17 It did have electricity, cold running water, central bathrooms. 6, 7, 11, 20 We just loved it. 9, 12, 13 I think he started smoking pot when he was fifteen. 9, 11 He got caught by the police, he and two other guys were parked in a car and the police came up to them, opened the car doors and smoke just billowed out. 7, 9, 12, 17, 19 Pot.  The police, bless their hearts, kept them in the jail cell longer than they had to and then released them. 7 AS: To try to make an impression. 16 Was this here in Minnetonka?  AP: I think it was the Orono or Long Lake police. 7 They notify the schools right away. 8, 14, 16 Spencer was on the baseball team. 8 He got kicked off the baseball team, which is what you do for somebody in trouble. 8 It just irritated me. 9, 12 Then he had to go to chemical dependency… 9, 12 AS: So backtrack. 19 Tell me what you mean about being kicked off? 16 AP: Being kicked off of the baseball team, it always impressed me that here kids in trouble could not participate in healthy activities. 8, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18 AS: They see it as a punishment.  It’s a privilege to be able to play on the team.  AP: I don’t know if that view is still held today or not. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I understand that he has to be accountable, but to punish him by taking him out? 9, 12, 16 Then he went to a chemical dependency class that the high school ran. 7, 8, 9, 12, 20 It was very good.  It was run by a wonderful counselor. 10, 11 I think he had to do that for six months. 8 I noticed from the time he was fifteen, I think probably here, we went out to Montana to visit our friends. 12, 13, 18 I don’t think he smiled that whole year he was fifteen. 20 We’d tell jokes, take him to counseling, took him to a therapist who thought he had ADD. 6, 9, 11, 12 He was on Ritalin.  That’s another thing I feel terribly guilty about. 16 I think that was either eighth or ninth grade that started. 9, 11, 20 High school was relatively benign. 8 He had good buds; he did a lot of activities that we thought were healthy. 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18 He told us later that he was smoking pot the whole time he was in high school. 8, 20 Then he went to college. 8 He didn’t know where he wanted to go. 12, 13, 14, 15 I, of course, filled out his applications. 10 He got accepted at the U [University of Minnesota] and went there. 13 He was very, very homesick. 19 He lived down there.  He would come home a lot and then the second year he asked if he could live on… 10, 13, 17, 19, 20 I can just picture it, it’s right off here, the tall building, it was brand new when he moved in, student housing. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 He moved in with three other high school friends that were doing fairly well, but all they did was party. 6, 8, 12, 18 AS: So he moved off campus? 8 AP: It was off campus. 8 What was the name of that? 6 We tried and tried to keep him back in. 10, 12, 19 We talked to the counselors. 10, 11 He was put on probation. 10 We even had his pediatrician write him a note about his ADD. 8, 15 We were very into enabling, into doing everything we could to keep him in college. 8, 12 He, looking backwards, he was probably one who should have taken a year or two off before going to college to figure things out. 6, 8, 13, 16, 19, 20 We didn’t want him to; we thought college is the way to go. 8, 11, 12, 13, 16 Can you back up for a second and talk about his sister? 5, 9, 10, 19, 20 AP: Shelley was born in 1984.  AS: So they’re three years apart. 20 AP: She was always a delightful, happy child until ninth grade. 16, 17, 20 Then she sunk into a horrible depression. 17 A depression so bad she would drag her mattress into our room and sleep in our room with us. 7, 14 She could not get out of bed.  She said, “It felt like it was enveloping me and taking me down.” 17 She was so sad and so she went to heavy duty counseling. 12 They put her on antidepressant meds. 10 Every one you can think of.  AS: To just find something that worked? 9, 12 AP: Until we found something that worked.  She gained a horrible amount of weight. 17, 18 She survived; she did very well in school. 8 She wanted to go away to school. 8, 12, 13, 16 She wanted to go to DePauw University outside of Indianapolis which was smaller than her high school. 8, 12, 13 She just fell in love with it. 9, 12, 13, 15 We wanted her to go to St. Olaf because it was close. 12, 13 We were just so worried about her depression. 9, 12 She did well.  We ended up saying, “Okay, you can go to DePauw.” 11, 12 She did well there the first year, but then she started cutting herself. 9, 11, 20 She ended up in the hospital. 12 Let me back up. 19 After cutting herself we get a call that she was in the emergency room. 7 She had taken a bottle and a half of Tylenol, which is significant—liver issues. 6, 14, 15, 17, 20 She was in the ICU.  They had washed her stomach out with charcoal. 9 They thought it was a suicide attempt. 11, 12 She said, “I can’t say for sure if it was a suicide attempt. 15 There was a voice telling me to just keep taking these pills and that’s what I did.” 9, 12 That was very traumatic on us.  Spencer will always say, “You spent more time on her, trying to help her with her depression than you did me with trying to overcome addiction,” which wasn’t at all true. 13, 16, 17, 19 That’s his perception of it.  He watched a lot of it because he was with us when that was happening. 12, 13, 17 Shelley got better.  She ended up graduating from DePauw. 12 She had to go to summer school. 8 She was upset because she couldn’t walk with her class—that was a big deal for small schools. 8, 13, 17, 19, 20 She came back here and she decided she wanted to go back to school. 8, 12, 13, 19 She had a degree in anthropology, which is something you could really use in finding a job. 9, 20 That was sarcastic. 9 She was really interested in theater. 9, 11, 19, 20 She went back to the U and got a degree in theater. 19, 20 AS: There’s a dog snoring in the background. 8, 10, 19 [laughs]  She has a degree in anthropology. 20 AP: Anthropology from DePauw and then the U for theater. 20 Then she discovered that there weren’t a lot of jobs in theater. 12, 17, 20 She went back to Hamline [University] and she’s finished up all her coursework for her master’s in theater education. 6, 9, 10, 13, 19, 20 She’s got her teaching degree. 20 This last half year she taught at the middle school in North Minneapolis. 8, 9, 20 I can’t think of the name of it right now. 6, 14 Now she is has a very serious boyfriend, Jeff. 12 Her hair is green. 12 I never know what color her hair is going to be. 12, 13, 14, 15 I had a horrible time; she has tattoos all over the place. 11, 17 You think my kid Spencer has always been very conservative and worried what people thought of him. 11, 12, 16, 17 She’s always very responsible about drinking and using drugs and everything, very responsible. 6, 14, 16, 17 He’s off the deep end. 12 One thing at least in dealing with addiction, it’s taught me to be very tolerant of Shelley, very approving of what her choices are. 7, 9, 13, 17 Not approving, accepting what her choices are in life. 11, 17 So Spencer’s addiction, while he was in college he had a very bad case of mono. 8 This is probably caused by all the partying. 6, 9 AS: The mono?  AP: Yes.  His doctor, probably being well meaning at the time, he had a horrible sore throat, prescribed him tons of Percocet. 16, 17 AS: For a sore throat?  AP: Because it was so bad.  AS: I’ve never heard that for sore throat. 15 Wow.  AP: It was at the time he had his first girlfriend. 9, 12 He never dated at all in high school. 8, 15 He was too shy and immature.  It was probably his first or second year. 9, 20 He met this girl Cassie who was just absolutely wild. 5, 9, 12, 17 She had no place to go so she wondered if she could stay at our house. 6, 9, 11, 12 I said, “No, no, no.”  And then, “Yes.”  Her parents wouldn’t allow her back in their home. 10, 16, 19 AS: He was in high school or college? 8 AP: College, this was after he had dropped out. 14 I said, “She can stay in a separate bedroom. 7, 9, 14 I want no interaction between you two sexually, in my house. 6, 9, 10, 13 She has to actively look for a place to live.” 10, 11 She was an alcoholic and we didn’t know it. 5, 13, 14, 15 They would drink and drink. 6, 14 I ended up taking her down to HCMC emergency room, sitting with her when she had these horrible cases of anxiety. 7, 12, 13, 17 Her parents lived over in Hopkins. 10, 16 Her mom had nothing to do with her. 15 Her dad would come and just be disgusted and walk away. 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 So me, the enabler, would sit with her. 13 I just felt so bad for her. 9, 12, 17 Then those two ended up, Spencer and Cassie, moving to an apartment down near the U. She ended up going off the deep end in an alcoholic craze. 5, 12, 20 The police found her banging on the doors of Ridgedale at eight o’clock on a Saturday morning. 7, 19 AS: Of the shopping mall?  AP: Of the shopping mall.  Probably two weeks previous to that we were gone, Spencer and Cassie were at our house and she started attacking him. 6, 9, 11, 19 He called the police. 7 She got charged with domestic abuse. 9, 17 After the shopping center thing, Spencer was probably twenty one; we had no business saying this to him. 9, 11 We said, “That’s it.  We will not tolerate her being around you.”  That was the end of Cassie and Spencer together. 12 He was clearly abusing alcohol, looking backwards, with her. 9, 19 I’m assuming it probably ended up being pot. 12 Then he told me, a couple years ago, how they would get renewals of the Percocet from the doctor’s prescriptions and take as many as they could. 6, 20 Probably when he was twenty five or twenty six, he had his first bout with appendicitis. 9, 12 He ended up in the hospital. 12 It was so inflamed they couldn’t operate.  For pain control they give him Percocet and oxycodone. 6, 17 Sometime between his mono and his appendicitis I figure he probably got addicted to pain meds. 5, 13 Then he met Jamie and they probably dated for two years. 5, 20 Then he moved in with her at the U. She was a nursing student at the U. She got pregnant in her junior year. 8, 9, 20 Right before—let me backup. 19 I’m trying to think if Aidan was born before or after his second appendicitis attack. 12, 16, 20 I think it must have been right after Aidan was born, more Percocet, more oxycodone. 14 Jamie called us right after Christmas. 7, 9, 14 AS: So Ann you’re looking on your laptop?  AP: Which is Spencer’s drug history. 9, 14 AS: You kept a history of this written down. 9, 15 AP: He entered The Retreat. 12, 16 Jamie came to us saying, “Something’s wrong with Spencer. 11, 19 He’s acting weird.” 10 She thought he was addicted to pot, which he probably was. 11, 12 We called The Retreat. 7, 16 We did an intervention, just ourselves with him and Jamie and said, “You’ve got to enter treatment. 9, 12, 16 This is unacceptable.”  AS: At this point Aidan is born?  AP: Aidan is born.  He was born in September 2008.  This was in February 2009.  He told us that he was only on pot. 20 When I talked to The Retreat, to Mike Kennedy, did you ever know him? 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 He was a nurse anesthetist. 9 He was Shelley’s nurse anesthetist to the doctor when she was born. 9 Shelley’s doctor knew him really well. 6, 12 He became addicted to fentanyl and pain pills, which was very convenient being a nurse anesthetist. 5, 9, 19 He would just open a vein in his leg when he was treating a patient and drain the medication into him. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17 Anyways, he ended up being Spencer’s counselor. 10, 12, 16, 17 He told us, “Make sure it’s only pot. 15, 20 If there’s any pain pills in him he’ll have to go to detox.” 10 We had no idea about the Percocet, we were very naïve. 11 After three days when he was at The Retreat he started going into withdrawal. 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 They sent him to the Mission to go into detox. 7, 10 He came back and he told us he had taken a couple Suboxone and that’s what he had to detox from. 6, 10, 19, 20 We had no clue what that meant. 16 He did the full thirty days there. 11, 19 They really wanted him to go live in a sober house. 6, 9, 12, 13 He refused to because he didn’t want to be apart from Jamie and Aidan. 9, 13, 20 He did well.  He did well for probably six to eight months. 8 Then Jamie could tell that he was withdrawing again and something was wrong. 14 Right before Christmas I remember her calling us to come over to their house because she couldn’t wake him up. 6, 7, 9, 13, 19 We couldn’t wake him up either.  We had no idea. 11 He was probably overdosing.  Eventually he came to. 19 Then we brought him to Fairview Chemical Dependency for an evaluation. 9, 12, 18 Of course he wouldn’t let us in. 19 He told us, he just thought he should go to outpatient treatment. 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 They recommended Nystrom. 9, 12 At the same time Jamie had graduated the previous spring. 8 That’s when the nurse’s freeze came on. 19 There were no nursing jobs to be had whatsoever except in a nursing home. 19 She wanted to be a hospital nurse. 12, 13 That was her dream. 14 She applied out of state. 9 The only two hospitals that were hiring then were ones connected with Native American communities because they got grant money. 7, 18 One was in Ellisville, Montana the other was in Casper, Wyoming.  She interviewed both; got both jobs but she preferred the Ellisville, Montana job. 6, 12 This was in December, January.  Spencer insisted that he move out there with her even though he obviously had an addiction going. 9, 15 He moved out there with her. 8 He detoxed on his own, going out there. 10 Then he did pretty well for a year. 18, 20 He got a job as a landscaper. 8 Then he probably started heroin, I want to say out in Montana. 9, 11, 13 The FDA changed the formula for… 16, 17 AS: Oxycodone.  AP: Oxycodone and Percocet.  AS: You couldn’t crush it.  AP: I bet he became a heroin addict, putting things together, back then. 5, 10, 16, 19 He kept asking us for money. 13 Jamie kept saying, this is July 2011, he wasn’t paying rent. 11, 16 He kept coming up with these weird reasons for needing money from us. 13 Then he started pawning things probably in August of 2011. 9, 11, 16 Then his addiction really got bad.  This was all out in Montana.  Jamie called us in October saying she found a pop can with some resin in it that wasn’t pot. 7, 11 AS: She was still thinking it was pot at this point? 9 AP: Yes.  I think she just got worn out, that she didn’t care what he was doing. 7, 9, 12 She needed somebody to watch Aidan. 13 Then we, in response to that, kept saying, “You’ve got to handle this yourself and do things.” 11, 16 We had no clue.  Or, “Kick him out.”  I said, “We’ll come and get Aidan. 13, 19 He can’t be in this type of environment.”  I ended up in the end of October going out there and getting Aidan and brought him back to Minnesota. 9, 12, 18, 19 AS: Just your grandson, just him? 7, 9, 12 AP: Just him. 9 Spencer said he was going to stay there. 9 He stayed out there until Thanksgiving. 5, 9, 11 We sent him money. 7 His car had died. 7 He probably sold it for drugs. 14, 20 His car had died by then. 7 We sent him money to take the train. 6, 7 Jamie had kicked him out of the house. 6, 9 Then on Thanksgiving Day he said he had to run to an AA meeting. 11, 13 He started using. 9, 11 He started pawning from us. 9, 11 AS: He said he had to go to an AA meeting but he wasn’t going to an AA meeting? 13 AP: No, he was using.  He pawned all through December 2011.  At the same time Dean’s mom was dying. 15 AS: When you say pawn, he was just taking things from the house? 6, 9, 12, 16 AP: Half the stuff we didn’t even know was gone. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 That was so foreign.  We finally figured out he was pawning from us. 12, 13 Dean looked for his drill and he couldn’t find it. 14 “I don’t know what happened to it.” 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m trying to remember. 16 AS: Your mom was dying? 15 AP: Dean’s mom was dying. 15 Dean had to go to Santa Fe to be with her.  While he was gone Spencer took all this other stuff. 9, 19 He confessed to me that he was pawning.  I threw him out of the house. 6, 9, 15 He spent the night at a friend of his. 12, 19 Then he came back. 19 I let him back in. 19 He ended up going through withdrawal. 12, 14 Then we started talking about treatment options with him. 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 This is right before Christmas. 9, 14 He had come home from Montana, $40,000 in hospital bills from doctor shopping. 13, 19 He would go saying he had a stomach ache caused by the appendicitis removal. 9, 11, 12 I think there were two hospitals and several clinics there.  He had no insurance here. 7 When you become a resident of another state and then come back to Minnesota you have to wait at least three months before you can get medical insurance. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 19 He was too old to be on ours. 20 We said, “You can go to the Salvation Army.”  Dean took him down.  This was right before Christmas. 9, 14 AS: He’d go to the Salvation Army for what?  AP: Treatment, Adult Rehabilitation Center near Harbor Lights.  Dean had done some volunteer work with it before.  He took him down there and started registering him. 9, 11 He just freaked out, he said, “This isn’t my type of environment.” 9, 12 We said, “You’ve got to go somewhere.”  He said, “What about The Retreat?” 16 We didn’t have the money, so we borrowed money from my mother.  They took him back. 19 Right after Christmas he went there. 9 He lasted a week before he started using. 9, 11 He got kicked out.  Then he entered, when he got kicked out of there, that’s when he decided to enter the Salvation Army rehab. 12, 19 He wasn’t too good for that.  He used with another resident. 9 That kid was four days from graduating from The Retreat and going into a sober house. 6, 9, 16, 19 So he detoxed at home between The Retreat and the Salvation Army. 10, 16, 19 AS: That’s how he got kicked out of the retreat? 16 AP: Yes, he called his dealer and he came right up there. 7, 13, 14, 19 AS: By this point he’s using heroin?  AP: He’s using heroin.  AS: Do you guys know this at this point, that he’s using heroin? 13, 14, 15 AP: At this point we know it was heroin. 13, 14, 15 We were totally shocked. 17 AS: What did heroin mean to you and Dean at the time?  AP: Heroin meant to me you lived under a bridge and you were from a bad family. 16, 18 You were brought up in a dysfunctional family, not to say that ours wasn’t. 9, 18 Not a mom and a dad living together, graduating from high school and going to college. 6, 8, 15 We were in shock.  It took me two years to tell people that he was a heroin addict, my friends. 12, 18, 20 It took me three years to go to Al-Anon. 20 I started with Al-Anon. 9, 11 Then I worked back over to Nar-Anon. 19 How many times has he relapsed? 18 I can’t tell you.  He went to Salvation Army.  He used. 9 Everybody there uses. 9 Then he was in and out of treatment. 9, 16 Do you want to know the details? 13, 14, 15 AS: Just how many times maybe. 9, 18 AP: He was in Teen Challenge twice, Salvation Army; he went to Fairview five or six times. 18 He went to Unity Hospital and then up to Cambridge to Dellwood.  Did Maddie ever go there?  AS: Close, but no.  AP: He went to someplace in St. Cloud. 11 He ended up living at Serenity Village for a while. 6, 12 Fairview was the most focused. 9, 15 Focus 12 was in St. Cloud.  He was at Cornerstone in St. Paul sober living. 6, 9 I think he was in treatment fifteen times. 9, 16, 18 Let me pause this.  DP: Ann was so frustrated at the end and frustrated with me because I didn’t follow the book. 9, 12 Now that he’s gone, her problem really is should she have been following the book. 12 AS: In what way? 16 What do you mean? 16 DP: No enabling, no help, you’ve got to draw the line, we’re hurting him, you’re not helping him. 6, 12, 13, 14 AS: You’re hurting him by helping him. 12, 13 DP: He needs to help himself. 13 She’s reevaluating whether or not that really…  AS: That’s what I’m coming up against.  That’s what I’m discovering.  DP: Then you say, “Where’s that line that allows you to fudge on this but not on that?” 6 You’ve got to do it case by case.  You’ve just got to live with the consequences of whatever happens. 9, 12 [Break in Recording]  AS: You were talking about all these treatments. 6, 9, 10, 16 Fifteen times. 18 How were you feeling as a mom? 15, 16 AP: I was so angry and I kept thinking, “Why isn’t this working?  What are we doing wrong?”  He was on Suboxone.  He was probably on Suboxone two years. 20 I’d always heard how controversial it was. 15, 16, 17 I especially heard at Teen Challenge, “That wasn’t acceptable. 15, 20 If you were really serious about it you should be able to do it without MAT.”  AS: Medication assisted treatment. 9, 10, 16 AP: It’s always that bullshit. 16, 17 AS: It’s so macho and has this kind of moral… 16, 17 AP: Stigma to it.  I just always felt so inadequate. 9, 12, 16, 17 I think that goes back to having an alcoholic dad and needing to control things and make sure people could survive alright when something bad is happening. 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I really attribute it to the growth in the Nar-Anon program for helping me discover who me is a lot. 13, 17 Where else did I want to go with this? 13 I felt so much judgement from my oldest sister who said, “This whole family needs to do tough love. 5, 9, 13, 17, 18, 20 That would solve everything if we just did tough love.” 9, 12, 13, 18 My oldest sister is a social worker and very well thought of. 5, 9, 11, 12, 20 How can you say something like that in the profession you’re in?  Maybe you’d like to come and say that to my Nar-Anon group and see how that goes over? 13, 19 AS: You’re being judged for helping too much because he keeps going to treatment and relapsing and treatment and relapsing and it’s not working? 9, 12, 13, 16, 18 AP: It’s not working and yet we have a relationship, a strong relationship. 9 AS: You and Spencer?  AP: And his dad.  AS: You were in some ways working on it together. 16, 17 Can you unpack that a little bit for me?  What you mean when you talk about enabling—a re you saying that at that point you felt you were doing too much, or are you saying that other people were telling you you were doing too much for him? 10, 11, 16, 17, 18 AP: Other people were telling me I was doing too much for him. 18 To some degree—this is the odd thing, especially since he’s gone now, doing things to stay close to your child, to have a relationship is so important to me. 9, 14, 16, 20 That’s what you do as family. 18 Because he has a disease like this you’re not supposed to do these things? 6, 16 I really detached from him, especially the last year before he died. 9, 20 I feel guilty about that. 16 I know that’s what you’re supposed to do to protect yourself, but I feel very guilty for that. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 I never went and saw him the last time he was in treatment. 9, 15, 16 Dean did most of that.  Even Jamie and Aidan went and saw him.  There’s so much guilt with that. 18 I’d get so angry at him.  I could not control my anger when some facets of addiction would come out. 13, 17, 19 That’s what I’m really trying to work through now, is the teaching some of these things. 14, 16 I don’t know if detachment is necessarily part of the twelve steps. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I think it’s grown out of the twelve steps. 9, 12, 17 Part of the teachings that they tell you in different family programs, or different books to help families of addicts is you need to detach. 13, 16, 17, 18 I don’t think that’s right. 14 I know you have to, to some degree, to protect yourself. 13, 14, 15, 20 I look back, should we have turned him into the police even? 7, 15, 19 AS: At what point?  AP: When he was stealing from us. 9, 10 We were being financially; I can’t tell you how much stuff we paid for out of pawning. 9, 18 We just couldn’t do it anymore. 9, 12, 13 AS: To get your things back? 16, 19 Because you didn’t want to call the police? 7, 13 AP: Right.  Then you feel, “Well, Shelley’s so independent. 12, 16 She was brought up to be very independent. 9, 12, 18 Why isn’t Spencer that way, too?” 16 They’re just two different kids, you know that intellectually. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 One of the things you feel guilty about, too, is never really realizing that recovery was not working. 15, 16 AS: You feel guilty that you didn’t realize? 14, 16 AP: What do you do in those situations? 13 Do you ship them off to Vancouver where they have a hospital where they allow addicts to continue to use but do it in a safe way? 9, 16 I don’t want to blame anybody, but there is no medical answer for it. 13, 14, 17 Suboxone wasn’t working for him.  Did he ever try methadone? 16 AP: Not legitimately, let me put it that way. 10, 16, 19 No, I don’t think he ever did.  AS: He was never monitored that way where you have to go in everyday and be drug tested? 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 AP: We talked about it a lot. 10, 11, 17 He was seeing an addiction psychiatrist for the last two or three years. 9, 20 I said, “Why didn’t Dr. Buchanan ever recommend methadone?” 12 Then he saw Dr. Amer previously to that.  He said, they just said he wasn’t a good candidate. 9, 12 They thought the Suboxone would be appropriate. 11, 12 AS: Do you think that’s a class designation, or racial and class designation? 20 AP: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: I feel like it could be. 16 AP: Your daughter and Sean are very successful at it. 5 Although I know Kim says it makes Sean sick a lot. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Maddie’s never been sick. 15 There was another couple in our St. Paul, well Tom and Jackie whose daughter was very successful on it. 5 AS: I feel like it’s a class and race-based decision that maybe people don’t realize their bias for it, or they think methadone is for the underclass. 9, 14, 16, 20 AP: The inner city. 20 That’s the zoning laws.  Right in federal law they say they can’t go into the suburbs.  AS: Methadone clinics?  AP: Yes.  I should go back and look at the law because it came up in our urban planning stuff. 9, 19 They have to be within so many miles or feet of a hospital.  There’s that methadone clinic up in Brooklyn Park, Valhalla, and Woodbury.  Maybe that’s close enough to that Woodbury Hospital. 20 There were some restrictions so they would never locate out in the suburbs. 9, 10, 15, 19 I see that a lot as being with the AIDS epidemic because there was so much prejudice, this was probably in the early ‘80s, about locating them in the suburbs. 10, 17, 18 AS: AIDS hospices.  AP: It was a big deal about group homes and where they should be located. 8, 10, 13, 19 AS: There’s a geography of addiction and recovery.  AP: Absolutely!  I’m surprised nobody has done any, maybe somebody has, but I haven’t seen anything about it. 9, 18 That would be a very interesting study to do. 9, 19 The only reason sober homes are out here now is because if they’re six or less they’re permitted as a right. 6, 14, 19 It’s no different than a single family home. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 They can’t discriminate.  There’s quite a few out here now. 14 AS: Let’s go back to where you were with your list of places and where the last few… 9, 11, 17, 19 AP: The last treatment program that he was in was a Fairview Lodging Plus. 9, 16 We had tried to get him in and this was a month before he died. 8, 10 [Interruption due to the vacuum cleaner]  AP: We tried to get him into St. Joe’s right before Christmas. 9, 10, 14 His MA insurance would only permit seven days of treatment. 7, 9, 16, 19 AS: Seven days? 15, 19 Do you think because he’d been in so many times, or what do you think? 18 AP: No, it’s MA Medica.  I wrote it down here.  AS: So January…  AP: He said, “MA Medica would only pay four to seven days of treatment.” 9, 16, 19 I said, “Do you have problems with other types of MA?”  He was on MA UCare and then the state dropped UCare and went to, I can’t remember, there are two more. 9, 14 One is Hennepin County, one is not very good.  It was only MA Medica that this counselor told me they had problem with. 10, 20 The other MAs they had no problems with thirty days of treatment. 9, 16, 19 I think this is when the Obama Treatment, Chemical Dependency Treatment protocols were rolling out too. 12 There’s probably some confusion between insurance and everything else. 7 Then we had to go back to Fairview. 19 He did well; he was excited to be there.  It was the first time he started talking about what he wanted to do in the future. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 He got real excited about becoming a counselor in the recovery. 10 He said, “I think I really want to do that.” 13 He even called the U while he was at Fairview to see what it would take to get into that program. 6, 7, 15 AS: This is in the winter?  AP: This was in February of this year. 20 Then at Fairview they were going to arrange for a sober house for him to go to. 6, 7, 9 He arranged with River Ridge to go to Glenview Lodge which is here in Minnetonka. 7 They kept him in Fairview another week because he was having problems finding a sober house. 6, 9 When he called River Ridge nobody would answer the phone the day he got out. 7, 19 So I got mad and called them. 7 The person that ran the sober home finally called Spencer back. 6, 7, 19 They talked and they mutually agreed that his sober home experience would be the same as what he’d just been through at Fairview. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 Then we had told them about New Heights sober home. 6, 19, 20 It was run by the drummer that is in the church band. 11, 14, 15 Spencer went and looked at it.  He said, “This is the first place I really feel comfortable.” 9, 11, 16 He had nothing but good things to say about that sober house. 6, 9, 16 He really liked it. 10, 18 He died Sunday, April 3. 19 He spent Thursday night; he and Jamie took the kids to a movie. 19 AS: Which kids?  AP: Aidan and Aidan’s half-sister, Sadie. 5, 9, 20 After Jamie threw Spencer out of the house in Montana she fell in love with this other guy and they got married like three months later. 6, 8, 9, 13, 15 He ended up being a drug addict, too. 12, 14 By the time she found out she was already pregnant with her daughter Sadie, she’ll be three in August. 5, 9 She ended up divorcing this guy. 12 Then she moved back to Minnesota. 8, 19 AS: So she’s here now? 14 AP: There’s a picture of her.  AS: So go back to when he moves in to this sober house that he liked. 6, 9, 10, 18, 19 How long was he there?  AP: He was there three weeks.  He liked his roommates. 7, 10, 18 He was going to IOP, intensive outpatient treatment, at New Way. 9, 15, 16 He had been to New Way before.  This was three years ago and they really changed. 16, 20 They’ve got new curriculum, new staff. 6, 9 It’s very good from what I hear from many sources.  He really liked it. 10, 18 That was so odd about how he died.  AS: Is he on any medicine at this point?  AP: He’s still on Suboxone. 9 He had just had a meeting with his psychiatrist. 9, 12, 13 He was over; he got his first pass for the weekend to spend time at our house with Aidan. 6, 9, 12, 19 You could see his personality again, everything coming through. 16 Saturday night, the night before he died, he asked me to shave his neck. 10, 19 He had his shirt off.  He had just taken a shower and he had gotten a haircut and he didn’t like what they did around the neck. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 I shaved it and I looked all over to see, nothing.  He was just my boy again. 9, 12 I don’t know what happened. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Talk about what you know happened between Saturday night and Sunday. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Talk about the timeline. 6 AP: Saturday night he had dinner with us. 19 He had gone to New Way on Saturday for a makeup session. 16, 19 He had met this new girlfriend, Maria. 5, 6, 12 I never met her. 5, 15 He had spent the day with her Wednesday. 19 He had hours to make up at New Way on Saturday. 11, 16, 19 He spent Friday night with us, with Aidan. 19 They had a ball. 8 Left to go to New Way, he came back here for dinner. 19 I heard his phone text messaging going off around nine o’clock. 7, 8, 15 He said he had to get back to the sober house by ten, his pass was over. 6, 9, 19 Then we thought he didn’t call on Sunday. 7, 11, 12, 19 He said he was going to call. 7 We didn’t think anything about it.  It was probably four in the afternoon.  It was a really nice day that Sunday. 19 Spencer was riding the bike with the neighborhood kids here. 8 AS: You mean Aidan? 16 AP: Aidan.  The groundskeeper at church came driving up with his girlfriend, we know them fairly well. 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 He’s a former coke addict. 17 He’s a really good friend of Greg’s. 12 He said, “Come in the house I have something terrible to tell you.” 6, 9, 15 I thought he had gotten kicked out of the sober home. 6, 11, 12, 15, 19 Dean and I were both there.  He said, “Spencer overdosed and died.” 15 I called my sister Susan to come over right away and Jane. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 They came over and Claire and then I called Jamie. 7, 19 Then we talked to the medical investigator. 9, 10, 11, 14 She said it was really odd when they found him because there was a needle next to his arm. 13 He was face down in the bathroom. 7 This is the first floor bathroom where everybody is coming and going. 7, 9 They had to jimmy the door open, it was locked. 17 The syringe was half full. 11 She said, “Usually you never find that. 15 They’ve used the whole syringe.” 9 She said, “We also found some vomit on his pillow upstairs. 9 We’re going to do a full autopsy on him.” 11 I had told them he was… 20 [Interruption due to vacuum cleaner]  AS: She was going to go ahead and do a full autopsy. 11 AP: She said, “We also found two packets of heroin in his wallet. 19 We’re able to lift the DNA off of it.  We’ve got a cell phone, too. 7 Do you happen to know what his passcode is?” 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: This is the medical examiner? 14 AP: Investigator. 9 AS: Let’s back up. 19 The owner of New Heights sober house comes to your house? 6, 9, 13, 19 AP: No, his friend. 12 AS: A friend of his who knew you from church. 6, 12 AP: Greg had called Dean’s cell phone and couldn’t get ahold of us. 7, 20 Greg is the owner of the house. 6, 9 He didn’t know how to get a hold of us when we didn’t have our cell phones. 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 That’s why he called his friend from our church. 7, 12 They were able to find our address. 14 He came over and told us, he and his girlfriend. 12, 19, 20 AS: Were you two alone?  Was Aidan here?  Aidan was here, he was out riding the bike.  We were just goofing around with him. 8, 9, 12 When they told us, some neighbor must have watched him; I have no idea who was taking care of him while this was going on. 7, 11, 17, 20 We called my sisters and then talked to the medical investigator. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14 Then they wondered if we had the passcode to Spencer’s phone. 7, 12 Aidan had given it to me right before Christmas because we had suspected that he was using. 6, 9, 14 We knew he was using. 6, 12 AS: Aidan told you what the passcode was? 20 AP: Spencer’s phone had some of his games on it. 7, 10 Aidan gave us the passcode.  They were able to get in his phone and go back and do the trace of telephone numbers, trying to find a person of interest. 7, 9, 16, 19 That’s those emails I showed you. 7 That’s all we know right now. 13, 14, 15 He lived with us the last two years. 9, 20 He probably was clean maybe six months. 8, 9 The way I figure it he probably started using again last summer. 9, 11, 13, 16 Benzos, heroin, pot, I don’t know what but he was using something other than heroin. 13, 14, 15 We had to call the police twice to come and get him because he was acting so goofy. 7, 10, 13, 19 AS: Goofy or violent?  AP: He was waving around and we wanted to take him to the hospital. 6, 8, 12, 13 He wouldn’t go with us to the emergency room. 7 He was just waving all over the place. 9, 11, 12 He could barely stand, could barely talk. 5, 9, 10, 12 The first time the police took him to Fairview detox. 7, 9, 10 They used a seventy-two hour hold. 9, 15, 20 “No problem at all based on our interview with him.” 6 At one thirty that morning we get a call from some kid down at the U who’s found him walking along the light-rail tracks. 7, 15 So Fairview released him.  He had obviously had his stomach pumped. 9 I don’t know what he took. 13, 14, 15 When I get his medical records, I haven’t done that yet. 6, 7, 14 Christmas 9 Eve it was just disgusting. 9, 12 Right before church…  AS: This past Christmas Eve? 9 AP: He had previously used. 9 He just went down like a pancake in the pew. 9, 12 You know how packed it usually is. 10, 13, 14, 15 We had the whole family over here, cousins, nieces, nephews. 5, 18 He had obviously used again and Jamie and the kids, everybody was here. 9 He would refuse to go upstairs. 9 We couldn’t bodily take him up, we weren’t strong enough. 6, 9, 20 He just sat there. 9, 12 My whole family was exposed to him. 18 I said, “This is just what addiction is. 9, 12 This is what they act like.” 10 Dean and I said, “Let’s just forget about being bothered by it.” 9, 12 This is what the disease manifests itself as. 9 At one point he was sitting next to my niece and said, “I don’t want to be this way at all. 13, 16 I’m so sorry. 10 I just don’t want to be this way.” 9, 12, 13, 16 He always wanted to go into treatment. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 He never fought it. 15 Probably two years ago, we had to throw him out. 20 He lived on the streets for a couple months. 8, 9 Maybe not even that long. 15 He got beat up.  He finally called and said, “I’m ready to go to treatment.” 7, 9, 16 As a mom I just know that he wasn’t going to recover. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I had his funeral planned out in my head for at least the last year, maybe even the last two years, Amy. 9, 15, 20 It was tearing Dean and I apart. 20 I felt bad as a mother not being able to protect my marriage from that. 17 Dean felt bad and I always would get upset with Dean because he was such an enabler. 16, 17, 19 But is that so wrong with what happens? 12 Then I have felt tremendous guilt because we don’t have to deal with the ramifications of heroin use anymore. 9, 10, 12, 13, 17 I can’t tell you what that feels like to not have to have that constant worry, that constant pain all the time. 9, 11, 16 We have the pain of not having him.  AS: So you feel guilty that you’re relieved? 16 AP: Yes.  AS: But being relieved means that your son is no longer in your life. 11, 16 AP: I remember the first time going back to Nar-Anon. 9, 19 I was walking out the door after, I think it was Christy, but she said, “I felt so bad for you. 9, 15, 17 Everybody went around the circle and here you don’t have your son anymore.” 13 But what I was feeling was that I’m so glad I don’t have to go through what they’re going through anymore. 13, 16 I felt always so inadequate in dealing with it; I thought I worked enough of them at home. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I know that some of these processes are—I was so totally confused with Rule 25, never having to deal with that. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17 What you do, getting so many conflicting answers?  I’d get so frustrated with the people I would talk to on the phone who would use acronyms for everything and think you knew. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 I was supposed to know what that meant and I didn’t. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 I was so frustrated in dealing with the insurance, trying to get ahold of the right person. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 So frustrated with dealing with counselors at different rehab facilities and knowing what they put in to try to help. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 What they give, the gifts they have. 6 AS: But you were frustrated with them? 9, 12 AP: Because I couldn’t get them to understand what he was going through. 9, 12, 16 I guess it all comes down to that I know so little about addiction but I know so much about it. 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 It’s so confusing to me.  As a mom I would never want any mother to go through this, even living through it with your child still being alive. 6, 9, 13, 15 In fact, I think it’s almost worse, unless they’re in successful recovery. 9, 10 AS: Even then it’s always on your back. 16, 17, 19 AP: It’s always in the back of your mind. 16, 17, 19 You’re never going to get rid of that feeling. 15, 16 I want to do something and I get angry. 13 It’s the anger, I felt so numb and angry these last three months since he’s died. 8, 9, 17 I’m angry because I can’t remember the good parts of it.  I’m so angry about the addiction parts of him.  I felt so numb. 17 I said, “How could this have happened?” 12, 13 Look at those pictures.  That a disease could be that insidious.  I often felt like, especially the last six months when he went off the deep end with using again, he’s dead but his body is still working. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20 Like a zombie.  AS: At what point would you say you started to detach from him? 9, 11 Was it like the last six months, back in the fall? 8, 9, 19 AP: Yes.  Even before then.  It was at least in August because I remember I was seeing a therapist at Hazleton. 6, 9, 19 We had gone through all these different techniques. 16, 17 She said, “I just don’t see that you need to see me anymore.” 9, 12, 13 Dean and I went back and I knew I had to break my ties with her, being an individual therapist, when Dean and I went to her. 6, 9, 12, 18, 19 Dean and Spence and I went to therapy in the fall and, this is off the tape, just this nincompoop. 9, 12 AS: We’ve had plenty of people talk about their inadequate professional support. 10, 20 AP: Spencer there,  “Don’t you realize he’s using?” 14 We’re sitting in a family therapy session. 13, 18 AS: At a renowned institution for recovery. 9, 14 AP: “Can’t you see the signs?  Can’t you pull him out of this?”  Then Dean and I started seeing her. 9, 11 AS: Not the same person?  Or the same person?  AP: The same person I saw.  Not the one for the three of us.  The good one.  I just love her. 9, 12, 13 She was able to get through with Dean about how this enabling was not helping. 13 Then looking back, I’ve had many conversations with the director of the family program at The Retreat now about this issue between when you’ve lost somebody, enabling, and detachment. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 They still don’t believe in MAT over at The Retreat. 9, 16 AS: I think we’re on the brink of change, at least some people I’ve talked to say we’re on the brink of change with it. 9, 10, 11, 16 You want to keep the addict alive as long as you can in hopes that they will recover. 10, 12, 13 The bottom with opioids is death. 10 There’s no coming up from that.  Can you go back a little bit about feeling; I wonder if last fall when you were so frustrated and angry with him, do you think that you just kind of maxed out? 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 That you just became so worn down and exhausted by the addiction that you had to detach to just maintain your sanity? 5, 9, 12, 19 AP: Yes.  AS: I don’t want to put words in your mouth. 10, 13 Before you jump ahead to enabling and the kind of critique of that, what was that like for you as a mother to get to that point? 16, 17 It’s years of addiction, it’s fifteen treatments. 6, 9, 16, 20 AP: What got me to that point?  I really started buying into the Twelve-Step program. 7, 9, 11 I really felt really tied in to, there’s nothing I can do to change this. 16, 17 I’m just going to take the fourth step out of here. 6, 9, 12, 20 I truly believe that in order for me to get healthy and to survive this I needed to rely on my higher power. 8, 13, 14, 15, 18 I started becoming very spiritual again and did a lot of reading on spiritualness; I read a lot of Karen Hesse’s stuff. 9, 11, 17 Really reading about not being able to deal with another person’s addiction. 11, 13 Her book, hearing her speak, just attending and doing more step work myself and thinking about it and doing more readings. 9, 11, 12, 15 I just knew I had to rely, for me, on God, my higher power. 6, 8, 9, 12, 15 I almost had an epiphany, I remember one day I woke up in the morning and I just felt, I knew it was black and white: there’s nothing I can do about this anymore. 6, 9, 12, 13, 17, 19 There’s absolutely nothing I can do.  It took me a long, long time to get there.  Mothering doesn’t work, nothing, there’s nothing I can do that’s stronger than heroin and what it does to my son. 9 The only thing stronger than me is God. 9 I thought if I can survive his death. 11, 12 I knew that’s what it was going to be, I’m just going to have to give in to God. 6, 9, 12 I think that’s when I felt detached. 17 I have to let God do his will with Spencer. 19 AS: Was there a little bit of peace in that?  AP: Yes, there was a lot of peace in that. 17 I hear messages coming from the outside.  That’s where you should feel guilty as a mom. 15, 16 You couldn’t be part of that peace.  I’m not explaining this very well.  I had no part in it anymore. 13 It was between Spencer and his higher power, or my God. 8, 15 I knew there was nothing I could do. 6, 12 That’s hard for a mom to say that. 11, 15 AS: It’s the opposite of how we’re trained and raised and feel. 5, 13, 16 AP: I was kind of a controlling person. 16, 17 Hopefully 11 I’m not that much anymore. 13, 18 That’s kind of the way I was brought up to be, I had to be controlling. 9, 16, 17, 18 I have no regrets about doing everything I was able to do.  I have no regrets that way at all. 16 I did too much or a lot. 17, 18 I know there was nothing more I could do. 13, 14, 15 I have great peace with that. 11 I have trouble remembering him before without drugs. 14 That’s what I have to work on in this next time, getting over the numbness and the anger of that.  AS: Do the pictures of him as a child help? 13 AP: This is the first time since the funeral that I’ve brought them out. 9, 18 AS: Thank you for sharing them.  Shelley said, “Mom, you’ve really got to look at these to make sure they’re okay before we put them out.” 10, 15, 16 The last seven years I had to look at those pictures, some obviously he was using. 9, 20 I wanted to make sure there weren’t any obviously using pictures there. 12, 13, 15, 16 I had recorded on my phone with him right before Christmas, of him flopped over on the couch, passed out from using, his head in his cereal bowl. 6, 7, 9, 14 AS: You had taken pictures of that? 6 AP: It helped for me to look at that. 13, 16 That might perpetuate the anger.  I don’t know how I feel about that right now. 13, 14, 15, 16 I’m trying to think of what else. 16 AS: I wanted to ask you something and now I just completely forgot. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 AP: I joined these other; they’re primarily mom sites, closed Facebook pages for parents or loved ones of addicts that are dead. 10, 13, 15, 16, 20 One is Grass, which is a national organization that doesn’t have a chapter in Minnesota.  It’s a Twelve-Step program for moms or anybody who’s lost a loved one. 9, 13, 15, 18 It’s primarily mothers.  It’s just so disgusting to look at, but it’s a very healthy site for people to vent. 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 AS: Why is it disgusting? 9 Because so many people have lost their children? 9, 14 AP: Yes, so many women or moms can’t get over it. 15, 18 I should show you some of the posts from it. 9 You probably can’t get on it.  Then there’s another one with Compassionate Friends, it’s the same way. 12, 16 I find there’s little support for people like me in the Twin Cities.  There’s Gloria’s group, but Dean can’t stand her. 9, 12 AS: I know what I was going to ask you. 13, 14, 15 You and Dean, what I heard is that you went to the sober house after Spencer died. 6, 9, 15 Can you talk about why you did that? 10 What happened, just for this record? 6, 9, 12, 13 What made you do that, what did you say and how was it received? 16 AP: I still don’t even know what time Spencer died at. 9, 13, 14, 15 It says so on the death certificate, it says two in the afternoon, but he probably died before that. 10 When Greg couldn’t get ahold of us, after we talked to the medical investigator we talked to Greg. 9, 10, 11, 14, 20 Greg told us that he was not in the house when Spencer died. 6, 9, 20 He was coming back from his church. 19 He didn’t get there until one.  All the residents there were traumatized.  There were about twenty vehicles and it was cornered off. 12 The police investigators had interviewed about eight of them. 6, 7, 9 He said, “I don’t know what to do about this. 13, 14, 15 I’ve got all these traumatized people.”  I said, “We can come over and talk to them.” 10, 13, 19 Greg said, “Would you?”  Dean and Shelley and I went over there Monday night, the day after Spencer died, which is when they always have their group meetings. 13, 16, 17, 19 It was packed.  We told them what we had been through and told them how we felt and told them how happy Spencer was at the sober house. 6, 9, 17, 20 How thankful he was that he was there. 13 We told them not to give up hope, there’s so much hope in recovery. 6, 10, 18, 20 Everybody was crying. 11 This beautiful girl, she was absolutely gorgeous, was just sobbing. 6, 9, 12 Saying, “I feel so bad for what I put my parents through.” 10, 16 So many of them said that.  A lot of these people that live in the sober home parents have disowned them because of the addiction and the collateral damage with addiction. 6, 10, 16, 17, 19 It was very soothing for Dean and I to hear the outreach that they gave. 13 Several of them came up to us afterwards and told us how much they liked Spencer, how kind he was and what a compassionate person he was, which was really helpful to me. 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 That’s how we brought him up to be. 9, 18 Then I had to have the person that found him show me everything and show me how he was laying when he was found.  I had to have his roommate show me his room. 7 I laid down in his bed to see what he would see when he was alive.  All this is helpful. 13 AS: Do you want to go inside so we can get Kleenex? 13 AP: Oh yes. 14 We’ve been back a couple times now. 14, 18, 19 I met a woman there, it was probably two or three weeks ago, that came up to me and said she went in to Fairview the same time that Spencer did. 5, 19 They developed a friend relationship. 12, 16 She just wanted me to know what impact Spencer had on her. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 She said, “I just remember Jamie and Aidan had just come back from his Boy Scout meeting. 9, 12, 13, 19 He was in his little Boy Scout outfit running around Fairview Recovery Plus floor.” 7, 11 Just hearing those things, I only can think of, sometimes I don’t want to hear stories from his friends from after high school because he stole from them or did something. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18 All I’ve heard is bad the last seven years just to hear something good is just so nice. 9, 12, 15, 20 AS: What did you do at his funeral?  You talked about how it took you two or three years to tell people that your son was an addict. 10, 11, 20 I think something changed in you by the time of his funeral. 16 AP: Yes.  We wanted J. R., our pastor, to be very open about addiction. 9, 12, 13, 17 You were gone. 19 AS: I was out of town. 19 AP: I can give you a CD of it if you want. 6, 13 AS: Yes.  It was a very kind of addiction based sermon. 16, 17 We just said we didn’t want to sugar coat anything about his life, but we want to celebrate his life. 9, 11, 12, 13 He had very good parts of his life. 11 He had a wonderful life until addiction took over. 11 It was kind of two parts. 16, 17 We had his good friend John talk. 10, 12 John talked a lot about the younger days and growing up and knowing what struggles Spencer went through. 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 Then Greg the sober home guy, he spoke too about addiction. 6, 19 There were a lot of people from his sober home in attendance. 6, 12, 15, 17, 19 I think four pews were filled with our people.  AS: From Nar-Anon?  AP: Yes.  Several of his high school friends attended and said, “We just knew what a good guy Spencer was before drugs took over. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 That’s the memories we have of him.”  I don’t know how many people; there were a lot of people there. 13, 14, 15, 17 At the end, J. R. just gave; we gave the hands on the back kind of thing and said the serenity prayers in closing. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19 That was very powerful. 15 gets so pissed off.  AS: This is your pastor? 9 AP: Our pastor. 9 This is the third heroin death since January. 20 AS: The third? 20 AP: Third or fourth. 20 Our church always hosts the stuff with The Retreat about recovery stuff. 9, 16, 17 AS: What church is it that you go to?  AP: It’s Wayzata Community, it’s a UCC church.  The only reason we started going there is because of Spencer’s addiction. 9, 11 A friend of mine goes, says, “You should come to the service with me. 12, 13, 19 It’s so calm and soothing.”  Then I met the building and grounds guy there, who’s a former addict. 5, 8, 17 AS: He ends up being friends with the sober house director. 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 AP: He knew Spencer because when Spencer worked landscaping that church was one of the places they had accounts. 6, 8, 11, 12, 17 It’s connecting the dots.  It was a very open; we didn’t want to cover up anything about addiction. 13, 17 Dean and I and Shelley have grown so much being open about it. 17, 18 We didn’t want Spencer’s death to be anything different from cancer or diabetes or anything else or have any stigma attached to it. 9, 13, 16, 17 There’s no reason not to talk about addiction as part of a celebration of a life event. 10, 11, 15 AS: Aidan is how old? 20 AP: Seven. 15 What does he know about the cause of his father’s death? 5, 9, 13, 14, 15 AP: We’ve tried to stay age appropriate with him. 9, 10 We’ve always told him since he was about three that his dad had a brain disease. 16, 17, 20 When he died we told him that he died in his sleep. 7, 20 I mean he wasn’t asleep I guess technically. 7, 10, 16 Aidan has been very quiet about his dad’s death.  We’ve been, every occasion we’re with him, we tell Spencer stories, funny stories. 9, 18 He loves hearing that. 13 I went to his end of the year first grade picnic and started talking to one of his best friend’s dads. 9, 10, 11, 12, 20 He said, “This kid just told me that Aidan’s dad died this morning. 9, 12, 20 I knew a kid in his class’s dad died. 6, 12, 20 I didn’t know it was Aidan’s died.” 13, 14, 15 I said, “What did he tell you he died of?”  “Brain disease.”  It was that morning that this little kid told his father. 5, 20 I said, “Well, that’s what we told him, but it was a heroin overdose.” 15, 20 The little kid’s dad is a special ed teacher at Minnetonka High School and deals a lot with kids who have had terrible anxiety either through relative’s addiction, their parents, or them dealing with it themselves. 10, 13, 15, 16, 17 He totally got it. 17 It was good having that conversation with him. 12 We told his Boy Scout leaders the true cause. 9, 20 I don’t know how to. 13, 14, 15 Jamie’s got the name of all these child psychiatrists, but she doesn’t feel the need to call them yet. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16 That’s probably okay.  His teacher at school, he’s had a male first grade teacher that has been very good for him. 8, 9, 20 He’s been wonderful.  I don’t know what to think. 13, 14, 15 Now I feel, I see Dean, we’re parenting his son. 10, 16 I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. 11, 13, 14, 15 We’re being more than grandparents. 7, 10, 16 Is he staying with you? 9, 19 AP: He stays with us like every three weekends because Jamie has to work those weekends. 9, 12, 19 We try to help her out throughout daycare and financially we’re helping him. 7, 13, 16, 18, 19 Although one of the best things we ever did was take out life insurance policies on the kids when they were babies. 6, 7, 9, 11, 16 We’ve been paying them up every year. 11, 16, 20 I would recommend that Maddie and Brandon take out an insurance policy. 6, 7, 12 I think we paid twenty-four dollars a month for years. 8, 20 I thought we stopped paying it but we didn’t. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20 Then now Aidan has Social Security. 14 Spencer was never able to financially support Aidan, very rarely. 15 We were always doing it. 16, 17 It’s good what he couldn’t provide in life he can provide in death now for his son. 11, 14 Part of the mothering or grandmothering is we have to take care of Aidan. 6, 7 We want to. 13 AS: Why are you kind of critical of that? 16, 17 AP: It gets back to that damn enabling thing. 13, 19 Am I enabling Jamie?  We’re helping her. 13 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I just want to get that word out of my vocabulary, that detachment right now. 9, 12, 13, 14 AS: I’m not a fan of them now. 14 Not after my tenth interview with mothers, you being number ten today. 6, 15, 19 I’m not seeing the benefit. 14 AP: I’ve never heard anything or read anything about mothering when your child dies. 15 Enabling and detachment aren’t a good thing.  AS: No, they don’t help us. 13 AP: Have you heard other mothers say that? 15 AS: Yes, many.  It seems to me there’s a continuum somehow, there’s like a measured kind of—I’m just thinking this out loud. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 When you get to a point mothering your addict child that you’ve done everything you feel you can possibly do then you have to save yourself and realize that your child has to figure this out on their own. 13, 14, 16 That’s where that pop psychology idea of enabling and codependency comes in. 11, 12, 13, 19 As parents we are codependent. 10, 12, 16 We’re dependent, our children are depending on us for their lives, and addiction just throws that whole thing into this strange… 7, 9, 12, 14 It’s like a hall of mirrors in a way for parents. 10, 16 In any other disease or disorder or mental illness, however you want to think about addiction, doing everything we can is completely and utterly acceptable and expected. 13, 14, 19 For some reason when we get into Twelve-Step program and this whole codependency thing, I think a lot of it comes from Al-Anon and spouses of addicts—that whole movement. 9, 12, 13, 17, 19 Doing the care work of your beloved addict, you become part of the problem instead of looking at addiction as the problem, lack of resources, lack of treatment, lack of money, lack of knowledge about addiction is the problem. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 It’s not the mothers and fathers wanting to help their children live to the other side of addiction. 5, 13, 14 That’s where I’m really, really thinking hard about this because it’s not working. 11 Yet, when I ask my daughter, she will say, “It had nothing to do with you, Mom. 5 Thank you for not giving up on me, but you could not have stopped me.” 9, 10, 11, 20 That’s the in between space that we need to talk more about. 10, 13 AP: Going back to the comment about forcing or allowing them to make decisions on their own. 16, 19 I feel that the disease robbed Spencer of the development of his frontal lobe. 16 So that he couldn’t reach that point. 13 He did make a comment when he was living on the streets, when we threw him out, that that made him realize he needed treatment. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 That was the best thing for him when we threw him out. 9, 15 It didn’t change him to grow anymore and develop breaks in his brain or other things that the frontal lobe produces. 13, 16, 17, 18 I don’t know that much about the brain science just what I’ve been taught. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 He could never survive that. 15 He could never develop those skills and make a turn around. 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 AS: He needed to be in sustained recovery for a very long time for that to happen. 9, 12, 13 Tomorrow he’ll be thirty-five.  AS: Tomorrow is Spencer’s birthday. 19 AP: Earth Day is what I’m calling it. 7 AS: That’s lovely, Ann. 13 AP: That’s when he came to earth. 19 AS: Should we stop? 9, 10 AP: Yes.  AS: Thank you.  AP: This has been so helpful to me. 13 AS: Your courage and your willingness to talk to me so fresh in grief, I just want to say I was not going to ask you. 9, 10, 12, 13 AS: Well, I was going to ask you months ago when I decided I was going to do this. 8, 12 When he died I realized, “I’m not going to bother her.” 14 Then you came back to Nar-Anon so quickly and I was getting to the end of my interviews and I thought, “If she’s at the meeting tonight I’m going to ask her.” 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 As a document in this moment that freshness of the grief is so powerful. 13, 15 I’m so grateful to you for being willing to talk about it and be so honest. 9, 10 Starting the Nar-Anon that you did two years ago, our connection in the St. Paul group, all of that has been, you’ve just been a really incredible force for a lot of people to feel at home in this turmoil that we live in. 9, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20 AP: I need to keep coming back. 12, 13, 19 Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit there anymore. 5, 13, 14, 16, 18 I need to be there. 13 I’d like to ask Barbara. 5 Did you interview Barbara? 5, 6 The one who came to our group right before Spencer died, who lost her son? 9, 14, 19 AP: Lost her son three years ago. 9, 20 I haven’t talked to her about this issue and I wanted to explore that. 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 AS: Which issue? 15 About enabling?  AP: Enabling and detachment and everything.  I guess I need to think about this some more. 10, 13 AS: She’s also three years out and you’re three months out. 8, 20 AP: Anyways, I don’t know if I told you, The Retreat is finally having a grief support group. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 It’s starting August 20. 9, 11 I don’t even know where to post it. 9, 13, 14, 15 I was going to post it on our Facebook page. 9, 20 They’re for people like me.  I’m really curious to see how they’re going to; it’s a Twelve-Step grief support, to see how that goes.  AS: Maybe just go and see if you like it before you start posting about it. 9, 10, 11, 12"
"18","Hilger_Chuck","Cody Petrich Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 10th, 2019 Macalester College Cody Petrich -CP Amy Sullivan -AS AS: Alright this is Amy Sullivan. 9, 14 It's May 10th, 2019.  I'm interviewing Cody Petrich? 6 [Pronouncing last name as Petri-ck]. 6, 9 CP: Petrich.  [Emphasizing pronunciation of last name is Petri-ch]. 6, 9 AS: Petrich.  I always get the names wrong. 6, 16, 17 And we are at Macalester College. 9 And, Cody could you just state your name, and spell your name? 6, 9, 12 CP: Yes.  AS: And say that you give me permission? 6 CP: Of course.  So, Cody is C-O-D-Y [spelling].  Petrich is P-E-T-R-I-C-H [spelling].  And, I give permission. 6 AS: Thank you.  Let's talk about... 10 tell me about your early life. 11 You're about to graduate from college, here at Macalester, here in a week. 8, 9 CP: Yes, yes, yes. 14 AS: So, let's go way back. 16, 19 CP: So yeah, I am in Saint Paul right now, but came from Lansing, Illinois. 10, 14, 19 It was, it's about twenty minutes south of downtown Chicago. 7, 19 Nestled up next to the border of Indiana. 8, 9 But, I was born in '97, in Lansing, and stayed eighteen years, at least the same street. 5, 9, 20 AS: Same house? 6, 9 CP: Yeah, furthest I moved was four houses down [both laughing]. 5, 6, 8, 9 There was a weird set up, at one point my Ma and Dad lived four houses away. 6, 9, 16, 17 And, we lost my ma's house, I just moved in with my dad down the road. 6, 8, 9, 12 Made it pretty easy to move [both laughing]. 5, 18 AS: Yeah I'll say.  CP: Didn't necessarily prepare me for the Minnesota move, but…  AS: Right.  So, tell me about your childhood. 11 CP: I was pretty happy. 17, 18 I was spoiled in a lot of ways. 16, 17 Very outdoorsy.  Yeah so, I think right around the time I started actually being cognizant—I was about five, I think. 9, 10, 11, 14 My ma and dad had gotten divorced at five. 5, 15 And so, I lived with my ma, my Aunt Tracy, my cousins, Uncle Rye, my brother Greg. 5 In a small little Cape Cod house. 6, 9 Big backyard, park across the street. 9, 19 I don't know, for the most part childhood was good. 11, 13, 14, 15 Allowed to go outside and play.  Do all that fun stuff. 9 AS: Could you roam around in the neighborhood? 8 CP: Oh yeah. 10 I still keep in contact with guys from a couple blocks down and around. 8, 9, 10, 12 Playing football, different things. 8, 16, 17 Started to get into sports a little later on.  But for the most part, just did school, came home and played, just did fun stuff. 8, 9, 12, 19 AS: How, how was school for you? 8 CP: Easy [both laughing]. 5 I guess I don't need to be cocky with it, but yeah I had a brother who was pretty focused with school. 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 18 And smart. 20 AS: Is he older? 5, 20 tell me about your siblings. 5 CP: Yeah he's older. 5, 20 Let's see I'm 21.  Lives in Colorado.  Got a wife and kid.  Doing his thing.  Yeah, so we have eight years difference. 20 And he's technically a half brother. 5, 7, 20 I think his dad is somewhere in Florida right now. 14 I really don't know if he's alive or dead or not. 13, 14, 15 He was a heroin addict himself.  But, I think my mom and Greg had moved from Florida back to Chicago to kind of get away from that. 8, 15, 16, 17, 19 So yeah, Greg was raised mostly with my dad and my ma. 5, 9, 10 Even when they split.  Then I've got an uncle who's actually my legal brother. 5, 10 My ma had taken custody of him when their ma had died. 6, 9 So she raised him from I think when he was like, somewhere between five and ten years old. 5, 10, 20 And, he's got another eight year difference from my brother. 5, 20 So, he's sixteen years older than me. 5, 20 Oh, okay.  CP: Eight, eight, and eight.  But yeah, I mean Greg stayed with us up until, up until he went to college. 5, 8, 9, 10, 16 He went to University of Iowa, doing an ROTC program. 13 My uncle Rye stayed with us, till he was like way too old [laughing]—twenty-five, twenty six. 5, 9, 16, 20 He was a little bit more of like a partie.  Funny guy.  My Aunt Tracey, and Lindsey—Lindsey is my cousin, but we grew up in the same room and stuff, so more sister-like to me. 5, 7, 9 I don't know when they moved out, but I think it was earlier on. 8, 13, 14, 15 Probably when I was like five, six, seven—around there. 8 And yeah. 10 My dad wasn't in the immediate house, the four houses down… 6, 9 until I was about sixth grade. 20 But, he stayed in the town regardless. 5, 9, 19 AS: Oh, so you grew up with going back and forth? 19 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 I think we did the good old court, back-and-forth every other weekend? 12, 19, 20 AS: By court, you mean the typical custody arrangement? 7, 9, 16 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And, like yeah, I guess like my ma and dad were never like best friends or high on each other. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 But, they got along enough for me not to ever have to deal with clashes between the two. 13, 20 So, I was very fortunate for that.  AS: Do you have any younger siblings? 5, 14 I had a younger step-brother for a little while. 5, 9, 12, 14 My ma's second husband, Rick. 15, 20 And his son was Ricky [both laughing]. 5 That was like a year, year and a half. 20 I don't know what's going on with those two either. 13, 14, 15 Not anymore. 13 AS: How was your teenage, how were your teenage years? 20 CP: Pretty angsty, I would say [laughing]. 5, 9 Typically angsty. 7, 9 I think it was right when I got into high school, close around there. 8, 14 Is when I had moved in with my dad. 8 AS: Did something precipitate that?  the house that we had got foreclosed down. 6, 9, 10 She was kind of at that point. 16, 17 I'm trying to think. 16 Yeah, I moved out of that house like middle of freshman year, that high school year. 6, 8, 9, 20 After having been out of the house for like a couple of months. 6, 8, 9 The prior summer I wanna say. 19 But yeah it's like, my ma had been clean from, I think she had a three and a half year sobriety time. 10, 20 Which I think was the longest for her since she had started. 9, 11 I think she had started when she was like fourteen. 9, 11 At least with cigarettes, I know that. 9, 13, 14, 15 She had heroin in the house and other drugs and stuff from when she had told me. 6, 9, 14, 20 But, I think seventh grade summer, or eighth grade summer, either or, she had, she was working construction at the time. 9, 15, 20 Making good money, feeling really good. 16 And like, whenever she wasn't working construction she was a server, or doing like cleaning. 9, 10, 15 But I think, whichever summer it was, she had gotten in an accident. 7, 15 Like a motor vehicle accident. 7 She was on her motorcycle, and some uninsured driver hit her. 7, 12, 14, 15 I think she had a contusion on one of her legs.  Yeah, so a bone was popping out and all that good stuff. 9 But she went to the hospital, got recovered from it. 12 I think successfully did whatever drug treatment she had chose for that. 9, 11, 14, 16 Little after that, relapsed. 18 And, I knew about some of the relapse… 6, 12, 18 Or, I didn't know up until the point. 13, 14, 15 But I did find her overdosed. 15 AS: Oh my gosh. 17 When you were a middle schooler? 8 CP: Yeah, either seventh grade summer or eighth grade summer. 15, 20 AS: Was that the first time you were aware of her drug use? 9, 14 AS: Oh, do you wanna back up? 19 CP: Yeah I can go back [both laughing]. 5, 19 I skipped a lot. 17 AS: Okay, my point is, I'm trying to have you not skip. 16 No it just takes a minute. 6, 9, 12 CP: Me and my ma were really close.  she was probably more open with me than she should have been. 17 Yeah I went to NA meetings with her, open groups, closed groups. 10, 13, 17 It was, her home group had a babysitter, nanny whatever you wanna call it. 5, 7, 13, 19 AS: So from how old do you remember going to meetings with her? 13, 20 CP: Ever since.  AS: Your whole life? 11 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 Obviously when she wasn't going to the meetings I wasn't going to the meetings. 13 AS: No. CP: But, yeah I met a lot, a lot of people. 5, 10, 17 'Cuz I mean, that's how my ma was. 16 Was when she was going to the meetings she was involved, and going to the cookouts, camping things. 8, 13, 16 So yeah, I think once I got up to middle school was when it was a little bit more tempoed. 8, 10 I definitely saw…  AS: What was more tempoed?  CP: Like, meeting attendance, and… 12, 13, 15 AS: That she didn't go anymore? 13 CP: No. And for whatever reason, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 She barked a lot of BS towards the end of the… 5, 12, 17 AS: So was the three years when you were a younger kid? 5, 14, 20 The three and a half years that you remember? 20 probably like fourth grade, fifth grade, up until she had the accident. 7, 20 AS: Like seventh grade? 15, 20 Oh, okay.

I wasn't aware at all really.  That she had relapsed prior. 18, 19 Obviously you find her overdosed 15 I knew what it was right away. 6, 12, 14, 16 AS: How did you know what an overdose was? 13, 14, 15 In eighth grade, whatever it was. 20 Seventh of eighth grade. 20 CP: I wanna say partially my ma, partially the town I grew up in, partially I mean just Chicago in general. 9, 12, 16, 19 I was cognizant of it, pretty early on that I knew my ma could die from that type of stuff. 6, 9, 12, 18 So yeah, I had found her in our bathroom, because I had to poop [both laughing]. 5, 7, 10 She, yeah just like the, it's a nasty sound, but like snoring pretty much. 9, 10, 12, 18 I had actually, someone relapsed at the sober house the other day so then, kinda just took me all the way back. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 So I mean, that incident went down. 16 And got in contact with family, got in contact with paramedics obviously. 10, 18 And, she was fine. 14 And, I don't remember if I had moved out right after that or not. 8, 14 I don't think I had, until like my dad pretty much gave me the option. 18 And, I didn't wanna leave, but you know she got back and things never really got better. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 And, you could just tell. 9, 12 Fricken’ house is dirty, and my ma would never have a dirty house. 6, 9, 15 Getting home late never was an issue, lack of communication, yada yada. 10, 15, 19 Up until the point where she just took off. 9, 12 Yeah, for I don't know like a year, two year stint. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 CP: From, what she told me, she was pushing. 20 She was pushing drugs from Chicago Heights to Champaign-Urbana, where U of I is. 14 And, she said she had been a lot of places. 11, 17 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 AS: So she was dealing? 13 CP: Yeah, and mostly, what she said, was just for her own fix. 9, 12, 16 She was staying in trap houses and... 6, 9, 19 She said luckily, she had met someone who was pretty much the operator of whatever was going on, and she said you know, relative to what it could have been, he was good to her. 5, 13, 14, 15, 18 And so, yeah. 10 She, I don't think she ever left Chicago, or the area, or Illinois.  But, I can't quite remember how we found her.  I know that there was jail time at some point, and calls from Cook County. 7, 13, 14, 15 I think it was my junior year, winter. 8, 20 Yeah winter break, my junior year of high school. 8, 18, 20 So, she had been gone. 19 She left that freshman year. 20 I really didn't…  AS: Wow.  And you didn't see her?  CP: No. AS: Were you ever in touch with her? 15 Did she ever call you, or? 7 CP: It's still blurry to me. 9 But, I'm pretty sure I got in touch with her. 15, 18 Earlier on, maybe a little bit more frequently. 9 'Cuz once we lost the house I knew she was… 6, 9, 12 I think she was living in, I forget the name of that damn town. 6, 13, 19 Somewhere in Chicago.  With her sober boyfriend's like apartment. 6, 10, 12, 20 He just kept an apartment for when he was working construction, so. 9, 12, 20 He'd come down to the city. 13, 19, 20 But, I don't remember too much. 18 It was, yeah like I said I had gotten calls. 7, 10, 15 I remember getting calls from the jail, the prison, being like, ""Sweet. 7, 10 At least now I know where she is.” 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: You're saying it was good, 'cuz you knew she was safe there? 6, 11, 12 Yeah and my ma was tough so I wasn't too worried about her being alright. 14, 18 AS: No that's a common feeling of relief among many people, at least they're somewhere… 9, 16 CP: Exactly. 10 where, at least they're not out on the street. 9 It was tough for me though, 'cuz I think I got a call. 7, 11, 18 'Cuz that type of stuff would mess up my day for… 9, 19 I mean, I thought about my ma a lot, but like I also had school, and I was achieving pretty highly with that. 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 And so, I had a good outlet. 19 I had that, and sports to kind of focus on. 15, 16, 17 But, yeah I remember getting that jail call was, I was at school at like six in the morning doing something. 7, 8, 10 And, I got that call, and it just fucked up the day. 7, 9, 12, 19 But yeah, trying to think. 10, 16 AS: So, you're a junior, and she comes back into your life? 8, 11, 13, 19 What happened? 12, 13 CP: Mhm.  That January she got into a treatment program, in-patient program, up in like Northern Chicago. 9, 16 Northern suburbs.  Really fancy program.  I don't know how the hell she got in [both laughing]. 5, 13, 14, 15 But, even before that I think she had tried another treatment center before that ‘'cuz I think I remember visiting her at another treatment center. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 I had also visited her at treatment centers before her three and a half year stint. 9, 12, 13, 16, 20 AS: Oh, when you were a little kid?  I remember that vaguely.  But, I think that was around the time my dad, her and my dad were getting divorced or what not. 5 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 Roughly around there. 8 I been to quite a few treatment centers, without having worked there like I do now. 9, 14, 16 AS: Yeah, right. 14 CP: Yeah, she had gotten clean that January. 15 And, she was kinda just trying to figure out where to go. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 You know it's a… 13, 14, 15 AS: 'Cuz she has no home. 19 CP: Nope.  No home. 19 AS: Now she has a record, criminal record. 6 CP: Yeah she had a record before, way before. 6, 16 I think she got picked up for paraphernalia.  I think that's what it was.  But, yeah she… 10 AS: Oh, so she never had a felony? 15 CP: I have no idea… 11 I wanna say…  no she is a felon.  'Cuz we couldn't get…  she wanted a gun, and she couldn't get a gun [both laughing]. 5, 12, 13 AS: Oh my gosh, wow. 14, 17 CP: But, I remember she got out of treatment, and were just, she was trying to just figure out what, I guess what the next move is. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 And, somehow, Ken her sober boyfriend—they had probably been dating for four or five years—they had met when she started working construction. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 20 He was still in the picture. 9 I talked with him last week actually. 9, 10, 11 But, he lives in northwest Illinois. 9 And so, my thought was, get her out there. 11, 12 And it's a hell of a drive to Chicago Heights to pick stuff up. 7, 9, 14 And, I think she was, with the same idea. 11 Not too sure if she was working construction, or waitressing, or what she was doing. 9, 15 But, she was working.  And, you know she'd come out to Chicago every now and again so we could hang out. 13, 14, 15, 19 And, she struggled, big time with that. 8, 9 AS: Was it just, do you know about her treatment? 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Was it just abstinence-based? 9, 12 Was she ever on any of the medications? 10 CP: Yeah, it was abstinence-based. 9 I don't know if she ever took psychotic drugs, or anti-psychotics… 13, 14, 15 AS: No, I mean did she ever take methadone or suboxone? 5, 6, 16 CP: Not to my knowledge. 13, 14, 15 I don't know, she was pretty old-school. 8, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 So, I don't know if she would've. 13, 14, 15 But, yeah. 10 And, I'm not too sure if she took other medications either for other stuff. 9, 10, 15 Yeah I know, when she was up there, I don't really know what the clean time would be for her, 'cuz I mean she was struggling. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: But she lived with Ken?  CP: Yeah, and Ken was good.  He was really old-fashioned. 20 I mean they were living in a town of six hundred people. 6, 16, 19 So, there wasn't no dope up there.  Or at least, not easily findable. 9 And, yeah. 10 Like I said, she made a lot of efforts to get back down to see me. 16, 17, 19 And like, you know it was rolling a dice every time I got to see her. 10, 13, 14, 15 It was either, she was…  I could tell if she was clean, or I could tell if she was high. 8 AS: You knew that? 6, 12 Yeah, from a long time.  A long history. 9 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And I remember going up there with my good friend Harry. 12 Harry grew up three blocks from us, and my ma was his ma.  Vice versa, whatever.  she was dopesick.  And, I knew that the whole weekend she was dopesick. 6, 12, 19 But, I forget why we wanted to go up there, we did. 12, 13 And, I think my ma was of the mind that we didn't have to drop Harry off in Iowa. 14 'Cuz he had moved by this time. 8 But, she wanted to cut the trip short. 12, 13, 16 A no brainer to me.  And Harry's like, ""Okay well, yeah I guess this could be a drive or whatever."" 7, 10, 14 And, my ma figures out that we have to drop Harry off, and it's gonna be this much longer. 13, 14, 18 And, yeah. 10 AS: She couldn't take it? 6 No, I mean she, we did it! 16 'Cuz she gotta get back to Chicago Heights somewhere. 19 But, that was the first time I had ever seen her be nasty to Harry. 9 And, unfortunately, that was the last time Harry had seen her. 9 And, so yeah that was tough for him. 10, 18 But yeah, that's just one instance. 9, 10, 12 I know there were other instances. 9, 13, 14, 15 She came down for a game, my junior year cuz 8, 19, 20 I was playing or what not.  AS: What sport were you playing?  CP: Football. 8 AS: Okay.  CP: Yeah, yeah I was. 10 Luckily got to play quarterback for four years. 20 Got to junior year, and started varsity which was cool. 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 20 AS: Mhm, that's cool. 17 CP: Very cool. 17 But yeah, she had came out for one of the games. 10, 19 It was a really nasty hotel over by the highway. 8, 9, 16 And, she had gotten a place there for the night. 11, 15, 19 And she was like, ""You know…"" 10, 13, 14, 15 I could tell she was doing good at the time, she wasn't high or anything, but she was like, ""Yeah you know you wanna come hang out, and spend the night here that's fine."" 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 And I was like, ""I really don't wanna be on those bedsheets, but that's fine."" 10, 14 And, so I hung out with her for a little while, and then left, hung out with some friends, came back, probably midnight to one. 12, 18, 19 And, door was locked.  And like, I couldn't get the damn door open. 10, 13, 17 I needed to get in there to sleep. 7, 13 But, she wasn't overdosed she was just really fricken’ high. 8, 9, 12, 15 She had nodded out.  And so, I remember that night. 19 That was bad for me.  I wasn't too sure what to do off the bat. 15 And eventually, just kinda knocking until she woke up. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 Yelling at her or whatever.  AS: Oh my gosh. 17 But, I don't think she remembers.  She probably don't remember it.  Or, didn't remember it.  AS: And you, you were able to get in there?  CP: Yeah, I got in there that night. 19 She had kinda slid [unclear]. 16, 17 And, yeah just another instance of us hanging out, or having our time, and she was using. 9, 10, 12, 18 AS: Right.  Even up like before she had passed, I think we had hung out the week, weekend before. 12, 19 She had overdosed on Thursday during football season. 8, 15, 19 So, fall of 2014.  Prior to that Thursday… 19 AS: Is that your senior year, '14? 20 CP: Yeah, so she was pretty steadily coming down on Thursday nights for football. 8, 9, 18, 19 We would have practice, do our pasta night or whatever, and then we'd be off for the night. 9, 10, 19 So I'd do practice, go to pasta night, lead prayer. 9, 10, 19 I wouldn't eat anything, I'd leave with her. 6 And we'd go to the movies, or go get dinner or something.  And, we went to the movies, and I really couldn't tell if she was or not.  I wasn't really trying to tell. 16 But, I just remember her like at the end of the night giving me a hug, and I wasn't good. 9, 11, 12, 19 Like, I could feel something was off. 16 And, she knew it too. 6, 12 But yeah… 10 AS: What do you mean she knew it too? 6, 12, 16 CP: I think she was a little ashamed.  I think she was high. 8 CP: And, I think she might have noticed that I hadn't noticed.  Which I usually do [laughs]. 10 I don't know… 13, 14, 15 that might be a little…  AS: What would you do when you noticed?  CP: It was better to be hanging out with her, than not to be. 18 AS: So you would just… 9, 12 would you say something to her, or?  CP: Mmm… no.  AS: So, when you say notice it's more of like, you two in your body language, and how well you knew each other. 6, 10, 12, 13 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And, I mean me and her had had talks about her use, I'd confronted her on more than one occasion. 9, 10, 14, 16 Pretty formally. 17 You know, I wasn't gonna talk to her when she's high. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15 'Cuz you know, I got a bunch of drunks in the family too. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 I don't talk to them when they're drunk. 10, 11, 14, 15 But, yeah like, I remember having a conversation out in Elizabeth, the northwest Illinois town. 9, 10, 12, 19 Very strong conversation. 9, 12 I remember going and confronting her.  That Chicago town, I forget the name of it. 6, 19 And, telling her like, pretty much just telling her, “I know you're using. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 What's your game plan?  At least you need to know that.” 9, 13, 14, 15 And, so yeah. 10 I must've probably talked to her, I was at least checking up at the time. 9, 10, 11 You know, ""How you been doing? 13, 14, 15 You been feeling alright?"" 14, 16 Yada, yada.  When she was coming out, and yeah, the week prior to her passing when we were hanging out, I knew she was struggling. 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19 AS: Was that when you hugged her?  What you were just talking about? 9, 10, 12 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And we had both driven separately to the movie theater. 7, 14, 20 So, I remember the hug, whatever.  She's tearing up.  And, she went back to her car, and just sat there for a while. 7, 9, 12, 19 And, I like couldn't leave. 6, 10 AS: 'Cuz you wanted to see her drive away? 7, 12, 13, 14, 16 CP: Yeah, mostly that. 9 Yeah, mostly that. 9 I had, she was staying with my uncle, I think I called my uncle that night. 7, 9, 19 I usually don't like, babysit or you know, I really hated having to make calls to check up on my own mother. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 So, I didn't very many times. 18 But, I remember calling Rye that night, and just being like, ""She make it?"" 7, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19 ""Okay, cool."" 17 AS: Oh, to see if she made it back. 16, 19 So, she was living with him at that point? 6 CP: No, she was just staying there. 9, 12, 19 This was one of her visits from northwest. 9, 12, 13 AS: Oh right, right. 14 Sorry.  Nah it's fine. 14 And so, yeah. 10 still made it to the game that week. 9, 16 We kinda did that, and went back up to Elizabeth. 16, 17, 19 But, yeah the next weekend was when she came down for her normal Thursday to hang out with me. 10, 12, 19 And, she just never made it. 9, 12, 15, 16 AS: She never made it to… ? 15, 16 AS: What did she, what happened? 12, 13 CP: Might have stopped off in Chicago Heights. 9, 10, 20 'Cuz Chicago Heights is right next door to Lansing. 14 I mean you can get dope from either spots, but, yeah she… 10, 16 I remember I called her that morning. 7 Didn't get a response.  AS: Called her Thursday? 19 CP: Yeah, that morning.  Just to see if she was coming out. 9 I had spoken to her the night before. 19 And, apparently her and Ken were not doing good. 10, 16, 18 Ken wasn't very honest with me up there. 9 She was living in a different place with three other girls, probably other servers. 6, 8, 11, 16, 17 But, yeah she sounded good, she sounded fine. 10, 14 That Wednesday night. 19 And then, called her Thursday morning. 7, 19 I'm like, ""Okay, whatever."" 10 Time keeps going, and I'm like, ""Okay, still haven't gotten a call."" 7, 9, 10, 12, 15 School finishes.  I have like an hour break in between school and practice. 8, 10, 18 Tried to give her a call again. 6, 7 Wasn't getting nothing.  Called Ken, to see if he had heard from her. 15 Called my uncle, ""You hear from her?""  Okay.  Finally, I get dressed, go to practice. 10, 14 And yeah, like did the whole practice. 10 Hour and a half goes by. 20 We're about to do our last thing for the day. 9, 19 I saw my uncle whip up, like with his car. 7 Right next to the practice field, which he probably hadn't been there since he had played himself. 8, 10 So, I knew, I knew something was up. 6, 12 Like I knew… 6, 12 AS: Was that Rye?  CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 I knew right away. 6, 12, 14, 16 So, he just gave me the ""choo-choo"" [imitating sound]. 9, 10, 12 Got to drive back to the… 7, 14, 19 to the locker room. 7 Got dressed. 14 Hopped in Rye's car. 7 And, Rye really didn't have to say nothing.  Like we, he gave me the rundown: ""She's at the hospital, she OD'd, they didn't find her till very late. 11 And so, she's in critical condition.""  Yada yada.  Comatosed.  But yeah, she had apparently went to Chicago Heights earlier that morning. 10, 16, 18 Picked up.  I think it was some form of speed ball. 8, 17 So, heroin and coke.  I think it was some old lady's apartment, in like a sky-rise. 20 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 Some lady must've either been crazy, or nice enough to let her up into the apartment. 16, 19, 20 I think she, I don't know if she got found inside or outside. 13, 14, 15 But, basically she had overdosed. 7, 11, 15 No one found her for a long time, and they found her when her body temp was like 91°, 92°, AS: Who found her?  Do you know? 13, 14, 15 CP: No clue.  No clue.  I didn't get enough answers on that, from my mom [unclear]. 15, 20 yeah. 10 AS: You went to the hospital?  CP: Mhm. AS: Where?  She was in Chicago Heights, in a hospital?  CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 So it was only ten, fifteen minutes from the house. 6, 7, 9 But, but yeah. 10 It was, that was Thursday. 19 And, she ended up passing away on Sunday. 12, 16, 19 Basically, since then had found her so low with the body temp and it took so long, there were like traumatic brain issues that she was gonna be experiencing, if we took her off life support, and she still came through. 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19 Even if she would've lived without the life support, she would have been more, for lack of a better term, like vegetable state. 9, 11 AS: Right.  CP: And so, we waited Thursday, Friday. 19 I think the neurologist met with her on Saturday, or Friday. 5, 9, 19 And, we got results Saturday. 19 And basically, it came down to me and Greg. 7, 11, 19 We had to make a decision. 16 AS: What was your decision? 16 I mean, what do you mean? 16 CP: Like, whether or not to keep her on life support or not. 11, 12 We knew… 6, 12 AS: But, if she came through. 19 CP: There was a chance that if we kept her on life support, that at some point she, her body would like regenerate, regenerate enough to be able… 10, 11, 20 AS: To stay alive without it… 9 Without it, yeah. 10 AS: Oh, I see what you're saying. 11 CP: But even if that was the case… 15 AS: Even if it did, she would never regain her full consciousness. 11, 15 CP: Mhm, for real yeah. 10 AS: So that was left to you and... CP: Me and my brother. 5 AS: Greg.  CP: Yeah, I don't know it, I mean obviously a very difficult decision. 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 Awful decision. 16 But, I, oddly enough me and ma had had conversations about it prior. 12, 19, 20 And so, I knew what the answer was. 6, 12 AS: You mean, what she would want? 13, 16 She had told me prior like she would not ever want to live, like highly debilitated or what not. 8, 13, 19, 20 AS: Right right. 14 CP: And, so yeah. 10 That was a real shit weekend. 12, 19 But we had family come up, all of her brothers and sister. 5, 9, 13, 18, 19 AS: Was that, so that was the fall of your senior year? 20 AS: When did she pass?  CP: October 19th.  And, yeah. 10 Nah, senior year from there on out was a little bit tougher. 18, 20 I've done through for me [unclear] a bunch of shit. 9 AS: Oh, yeah. 10 CP: Yeah and it was right in the middle of my senior year of football. 8, 14, 20 AS: And college applications… 8, 10 CP: College applications. 10 And so I, I just did my best to keep going with it. 9, 12 Did the burial and all that stuff. 9 And, had to figure out things to do with items. 13, 16 By that time she didn't have much. 18 When we lost the house she pretty much lost everything. 6, 9, 18 AS: And, that had been several years before, like three? 20 CP: Yeah, my freshman year. 20 Yeah, so three years prior. 19, 20 But yeah, that's, I think that's most of that. 10 AS: So how, how was your dad through all this?  Are you close to your dad?  CP: Yeah, we're closer now. 14 He's very, I guess business-like in a way. 9, 10, 16 Not, not in any overbearing manner.  He's very quiet and polite.  A little quieter than most.  But, yeah I mean he kinda let me do what I was choosing to do. 10, 16, 17, 19 I knew that I didn't have to mess with, you know what was going on with my ma. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 I could've stayed a distance, and you know processed whatever I had to process. 5, 9, 13, 14, 15 But, I had seen family members pull out of relationships with her, no contact with her. 10, 18 And, that pissed me off.  It was really just me and Ken. 9, 12 AS: Wow.  CP: Yeah, but as time, Greg.  Summer before my junior year, my brother got married in Alaska 'cuz he was stationed up there. 5, 8, 9, 20 My ma came with us. 19 My dad went out.  Whole family went up. 18 But, I think she was using at the time too up there.  She ended up, like not staying with my brother at their house, for a night or too. 5, 6, 9, 12, 19 Mostly 'cuz of an argument 'cuz Greg knew. 6, 9, 12 She went and stayed with some random lady. 5, 7, 9 AS: Wow.  CP: Very nice lady!  [Both laughing]. 5 She's, she's facebook friends with us. 12, 13, 18 But, there was a point to that, but.  AS: Oh, but it was about Greg and his relationship with her.  Greg had had enough. 20 And, you know, I never really blame Greg for you know, not being, trying to get his hands dirty in it. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 'Cuz you know, he's had two parents tap out from that. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: Oh, his father died? 5 Or just disappeared? 9, 12 Oh yeah that was who you… 10 right, you were saying at the beginning… 11, 14 CP: I don't know. 13, 14, 15 Last I heard of, whatever his name is… 6, 9, 15 he's a double amputee down in Florida from Hep-C, and needle sharing, and whatever. 10, 13 AS: Oh my goodness.  CP: Yeah, most I ever heard about the dude was you know, maybe a, ""Hey I'll come up for… 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I'm doing better now. 14 I'll come up for your grad!"" 13, 19 AS: And then he wouldn't show up.  CP: No [laughing], no. 5 And so, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I don't think I've ever had a conversation with Greg about… 12 me and Greg don't.  Even though I'm a psych major and all this stuff. 9, 18 My family's very much not. 18 Lot of Indiana roots. 8 Blue collar.  Union.  That type of work.  AS: Don't talk about stuff? 9, 10 Is that what you're saying? 11 To a degree yeah. 10, 20 I mean we, we always knew. 6, 12, 16, 17 Like  We always knew if Red was using or what not, but it's not like we were sitting down, and devising plans, or… 6, 12, 13, 16, 17 AS: If who was using?  AS: What'd you call her? 7 CP: Red.  AS: Red.  What was your mom's name? 6, 15 CP: Michelle.  Michelle  Horsely.  [Check spelling].  But yeah, we called her Big Red, 'cuz she was intimidating. 7, 10 Very skinny, but very intimidating [Sullivan laughing]. 5 Could clean her, but it didn't matter. 20 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 She laid the law.  Usually with like chores and stuff like that, but so yeah. 9, 10 I got a tattoo of her, and it doesn't have her real name. 6 But, it's just “Red” [laughing]. 5, 9, 12 It was a good nickname. 6, 8 CP: Right when I turned eighteen. 19 So, yeah the July following that senior year. 10, 12, 20 Before I came up here. 19 Trying to think if there's more.  AS: Do you need a break? 13, 18 AS: Okay, okay. …  AS: Okay we're back. 19 So, what I'm wondering, so you're eighteen, and it's your senior year. 20 What kind of support did you have? 16, 17 What kind of a support network did you have to kind of cope with all this? 16, 17 CP: Like immediate support.  I had a lot. 17 A lot. 17 Having grown up with, like in the same town for so long. 17, 19 Met a lot of people, and developed a lot of relationships. 16, 17 And I, I still keep in contact with a lot of those folk now days. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19 No, she had immediately passed, and social media is blowing up.  People are checking in, and all this stuff. 9 I got a lot of financial support from people. 17 CP: That, you know, whether I knew 'em or not. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Do you feel like people knew your… 6, 12, 16 they knew, because you were in a pretty small town for a long time, that they knew your mom's story? 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19 I mean was it… 16 CP: To a degree, yeah. 10, 20 And, I became a little bit more aware of other people's awareness as I was getting older. 5, 19, 20 And so, I think I got a little added support 'cuz of that.  And, a lot of it because people knew that my mom, she was a good people. 6, 12, 15, 17 But yeah, even when she had overdosed, like my eighth grade summer, she you know even the paramedic that came, I knew the paramedic. 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 I played ball with three of his sons. 8 Baseball with three of his sons for most of life. 8, 11 And so, I, yeah I remember sitting out like trunk, in the bed of some, my uncle's buddy's truck. 10, 11, 13 'Cuz they came over from the bar. 5, 19 One of 'em.  And I was just sitting there. 9, 12, 13 And, I was like, ""Fuck."" 10 Definitely when it happened people knew. 6, 12, 13 It wasn't necessarily a surprise, for any.  But, yeah. 10 AS: What about your mom's parents and her family? 10, 15, 16, 18 You mentioned that there was a lot of addiction in the family? 17, 18 Is that on her side?  CP: I don't know too much about my grandma. 7, 13, 14, 15, 18 And, I heard a little bit more about my grandpa. 7, 15 AS: Had they passed away already? 16 CP: Both of 'em are passed by this point.  So my ma I think passed away at forty-three. 16 Her ma passed away at forty-two, from I think it was a heart attack. 16 Complications with maybe substance, maybe not. 9, 10 But yeah, she had passed away at forty-two. 10, 16 So, I think my ma was nineteen at the time.  Took over custody of Rye. 9 And, her other siblings were old enough to pretty much do their own thing. 5, 18, 20 But, yeah. 10 Her dad was absent. 7 Picked up, and made a new family twenty minutes down the road. 6, 7, 9, 16, 18 Yep.  And so, I don't know too much about the dude, besides that. 13, 14, 15, 18 When I went back, I think I went with my uncles and my aunt to Portillos—very good Italian beef place. 8, 11, 19 We were talking about it, and apparently he had passed away. 10, 16, 18 But, I remember my ma telling stories about her... like they knew where he was. 6, 9, 12, 18 And, like showing up at the house and talking with his wife, and you know just not being able to see him. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 And so, yeah. 10 Unfortunately, like that wasn't like weird to me either ‘cuz I knew a lot of buddies and stuff whose fathers were absent. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 17 My best friend's father is you know, mainly absent. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Most of the guys around my block have dads absent. 7 But yeah, I mean as far as her childhood went, she, they... it was wild. 10, 11, 16, 17 I know that they didn't have the same opportunities that I did. 13, 14, 15 I wanna say she was, what they called home was Cedar Point, Indiana. 7, 8, 19 Which is like forty minutes, thirty minutes, into Indiana from Illinois. 7, 8 And, they'd bounce at a whole bunch. 9 But yeah, I think Cedar Point was their longest stint. 9, 10 And they just stayed in northwest Indiana, bouncing. 5, 8, 9, 12 AS: And then at nineteen, she's in charge of her little brother? 5, 17 CP: Yep.  CP: I wanna say like five or six.  CP: He was younger, but at that point you know, he knew what was going on. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 And, I think that, I think that's when she bounced to Arizona, or to Florida because she, she might've been nineteen, she might've been seventeen. 15 But, I do know that she was pregnant with Greg when she was nineteen. 13, 14, 15 And so, she had to have been in Florida.  Or maybe… 9 dude came up, and then went back to Florida. 19 AS: Yeah, yeah. 10 CP: She wasn't there for very long.  So yeah, like. 10 I don't think all of 'em had, like the same dad.  I think my mom's dad, she shared that dad with like two of her siblings. 5, 12, 15 And the other two had different dads. 16, 17 That dad's still in the picture. 9 I think.  So, my maybe grandpa. 7, 9 He lives in the backwoods of Indiana. 8, 19 He's fun [laughs].  CP: He could probably use some Macalester education, but that's okay. 9, 10 You said, he could probably use some Macalester education? 9, 10 [Laughing].  CP: Yeah, he's a funny dude, but I don't think…  he's not the most politically correct. 7 My cousin, she's mixed, 'cuz my Aunt Tracy married my Uncle Frank. 5, 7 And so, it's an inter-racial marriage.  And so, my Linsey's mixed, and I just remember going to cook out in high school at some point with Lindsey, and my aunt, and Frank, and they're doing karaoke [unclear]. 7, 8, 9, 12 End up saying the ""N-word"" multiple times. 11, 18 AS: Oh my gosh. 17 CP: But yeah. 10 So yeah, as far as her raising and all that. 10 They relied on each other a lot. 17 I mean, she was very close with my aunt and my three uncles. 16 Even though they're spread out.  AS: Your mom was close with her siblings, is that what you're saying? 5, 11, 15 Yeah, she was really the glue for our family as far as getting together or doing events. 15, 18 Doing like, you know, I was always, always had, always celebrated holidays. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 Always went to church. 16, 17 That type of stuff. 9 And, I can't say that about my uncles or my aunt.  AS: Oh I see, yeah. 10 CP: And so, she was very high, high productivity. 8 In a lot of areas. 17 But, I don't know where she learned that 'cuz I know her ma and dad weren't, not necessarily the most engaged. 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 But, the one thing that they do tell me about my grandma, my ma's ma, was that she just like, was a very like, loving person. 7, 9, 10, 12 Showed it in different ways. 16, 17 Strict with little things, chores and she never really monitored homework or anything for me, 'cuz she didn't have to. 12, 15, 16, 19 But, you know I… 13, 14, 15 multiple occasions not being able to go out 'cuz I gotta go whack a bush down or something. 9 I got put to work quite a bit. 10 She was incredibly loving. 12 Not even just like her family, but I mean she, from what I consider pretty racist roots in Indiana, prejudiced roots in Indiana, I think her lived experience, and her relationship with her ma, kind of allowed for her to talk to me more about like, people who don't look like us, or who have less, or more, or yada yada. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 And so she passed that down to me pretty well. 18 AS: That's an awesome thing.  CP: Yeah, it was sweet.  She was pretty crazy for some ways, she'll talk to anybody. 10, 16, 17, 18 Like I said, when we were in Alaska, she had no idea who this woman was. 11 And, for some reason, that woman has probably posted on my ma's wall more than anyone! 9 AS: Really?  Oh my gosh [laughing]. 5, 17 CP: I think, she showed a, the lady didn't want anything. 7, 13 They went to bed, and my ma cleaned the entire place. 11 Like that's just how she was. 9, 12 AS: Very outgoing CP: Outgoing, and she worked for, she could appreciate a good day's work. 19 And, she passed that along to me.  I think that's probably as much as I really know about the childhood. 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 Also impressed 'cuz I heard that they used to get their asses whooped quite a bit. 9, 15 I never got a finger laid on me. 15 Ever, no.  Some stern talkings, but… 9, 10 AS: That's different. 16, 17 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 AS: So how was it for you at Macalester? 9 CP: It's been awful. 10 It's really been awful. 10 CP: I don't necessarily think it's Macalester or anything. 9 I just don't think I was ready. 9, 12 I think, I was pretty spoiled as far as support back home. 18, 19 Knowing where I'm gonna be, where I'm gonna eat, and all these things. 14, 16 And, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I just like, didn't do too well with due diligence. 9, 10, 12 Like, planning how I was gonna be living up here. 6 AS: You mean, once you weren't in the dorms? 16 CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 You know, I had no cookbook, none of that stuff. 9, 13, 14, 15 And, a lot of it I had to learn. 12, 17 And still learning. 9, 12 back home like, even though my ma had passed from overdose. 10, 15, 19 It's not, like anything like, crazy. 10, 16 It's a little crazy up here. 16 Like guys…  you can just see it in the face. 9, 12 AS: What's crazy here? 16 What do you mean? 16 CP: To me, the lack of loss.  Sometimes. 5, 18 AS: The lack of laws, or loss?  CP: Loss, loss.  AS: What do you mean by that? 16 Like I say, 'cuz I mean, even with hearing like how my ma was raised, and family stuff. 5, 9, 15, 16, 18 Like I knew a lot of broken families back home. 5, 6, 12, 17, 19 Know a lot of people who had family struggles that were very different from mine, but like you still understand the struggle a little bit. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 Us coming from a pretty lower socio-economic area… 18 AS: … school. 8 CP: I was never really exposed to much money. 15, 18 I didn't take too many drives on northside of Chicago, or any of that stuff. 6, 7, 9, 14 So, from what like, from what I knew and understood, that's just kinda how life was. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 I knew there was different, different classes and what not. 6, 8, 12, 16, 17, 20 But I just hadn't interacted with 'em very much. 9, 10, 12, 18 And so, that was tough for me. 18 AS: When you came here, because people had, are coming from… 19 CP: Yeah, some money.  AS: … a lot of money. 17 CP: Yeah, you know full families. 11, 13, 14, 15 They don't have to worry about, you know, food in the morning or, that type of stuff. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 And so, yeah it was difficult kind of managing my own like emotional regulation and stuff. 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 20 It really didn't matter to me whether I was, whether the person was trying to be nice or a dick [unclear] to me, I just had a deep hate, a deep hate for that type of stuff. 9, 12, 16, 20 AS: A deep hate for?  CP: For people with money, really.  And that's just something that I've been working on these four years. 9, 12, 20 If you weren't exposed to it, what was it about it that made… ? 16 I knew that… 6, 12 it was probably less so in the dorms.  I mean, my first two years were fine. 9, 14, 16, 20 Most of my struggles were self-inflicted. 9 You know, getting too drunk or being disrespectful to the wrong person or something. 11, 13, 14, 15 But, once I got out of the dorms.  You know, having to go pick up groceries, having to buy notebooks, and books, and… 7, 13, 14, 15 lot of frustration with just how my family had rallied around the death. 9, 12, 17, 18 Like I said, my ma was the glue.  And so, without her, I mean. 16 No one's getting on the other people's case to do the right thing, or what I would perceive to be the right thing. 14 AS: Did you have, have you had support from your family while you've been here, or you've been kind of alone? 16, 17, 18 CP: A lot of alone, a lot of alone. 17 In my eyes. 14, 16 You know, I do call. 7, 13, 14, 15 I call [laughs]. 7 A twenty-one year old dude, you know calling aunts, uncles. 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 And you know, it's always the same: ""Well, yeah we're real proud of you."" 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Yada, yada.  But, that doesn't feed me in the morning.  It doesn't prepare me for school. 8 so, has being here been a financial burden for you?  CP: Huge, huge financial burden.  AS: With loans, and, I mean or did you have… ? 16 CP: Yeah, loans…  this was the best option. 9 I mean, I wasn't gonna bust butt in high school and grade school, 'cuz I was, I don't know for whatever reason I thought college would really warrant the full twelve year track, but no. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 Yeah, I wasn't gonna bust butt in high school and not go to a college… 8, 9 CP: That was good [unclear]  Especially Mac.  Ultimately, I picked Mac 'cuz of the financial aid that it offered. 12 And, it's enough. 20 It's close to the full tuition. 11 Wow.  CP: First two years, I had to cover room and board. 5, 7, 9, 20 And, I'm still covering a little bit now. 9, 14 But, you know that's… 13, 14, 15 AS: That's impressive.  CP: Yeah, yeah! 10 And I mean, I have had it easy in certain areas. 16 Like, my dad pays my rent. 16 I take care of utilities. 6, 7 You know, work on the weekends. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 I get paid, you know a pretty good for twenty-one years old. 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 And so like, we make it happen, but it's tight [laughs]. 10, 12, 16 I've had to go to food banks, I've had people drop off food for me. 14 I just, like, it's just… 9, 10, 12 knowing that other people don't have to do that stuff. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: That resentment, that's hard. 7, 11 CP: Yeah, deal with that stress. 9, 13 AS: Do you think, do you see an insensitivity? 13 CP: At times, oh yeah! 10, 18 AS: … of your peers towards that?  CP: At times. 18 Or just lack of understanding? 9, 12, 16 But, I mean I'm also smart enough to know it's not 'cuz of, you know how much money their family makes, it's the individual person. 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 And so, I've just had to remind myself that a lot. 9, 12, 17 Unfortunately I've got some roommates that aren't very sensitive to it. 7, 13 And so, that, that hasn't been great. 11 I made a bad roommate decision coming out of the dorms, staying with friends as opposed to good roommates. 7, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 AS: Oh, that's a hard lesson, isn't it? 11 CP: Very hard lesson. 11 And, we're still learning 'cuz we gotta get the house cleaned up. 6, 9, 12 But, you know, one of my guys, his dad's a lawyer and his ma teaches, and they do well. 13, 14, 15 Like he, he gets it.  Like, we don't necessarily sit there and do cry sessions with each other, but he understands when he's pushing something too far. 9, 12, 13, 16 Whereas, I got two guys who live upstairs that are just dumb. 9, 12 I hear about their stories: ""Oh yeah, didn't always live in Scottsdale next to this Arizona Cardinal's player."" 9, 10, 16, 17, 18 ""Tell me more.""  AS: So Cody, I know that you have been working in a sober house. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 Or, sober living. 6 And then, you also just mentioned getting drunk. 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 So what is your, what's your relationship to substances? 9 And then what, how did you end up getting, working in a… 12 AS: I realize those are probably two different… 14, 16, 17 they might be two different stories, they might be the same! 9, 16, 17, 18 but it's an important question to ask. 6, 9 So yeah, I… 10 my biggest issue with substance right now is nicotine. 8, 9, 11, 14, 15 I've been chewing, smoking, vaping, since fourteen pretty steadily. 9, 18 And unfortunately, it's a substance that I just like haven't gotten around to do anything about. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15 On the other hand, you know alcohol. 13, 14, 15 I was drinking a lot in high school, which is weird to say. 6, 8, 14, 17 Why does that seem weird? 19 CP: It just like, I get up here, and I hear about the things about drinking, you know sex, and just like initial exposure to that type of stuff. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: When people just get to college, they're just being exposed? 8, 9, 12 CP: I was fourteen, and I was doing really not fourteen year old things. 16, 20 But, it's natural like in that type of environment I suppose.  If you're not disciplined—I wasn't very disciplined. 6 And so, yeah. 10 I've drank, smoked weed, you know I've tried… 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17 what have I tried. 10 Some psychedelics, I've tried coke on one night—and that's really the only hard drug that I've tried. 10, 11, 14, 19 But, all of that was early.  You know, high school. 8, 13, 14, 15 AS: In high school? 8 CP: High school was drinking, smoking. 6, 8, 14 College still smoked, drank, but it was really my first two years where I was like, you know I've always known that I had this, I wanted to work in the field, and I don't wanna work as a hypocrite. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 And so, you know, my first two years… 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 AS: You wanna work in the addiction field?  CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And so, I was still getting blacked out drunk and all that in freshman and sophomore year. 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 20 To a point where like, the issues that were coming from were just too much for me to want to deal with. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 And so I, I was able to cut back on binge drinking, pretty wildly and pretty quickly. 6, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 To the point where like I'm, you I'm in bed at ten, eleven PM on Fridays and Saturdays now. 14, 19 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 And yeah, I'll still go out to the bars and stuff, but I couldn't tell you the last time I got unbearably drunk. 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 And you know, I do still, still smoke, but not as frequently as I used to. 9, 13, 14, 15 And it's always been something that's a little different for me, it's more social interaction and stuff. 9, 10, 16, 17 But you know I've, if I know I'm working Monday through Friday, you won't see me drinking or smoking, you know day prior throughout that week. 6, 13, 14, 15, 19 And, right now, I've just been doing weekends. 9, 12, 14, 19 So, kind of hard to use mind-altering substance during school, like during the weekdays. 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 And, during the weekends I just, something innate in me, like I have that discipline. 6, 9, 12, 19 AS: Yeah, you're able to regulate it?  CP: Yeah, yeah. 10 And it's to the point now where I really don't even… 14, 15 like drinking is a chore. 6, 14 I feel old, for whatever reason. 16, 20 It was a little scary my sophomore year, and I kinda had to have my own talk with myself. 7, 8, 10, 16, 17, 20 Unfortunately I've seen different sorts of addictions, and they don't map out well. 16, 17 Especially drinking with my ma's side. 6, 14 AS: In your family? 18 Oh yeah, yeah. 10 CP: Yeah, I have people who…  my uncles always said, you know, ""Red's gone. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I'll step up."" 9, 12 Bullshit, you're not gonna step up. 9, 12 You're still drinking. 6, 9, 14 oh 'cuz she died, he's gonna get clean?  CP: Well, no.  Not even necessarily. 15 He doesn't think he has an issue. 15 He just ""drinks."" 6, 9, 12, 14 AS: He'll step up to be there for you? 9, 12 And like, you know, trying to bring family closer: 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 ""We'll do this on the weekend."" 12, 19 It's just bullshit. 9, 12 Like, he works a lot which I get. 14, 17 But, he likes to go to the bars, and drink as a hobby. 5, 6, 10, 14 I mean that's the activity. 10, 16 It's not anything else.  He's a large man.  He's been up in the three hundreds. 12, 14 I've had to drag him around before… 8, 14 AS: Oh my gosh. 17 CP: … or try! 16 And it's just ugly stuff. 9, 12 And I have the two roommates right now, that are still going hard drinking. 6, 7, 9, 11, 14 You know, Monday night, Wednesday, Tuesday… 13, 14, 15, 19 whatever it doesn't matter. 20 Even after asking 'em not to. 13 You know, whether it's for my sleep 'cuz the living room is right above my room. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 Or 'cuz...  I, I tell 'em.  I get, I get frustrated. 9, 12 And frustrated is probably a nice way to put it. 9, 10, 12, 16 Like, if you're drunk, and you're spouting… 11, 14, 15 like I've dealt with that way too many times for me to want to put up with you. 10, 13, 16, 18 And so, yeah, mostly seeing a lot of stuff, and then being a part of some issues. 9, 10, 14, 15, 17 After not being cognizant or what not, kinda led me to get away from it myself. 16, 17 Also, knowing that I was going in the field. 13, 14, 15 AS: Yeah, your exposure. 15 So when did you start being interested in working in… ? 9, 11, 19 Like third grade. 20 AS: In drug treatment? 9, 14, 16 CP: Early, early.  AS: Third grade? 20 CP: Promise, I promise.  I always liked the idea of like, being a counselor and having like a really comfy chair. 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 But no, I knew my ma's therapist back then. 6, 9, 12, 19 And she, she was just like a badass lady. 9, 10, 12 I still, I talked with her this week. 9, 10, 11 It's Jan.  But, she's an addictions counselor back in, back in Chicago. 10, 19 But she does all sorts of different therapies. 16, 17 Like family, and trauma, this and that. 18 I actually saw her for a little while after, after my ma had passed. 10 With the seven hundred dollars that I had gotten from social security, whatever it was. 15 AS: Oh yeah, oh my gosh. 10, 17 That's what you got?  AS: From social security?  CP: I've been learning quick that there aren't… 12 no one's gonna give you nothin' unless you build it, as far as money. 6 CP: Yeah, so that was a nasty taste. 9 But, yeah I saw her for a little while. 10 And, I knew her prior. 6, 12, 19 She had spoken at the funeral. 19 Really, really enjoyed my ma.  But yeah, I met her when we were young, and like saw her house. 5, 6, 9, 10, 14 And I was like, ""This house is sweet."" 6, 9, 10 And, she was cool. 17 She was a little bit more like, hard-headed than other… 10, 11 what I had thought of counselors, you know? 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 She was probably the only person that I knew would tell my ma, like different. 6, 12, 16, 17 Like you know, ""No you're wrong. 13, 14, 15 Period.""  AS: Oh instead of just listening, kind of placidly? 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 CP: No, she was about work.  You know. 13, 14, 15 Getting stuff done. 9 AS: Figuring your stuff out. 9 CP: Absolutely.  And so, I liked that idea. 10, 11, 18 And, I never really gotten away with it… 15, 16 or gotten away from it. 15, 16 I've always been good at the math. 16, 17 So I was like, also trying to flirt with the idea of like being an Econ major. 10, 11, 16, 18 I liked the idea of having lots of money. 5, 10, 11, 17, 18 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 But, I didn't really care about the work. 7 But, I got away from that pretty, pretty quickly, so. 9, 16, 18 AS: So, when did you start working in the sober living? 6, 9, 11 CP: So this is a year and five months. 8, 20 So, January of 2018.  And yeah, I've pretty much worked every shift you could work over there. 8, 10, 18 During the summer I was full-time. 11 Well they sign me for full-time which is nice 'cuz of benefits and stuff. 9, 11, 14 AS: Oh, so you're a full-time? 11 You work full-time? 11 CP: Not currently, but they still keep me on so I can keep the benefits. 9, 12, 14, 16 AS: Oh, that's fantastic. 9 CP: It's been sweet.  Sweet to see things, like build. 16 AS: And where is it that you work?  CP: Supportive Living Solutions.  The recovery program has the Arrigoni Houses. 9 So, Arrigoni East, and Arrigoni West. 9 East is in Saint Paul, and West is in Minneapolis, like next to the U's ""frat bro."" 9 Which is kind of funny. 16, 17 CP: So, I work mostly at East, but you know I've been over to West. 9, 13, 14, 15 They put me on consistent schedules over there at times, and I fill in a lot. 9, 10, 15, 17, 18 What's your job?  CP: So, say I'm there during the day, during like business hours, along with like having to you know kinda oversee our clients, I'm also trying to recruit new ones, and build waitlists. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 But, currently what my shits have been is weekend mornings. 12, 16, 19 And so that's more just, you know client focused and facility focused. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Lot of it is, you know medication administration. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 Making sure the guys are taking their meds at the right time. 14, 15 Case management.  I've got eight- I think eight right now- eight of the twenty-nine guys in there, will meet with me weekly to go over like what's going on, and cover some basics. 13, 14 You know: ""Eating? 13, 14, 15 Sleeping?  Feel alright? 14 making your appointments?  Do we need to make an appointment?"" 13, 16 Yada, yada.  I oversee the accountability program.  So, making sure the guys are taking care of their responsibilities in the house. 6, 7, 9, 15 Making sure that they're, you know, that their hygiene is fine. 13, 14, 15 That they're washing their sheets once a week, and they're making their meetings that we require, and I guess just like general supervision. 9, 10, 12, 13 We don't offer program in the house. 6, 9 We have like a Tuesday night AA meeting, Thursday night NA meeting. 13, 19 But, some guest speakers on Monday sometimes. 5, 9, 18, 19 But by and large, like the guys are either going out and doing out-patient programs with Saint Joes, Meridian, or you know just making regular meetings on their own. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 We don't require that they do AA, NA.  Really anything that's I guess self-help. 10, 13 So like therapy sessions count for outside meetings, meditations... although not, people don't really do it. 13 What else, guys will go to Church on Sunday, some of 'em. 19 But, yeah no it's been really cool. 10, 17 And like I've done a lot of different things. 16, 17 AS: Different jobs in that, with that business? 9, 16 CP: Yeah I mean, one day I'll be you know trying to touch base with other service providers to see if they've got people that want to get in. 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Some nights 19 I'll just show up, pass meds, really not doing much. 9, 12, 18 If the guys are doing their house jobs I don't really have to do anything. 6, 9 AS: You don't do night shifts do you? 8, 19 Oh okay.  AS: Do you have to stay awake for those? 9 CP: No. AS: No. CP: No. AS: Just have to be in the house? 6, 9 CP: I've had night shifts where I've slept for the five full hours. 8, 11, 19 I've had 'em where I get waken up an hour after for whatever reason.  And like, yeah. 10 It's just so much variability. 9, 12, 18 And, kinda learning just like what those service providers, like... it's a lot. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 It can be a lot. 17 And unfortunately the system that we have in place now, not too many people are incentivised 'cuz you're not getting paid much. 8, 9, 11, 14, 18 And so, you really rely on a couple of really good staffers. 9 I've just tried to do my best to kind of pick up if there is slack on the weekends, try to pick up slack on the weekends. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19 AS: And do you see the job as informing you about what you would want to do in the future? 13, 17 what're you thinking about your future right now? 14 CP: It hasn't deterred me from wanting to do it. 12, 13 AS: Oh no, that wasn't my question. 6, 9 AS: But, sorry! 10 I didn't know… 13, 14, 15 CP: I think I don't want to stay in residential living. 6, 9, 13 AS: Oh, okay.  Right.  It hasn't deterred you from addiction as a field to work in, but you don't... oh sorry. 10, 12 CP: I still want to go get a degree at some point so I could find that comfortable chair. 9, 12, 13, 20 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 AS: Get a…  like another Psych degree? 20 Or an MSW, or something?  CP: Some sort of degree that's gonna... 17, 20 AS: Counseling?  CP: … allow me to counsel.  Right now what I've been looking at is Masters in Social Work. 9, 14 Quick cheap way to get to counseling. 16 And I do like the idea of you know resource allocation. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 But, still gotta do more research on that and I don't know. 9, 13, 14, 15 It's, it's tough because like I know when I leave here there's just like, there's certain things that I feel like I bring to the table 'cuz of lived experience. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 CP: For example, we had a guy... 6 They switched me from my Saturday, Sunday morning shifts to the evening shifts, so that my replacement could just kinda get used to it. 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 And she's bright, and I'm glad that we got her. 14 She's a certified social worker during the week, but no.  That night shift that Saturday, or no, that Sunday. 8, 19 I'm supposed to get off at midnight. 6, 19 I didn't leave until 1:30, 1:45. 6 I caught a dude smoking meth in the, in the bathroom. 5, 7 And so, similar thing with my ma.  I could hear that frickin' snore.  And so, immediately I'm thinking I gotta...  AS: A snore from meth? 5 CP: Yeah the dude, I'm guessing… 10 I can't see behind the door, but…  AS: Right.  CP: You know, I was trying to close a window 'cuz we have a sensor on it. 13, 14, 15, 16 I got, armed the alarm.  And, it's midnight. 19 I'm trying to get out of this facility. 16 And, yeah like couldn't get in that bathroom all night. 7, 10, 19 And, I just figured like, bad timing, bad timing. 9, 12, 13 Kept happening. 12, 13 But, I also knew that there was two dudes that I hadn't seen all day. 6, 12, 19 And like, sometimes it's just like that. 5, 9, 10, 12, 18 Other times, it's usually not. 10, 18 So, one of the guys got home. 19 And I was like, ""Okay, whatever."" 10 And, yeah so, my plan was to go shut that window, walk down the hall, make sure that dude had gotten home. 10, 15, 16, 19 I didn't even make it to his room 'cuz I, once I heard the snore, I was like ""Okay well, he's using in the bathroom, and he's fallen asleep."" 7, 15, 16 And so I: [Mimics knocking sound]. 10 Knocked on the door.  ""Steph!""  I was like ""[unclear]  Blah, blah, blah.  Open up!""  And he goes, still snoring. 9 [Mimics knocking sound]. 10 I finally got him to wake up with the banging, 'cuz you know I was like, ""Dude I'm coming in."" 10, 13, 14, 15 Once I knew he was, wasn't just OD'd. 6, 9, 12 You know he'd woken up, and I could hear him trying to talk to me again. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I know he's scared, very scared. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 He's about to lose housing.  And so I, and I'm mad 'cuz I wanna leave. 6 I'm human, and I don't wanna be there dealing with this. 13 But, I go yeah, I'm like, ""You got five seconds dude, I'm coming in. 10, 20 Make sure your pants are up. 15 Whatever, I don't wanna see it.""  And, he turns on the shower. 19 And I was like, ""[Unclear]"" Okay, well that's fine. 10, 14 And so, instead of you know, going in there, and like pulling the dude out, I let him shower. 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I let him take the ten, fifteen minute shower. 6, 15, 19 Sat by the stairs, played with the cat that we have. 8, 9, 10 Waited for him to be done.  Still hadn't came out after I heard the water was off, and I was like, okay I'm coming in. 6, 10, 15, 19 And so I came in, got him out, and it was a long process. 19 I could have very easily let him shower, went and called the cab, had it ready, and shipped him off like right away. 7, 14, 16, 19 AS: Shipped him just to wherever? 9, 12 Just leave? 6, 9 CP: The detox. 10 AS: Oh, the detox. 10 Oh, okay.  CP: 'Cuz if you're intoxicated in there you got two options. 7, 10 You got family or friends to come pick you up, or shipping you to detox. 10, 12, 13, 18, 19 We just can't have you high in the facility. 8, 9, 12 And I've had guys, you know high on meth, high, or drunk, or smoked out, or whatever, in there and you know I never had an instance where the guys, I felt that they were a danger to me or to the other guys in the house. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 Granted, still can't have you in there messing like... 7, 9, 10 I don't want other guys to be urging or whatever. 13 But, at the same time, I try to you know, still like allow some dignity to happen within the process. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 And so, I brought the client down, asked him questions I had to ask like: ""Are you intoxicated?"" 6, 9, 10, 18 ""Yes.""  ""Were you smoking meth in the bathroom?"" 5, 7 ""No."" ""I really want you to be honest with me. 9, 13 ‘Cuz if you're not honest, it's bad."" 9 And, I just, he wasn't able to give me that answer. 6, 9, 12 We knew. 6, 12 And, later found his pipes or whatever.  But, you know. 13, 14, 15 I did more than just like, I couldn't be mad at him. 9, 10, 12 The guy was, has a mental health issue. 14, 15 He's been out of meds, for you know a week or two. 13, 14, 15 And, it's a pretty serious mental health condition. 14, 18 AS: He's been out of his medication? 10 CP: Not taking it.  AS: Oh. CP: Could be insurance, could be his own not wanting to take it. 6, 7, 13 It was insurance. 7 I did more follow up with it, and yeah he just hadn't gotten his card. 7, 9, 10, 12, 15 AS: So what happened? 12, 13 CP: It's hard to say. 11 AS: Is he still there? 9 No he got discharged. 17 Yeah, I mean it's a pretty clear rule from when you come in. 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 You use in the facility, you got… 9 we'll bring you back. 19 You got ninety days, but we're not gonna bring you back right away. 14, 16, 19 AS: You have ninety days what? 19 To come back? 13, 19 CP: Out of the facility to, you have to wait ninety days, if you got discharged. 17, 19 AS: Oh, oh I see.  Because of drug use. 9, 14 But I mean guys relapse, and it's not an immediate discharge. 16, 17, 18 We've brought a lot of guys back. 9, 17, 18, 19 We just try to preach, you know like honesty. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Mostly honestly. 9, 16 That's really…  if you tell us that you're relapsed, we'll work with you. 18 Now if it's more frequent and stuff, maybe that bed is probably just better for someone who's a little bit more ready to work it. 9, 12 But, I mean that's always been my thing. 16, 17 You know, if there's people in the house using, we gotta get 'em out so that people who are ready to work the stuff can get here. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 And, even if they're using in the house, you know what I mean, this is probably the only place where they're not gonna be getting crazy chewed up by the people, and judged, and all that stuff, so it's like... 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 I've had, I had another guy who was very high on meth. 5, 8 Call [unclear]  Got him to admit.  It's midday. 19 But, I still let him go up to his room and pack. 7, 9, 19 Still let him eat the meal with us. 19 You know, supper, but make sure sure he gets something in his stomach before you know, you go sit in detox, or you go sit with this family member that like really doesn't want you in the house. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 So yeah. 10 Just seeing the side of my ma, and like and I don't know sensing dejection that she received, all that stuff. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 I get that like it's a fricken' nuisance.  Like, people being high is a nuisance. 8 But, same time it's, you know there's a lot of other shit that goes on with it. 13, 14, 15, 17 Yeah, I just try to keep that in mind when I'm working. 9, 12, 16 AS: They're people.  Absolutely, absolutely.  And so yeah, I don't wanna be disrespecting them any more than I would a regular person. 10 Or someone without substance abuse problems. 9 And that was another thing is that I've learned from it. 12, 17 I really like the field because unfortunately substance really doesn't discriminate. 9, 10 You can be wherever in life, and if you fall into a pattern or whatnot, it's a tough thing to get rid of. 11, 18 It's gonna be sad going, a little bit. 12 AS: Leaving the work?  CP: Leaving the place, yeah. 10, 11 AS: When's your last day? 9, 19 CP: Sunday night. 19 CP: Yeah so I'm just hoping no one's smoking meth in the bathroom. 5, 7, 9, 12 [Sullivan laughing]. 5 I'd be frickin mad.  AS: Your wish for your last day at the job, on the job. 9, 19 CP: And, it's very infrequent.  AS: Is meth the main thing that you… ?  AS: Oh it's just everything. 9, 12 Yeah pretty much. 18 I've had another guys in there.  I had a guy my age in there for weed.  You know if you're a weed smoker, then you start thinking about some things. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: What do you mean? 16 CP: Yeah, I'm like, well it can be an issue. 10, 15 Yeah, yeah it could be an issue. 10, 15 AS: Right right. 14 CP: Yada, yada.  But, yeah it's, I don't know. 10, 13, 14, 15 It's been a crazy ride. 6, 16 And, I've enjoyed it.  And, it's been challenging and easy at some days. 19 I just hope that… 9, 10, 12 'cuz I do believe the Arigoni houses— especially East here in Saint Paul— is probably one of the best government funded programs, residential programs that you could get into. 6, 9, 20 So, I just, I hope that the two main staff members don't get more overworked than they already are. 9, 10, 12 And that they're able to stay. 9 I know the guys benefit from it. 13, 14, 15 AS: How many live there?  AS: Wow!  And then, Minneapolis one is either thirty-one or thirty-two.  So, yeah very rare to, like guys are using in the facility. 10 But I mean, that does happen, and I've driven guys that we've discharged over to the next facility. 7, 12, 14, 16, 17 Or, seen what that looks like. 10 And I'm like, ""Shit."" 10 Not where I would wanna be.  AS: Right, right. 14 CP: So yeah. 10 AS: That's good.  Anything else you wanna say?  CP: Can't think of nothing, no.  AS: Thank you.  It's really a pleasure. 15 I'm really, I feel really fortunate to have had you in class, and to have you willing to talk about this. 10, 16, 20 It's a hard topic, but I think you're… 11 I'm sure you're doing your mom proud. 15 CP: Trying!  [Petrich laughing]. 5 Definitely trying. 16 We'll continue it.  Definitely continue it.  AS: Thank you. "
"19","Holman_Deb","Kim Powers Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer July 5, 2016 Minneapolis, Minnesota Kim Powers-KP  Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan in my home in Minneapolis interviewing Kim Powers on July 5, 2016. 6, 19 Kim could you state your name and just say that you give me permission to record this interview? 6, 9, 12 KP: This is Kim Powers, and I give Amy complete permission to record this conversation. 6, 12, 19 AS: Thank you.  Like I was saying before, could you just start by talking about your own childhood? 9, 10, 11, 12 Talk about your childhood and just some highlights from it. 8, 9, 11, 12 Where were you raised, your education, did you go to college, your career, how you had Shawn? 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 KP: Okay.  I was born in Sioux City, Iowa.  My dad was in the Air Force.  We lived there like six months. 8 It really doesn’t count.  I was always embarrassed that I was born in Sioux City, Iowa. 5, 16, 17 We moved to the Twin Cities, my parents and I. 8, 10, 16 I was first born and we moved to Mendota Heights. 8, 9, 12 I spent most of my early years, until I was about twelve, in Mendota Heights. 12, 19, 20 Nice neighborhood, big yard, lots of close friends. 5, 8, 12, 17, 18 That type of thing.  My parents’ marriage was pretty rocky from the beginning. 10, 16, 18 If I was to look at their parenting I would say that my mother was extremely distracted with what my dad was doing. 9, 10, 16 She also lost her father, she lost a baby. 5, 9 KP: After me, yes. 14 She had a child that was born with spina bifida that lived about six months and died at that point. 8 I think emotionally she had a lot of trauma going on during that period of time. 13, 17 But with a two year old, you’re kind of left to fend for yourself, not a lot of conversation ever about what was happening or comfort in that. 12, 13, 16, 17, 20 AS: Do you remember that?  KP: No, I can’t remember any of that.  I think we were planned to be almost exactly two years apart. 9, 10, 20 I’m a March baby, my sister’s April, and my brother’s May. 5, 9 It was planned in my dad’s mind.  How crazy that is? 16 AS: A year apart, or more? 20 KP: Two years apart. 20 AS: Two years each, okay. 20 KP: Because of the loss of Dale, my brother, there was a gap. 5 My sister is four years younger and then I have a brother that’s two years younger than her. 5, 9, 14, 20 I mean we had a lot of family friends; we did family ski vacations, and the cabin. 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 Now Shawn is fourth generation of going to the cabin. 20 It’s been in our family for a really long time. 18 That was always a special place. 11, 16, 17 My dad wasn’t very present. 7 My mom was kind of the, she single parented in some regards because it turns out he had a whole other life outside of his marriage with someone else. 6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: What did he do for a living after the Air Force? 6 KP: He was a stockbroker. 9 A very matriarchal mother who kind of called all the shots in their marriage for a long period of time, from what I understand. 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 Once he was independent when she died he gambled all that money away. 12, 16 There was a form of addiction in my family that I didn’t realize at the time, but absolutely he had a gambling addiction whether he’d admit it or not. 14, 17, 18 It became extremely apparent through the rest of his life. 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 19 He died this spring, he had nothing.  AS: Did they stay married? 9 KP: No, the divorce was when I was about twenty-five.  They were married twenty-three years and not happily. 20 Odd dynamics, no communication, but just nonverbal cues. 9, 10, 12 I think between the three of us kids I think we would have wished they were divorced earlier because I don’t think we thought my mom was being treated fairly or respectfully. 5, 11, 12, 15, 16 AS: When did you find out about the affair?  How old were you? 20 KP: Thirty-three when I found out.  I went through college. 8 I went to high school, graduated from college, moved to California after working for Dayton’s for a while, I was recruited out of college. 8 I moved to California, I was there about seven years. 8, 20 Shawn was born when I was thirty-three, at the tail end of that period of time. 12 She was not planned and I was not married to her father. 5 We agreed it was one of those crazy, wild drunk nights that she was conceived. 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 Our relationship was kind of on and off. 16, 17 I found out right after Thanksgiving. 11, 14 We decided that we financially… 12 We were not going to get married.  I looked at this very much as going into it as a single parent. 10, 15, 16, 18 I mean, I felt like I had a choice whether to have the child if I was ready or to abort the pregnancy. 16, 17 We both were on the same page. 20 She was born in July of 1990.  She’s almost twenty-six. 9 We decided at that point to get married. 12 We were going to move to Minnesota.  His family, there’s addiction in his family. 18 He has two nieces that have gone through severe heroin addiction.  They’re now clean. 14 Both of them are clean for a period of time.  You know it’s odd because I don’t know if you interview your perspective husband about all the family dynamics, in illness and mental illness. 6, 13, 14, 15, 18 I would have never even have thought about doing that. 11, 12, 15 There was a lot of craziness on his side of the family. 17, 18 AS: Romance kind of rules. 12, 16, 17 KP: It does, it overrides. 6 We were going to move to Minnesota.  We came back, we planned a wedding. 19 I called it off the night before. 7, 19 It just wasn’t the right reason to get married. 9, 12, 14 Having a child in our lives was not the right reason to get married. 14 AS: She was born by this point?  KP: She was born in July; this was December.  AS: The December after she was born?  KP: Yes.  His friends were outrageous at the groom’s dinner. 7, 12, 18 They were drunk; they were talking about taking him out to get him laid at the strip clubs in front of my grandparents and my family. 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18 I just kind of went, “He’s got no spine. 9, 12, 16, 17 I can’t have a father,” which relates to my own father, “in Shawn’s life that’s not going…” 5, 11 It was not the right reason. 14 They were toasting to, “Oh my parents got married because of the kid.” 9, 10, 16 All these other things and I called it off the night before. 7, 16, 19 No regrets, but drama. 14 AS: That is really strong of you. 9 I had so much support after. 18 I just felt crazy at the time. 9, 12, 16, 17 It was a really good decision. 16 It was a higher power situation. 8, 13, 15 AS: You also were not in your teens or your twenties.  KP: I had a career, I travelled. 7, 11 Exactly. 10 KP: Anyways, Shawn and I, after that, moved to Minnesota to be with my family. 8, 16, 17, 18 I was a single mom; my parents helped tremendously. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 The family dynamic was great. 11, 18 I went back to work probably when she was close to nine months to a year. 8, 19, 20 I had that time with her.  I was pretty traumatized by the calling off of the wedding. 7, 18 I was pretty distressed during that period of time. 9, 18 Her childhood was good. 11 We moved into a townhome, she had lots of friends. 5, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19 She was happy, really very curious about everything, details and people. 17 She’d remember things. 16 A happy kid. 17 I remember someone telling me that if you have a happy kid you’re going to have a hell of a teenager. 17 Seriously, I do remember.  I’ve never forgotten. 15 I’ve never forgotten that statement. 9, 15 AS: What a terrible thing to say. 15 KP: I know. 13, 14, 15 Does it set you up? 17 Then you mentally start thinking that way. 9, 11, 14, 16 I’ve never forgotten it. 15 She had a lot of anxiety. 17 She used to have tremendous anxiety about public bathrooms. 7, 9, 12 She also had anxiety, every time we’d get in the car she’d have to pee. 7 Wherever we were we had to find a bathroom. 7 The grocery store, Walgreens, a coffee shop, whatever. 5, 9 It was a really odd kind of social anxiety maybe. 9, 16, 17 When I talk about that now, that’s definitely what’s going on right now. 10, 14 Tremendous amount of recovery. 12, 18 Or maybe I’m figuring that out, or she’s just starting to feel again. 9, 11, 12, 16 I think that’s true.  It’s certainly not easy going through the sober aspect. 6, 9 I’m not sure she’s clean. 15 I question that, some of the behaviors and stuff. 6, 9 They just feel too familiar. 9, 12, 16 AS: Talk about her as a teenager and you as a mom. 15 So you’re working full-time, here in the Cities? 11 KP: Yes.  When she was in elementary we lived in Minnetonka.  I bought a house in Minnetonka, a great neighborhood. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 It was all about creating an environment where she would be healthy and have friends. 12, 14, 18 A good neighborhood, she was happy and active and everything through middle school, I mean grade school. 8, 10, 16, 17, 20 I met somebody and I got married. 5 His name was Kevin and we moved from Minnetonka, which is where we were really grounded—that was a mistake in my mind—we moved to Mahtomedi as she was going into middle school. 6, 8, 9 She inherited two step-brothers. 5, 9, 12 I think they were ten, eleven, and twelve at the time. 15 She was in the middle, two boys. 8 They did not get along for a long time.  My husband’s ex-wife was very angry that he got married to somebody that had a daughter. 5, 15 Just as Shawn was going into middle school, that exact transitional time. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 I think uprooting her at that point and my…  I think I remember packing in our house in Minnetonka and saying, “I wonder when I’m ever going to come out of this box. 6, 9, 11, 13, 19 Where is Kim going?  How is this going to work?  We’ve been so happy here, going through this transition.” 7, 13, 17 We moved into a very volatile situation, ex-wife showing up at the house. 6, 8, 9, 13 The boys, whenever Kevin would try to discipline them, called the police. 6, 7, 8, 15, 16 A lot of drama around that. 14, 17 AS: They would call the police on their father? 5, 7 KP: Yes.  He cared so much about them. 7, 11, 12, 18 He had them fifty percent of the time.  Anytime he did something or raised his voice or whatever they would call the police. 5, 7 Or they’d call their mom. 7, 15 It was unpleasant.  When she had a man in her life it was a little bit easier, but they were jealous of Shawn. 11 They thought she was spoiled rotten. 11, 12, 15 AS: The boys were? 8 KP: Yes.  We had a beautiful home with a pool. 6, 19 She had a great group of friends, popular, well-liked. 10, 11, 12, 18 She was playing hockey then.  She was on the hockey team.  They didn’t like any of that for quite a while. 10 Until I got to a point where we had some dialogue.  I just said, “I’m not your mom. 9, 12, 15 I don’t want to be your mom. 13, 15 You think I spoil Shawn, I’ll spoil you too if you let me. 19 I’d rather be your friend.” 12, 13 I never liked the term step-mom. 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 It had negative connotations for me.  During that period of time Shawn started hanging out with some more kind of bad boy types. 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 People that were getting in trouble, not doing well in school, shooting paintballs at somebody, or throwing toilet paper in the school, things like that. 8, 16, 19 There was a transition that happened during that period of time. 7, 12, 13 Kevin and I, we weren’t married very long, it was less than three years. 20 Shawn and I stayed in Mahtomedi, moved into a neighborhood close by. 5, 8, 9 That transitional time seems to be a huge change. 7, 13, 16, 19 What I pinpoint, she doesn’t agree with that.  She doesn’t think it’s the divorce, the moving into a smaller house. 6, 9 It was less prestigious; people didn’t hang out as much because we didn’t have a pool. 9, 18, 19 AS: That didn’t bother her?  KP: She says it doesn’t.  I think it did.  It just really—there was a big shift. 8, 9, 12 AS: At the time you saw that it did.  KP: I felt it. 17 Her behavior started changing. 9, 11, 16, 18 She told me several years later—we were at the cabin—she said that she was accused of being a lesbian by some of the girls that she hung out with. 8, 9, 20 She said one night the girls got together. 8, 19 You know I always had a house full of kids. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I always wanted to be the mom with the neighborhood hanging out. 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 I didn’t have that as much. 18 I really wanted that. 12, 13 She always had friends overnight. 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 I encouraged all of that.  I was probably not the greatest disciplinarian. 8, 9, 11, 15 You want to go toilet paper? 13, 19 It seemed very harmless to me. 19 I wasn’t very good at holding the line either if I was upset about something or, “You’re grounded.” 6, 8, 17, 19, 20 This was true in the dynamic with my parents also. 10, 16 My dad would say, “You’re grounded.” 8 My mom would say, “Here are the car keys.” 7, 15 There was never that cohesiveness between parents giving the same message that we’re backing each other up. 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 She kind of started, she told me later that there were a group of women, a group of young women, girls together one night and they were practicing kissing. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 They swore to each other, “Nobody’s going to tell anybody about this.”  It was just like what’s it like and what do you do? 9, 12 That type of thing.  Then one of them accused her to many of the people at school that she was a lesbian. 8, 9 They treated her differently on her hockey team. 16, 17 I don’t know if Shawn created this as a fantasy or if it was reality. 13, 14, 15 She told me, many years later, that changed who she was, how people reacted to her at school. 8, 10, 16, 20 She didn’t have the same group of friends. 12, 18 She was kind of an outcast at that point. 9, 16, 17 The boys, on the other hand, she always liked boys. 8, 10, 16, 17, 18 They knew completely differently that she wasn’t… 6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 It was the girls, that catty, hurtful dynamic that happened. 8, 10, 12, 13 I think the first time she partied she was at a home and I called. 7, 9, 19 I was one of these, “Talk to the parents, are they going to be home, no alcohol, no drugs.” 10, 14, 16, 19 I get a phone call. 7 They say, “She’s vomiting.  She’s so drunk.” 11, 14, 15 AS: The parents called you? 7, 10, 16 KP: Yes, they were home. 19 “She doesn’t have her bra.  She doesn’t know where it went. 13, 14, 15 Can you come get her?” 13, 19 I’m like, “Number one I called. 7, 10 Number two you were there.  How could this have possibly happened? 12, 13 Weren’t you aware of that house party going on with a bunch of young kids?” 6, 9, 14 Her first drinking experience that I knew about she ended up in the hospital. 6, 9, 12, 14 AS: How old was she? 20 KP: She would have been thirteen. 20 AS: Thirteen or fourteen?  KP: Yes, right in early middle school. 8, 14 She said, “I’m going to die.”  She was so sick.  I said, “Do you think I should take you to the hospital?” 6 I didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 I thought she might have alcohol poisoning or something. 11, 12 So I took her.  They never reported it, which they’re supposed to do to the school, to her hockey coach, all these things. 6, 8, 15, 16 They never reported it to anybody. 15 The medical staff didn’t. 9, 14 She kind of got away with that to a certain point. 16, 17 It just started snowballing after that. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 AS: Even after being so sick she went right back to it. 14, 19 KP: Yes.  I’d gone out of town to Austin, Texas to go to a concert. 9, 19 I dated.  I really tried to keep a balance between work, home life, and parenting. 10, 11, 12, 16, 19 I wasn’t one of these, “I can’t leave and do anything else just because I’m a mom.” 6, 9, 12, 15 I travelled quite a bit for work.  We had nannies and we had family and she had daycare, all these things to cover. 7, 16, 18, 19 When I went to this particular venue and I was gone and I got a phone call because my neighbors were watching our dogs and walking over to the house and things. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 They walked up and there’s a huge house party going on. 6, 9, 17 She was supposedly staying with another family for the weekend. 6, 9, 12, 18, 19 They knew I was out of town. 6, 12, 19 It was like homecoming weekend. 12, 19 AS: What was your relationship with other parents? 10, 16 It sounds like you weren’t supported by other parents or that there wasn’t… 10, 16 KP: A network?  AS: Yes, there wasn’t a watching out for.  You thought you had done what you needed to do. 11, 12, 13 KP: Right.  In that instance that did not pan out that way. 9, 16 I would say I had, because of the hockey, I was surrounded by parents all the time, other moms. 8, 10, 15, 16, 18 We were really connected. 18 We watched over each other’s kids. 17 A lot of, “Oh she did this.” 17 It was there but I think there’s some acceptance.  “They’re kids; they’re just going to experiment.” 9, 12 We didn’t allow drinking in our homes or some of that, “Oh they can drink and I’m going to take the keys.” 6, 14, 19 AS: She and her friend probably told those parents they were going to someone else’s house. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20 KP: They didn’t follow up or whatever. 12 Word got out.  College kids were home for homecoming. 19 This is high school now. 8, 14 I get a phone call from my friends who are watching the house saying, “They won’t even let us in the house. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19 They knew the whole drill, these kids. 6, 12, 14 “You can’t come in, you don’t live here. 13, 19 You don’t have permission to come into the house.” 6, 9, 13, 19 They even said that the police could not enter my home. 7, 15, 19 I called them. 7 Without my permission to go in and raid this party and get everybody out of my house. 6, 9 KP: Oh, yes. 14 I was kind of hesitant to pull in other resources. 13, 16, 17 I got on a plane and came back right away. 13, 14, 16, 19 It was a mess.  My sister had gone over and cleaned the house but it was trashed. 5, 6, 9 They got minors for that because they were drinking underage. 6, 14 They had to go to a class. 20 None of it ever made any impact. 10, 16 It just continued. 9, 12, 18 When I look back on my childhood, I mean I partied too. 11, 16, 19 My parents weren’t that aware, but it was never to the point where you get in trouble with the police. 7, 10, 15, 16 We’d hang out as a group.  It was very much more innocent. 18 I don’t think the drugs or the drinking was as prominent either. 6, 14 It was just a little here, a little there. 9, 12 The drinking was always guzzling with them. 6, 14, 16, 17 I don’t know if Maddie is like this. 13, 14, 15 Could she sit down and just have a glass of wine? 9, 12, 13 Do you know what I mean? 13, 14, 15, 16 That generation didn’t drink that way. 6, 14, 16 They drank to get drunk. 7, 11, 14, 15 AS: The binge movement.  We can call it that. 7 KP: I did feel support. 16 I felt some judgement from my own mom. 15, 17 I always felt like it was my fault. 16, 17 I was made to feel, “How could she have done that? 16 AS: Right.  KP: Right.  AS: By this point had you divorced Kevin? 5 KP: Yes.  I was a single mom at that point. 15 Her addiction, her substance abuse just keeps going? 9, 12 KP: I would say it started with the alcohol. 9, 11 She never liked weed or smoking pot I guess. 10, 15, 18 I know some of that was involved. 13, 14, 15 I think she was into Adderall.  Adderall was probably the first drug that was introduced. 9, 14 They were selling it in middle school. 7, 8 She really liked it. 10, 18 Maybe at that point it was something that could have been recommended from a physician because of anxiety. 8, 12 I just don’t remember her… 9, 12 AS: That would be more for ADD wouldn’t it?  KP: Right.  When she was in grade school at one point she had a teacher, one teacher, the bad teacher that you never liked. 8, 10, 15, 18, 20 There’s always one witchy teacher. 16, 17 She walked by me in the hall one day and said, “She’s got ADHD you need to get her tested.” 9, 13, 17, 19 It really threw me for a loop. 15 They said she was borderline.  They didn’t feel that she needed any medication or therapy or anything. 10, 13, 16 AS: She liked the feeling of the speed of Adderall. 10, 16, 18 KP: Which is interesting because she doesn’t like meth. 5, 9, 10, 19 They’re one molecule, according to her, there’s one molecule between Adderall and meth. 5 It’s that close.  AS: I did not know that. 13, 14, 15 So what happens through high school? 8, 12 KP: She was flunking out of classes, hanging with the wrong people, sneaking out at night, all that, all the dynamics. 8, 18, 19, 20 Her friends changed, who she was hanging with, a couple years older, not necessarily her school district. 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20 It was scary for me. 7 I thought she was really mixing with the wrong people. 11, 12 How do you stop it? 9, 10 You’re not really in control of every single person that they see after school or their friends. 8, 12, 15, 17, 18 AS: Or how they meet people. 13 KP: I felt pretty helpless at certain points during that. 13, 17, 18 I felt she was spinning out of control in some ways. 16, 17 She and I weren’t getting along because I was trying to set rules. 12, 16, 17 She’s just like, “I don’t have to listen to you.” 9, 10, 12, 15, 17 I sent her to California to her dad’s. 7 Her dad lives in the LA area.  He had been active in her life from the time we split, when I called off the wedding. 7, 10, 11 He was active. 10 He’d see her.  He’d come to Minnesota when she was an infant all the way through childhood, every three to four months. 8, 11, 13, 16, 19 They’d go stay in a hotel. 9 He was very consistent with child support until he got married. 9, 15 Then she started to go see him when she was about five. 9, 11 She started flying to California when she was about five. 9, 11 He got married in that time.  It really changed a lot. 16, 17 She would call. 7 She wasn’t very nice to Shawn when she was there.  She had to sleep on a cot in another room. 7 She wanted Marty to do paternity testing because she didn’t know for sure. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 They look so much alike. 10, 18 Shawn wasn’t aware of it.  They called her Montessori [school] and said, “How much is Kim paying for child support?” 7, 8, 11, 16, 18 That was sad. 12 He’d always been very consistent and loving. 9, 15, 16, 17 As she started acting out in high school I called him. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 We were in touch and I said, “I can’t manage it. 15 She’s out of control. 17 She’s failing classes. 8, 20 I think she should come be with you for a while.” 13, 19 So she went to California, enrolled in high school for a year, partied a lot. 8, 17, 20 He was a ruthless disciplinarian, to the point of being mean, not physically. 7, 8, 15, 16 He’d belittle her a lot for, “You don’t pick up your bowl of cereal.” 17 He’d dump it on the floor.  It was a really tight ship.  She couldn’t see people except at school. 8 She was still partying there. 6, 9 I think she was there about six months. 8 Five to six months. 8 Then he called me and she’d run away, Friday night in Los Angeles. 7, 11, 16, 19 He had no idea where she was. 11 AS: She probably doesn’t have a cell phone at this point? 7 KP: She had a cell phone. 7 She called me. 7 She’s like, “I’m not going back. 10, 19 I’m with friends.” 12, 18 It was terrifying.  He called the police and nobody can track her down. 7 It was like a twenty-four hour period where she was talking to me. 10 I knew she was okay. 6, 12 She would not connect with him.  That ended that whole California experience. 12 She barely made it through high school. 5, 8, 16 She ended up in like a specialized program for kids that were struggling in another building. 9, 12 She excelled. 7 She was always a good student, but she just didn’t care. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 She didn’t apply herself.  She was like, “What for? 10 High school that was kind of the catalyst. 8, 9, 10, 16, 17 She took a year off, a gap year in between because she didn’t know what she wanted to do. 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I was really paranoid about investing all this money. 7, 9 She wanted to go to Portland, Oregon to college. 8, 12, 13 AS: Portland State? 8 KP: Yes.  She moved in with a guy and his family who was an addict for sure. 8, 15, 18 AS: So she didn’t go to Portland? 8 KP: No, this was the year in between. 20 She did end up in Portland. 8, 12 She moved out on Mother’s Day. 8 She said, “I’m moving in with so-and-so.”  I could not stand him. 9, 12 His family, they allowed her to move in with him. 18 She was nineteen at the time, eighteen to nineteen, and lived in the Cities.  She called. 7 I knew it was rocky. 6, 12 AS: Here you mean? 16 She’s here; she’s not in Portland yet KP: 8 She’s still in the Cities; it was that year in between. 9, 20 She called me. 7 He’d overdosed on heroin. 15 I assume it was heroin.  She just said he’d overdosed and she experienced it. 9, 12, 15 She’d never seen anything like it before. 15 She wanted to move out. 12, 13 She came back. 19 AS: Was he alive?  Did he live through it?  KP: Yes.  Can I use your bathroom? 7, 9 Pause! 9 [Break in Recording].  KP: She’d always wanted to go to Portland. 8, 12, 13, 16, 17 My best friend who’s her godmother lived in Portland. 8, 9, 10, 12 We’d spent quite a bit of time there. 19 To me it’s marvelous, but really drug loaded. 14 I did not know at the time. 13, 14, 15 She ended up going to college, was excited, and got her apartment downtown. 8, 12, 19, 20 She didn’t want to live in a dorm. 13 Stupid!  AS: So many parallels.  KP: Really?  Oh my God!  Just like set up, Ikea, painting—it was just all set up. 9, 12, 17 It was fabulous.  By herself, she didn’t want a roommate. 7, 13 I don’t know how much she went to class. 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 I think she was good for a while.  I was very resentful; it’s caused a lot of conflict with my best friend from high school. 7, 8, 9, 12, 17 We’ve gone our separate ways because she just didn’t play a part. 9, 12, 16, 17 Did she ever invite her over for dinner?  Did she kind of monitor her and stuff? 9, 16, 17 I really am kind of angry about that. 16, 17 It wasn’t her job either.  It just continued into the whole heroin. 9, 12, 18 AS: You think that’s when she started using? 9, 11 It was in Portland not before? 8 KP: I think she tried it right before. 10, 14 I think she’d been exposed to it before.  I don’t think she’d injected it probably.  I think she’d been exposed.  It just went from the Adderall to the drinking, or the drinking and the Adderall. 6, 9, 12, 14 I think she’d experimented with other things at one point. 16 I don’t know opiates for sure. 13, 14, 15 She talks about 10, 14 Oxy being a big, big influence. 8, 20 That was kind of the gateway for her, in her opinion. 16, 17 That got her into the heroin.  It’s the same story that we hear. 9 I thought heroin was… 11, 12 She was so paranoid about needles, doctors, any blood, anything like that. 7, 11, 13 I would never have imagined. 14, 15 It was readily available in Portland. 8 One of my friend’s sons that she had met when we were out there skiing one time turned her onto it. 5, 12, 19 She was hooked, immediately.  She came home for Christmas. 9, 19 I didn’t sense that she was really in trouble. 17 She was around and hanging out with family and everything. 8, 18 January she called me and she said, “I’m in a hotel bathtub in Seattle with some other people, they are in the other room and they have no idea. 7, 11 I’m trying to detox from heroin. 10, 16 Will you come get me?” 13, 19 That was my first. 9 AS: They have no idea what? 11 KP: That she was detoxing. 10 She said she was partying with them but she was doing it individually and they didn’t know. 6, 13, 14, 15 Whether that’s true or not I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I said, “No I won’t come get you, but I’ll get you a plane ticket. 13, 19 Go to the airport and I’ll come get you in Minneapolis.” 8, 13, 19 I took her to Fairview.  My sister and I went and picked her up, took her Fairview and said, “She wants to detox. 5, 9, 10, 11, 13 What’s the process?”  She had dropped her classes; she had no insurance because she had dropped her classes. 7, 8, 14, 20 They said, “$5,000 and she can stay for three days to detox. 9, 10, 19 You just have to give us the cash, write us a check.” 6, 9, 12 I didn’t really have $5,000 at that point.  I said, “Will she die?”  I didn’t know anything about it, nothing. 13, 14, 15 I went online when I got the phone call from her, from the time she was flying home. 6, 7, 19 It was all terrifying.  I thought, “She’s going to die.” 11, 12 What is detox? 10 They said, “She won’t die from it.  Alcohol detox is the worst and she could die from alcohol detox. 9, 10 She won’t die.  She’ll be really uncomfortable.  You could take her home and then put her in treatment.” 6, 9, 10, 16, 19 That was my first exposure to the restless legs and the vomiting and the sweating and all that. 9, 15, 19 She went through that for a couple of days. 19 She went to the retreat from there. 16 I think it was three days, three or four days before she could go in. 19 AS: Is she twenty now? 14 KP: Yes.  She went through The Retreat. 16 It was very alcohol oriented at that point.  They weren’t really addressing other drugs then. 14 She stayed. 5, 9 It was the first treatment that she completed until this past year. 9, 16, 19, 20 She stayed, she went through it, and she liked it. 5, 9, 10, 18 She went into sober living; they didn’t think she was working the steps. 6, 9, 12 It was all Twelve-Step.  She didn’t buy in, she didn’t like it. 7, 10 They just didn’t work for her. 9, 12 She did not buy into it. 7 Higher power is just something she can’t relate to or fathom or, “What is that? 9, 12, 15 What shape does that take?” 6 It was too religious oriented for her mind, too God focused. 9, 15 She just didn’t buy in. 7, 9, 12 They were like, “We want her in sober living, but she’s not done a third step, or fourth step.” 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 It was the thirty-day program, or twenty-eight day program. 19 She went into sober living. 6 She made it thirty days and she drank one night. 7, 14, 16, 19 They kicked her out.  She came home. 19 I was married to Bruce then.  Bruce, when she went to Portland, in his mind she’s gone. 8, 19 “I have Kim to myself finally.”  She was fifteen when we met. 5 We didn’t get married right away. 14, 16 He felt she was out of control and very judgmental, didn’t relate. 14, 17 He was just pissed about the whole thing. 9, 12 “My friend’s kids don’t have any problems. 12 She went to college and out of sight, out of mind. 8 Now, she’ll be fine. 14 Well it didn’t happen. 12 She was back. 19 It was very difficult on my marriage. 20 It’s a big part why it didn’t last, a lot of anger on his part, a lot of hate. 8, 9, 17 He’s not an angry guy, particularly, but he just wanted me. 9, 12, 13, 18 He wanted her to be normal, whatever that meant. 12, 13, 16 He just couldn’t control it, which is big. 8, 9, 12, 17 He didn’t know how to handle it watching me go through this dynamic of this addict in and out of our lives. 13, 14, 15 Setting her up in an apartment and then losing the apartment because she wouldn’t pay rent, losing jobs, and cars being impounded. 7, 16, 20 I was just enabling all that. 9, 12 I was just trying to think. 9, 12, 16 She couldn’t make her rent. 16 I’d write a check.  AS: Did you see that as enabling at the time?  KP: No. I didn’t know what that meant. 13, 14, 15, 16 I was trying to do everything that I possibly could to get her life to be normal. 11, 16 She’s in trouble because she couldn’t pay rent, things will even out. 15, 16 It was just a downward spiral, it went on for years until I went to Nar-Anon. 9, 12, 20 It really changed it. 16 I was desperate.  She stole from us. 9, 18 AS: She’s back in your house? 6, 9, 19 She’s in an apartment, she’s got a job, but that’s when the heroin got really bad. 20 Here she got an apartment and job? 20 KP: Yes, she was back here at that point. 19 When she flew back from Portland she was back here. 7, 8, 19 AS: But moved out of your house to her own apartment. 6, 8, 9, 20 So you set her up again, she got a job, then she relapses. 17, 18 KP: I think she was using the whole time, either alcohol or heroin at that point.  She couldn’t keep any job or any living situation for periods of time. 6, 12, 13 If you were to ask Shawn she says that she got involved with this guy named Troy who she knew in high school. 5, 6, 8, 12 She’d always had a fascination and a crush on him. 16, 17 He had been through treatment for alcohol, gambling addiction, but he had a son and he was living with his mom. 6, 9, 15, 16 He was working and he didn’t associate with anybody.  I think he got caught up in her lifestyle. 9, 11 I think she influenced, or has gotten many people involved in heroin versus the other way around. 8, 15, 16, 20 AS: So he got involved with heroin?  KP: Yes, lost custody of his son. 9 His mom was kind of crazy, but he got involved with the law and gambling. 15, 16, 17 They were hanging out at the casinos. 18 He would win.  She said he’d win all this money.  They’d be in a hotel, a lot of drug dealing at Mystic [Lake Casino]. 9, 13, 14, 17 I had no control over any of it. 17 At that point she was twenty-one, she was an adult, and she could do whatever she wanted to. 12, 13 You try. 16 You try to have hope. 10, 16 You try to influence. 16, 20 You try to come home; this really isn’t a healthy relationship. 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 That was the only thing she really cared about, was being high. 7, 8, 11, 12 Bruce, we had talked about splitting up. 10, 11 He had so much resentment toward her. 7, 18 We had a conversation with some friends of ours. 12, 18 This was 2014 January, and we had a dinner with her and her boyfriend and said, “We’re going to put it all behind us.” 10, 12 He was going to forgive her and try to move on from his resentment. 6, 7, 16 I was going to be less enabling.  We’d gotten some really good guidance from a couple that we knew well. 6, 12, 15 “Troy, we accept you.”  They stayed overnight. 5, 8, 9, 19 They stole from us the next morning. 9, 18 It was all planned.  We had a lockbox that was hidden.  We had the key to the lockbox that was hidden.  It had obviously been staged well ahead of time. 9 AS: So you mean they were going to steal that stuff? 9, 16 KP: Oh yes, they knew where everything was. 6, 12, 14 They knew where the key was. 6, 12 They’d gone in the lockbox.  They took my jewelry.  I went to work.  They’d stayed overnight. 5, 8, 9, 19 That was it in terms of her living with us. 6 AS: You’ve told me before that she was on methadone. 5, 20 Can you talk about when that happened? 10, 12, 13 KP: After The Retreat and getting kicked out of sober living she was seeing a therapist, or had gotten some counseling through The Retreat. 6, 9, 15, 16 She was connected to somebody through sober living. 6, 18 This person said, “Okay, I think she should go to treatment again for alcohol. 9, 16 I think that based on the heroin use and addiction that methadone might not be a bad idea.” 9, 11 She went to treatment. 9, 16 She did go to treatment in Meadow Creek, which is up near Pine City. 9, 16 She stayed there, she’s been there twice, and she stayed there almost through the whole program. 5, 9 Again a twenty-eight day program, which I feel is never long enough. 15, 16, 19, 20 She was connected based on the therapy there; they put her in a methadone program when she left there. 10, 18 That was the next step. 9, 12 She went to Valhalla Place in Woodbury for three and a half years. 20 She did pretty well. 18 She worked, she had a car. 7 That was kind of in between. 16, 17 That gap between 2014.  It worked.  She had an amazing, amazing counselor who I felt was a God gift in her life. 10, 11, 15, 17 She was very, very bonded with him, and spent hours talking to him. 10, 11, 19 He talked to me, we would go in together. 10, 11 He talked to her boyfriend of the day. 10, 11, 12, 19 He was very involved.  Bruce got laid off his job, which meant no private insurance. 7, 14, 16 She had to pay for methadone, which was very expensive. 16 I covered it at that point, she couldn’t make it. 12, 16 She couldn’t pay for it. 16 AS: She couldn’t go on MA [medical assistance]? 9, 14 KP: I don’t know if we knew about it then. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 So Rick left the clinic.  AS: The therapist? 6, 9 Yes, and went into private practice. 10, 14 She lost insurance and couldn’t cover the cost of the methadone at that point. 5, 7, 9 She relapsed right after that. 14, 18 She relapsed, she was at about thirty milligrams. 18 AS: At the beginning?  KP: Well they ramped her up to that point.  I don’t know what her max was. 13, 14, 15 She’s on thirty now and it’s not enough. 14, 20 They want her to go up more. 13 AS: You said before, you don’t have to answer this, but that you had felt pressure from your family or other people were pressuring her to quit the methadone even though it was working. 5, 15, 17, 18 Can you talk about that? 10 Was that before the insurance problem? 7 When she was taking it the family dynamic, my family dynamic—me included—was, “It’s a narcotic.” 15, 18 We heard all about the detox and how horrible it was and how was it affecting her as a person, a lot of pressure. 10, 15, 17 I was kind of brought up in that whole idea. 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 Rick was completely against her going off of it. 14, 19 We were like, “She needs to get off this. 10, 13 It’s another drug. 14 What’s the difference if she’s on heroin or she’s on something like this?”  There was a lot of family pressure to get her off. 15, 17, 18 It was a mistake. 6, 9 If I look back now, if I knew what I knew today about how it stabilized her, I would never. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 19 That’s when she started using, she relapsed. 9, 11, 18 She hadn’t used in three and a half years. 9, 20 There is a gap period in this whole thing until she was like twenty-six when she wasn’t using.  She was drinking. 6, 14 AS: Like three years. 20 KP: She drank during that period of time. 7, 14 She went to treatment for alcohol. 9, 16 AS: While she was even on methadone? 5, 15 KP: She was living with a boyfriend who was an alcoholic. 5, 6, 12 It was very, not violent, but it was a lot of police involvement and a lot of drama. 7, 14, 17 She’s definitely an alcoholic on top of it. 5 I think if she had kept that out of the picture she was doing okay.  She was pretty stable on methadone. 9, 18 So that was a mistake. 6, 9 We didn’t know. 13, 14, 15 It was, “What’s methadone?” 5 AS: It had such a bad reputation even just a few years ago; it still has a bad reputation. 9, 10, 12, 15, 20 KP: But it’s highly prescribed now. 8, 14 She needs it. 13 After coming off methadone she said she would never take it again. 6, 15 She had no idea how drugged that she felt. 11, 14, 17 AS: Three years ago? 20 But now? 14 KP: She didn’t want to go on methadone again, but she was court ordered to go on methadone now. 5, 12, 13, 14 She went to jail.  She’s been in jail three times. 18 She’s been in the workhouse twice. 6, 9 AS: In jail for possession?  KP: Nothing related to heroin.  She got a DWI.  She didn’t go to court.  She didn’t show up for her court date.  It manifested itself into a warrant and some jail time. 7, 9 It was all based on a DWI.  Never possession, never been picked up for heroin. 15 I implanted a lot of that though into the system with probation officers and all this. 8, 9, 10, 11, 17 AS: What do you mean you implanted it? 16 KP: I gave them a lot of information about her use and that she really needed help. 9, 13, 17 That she needed treatment. 9, 13, 16 It was not alcohol necessarily even though that’s what she got picked up for. 15 AS: So you would intervene at the moment where she got picked up and you would call? 7, 13, 15 Tell me what you would do.  KP: She had a probation officer. 10 The first probation officer and I would communicate back and forth when she’d get picked up. 9, 10, 19 She got picked up the first time, went into the workhouse. 6, 9 We talked quite a bit during that period of time about it’s not only alcohol. 10, 11 She’s going to die if she stays out there on the street. 9 When they stole from us, when she and Troy stole from us, she was out of the house, she was done. 6, 9, 18 She was home once after that for about two years. 19, 20 AS: Did you call the police on her at that point? 7 KP: Yes.  They were gone, but we reported it. 19 It was about $16,000, $18,000 worth of things that they had taken. 6, 16 AS: Did you ever get any of it back? 19 KP: I recently got a check, a $10,000 check from my insurance company, within the last month. 7, 8, 9 It’s been two years. 20 It was two years in January. 20 We didn’t report it to Home Owners Insurance because we thought we wanted restitution from them. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 We wanted them to be punished, not punished. 12, 13 They were so messed up.  They were so fucked up at the time.  We thought they were going to die. 11, 12 They were living on the streets. 6, 9 Shawn was held at gunpoint.  Who knows what she did for drugs. 13, 14, 15 She had no job, no money.  I didn’t give her anything for those two years. 6, 20 I’d meet with her in the car every once and awhile. 7, 13 It was a scary group of people and the places that she was living were just ratty. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 17 It felt like it couldn’t have gotten any worse. 15, 17 She was having people die in her life. 11 She had somebody die in her arms.  I thought that would turn it around. 8, 11, 12, 19 It’s like a trigger.  Anyways, do you want me to go back? 13, 16, 17, 19 [Speaks to cat]. 10 AS: I’m just thinking about that. 9, 12 Is that when you started coming to Nar-Anon? 9, 11 KP: I started coming to Nar-Anon after I kicked her out. 9, 11 Bruce was unhappy and the law was involved. 17 I just felt I had nowhere to go. 9, 12, 14, 17 I was not getting any support at home from Bruce. 19 She’d call in the middle of the night. 7, 8, 19 She wouldn’t know where she was. 13, 14, 15 “Come and get me.”  AS: But she wouldn’t know where she was? 13, 14, 15 KP: She wouldn’t know where she was. 13, 14, 15 I just kept thinking if I don’t respond and if I never did anything, I’ll never be able to live with myself. 9, 12, 15 I’d go look for her in Uptown. 19 I’d drive in the middle of the night up and down the street looking for her. 7, 8, 9, 14, 19 Hiawatha area was the worst. 9 AS: How many times did this happen? 12, 18 KP: Phone calls like that? 7 Regularly.  You go through periods of no contact. 10 AS: This was after you said you hit your bottom with her, which was when they robbed you?  KP: That was really then.  AS: You hit your bottom where you said, “You can’t be in our house.” 6, 9 That’s what you meant by that? 16 KP: It didn’t mean I disconnected from her or detached from her completely. 14, 16, 18, 19 AS: So you stayed in touch with her through this dark time? 5, 9, 15 KP: I called when I knew there was a warrant out. 6, 7, 12 My dad was in the VA Hospital.  We thought he wasn’t going to live. 11, 12 I had her come to the hospital and I arranged with security guards at the front desk when she came in to arrest her. 7, 9, 13, 19 My sister and I had this whole plan. 5, 9 AS: You’re going to tell her that her grandpa is dying, which he was. 7 KP: He was really sick.  I said, “I think you should come to see him.” 13, 19 I talked to the security guards, there was a warrant out for her arrest and could they arrest her. 7, 9, 10, 11, 19 I had no idea where she was at that point. 11 I’d see her.  She’d meet me at Kowalski’s in Uptown sometimes. 5, 13, 18, 19 I didn’t know where she was living, who she was with. 6, 13, 14, 15 She was moving all the time and she had abscesses.  She looked so incredibly like she was going to die. 12 She’d call and say, “I’m being held at gunpoint” then she’d hang up. 7 “I’m in this horrible place. 11, 17 I’m afraid of these people, they’re really dangerous,” and then she’d hang up. 18 I had no idea where she was. 11 What would you do at this point, just get in your car? 7, 9, 12 KP: You kind of build this little network of people that she knows. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I had phone numbers. 7 “Do you know where she is or who she’s with?” 13, 14, 15 “Oh, I think she’s here.”  “I haven’t seen her for a couple weeks.”  AS: What was that like on your psyche and your body?  I know how it is, but I need you to say it. 13, 14, 15 KP: I was sick.  I was physically ill. 7 I was losing weight. 18 I wasn’t sleeping. 7 I was on this hunt, almost this feeling of what little piece of information can I get to go find her? 9, 16, 17 Will she leave with me if I find her? 6 I would find her.  She didn’t want to go. 13 “No, these are my people.”  She’d be so fucked up.  There were years like those two and a half years from the point where we kicked her out to the point to her getting arrested. 9, 19, 20 Well, what happened at the VA, she gave them a false name when she checked in. 6, 12, 13 They didn’t know it was her, gave them another name. 6, 13, 14, 15 She could work the system. 8, 9 AS: She knew what you were probably going to do. 6, 12 KP: Anything to do with police, security, anything like that. 7 She walks in to this waiting room in the ER. 7 My sister and I are looking like, “How the hell did she get in here?” 5, 9 This security guard comes walking down the hallway, “Do you know what your mother tried to do? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 She tried to have you arrested.” 9, 10, 19 Yes!  Shawn was horrified.  She was so mad.  She just walked out. 9, 12, 17 There was a police car that had been notified that was waiting outside when she went out there. 7 They arrested her on the spot. 9, 19 She was so mad at me.  I’ve done it twice now. 14 AS: You’ve done this same thing?  KP: I had her arrested in Minnetonka. 9, 19 She got arrested, went into Hennepin, ended up at the workhouse because of her warrant. 6, 7, 9, 12, 19 Pissed at me, angry, but she was there for three weeks probably.  Then they let her out. 19 Somebody picked her up.  She didn’t even let me know when she was getting out. 13, 14, 15, 19 A friend picked her up. 12 She just went right back out and did the same thing. 9, 12, 14, 19 She could have gone to Hazleton at that time. 19 “I’m just going to go see my friends to say goodbye.” 9, 12, 18 This was always the drill. 14, 16, 17 “I need to go say goodbye to everybody.” 13 Did you ever hear that?  “Just go say goodbye, nothing’s going to happen. 9, 12 I’ll be back.” 19 She went into treatment a couple times, several times. 9, 16, 18 She’d go in, I’d beg her to go in, she’d go in to Fairview, she’d detox for a couple days and then leave. 6, 10, 19 She’d go into treatment, they’d recommend treatment, she’d stay for two or three days and she was gone. 9, 12, 16, 19 She went to Hazleton twice, stayed for three days. 5, 9, 19 She never even got into the program. 15 She used in my car in the Hazleton parking lot the night she was going in. 7, 9, 17, 19 I knew it. 6, 12 She’s like, “One more. 10 I’m going to be so sick, just one more time.” 9, 12 Did you ever buy drugs for your daughter? 5, 7, 14 AS: No. KP: I’m sure I’ve financed so much of that over the years. 15, 18, 20 AS: I mean I don’t know. 13, 14, 15, 16 I didn’t actually physically buy them. 7, 10 KP: Oh no, I never did either. 15 Suboxone—I never was involved in any transaction. 7, 10, 15 I’m sure the cash. 15 KP: Ann [Perry] will tell you stories like that. 9, 18 AS: I’m sure the cash that I handed over for jobs around the house. 6, 9, 15 What can you say about your mothering?  What can you say about addiction and mothering?  Are there things you’ve learned? 12, 16, 17 KP: I don’t know how they could possibly go hand in hand at times because you question your sanity. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 I question my sanity. 6, 9 I beat myself up for a long, long time about what I did wrong.  I wasn’t around enough or I didn’t monitor her enough or I wasn’t a disciplinarian, I didn’t catch it early enough. 8, 10, 15, 20 My mom who’s so judgmental about everything that I did. 14, 15 She loves Shawn, it’s her first grandchild, and she does. 7, 9, 13 It was just like, “You can’t put her back on the street. 9, 10, 12, 19 She can’t be home.” 19 It was just this constant questioning of your own mind of what you were doing right and what you were doing wrong. 6, 9, 12, 14 I think when it comes to mothering an addict, it’s a loaded question. 6, 9, 13, 19 To me mothering is supportive and nurturing and caring and non-judgement and respect and patience. 7 I’ve been so challenged in that regard. 10 I felt that way this weekend. 12, 16, 17, 19 I felt like I was on the opposite end of the spectrum. 12, 13, 17 Unless I’m spiritually fit or involved in prayer or reading or meditation or just being connected. 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 Nature does that for me, work does that for me.  I have a real hard time staying grounded in that regard. 8, 9, 11, 19 Just being supportive and letting her do her own thing because I just feel like it’s going back down, it’s starting to spiral. 9, 11, 12, 16, 19 The definition of mothering that’s what gets flipped.  AS: To where you say, “That’s not mothering what I’m doing.  I’m doing the opposite.” 13 Is that to survive?  KP: Yes, I think so.  It’s just to stay sane. 9, 12 I get angry and I get frustrated. 9, 12 I have been going through a period of my divorce of loneliness and starting to navigate life solo. 6, 9, 11 AS: Because you and Bruce just got divorced? 5, 9, 12 KP: Right.  Her living with me has been positive at times but she has a boyfriend now. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 He’s there all the time.  I can’t do it in a small space.  I feel like I’m taking care of two other people. 7, 16 I’ve set boundaries around it. 17 I’ve told them that he just can’t be there. 9, 12, 20 He’s not working and he’s floating.  I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 He’s supposedly clean for three years. 6, 20 He told me recently that Shawn’s been using. 20 He’s been using.  He’s got diabetes and he’s been asking for his needles. 13 I don’t know what’s true or not. 13, 14, 15 Were they in a fight?  Is it that he’s trying to get her in trouble or he’s trying to get away from her? 16 I think they both know that they shouldn’t be together. 13, 14, 15 It’s in my home and it’s in my space. 19 I don’t think we should be living together. 6 I told her today. 19, 20 We went to the cabin.  I’ve set this boundary and I haven’t kept it. 17 My mind—it’s that mind chatter that says, “Okay, she goes out there.  What are the chances of her not relapsing?”  At least she’s got a roof over her head. 9 She didn’t for years. 20 AS: But she’s using.  KP: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 AS: You don’t know, right. 13, 14, 15 So the unknown—no matter if she’s in your house or not in your house—is still there. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 KP: It’s that constant. 9 At least she’s living somewhere and she’s in treatment. 6, 9, 16 KP: Yes, she’s at New Way every day, in outpatient. 9, 19 AS: They’re drug testing her, right? 9, 14 KP: I think so.  She’s on methadone. 5 AS: She’s staying on it? 9, 19 KP: She’s still on methadone. 9 AS: So what are you doubting?  KP: She’s not working a program.  AS: Even though she’s going to outpatient? 9 KP: I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I don’t see any change in her behavior. 16 It feels like using behavior is starting over again. 9, 11, 16 AS: So you saw a change. 16 KP: We went to a cabin, and they slept for three days. 19 They didn’t do anything the whole time we were up there.  That’s what scares me. 7 They’re swearing it’s nothing.  How can you possibly sleep for three days and three nights? 7, 19 We were kayaking once, they didn’t go to town, they didn’t go fishing, and they didn’t do anything. 19 They slept.  They did it Memorial Day, same thing.  It doesn’t feel right. 14, 16 [long pause] 9 That’s what’s bugging me.  AS: That feeling, that familiar feeling that you’ve had many times in the past when you’ve known things. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 KP: My gut’s usually been accurate. 10 Trust your gut. 9 It’s usually really accurate. 10 I’ve got strong intuition about things. 9, 16 It doesn’t feel good. 16 AS: You know what it’s like to live with active addiction and deception, which is part of the addiction, is the deception and lying. 10, 13, 14, 15 KP: And lack of motivation.  AS: Does she have a job?  KP: No. AS: What did she say today when you said, “This isn’t working out.” 19 KP: For the first time she said she was going to call Greg about sober living. 6, 7, 9 She’s said it a million times before. 18 I think she’s got that one foot in, one foot out.  The feelings that come up for me, the anger, which I’ve been working on and trying to be more compassionate and understanding and knowing that even if you’re in recovery it’s really tough. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 It takes a while. 6 It’s a whole different dynamic. 16, 17 AS: It can take up to two years. 6, 20 KP: I know, but is that the behavior that goes along with it? 13, 14, 15 Just doing nothing? 9 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Do you know? 13, 14, 15 AS: I saw a lot of working the program and working towards goals and being accountable to social workers and counselors and people outside of her family. 10, 17, 18 KP: That’s what I think is lacking.  I believe that that has to be a part of recovery, the community, the connectedness. 18 Setting and having the support system is huge. 8, 9 AS: And deciding you’re going to do something with your life not just be not using. 9, 11, 12 KP: Right, just be there. 9, 12 Just go. 9 Whatever you do every day. 19 AS: But the state of not using isn’t recovery. 9 It’s just not using. 9, 12 That’s what’s happening. 12, 13 There’re no meetings. 13 She likes the treatment that she’s in. 9, 10, 16 I don’t know how long she’s there. 13, 14, 15 She was court ordered to be there, but she likes it. 10, 12 She said, “I trust the group. 9 I can talk about anything I want to.” 10, 13 She doesn’t talk to me at all. 10 Last week I was like, “How are you doing? 9, 10 Can we just connect?” 9, 12 Otherwise you fill in the blanks.  The assumptions can be really a negative thing.  AS: It’s dangerous for us. 18 AS: That’s where we go because of the traumas that we’ve been through.  The blanks we fill in are all on despair and tragedy.  KP: Exactly. 10 You put the words right in my mouth. 10, 14 I was reading this meditation I have about that on my refrigerator. 11 It’s exactly those words. 10 We had some therapy when she was at Park.  She had a fabulous counselor. 10 I was so looking forward to continuing with her. 9 She just said, “The two of you assume completely the wrong things about what the other person is thinking. 9, 12, 14, 16, 19 You’re not talking about it. 10 Take one little baby step at a time and talk about this.” 5, 9, 10, 12 Shawn talks a lot, she processes. 10, 14, 17 Sometimes she just talks on and on, most of the time she doesn’t say anything. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 She’s like, “Oh, we’ll talk later.” 10 Later never happens. 12, 15 I was asking her and she got all upset. 13, 17, 19 She was crying and she was having problems with Ryan. 11 She finally dumped.  She used to do information dumps periodically throughout her teenage years. 7, 9, 17, 20 All of a sudden I’d get things I wish I’d never heard, but I got a big dump truck load at once. 8, 13, 15, 16 It was just like this vomit of information. 9, 12, 17 She kind of went on that rant the other night. 7, 16, 17, 19 “I talk all day in therapy; I’m in counseling for four hours a day. 10, 11, 19 I don’t want to talk anymore when I get home. 10, 13, 19 I’m talked out. 10, 11 I’ve been talking about all this stuff all day long.” 9, 10, 19 AS: Which is understandable. 9, 12, 16 KP: Thank you.  I get that.  Then it was like, “You always want to have these serious conversations.” 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 I’m like, “I just want to have a conversation. 9, 10, 12, 13 I don’t care if it’s about the weather or walk around the block or go to dinner or sit down and eat together.” 7, 13 A lot about her relationship and she said, “I’m feeling for the first time. 9, 16, 17 I haven’t had these feelings for years. 16, 20 It’s terrifying.  It hurts and it’s scary for me.” 7 Her social anxiety is off the charts.  She’s feeling all those things that she was medicating before. 10, 16 That was all positive information. 13, 14, 17 It was dramatic, but I got this feedback. 14, 19 I understand that. 9, 12, 16 Thank you for sharing it.  She’s like, “I’m all upset!” 10, 17, 19 I’m like, “I get it. 10 I needed that.” 13 Yes!  AS: Because I love you. 13 Then we go away for the weekend and this whole weird dynamic. 12, 16, 19 AS: Is there anything else you want to say? 13 I’m just aware of the time. 9, 12 KP: I think I know in my heart, I’m sure you’ve heard this; this is the hardest challenge, the biggest thing that I have ever experienced in my entire life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 I almost didn’t make it myself. 9, 16 I don’t know if you knew this but I ended up hospitalized at one point. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 I tried to commit suicide over this. 10 AS: A while ago?  KP: It was a year ago in April. 20 I was in Nar-Anon then.  AS: I didn’t know that. 13, 14, 15 I’m sorry. 10 KP: I’ve never thought about it since. 11, 12, 15 Shawn had left treatment one more time, was back on the street. 9, 16, 19 I just cracked that day. 9, 12, 19 I just tried to find her, I was driving around. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 I was out of my mind.  I just said, “She’s going to die. 9, 12 I can’t outlive her.  I don’t want to live through losing a child.” 13 That’s how I felt. 17 That’s the craziness that was overcoming me.  “I can’t outlive her.  She’s going to die.”  AS: That made you want to kill yourself? 7, 13, 16 KP: Yes.  AS: That’s really heavy.  How long were you in the hospital?  KP: Five days. 19 Did you get good help? 13 KP: Oh, yes. 14 I felt completely out of my element because I was surrounded by people who had been there many times. 8, 14, 17, 18, 19 It was so extreme.  It was completely foreign to me. 14, 19 I was that desperate that I had to go there.  AS: To protect yourself.  Did you take yourself to the hospital? 6 KP: No, somebody called an ambulance for me. 7 I remember calling Shawn and saying, “Would you come see me?” 7, 11, 13, 19 She wouldn’t come see me. 13, 19 That was really painful.  Even then the drugs were more important. 14 AS: You told her how you felt? 17, 20 KP: Yes.  AS: That’s the power of addiction, isn’t it? 15 KP: It can manifest itself and grow and morph within each one of us. 9, 17 It can take over every part of our being. 6 I think if I had been in a more spiritual place at the time I don’t think it would have been that extreme. 11 I just didn’t believe in anything. 9, 12 I didn’t believe there was a God.  I didn’t believe there was a higher power. 8, 15 It was just like, “I’ve had enough.” 9, 10, 12, 20 Why does this keep happening to me? 12, 13 That’s how I felt. 17 What did I do to deserve this?  AS: Right, and that nothing you’re doing is helping. 13 KP: It took a long time to get there, to realize that there’s nothing I can do except love her and tell her if she’s ready. 13, 14 She wasn’t ready.  She went into treatment so many times for the family or for us or for me. 9, 16, 18 She’d say straight out, “I’m not ready. 6, 9 I don’t want to quit.” 13 AS: Do you know how many times she’s been in treatment? 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 KP: I think this is her ninth. 20 She’s very proud to say that.  It’s odd.  That they would say, “Oh, this is my ninth treatment.” 9, 16, 20 I just cringe. 9, 12 She never went through it. 15 She didn’t stay. 9 She never stayed, all those times. 5, 9, 15, 18 I think she stayed the first time at The Retreat; she went through Meadow Creek the first time she stayed, and then she went through Park. 5, 9, 16 So three out of the nine, she spent any period of time then. 19 To me it doesn’t count.  What’d you get from that?  Maybe it was a baby step forward each time. 5, 9, 12 I don’t know how long she’s been clean. 13, 14, 15 She said she’s done meth twice since January. 5 Amy, I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 She told me she hadn’t done anything. 20 AS: So the deception isn’t over yet.  How are you today? 19 How are you since you were hospitalized?  KP: I’ve been on an uphill.  It was just kind of one of these, in my mind, like a one-time feeling. 9, 12, 16, 17 I’ve never felt it before or after. 15, 17 I went through some pretty intense treatment. 9, 15, 16, 18 I went to DBT.  Are you familiar with DBT?  AS: Yes.  KP: Last summer, and that was helpful. 9, 13 It gives you new skills to use. 6, 7, 9 It’s like a different language. 13, 16, 17 AS: The hospitalization was a year ago April? 20 KP: Yes.  AS: So like sixteen months ago. 8 KP: I did that last summer. 9 I have a fantastic therapist and we do EMDR, which has helped me tremendously with all of this. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 It’s amazing how a session can change my perception or my reactions to things. 10, 15, 16 It’s fantastic. 9 Those tools—that work—has kept me stable ever since then. 9, 18 I get angry.  I’m trying to work on the anger part of it. 16 I know you’ve been there AS: Hang in there. 13, 14, 15 I have, but I have to say the anxiety doesn’t go away. 16 It becomes part of you. 13, 19 It’s part of your story with that child. 9 It’s something that she’ll be living with and I’ll be living with. 6 KP: It gives me hope when I see other moms, other families, other parents. 6, 10, 15, 16, 18 AS: We need that hope to survive. 10, 13 It was those other people in the meetings whose kids were four or five years in recovery that helped me when my daughter was homeless by the river. 5, 13, 16, 19, 20 KP: Is she still on methadone? 9 AS: Yes.  KP: Does she talk about getting off of it? 10 AS: Yes, they’re tapering down really slowly.  KP: Are they both taking it?  AS: Yes.  KP: I support it now. 14 I wish I would have been more knowledgeable, but she hates it. 13, 14, 15 They want her on a higher dose so she’ll feel better. 8, 13, 15, 16 She sees the psychiatrist this week. 9 We were talking about the system, that part of it. 8, 9, 10 I’m rambling, I’m sorry. 10 It’s okay.  KP: That whole idea of trying to find help, starting with no insurance. 7, 9, 11, 13, 16 MA has been actually pretty great. 10, 11, 18 Through Medica she’s gotten a lot of benefits. 14, 15, 17 That way once we figured out that whole navigating thing. 12, 13, 16 She couldn’t have done that navigating.  I had to do that piece.  She could never have figured it out. 12, 13, 15 It took me months. 8 Then trying to find her a psychiatrist, which has been a new thing. 6, 9, 16 I called the U of M Department of Behavioral Health or Mental Health and Addiction. 7 They said, “Well our one psychiatrist just retired and we’re not taking any new patients.” 6, 9, 12, 19 This is not like Nystrom, one of the other smaller psychiatric clinics. 9 AS: It’s not a small practice. 10 KP: I said, “Can you give me a referral?” 6 “No we don’t have any referrals.  I have no idea what to tell you.” 11 I was just like, “I’m the mother of this addict.” 9, 10, 12 I just went on this whole rant about how can you not have an idea of where to point people when this is so prominent? 7, 9, 11, 12 I called a psychiatrist that I know. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 Why I didn’t go that route in the first place? 9, 11 She gave me the name of one in Plymouth, Plymouth Psych Clinic or something. 6 They got her in in a week.  She goes Thursday. 19 You had to have the tenacity as a mother to keep at it. 12, 15, 20 We don’t take no for an answer. 6 KP: You almost have to go through personal connections to find a resource. 9, 16 If you go down the normal channels of MA or Medica, any of those channels, you don’t get anywhere.  Or you get three to four months. 8 We start with a physical thinking, “Oh, you’ll get a referral.” 9, 11 Took her to Fairview, had a physical, they said, “Here’s a couple names.” 6 It’s at least three to four months to get in. 8, 9 She just walked out and she felt hopeless. 9, 10, 12, 17 The anxiety has to be treated. 16 The mental health part has to be treated. 14, 16 We found another resource; we’ll see where that goes.  AS: That’s where a certain level of education and access to other resources comes into play for our kids. 6, 10, 13, 19, 20 KP: We know how to navigate that. 13, 14, 15 AS: But if you didn’t, where’s your kid?  They’re in jail.  KP: That’s not a solution.  I just don’t think that’s a solution. 9, 12 KP: Not enough treatment. 9, 16, 20 That’s enough. 20 AS: Thank you.  KP: Oh, you’re welcome. 13, 19 AS: Thank you this was really good.  KP: Thank you for asking. 13"
"20","Holter_Janise","Charles Reznikoff Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 17, 2017 Minneapolis, Minnesota Charles Reznikoff-CR Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I am with Dr. Charles Reznikoff at the Addiction Medicine Center at HCMC [Hennepin County Medical Center] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  It is January 17, 2017.  I am trying to get a whole picture of the people who are involved in what is going on right now with opioids in treatment and recovery and what has happened in the past. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 That said, I would like to be able to paint a picture of who are the kinds of people who are doing this and what their personal story is. 9, 10, 16, 17 Can you tell me a little about your family and growing up and how you got interested in medicine. 9, 11, 17, 18, 19 CR: I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin.  Both of my parents were professors at the University of Wisconsin. 10, 13, 16 My dad’s dad was a famous doctor in New York City -- he was a hematologist. 9 My mom wanted to be a doctor but because of circumstances in her life that wasn’t available to her. 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 I grew up in a very academic family. 18 Both my parents were geneticists. 9, 10, 16 I grew up talking about genetics and biology over the dinner table every day. 10, 19 My mom was Catholic. 15 I think she is now a recovering Catholic, you might say. 14 I was brought up Catholic and my mom was very into service. 9, 15, 18 Anyways, I grew up always told from a young age that I was going to be a doctor or a priest. 9, 14, 16, 17, 20 It sounds terrible, but I think my mom meant the best by that. 9, 10, 15, 16 My dad was really mellow about that -- he never told me what he wanted me to be. 12, 13, 15, 20 But, my mom wanted me to be in some form of service. 12, 13, 15, 17 I think she would have accepted if I didn’t, but from a very early age I was told I was going to do one of those things. 16, 20 By the time I was twelve I knew I wasn’t going to be a priest. 6, 9, 12 [laughs]  I crossed that one off the list! 9 That led me to be a doctor.  I think other relevant things in my family was that my sister was the smartest person I had ever met. 5, 9, 16, 18, 20 She was my older sister and she is a mathematician. 5, 8, 9, 20 She was a very rigorous and demanding thinker.  It sounds terrible to say this but she was verbally aggressive. 8, 10, 15, 16 I don’t mean that to be abusive. 9, 11, 16 I mean that if you misspoke she would correct you and if you were illogical she would correct your logic. 16, 19 If you used poor grammar she would correct it. 9 I still use poor grammar but the ability to deal with a critical verbal environment came from my sister. 5, 9, 13, 19 She also has a little bit of OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] so I grew up with some mental health issues in the family. 14, 15, 18 My brother is one year older than me. 5, 20 He is adopted. 8 He is currently a safety manager at a construction worksite. 9, 13, 14, 16 He is ten months older so we grew up almost as fraternal twins. 5, 8, 9, 14, 20 My parents couldn’t conceive another child so they adopted my brother and then immediately conceived me. 5, 8, 10, 16 We grew up like fraternal twins. 14 He has a much higher risk for addiction and anxiety. 8, 15, 18 At age twelve, thirteen, fourteen I saw him smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking. 6, 14 He was getting in trouble.  As soon as he could he was getting tattoos and taking all the risks.  The way I think about it is whatever ‘dumb’ is I did ninety-five percent of it and he did one hundred and five percent of it. 16 Overall, childhood was excellent. 7, 11 I was very sheltered and protected. 12 It was a safe and wonderful thing.  I grew up in this amazing, academic, intellectually challenging circumstance. 9, 15 With my brother I got almost a twin-like experience when we were getting in trouble together. 5, 9, 10, 14 With my sister I got this older sister who was very rigorously demanding and intellectually challenging. 5, 9, 20 My parents were these very smart intellects. 10, 16, 20 My elementary school was like lily-white. 8 Very affluent, white kids.  There was one person of color in my elementary school. 8 My middle school was forty percent black just by coincidence of the districts of those different schools. 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 My high school was back in the other district with the University brats in Madison, Wisconsin. 8, 9, 13, 19 AS: Which high school was that? 8 CR: Madison West. 9 It was a great school. 8, 11 I don’t know if it is anymore, but at the time it was. 13, 14, 15 I would say I was pursuing the doctor thing, but I hadn’t really thought deeply about it. 11, 12 It seemed like a good path, and it seemed like a good fit. 14, 19 It was being put in front of me. 10 Then out of high school I got into a program called the Medical Scholars, which I don’t believe happens anymore. 7, 8, 12, 13 The University of Madison Medical School has one hundred and fifty medical students per year. 9, 13, 14, 20 Fifty of those spots -- one third of the medical school -- is reserved for Medical Scholars. 8, 14 Medical Scholars get in coming out of high school. 8 Basically you apply to a program out of high school at the University of Wisconsin. 7, 8, 13 You have to be a Wisconsin resident, you have to go to University of Wisconsin for undergrad, and if you maintain a certain GPA [grade point average], which was very challenging, and do certain prerequisites, they grant you automatic admission into the medical school. 7, 8, 13, 14, 20 What Wisconsin wanted was to capture what they thought were their bright students and keep them in Wisconsin or in Minnesota. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 Keep their applicants in the state. 9 They did this as a lure.  I got into the Medical Scholarship program.  My pediatrician was on the admittance committee. 8 I don’t know if that’s nepotism or whatever you call it. 7, 13, 14, 15 [laughs]  I have really just had incredible luck along the way. 9, 12, 16 It is not like I earned everything I am. 10 I’m not saying I’m incredibly successful, but I am a doctor so I have a lot of things going for me. 11, 12, 16, 17 When someone has all of that going for them I am just so aware of all the little turns of luck I had. 9, 12, 19 Within the University of Wisconsin’s forty thousand person campus, Medical Scholars is like a liberal arts school dedicated to biology and pre-med embedded within the undergrad. 8, 10, 13 I had all the benefits of a big undergrad, yet none of the problems of being in a gigantic state school. 8, 9, 14 It was an incredibly focused pre-med education program. 9, 10, 12, 15 You have to get a good GPA, and they would dictate fifty percent of your pre-med courses and you had to get basically all As in your pre-med courses. 7, 11 All of the rest of your course credits -- do whatever you want; do enriching your careers, take philosophy, take Spanish, take whatever. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 The typical pre-med is stressing out about their GPA to get into the medical school spots. 8, 9, 14 I was basically studying to learn. 7, 9, 11, 12 I had to get a good GPA to maintain my Medical Scholar standing, but I wasn’t trying to outcompete my colleagues. 9, 12, 16 It was amazing. 15 I met the GPA bar by like .01. 5 It was literally a miracle.  It was like a B plus in organic chemistry instead of a B that did it. 9, 16 It was literally that close.  AS: But you stayed with it. 5, 9 You continued to enjoy it. 18 CR: What is really does is it gives you a really enriched education. 6, 10 You can take philosophy and Spanish and history and all these courses that make you feel more like an enriched person. 6, 9, 16 Meanwhile you work your butt off in your biology classes where you can take some risks in your other courses. 6, 8, 20 The typical pre-med is so anxious about their GPA that they will take fluff so they will get good grades in the fluff to focus more on the bio-sciences. 6, 15, 20 I could take more risks with my curriculum. 6 That has set this precedent for me with this kind of pay-it-forward thing where a lot of people enter medical school feeling like they competed their way in -- I feel like I entered medical school with this like, You’ve been given this, do something good with it. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17 I had incredible fortune. 12 I didn’t feel like I was a doctor until human anatomy. 16 The first week of medical school you start dissecting bodies. 8, 9, 11, 14 At that point I was like, Oh, wow, this is what being a doctor is and I loved it. 10, 13, 14 Human anatomy was probably the most important class I ever took. 20 It was incredible. 12 I don’t feel like I knew what being a doctor was until medical school. 6, 8, 12, 14, 16 In some ways that’s the story of an entitled person. 9, 16, 17 Someone affluent who had the silver spoon.  I didn’t have to stress out about my career until I was already in medical school. 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 And then when I was in there I was like, Yeah, this works for me. 10, 14 I had it easy.  I really did.  I had a really good path. 14 AS: The important thing is that you realize that. 14 CR: Oh yeah. 10 I am very lucky, compared to some of the things our patients and other people have to fight against in their young life. 11, 12, 14, 16 AS: How did you get into addiction medicine?  Did you have a personal connection? 16 CR: I think that almost everyone’s got someone in their family that is addicted. 9, 18 My sister had some mental health issues; my brother was alcoholic and later got into cocaine and opiates. 5, 9, 14, 15 When I was in medical school there was a scandal in Madison, Wisconsin where some cop caught a news reporter using coke. 6, 8, 13, 14 The news reporter, rather than taking some felony cocaine charge, said I’ve got a good deal for you. 6, 13, 17 He said, I know of at least a dozen firemen that are selling cocaine out of the fire station. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 I will give you those names if you give me a plea bargain. 5, 6 Of course because the cops and the fire stations usually have competitions, the cop was like, Yes. 9, 10, 15 This guy names thirteen names of these firemen that were using and selling cocaine. 6, 7, 15 AS: Do you remember what year this was? 20 It’s in all the newspapers. 6, 13 You would be able to find it.  Among those names, he listed my brother who was a fireman at the time. 5, 6, 9, 15 My brother was certainly alcoholic and had certainly used cocaine. 5, 9 Eleven out of the thirteen people were selling cocaine out of the fire station. 7, 9, 15 It was a huge deal and they got fired and went to jail. 12, 13, 15 Two of the people that were listed didn’t have any evidence. 9 My brother was one of them. 5 So my brother was caught in this fire storm of the fire union versus the fire police chief. 5, 7, 9, 15 Someone had seen my brother do cocaine in a bar late at night. 5, 19 No doubt he did; no doubt.  But lots of people use cocaine at 2:00 AM when they are twenty-three years old and they just got this new job and they have money. 5, 6, 9, 12, 17, 20 All the seriousness of the accusations of the people selling the drugs -- no one ever linked my brother to that. 5, 7, 14 I don’t link my brother to that. 5 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 He was one of two people that were front page news in the newspaper for a year. 6, 13, 20 AS: Even though he was still part of it all. 9 CR: Ultimately he was exonerated.  The charges were all dropped against him. 14, 17 It put him under such stress and scrutiny. 9, 10 He was an alcoholic. 5 He was exonerated of all charges. 17 He was allowed to keep his job. 12 After six months of being on the front page my mother was tortured by it. 8, 12, 20 You can imagine being his mom. 14, 15 In the end, he was wrongly accused of this. 9, 12 Two months later he got his third DUI [driving under the influence] and lost his driver’s license. 7, 8, 9, 14, 20 After that he was fired as a fireman. 12, 15 Joe has since gotten sober. 6, 15 After that he got sober from alcohol and hooked on pain pills. 6 Then he got sober from pain pills and now he is married, in recovery, a safety manager at a construction site, and a union welder. 6, 9, 13, 14 I saw this whole process go down.  We did an intervention for my brother. 5 AS: Were you in medical school? 8, 14 When did you start medical school? 8, 9, 11, 14 I graduated in 2002. 8 It was 2000, 2001 when this was happening. 12, 13 That may have been subconscious and it may have directed some of my thoughts but I was not explicitly becoming an addiction doctor to treat my brother. 5, 11, 12, 16 I was actually really clear with him. 10 I didn’t want to threaten him and be like, I’m doing this because of you. 10, 13, 15 I was also not doing this to help you. 13 I’m not doing this because of you, or to help you. 13 I’m doing this because it is right for me. 14 I’m doing this selfishly.  When I got into opioids and the pain world, Joe, my brother, had not come out as addicted to opioids. 5, 10, 13, 15, 19 When he finally told me he was hooked on Percocet, I was already deep into this world. 15, 20 Going down the opioids path was good for me and it had nothing to do with my brother. 5, 10, 14 Only later I found out he got hooked with opioids. 10 Just like every other person in the county that is introduced to opioids. 7, 9, 10 That was a very influential, early thing that happened to me. 12, 13 I think also dealing with my sister’s mental health issues affected how I interact with patients and think about mental health. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 It’s easy, in this story to be like, Oh, he had an alcoholic brother. 5, 9, 10 But I also had an OCD sister. 5, 9 Both these things had equal influence on how I think about and interact with patients. 10, 16, 20 I did an addiction rotation in medical school in that context -- while all of that was happening. 8, 12, 13, 14 I talked to the addiction doctor at the University of Wisconsin. 10, 11, 13 His name was Rich Brown. 6 There was a Randy Brown and a Rich Brown -- both of which work in addiction at Wisconsin.  In this case I talked to Rich Brown, and he was cool. 10, 11, 17 AS: What do you mean you talked to him? 10, 11, 16 CR: I emailed him and I was like, I’m struggling with what I should do with my brother. 5, 9, 10 Do you have any advice?  He emailed me back and then I did an addiction rotation.  I went to internal medicine residency at County Hospital -- here, HCMC.  I didn’t know if I was going into addiction or not, I didn’t know what I was going to do. 13, 14, 15 I was just enjoying residency. 9, 12 I did find that working with patients who had addiction wasn’t like Oh, an alcoholic. 5 I don’t want to go into the room. 7, 13 Then when I come out of the room I feel gross and weird. 7, 13, 16, 19 A lot of doctors are aversive to working with addicts. 17 Or they find working with addicts aversive, I should say.  That’s a really common thing.  Doctors are humans too.  Some doctors are like, ‘I feel really weird dealing with the health consequences of obesity’ because they think obese people caused this by themselves by eating too much and gaining weight. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18 ‘They have bad knees because they are obese.  I feel morally compromised.’ 16 Some doctors have that thought. 11, 12 Some doctors have the chainsmoker opioid user who has a heart attack. 9 For me, honestly, if there is anything, I don’t know if there is a bias, but patients I work with that have diabetes -- I will do it, but it’s not thrilling to me. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 I leave the room and I was like, I had to do that because it’s part of my job. 6, 7, 10 Whereas other people love that. 13 They go into that field.  We all have our things. 16 It just so happened I discovered during residency that when 9, 12, 13 I’m in the room with a patient that’s addicted I’m not stressed out. 7, 9 I’m happy to be there, I feel like I’m delivering care, I can look them in the eyes and relate to them, they seem to relate to me back, and I didn’t question that. 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 During residency I realized that was unique. 14 Most people are avoiding those patients whereas I’m drawn to them. 14 It’s probably because I saw it happening first hand with my brother. 5, 9, 12, 13 I know my brother is a good person, and I love my brother, so I know this person right here is someone’s sibling and I can look them in the eye and treat them as a sibling. 5, 13, 14, 15, 16 I think that contributed.  The fable I tell about how I got into addiction medicine is when I was a first year resident, I saw this young, black, gang member named Anthony. 5, 6, 9, 14, 20 He called himself Ant. 7 He had a tattoo of the word ‘ant’ on his arm.  He had congenital heart defect and he came in for his heart problem. 19 When he was there he confided in me that he was a heroin user and 9 I didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 I was an intern.  He went home and a couple of days later, as I was walking down the hallway a phone rang. 7, 15, 16, 19 A receptionist picked it up and said, Yeah, actually yes, he’s right here. 9, 10, 14 Someone just called this phone and asked for you, Charlie. 7, 9, 10, 12 I just happened to be walking down the hallway. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 Crazy coincidence.  I was surrounded by people that saw this happen. 8, 12 I picked up the phone and it was Ant and Ant was crying. 7, 11 He said, I just injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 There were people yelling in the background and he was crying and he said, I’m worried, I injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 I didn’t know what to tell him so I told him to go to the emergency room, which probably was not even the right answer. 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 I didn’t even know what to tell him. 13, 14, 15 All of these people were like, What happened and I told them that a patient that I saw three days ago randomly called this phone number and asked for me and confessed that he had just injected heroin. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19, 20 In some ways that was my vocation calling. 7, 10, 16, 17 I was like, That’s my future calling. 7, 10 That was a true story. 9 The other, more real, practical reason I got into addiction medicine was that my senior year, then as a chief resident, in my chief year, I would always work out in the gym. 10, 16, 17, 20 Gavin Bart, who is an addiction researcher and is my current boss, would work out beside me. 16 He would talk to me and he said, Look, if you want to take this job in the addiction department, we’ll account for fifty percent of your time with addiction work and the other fifty percent you can self determine. 6, 10, 13 Sounds eerily familiar, like the Medical Scholars program where it’s like here are fifty percent of your work you will have to work really hard for and we are going to account for and then we are going to give you freedom. 6, 11 Taking a job here pays thirty percent less than a community job, so it’s not like I’m going for the money. 10, 16 What do you mean a community job? 16 CR: Like if I went to a community hospital and just out of general interest I would have made at least thirty percent more money. 9, 12, 16, 19 He didn’t give me a financial pitch, he gave me a professional enrichment pitch. 6, 20 He just said that if I liked addiction to come do a fellowship and then come to the addiction division and you’ll be able to have a lot of freedom to self determine your job. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 It was just such a great offer. 9, 11, 12 Then when I assembled my dream job it’s this diverse patchwork of different things. 14, 16, 17 Everything balances each other.  There is a lot of addiction, but a lot of it is non-addiction. 17 He let me develop myself professionally and he trusts me. 9, 16, 19, 20 I saw this opportunity to work within a professionally enriching setting with a good boss. 17, 20 AS: When did you start with him? 9, 11 CR: Residency was 2002 and then chief residency was 2005 to 2006 and then fellowship was 2006 to 2008. 15 I have been here since January 1, 2008.  When you say fifty percent with addiction medicine does that involve the clinic?  CR: Yes.  AS: Can you describe what you do?  CR: About half of the weekdays of the year I am responsible for being on-call for the methadone clinic, which could be super mellow or super busy. 5, 7, 9, 12, 19, 20 It allows me to be in my office to take phone calls, multitask, do academic projects. 6, 7 From 6:00 AM until 1:00 PM, six hundred patients might come through these doors to the methadone clinic and we need a doctor on call. 5, 7, 13, 19 It could go smoothly or it could go crazy. 16 About half of the days when this clinic is open I am on-call and then the other half is another doctor. 7, 17, 19, 20 Methadone is a big component of my addiction work. 8 Every Wednesday afternoon, I do a tobacco clinic. 19 AS: This is one of the other things you do? 16 CR: This is one of the other components.  Well, the tobacco clinic is within the addiction domain and is something I have chosen to do.  I don’t know if that counts as my addiction part. 13, 14, 15 What Dr. Bart needed me to do was be on-call for the methadone clinic. 5, 7, 13 That’s what he needed. 13 Outside of that ten percent of my time is dedicated to tobacco work. 10 Ten percent of my time I drive to Rice County and work in Rice County and I work at a Suboxone clinic. 7, 14 Ten percent in tobacco, ten percent teaching at the University of Minnesota. 13 Twenty-five percent is general medicine hospitalist work. 9 I work with medical students and medical residents taking care of patients with pneumonia and heart attacks and what not. 7, 9, 14 The rest of it is on-call for methadone. 7, 9, 19 That’s busy. 9 CR: It’s a lot of things. 16, 17 The methadone is so hit and miss that you can have a lot of side projects. 5, 17 So I have a lot of side projects, extra curricular projects. 17 AS: What happens when you are in here at the methadone clinic? 5, 12 What do you typically get called out of your office for? 7 CR: Someone appears oversedated, someone wants to change their methadone dose, someone has been continually been using drugs despite our best efforts and we need to do an intervention. 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 AS: When you say other drugs what do you mean? 14, 16 CR: Could be opiates, could be cocaine, could be alcohol.  Any combination of drug use plus being on the methadone dose and whether or not it’s wrong or they appear oversedated. 5, 9, 14 Sometimes they have a question and they want to speak to a doctor. 5, 6, 9, 13, 18 Or they are dissatisfied in some way. 16 Often the counselor has a question; the counselor feels like they are up against the wall or they have hit a roadblock and they need to brainstorm what is the next best step. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 AS: Have you gotten to know a lot of patients? 13, 14, 15, 17 Do you have patients that have been here for years? 20 CR: Yes.  I think the stereotype about addiction medicine is that it is this series of emergencies because an addict who is not in care is a series of emergencies. 7, 9 An addict who is seeking care isn’t going to the emergency room, isn’t going to the urgent care. 7 They are hospitalized, and in jail, and in detox. 10 An addict who is in care isn’t like that at all. 7, 10 An addict who is seeking addiction medicine is in long-term medical management of care. 7, 14 Whether they are getting a medicine or they are at support groups.  These addicts that get into care are these long-term patients working towards stability. 7, 9 You get these long-term, incredibly fulfilling relationships with people. 12 There are people that I have seen sixty times within the last eight years -- literally sixty times. 9, 18, 20 I have seen them and fifty plus of those times they are doing great and just checking in. 9, 11, 12, 18 Less than ten of those times they really need help for some reason. 13, 18 They are relapsing or they are worried about relapsing or they are being triggered in some way. 12, 16 Taking care of an addict as an addiction doctor is not a series of crises. 7 Seventy plus percent of the time you are managing people in stable recovery and you are just trying to keep them there. 9, 12, 15, 16, 18 In that sense it is really fulfilling. 17 At any given time, twenty to thirty percent are in crisis. 6 Every day there is something new. 6, 19 The vast majority of one’s patients are in long-term stable recovery. 9, 18 I think that is a misconception of addiction medicine: that you are dealing with people that don’t want to be there whose lives are blowing up, who are lying their pants off, and who are reprehensible characters. 10, 13 It’s people who have accepted that they have a disease, who are working to get back to a relatively normal life, and who are working hard. 11, 19 Most of them are in treatment. 9, 16 We help them get there and help them attempt to have a perfect life. 11, 13 It is really rewarding and that is a misconception of the job that I do.  AS: Speaking of that, I’d like you to talk a little about the stigma of methadone. 5, 9, 10 In interviews that I have had and other conversations there is a stigma that you don’t want to be on methadone because you don’t want to come to a clinic like this. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 There are class and race assumptions that go along with methadone, not to mention in many of the support groups such as AA [alcoholics anonymous] and NA [narcotics anonymous], to be on a medicine is to go against. 5, 15, 20 CR: It is changing. 16, 18 AS: It is changing, and I would like to see if you could talk about stigma and methadone and if you have seen a change and when that started? 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 CR: I think there are a couple of different reasons why the stigma for methadone is there. 9, 16, 17 I will lay out what I think is the biggest one first. 8, 9, 11 It is basically a misunderstanding about addiction. 7, 9, 11, 12, 16 I am going to come back to that one once I find the words for it. 13, 19 Number two: the easier one to explain.  In a methadone clinic twenty years ago you would have a lot of black people. 17, 20 A huge number of African-Americans, a lot of poor people, and whatever the other oppressed group in your local community is. 17 For us it might be Native Americans, poor people, black people, and if you happen to be caucasian you probably had a mental illness. 8, 12, 14 The demographics of a methadone maintenance clinic -- the demographics of heroin twenty years ago -- was black, urban, felons. 15, 20 Because of that I think there’s some component of, I don’t want to go to that clinic with all those people I don’t identify with. 13 If you’re an affluent, urban, caucasian person, the idea that going to a clinic that is highly black, urban, poor, with some mental health and felonies mixed in -- racism and classism took over. 8, 11, 14, 20 That was the first thing. 9 Now, I entered the field of addiction just as heroin was affecting white, suburban kids. 9, 12 You just roll your eyes: this is something that has been endemic in the North Minneapolis black neighborhood for decades and decades and decades. 8, 9, 12, 14, 16 Now that it is affecting affluent, urban kids people are freaking out.  I get it.  But I roll my eyes at it. 14, 16 I do think how democratic opioid addiction is will force the stigma to change. 9, 16 Opioid addiction is absolutely democratic.  Opioids absolutely have no racial, gender, or age preference. 12 This is absolutely a democratic addiction and it is fatal.  Now, a New York Times article about a Mexican drug cartel looked at a map of America and they said, Where are the regions already controlled by gangs? 7, 14, 17 We aren’t going to get into a gang war to sell heroin in North Minneapolis. 7 But, Wayzata, and Eden Prairie, there are no gangs there and there is a lot of money there. 17 There was a concerted effort of the Mexican drug cartel to look at a map of America, look at existing gang territory, and go to other regions. 7, 9, 14 That came on the tail end of the pharmaceutical opioid epidemic. 12, 19 Obviously the epidemic affected people who had insurance. 7 The pharmaceutical thing disproportionately affected people that had some sort of insurance and didn’t hit the working class as much fifteen years ago. 7, 17, 18, 20 The pharmaceutical thing was more white.  The Mexican drug cartel rode those coattails to those same communities that were getting the pharmaceuticals with their three dollar co-pay from their insurance. 7, 14, 16 It’s more complex than that, but opioid addiction has been democratized in the last five years and the only good thing about the new demographics of people: women, caucasians, suburban; these groups were less affected by heroin twenty years ago. 6, 8, 9, 18, 20 It was more male, African American, and urban.  Obviously it is negative when other groups get affected.  The only positive thing about it is that I think it will dramatically affect the stigma going forward. 7, 9, 13, 14 When only urban black men are affected, when HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] only happened to gay, male, IV [intravenous] drug users, you can’t help but to think of it as a gay disease. 9, 12, 13, 14 When it starts happening to straight people you realize it can happen to everyone. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 I think that is what is happening with opioids right now. 10, 12, 13, 14 People realize they had false ideas. 11, 14 That gets back to the methadone thing. 5, 19 The treatment was mistaken for the demographic thing twenty years ago. 6, 9, 16, 20 Two is that another thing that has bedeviled methadone maintenance, which is kind of a specific point, but relevant, is that methadone tablets for pain can very clearly cause death in pain patients. 5, 15, 16, 17, 19 There have been many very important warning from the CDC [center for disease control] that methadone causes death when given for pain. 5, 6, 9, 17 Recently, there was a Star Tribune article on this where I was weirdly misquoted but then people say, Methadone for pain is so deadly, why are we giving something so deadly to the addict themselves? 11 This is what I was trying to get at. 16 People don’t understand that once you’re an opioid addict, methadone reduces death, prolongs life, improves pregnancy outcomes, reduces incarceration, reduces IV drug use, reduces Hepatitis C and HIV transmission. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 Once you are an opioid addict, the medicine helps stabilize the addict. 9, 13 Once you are an addict, you have an incredible high death rate. 8, 12 Methadone lowers the death rate in that person in a controlled setting. 17 If you are a pain patient -- not addicted, but in pain -- you should have a really low death rate and methadone raises it.  If you are an addict you have a high death rate and methadone lowers it. 8 The pain patient in theory shouldn’t be at risk of incarceration and all the other stuff. 7, 9 The point is that in saying that ‘methadone kills pain patients, so why are we giving it to drug addicts,’ they misunderstand that we are talking about two distinctly different groups of people and the addict is at incredible risk of death. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 They are totally different groups of people. 16, 17 It’s like saying insulin would harm someone without diabetes, so why are you giving insulin to someone with diabetes? 11 It’s like methadone helps someone with addiction, so why would you give it to someone without addiction? 6, 13 The reason is because over and over since the fifties it has been proven to save lives.  I think that since all the stigma and talk is going to go away when you realize that young, caucasian, affluent kids that are dying, we need to have something to make these kids not die. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 That is a racist idea that we have let it go so long in the African American community. 9, 11, 19 That is a sad thing. 12 The good thing is that now that it is hitting other communities we are finally going to wake up. 14 The addicts themselves who enroll in a methadone clinic, if there is anything they don’t like it is the attendance requirement. 12, 15 The attendance requirement is funny because the addicts don’t like to attend because the first ninety days you have to go six days a week. 9, 10, 12, 15, 19 The community is often surprised to hear how close we monitor people on methadone maintenance. 12, 15, 18 We observe dosing six days a week for up to six hundred patients. 19 There is a doctor on-call every day. 7, 19 This methadone clinic sees more people every year than the emergency room does. 5, 7, 20 Up to three hundred patients a day come here and are observed. 13, 19 It is an incredibly tight monitoring program. 12 We are giving them a powerful medicine, but it has been proven to save their life and it is in the context of very powerful monitoring. 11, 15 Totally different from methadone for pain when they give you a bottle of pills for a month's worth and tell you almost nothing and we have almost no regulation on the doctor's prescribing those pills. 5, 6, 8, 9, 16, 17 It is a totally different context. 16, 17 Part of the stigma that comes from patients is they call methadone ‘liquid handcuffs.’ 7, 9, 13, 19 It comes in a liquid form. 13, 17, 19 They call it liquid handcuffs because they’re really kind of stuck here. 7, 9, 16, 17 They feel stuck here. 9, 16 This gets me back to trying to articulate what I was going to say at the very beginning. 16, 19 A lot of people think they are on methadone and then will be tapered off and then can be done. 12, 17 Then I’ll be cured. 12 What methadone is not is a cure for addiction. 5 I hope someday we have cures but we don’t. 10, 19 Before you enter the methadone clinic it means you have opioid addiction, which means you have high risk for death, HIV, incarceration, bad pregnancy outcomes, et cetera. 7, 8, 13, 16, 19 When you enter our clinic, we can’t make that go away. 16 We can only manage it with a drug. 14 A lot of people enter our clinic and think, Maybe I’m addicted to methadone now. 5, 14, 17 You’re not addicted to methadone now. 5, 14 You are still addicted and there’s no getting around that. 9 They feel like they are stuck on methadone. 9, 16 In some ways you’re stuck with opioid addiction and you need to find the best way to manage it and methadone is one tool. 9, 13, 16, 17 I think a lot of people express their frustration at opioid addiction directed at methadone. 5, 9, 17 They’re frustrated with the fact that they have an incurable disease and there’s no way around it and it has incredible consequences for their life. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 It manifests as showing up to a methadone clinic six days a week and feeling beholden to that liquid methadone because if you don’t you’re in a lot of trouble and then you get angry at it. 5, 9, 16, 17, 19, 20 I think doctors see that as well, for example, for dialysis patients. 6 If you are a dialysis patient you show up for dialysis three times a week, do a three hour dialysis run, and it shifts fluids in and out of the body and pumps blood around and it feels really weird and uncomfortable. 8, 11, 16, 18 You become reliant, dependent on the dialysis machine. 8, 12, 13, 19 If you skip you die in two weeks.  A dialysis patient with die without it in two weeks.  They are both totally dependent on dialysis for life. 11, 12, 17 Many, not all, come to resent dialysis and what it represents in their life. 7, 11, 13, 19 They can become angry at their dialysis unit, angry at the dialysis nurses and doctors. 13, 19 Not all are unhappy. 17 They come and get it quietly. 13, 19 Many patients become resentful at this ball and chain. 7, 8, 13, 19 They mistake the dialysis for the kidney failure. 6, 9 They mistake the methadone for the heroin addiction. 5, 6, 9 That’s a really common confusion.  Long winded answer.  AS: Methadone has an image problem from all sectors.  From society, from the patients themselves, and from the twelve-step recovery communities. 9, 12 CR: I’m going to sound like what I’ve heard Obama saying. 10, 11, 15 He keeps saying these things like there are these forces and demographics at play in America that will take us on a path, whether we have steps backwards or not, we are on this path and we can’t stop it. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19 These things are changing. 16, 18 It’s a good change. 16 I think the same thing about treatment of addiction. 9, 16 In some ways it’s bad news because addiction is so democratized now, but it will force us to change. 6, 13, 14, 16, 17 The twelve-step programs not liking methadone -- I’m not even worried about it. 9, 12, 15 Just give it ten years. 6, 9, 20 You can be in twelve-step programs, but you can only blame the dead person for their death so often before people will just reject it. 9, 12, 15, 17 You cannot blame the dead person for dying. 17 It just sounds cruel. 9, 10, 12, 16 Unless you have another way to keep those people alive you’re ideology is going to need to change -- and it will change. 12, 13, 16 Just like it changed for anti-depressants and all things twelve-step programs went back on. 9, 12, 16, 19 I’m not against twelve-step programs. 9, 12 I think it’s a good thing.  We have seen Hazelden Betty  Ford begin to backtrack on the opioid thing. 19 All the dinosaurs that don’t believe in the life saving care, they are going to come around because they have to. 7, 8, 11, 13, 19 AS: There is accountability now because you also have a whole new demographic of rich, affluent, white people who are not going accept that your program didn’t work because they paid for it. 6, 14 CR: Exactly. 10 I think a lot of those things are going to change. 16, 17 I’m not worried about twelve-step programs or Hazelden Betty Ford. 9, 12 They are changing and they have to change. 16, 18 I am happy that I spent those hours in the gym with Gavin Bart who coached me. 11, 17, 19 I will say one other thing.  People in the government and people in the insurance companies don’t flinch for a second about methadone. 7, 20 They know that methadone keeps people out of prison and keeps people alive. 12, 13, 14, 15 There is no insurer in Minnesota that has done the actual math in methadone maintenance clinics that doesn’t pay for them. 10, 15, 16 Every insurer pays for them. 15, 16 The typical clinic with collect fifty percent of their bills and the insurance companies will negotiate or people won’t pay or that treatment isn’t covered. 7, 9, 12, 16 We collect over ninety-five percent of our bills.  The only people that aren’t paid for are people who are clearly abusing the system and still relapsing and they get their funding cut off rightfully so. 8, 9, 11, 14 Every insurer is like, Oh, so you’re telling me for five thousand dollars this heroin addict gets six days a week plus urine screens, drug tests, nurses and doctors visits, monitoring, social work; wrap around services for a heroin addict, for five thousand dollars a year. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 You just need to save one emergency room visit and we’ve made a profit. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 We easily do that for every patient.  Methadone is just one of the best bargains in healthcare, so almost every insurer is going to pay for it. 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 That tells you that the monied interests love it because it saves money. 9, 13, 19 The government is very clear-eyed about medication assisted treatment; there is no stigma there. 9, 10, 16 This just keeps you alive. 9, 12 The people who look at this with analytical eyes all really clearly understand the value of methadone and suboxone for the treatment of opioid addiction. 9, 12, 14, 16 The people that get their eyes clouded with their stigma, their ideology, their belief system, and aren’t just being analytical about it throw their ideology about it and get moralistic and they blame dead people for dying. 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 One more thing about the stigma of addiction is that [A. Thomas] 9 McLellan published an article in JAMA [Journal of the American Medical Association] in 2001 in which he took four diseases and compared them: asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, and alcoholism. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 He made a grid and you say, What is the genetic contribution to these diseases? 6, 16 It turns out that asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and alcoholism all have fifty to sixty percent genetics. 9, 12, 15, 19 Fifty to sixty percent of if I’m an alcoholic is due to my genetics. 5 Second, what is the curability of those diseases? 6 None of those diseases is curable. 6 What is the treatability of those diseases? 6, 16 All of those diseases have treatments, but not cures. 6, 9, 16 What is the patient adherence to doctor’s recommendations? 12 All of them have comparable patient adherence.  Whether you tell a diabetic to not eat sugar or an asthmatic to not smoke a cigarette or a hypertensive to not use a salt shaker or an alcoholic not to drink alcohol. 5, 6, 9, 14, 15 When you’re telling a person to change their lifestyle behavior, whether it is in the alcohol or the salt shaker, you get the same results. 9, 11, 16 About thirty percent of patients just don’t follow doctor’s orders -- whether it is alcohol or salt or sugar or exercise or weight loss or whatever it is. 9, 12, 18 Thirty percent don’t follow doctor’s orders and seventy percent try to. 12, 15, 16 Many of those don’t succeed.  Alcoholism is just like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma in its genetic risk, patient reaction to news, treatability, and curability. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 If you forget you’re stigma it looks like any other chronic disease.  The final line on the bottom of the comparison is access to treatment. 6, 9, 16 All those other diseases are given access to treatments, but alcoholics are not. 5, 6, 9, 16 This was a really powerful, thoughtful argument made by McLellan saying basically in every way if you are analytical and put your stigma aside, alcoholism is every bit the same, chronic disease but for some reason they’re not given treatment. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 There are treatments available; they are no less good or worthy of patients than the hypertensive that continues to use salt. 6, 9, 15, 16 They have no more curable than a disease.  I think that is something we’re still slowly wrapping our heads around. 8, 9 AS: There is such a moral stigma and judgement against people. 9 It’s been called a disease for a very long time, but we don’t see it as we see other diseases. 6, 7 CR: Here is another thing I would point out.  In 1975 if you had a heart attack they would put you on bed rest for six weeks and tell you that you are stressing yourself out, you’re an A-type personality, and because of your lifestyle you’ve given yourself a heart attack. 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 19 In other words, your heart attack was blamed on your personality. 16, 17 Now, if you have a heart attack it’s bing-bang-boom: cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, put a stent in, give them the common cocktail of medicines, and they are back at work in two or three days. 6, 9, 10, 15, 19 Nobody cares what your personality is. 7, 16 Ten years later in 1985 if you had an ulcer people would say, Your family has given you an ulcer, you’re worrying too much, you eat jalapenos. 6, 11, 18, 20 Crap like this.  Now if you have an ulcer, no one cares what your lifestyle, personality, anxiety level, jalapeno, or coffee intake is. 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 20 Do you take Ibuprofen or Advil? 6 Do you have cancer?  Do you have an infection called helicobacter pylori? 7, 10 Correct those things and you are back at work in a day and your ulcer will be healed in two weeks. 16, 19 No one cares about your stress level today if you have an ulcer. 7, 9, 19, 20 This is human nature.  There used to be this disease called consumption. 7, 9 There was a consumptive personality. 16 That turned out to be tuberculosis. 19 Or gout was the king’s disease.  Gout has nothing to do with being a king.  It has to do with that you eat foods that are high in oxalate, which kings happened to do because they had money back then and it was trendy. 8, 12, 13, 19 AS: Or hysteria. 9 CR: Hysteria! 9 There are lots of examples of this. 5, 6, 17 When we don’t understand a disease fully, and more importantly when we don’t have tools to treat it, we don’t have analytics to measure it, we always describe these diseases to personality. 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 It’s just human nature. 9, 12 When we can’t define it, when we can’t measure it, and when we can’t cure it. 14, 15 AS: Does it surprise you that we are still there with addiction? 9 CR: No. Brain diseases are more complex. 6 It’s just a more complex disease. 9, 12 Depression is probably about ten to fifteen years ahead of addiction in terms of stigmatizing it. 9, 20 The difference with depression was when Prozac came out. 19 People say good and bad things about it: the Prozac revolution, the Prozac brain. 16 What Prozac and all the similar antidepressants that followed -- Prozac is actually not as good as an antidepressant as those that preceded it. 10, 12 There were better antidepressants.  But, Prozac was so safe that any primary care doctor could give it out basically willy-nilly. 6, 7, 11 It’s main advantage was safety, which allowed it to be used in any primary care clinic in the country. 7, 9, 11, 16 By putting a tool in the hands of every primary care doctor, suddenly a primary care doctor could ask their patient about their mood. 7, 10, 13 Suddenly, if the patient had a bad mood the primary care doctor could do something right there to help them safely. 7, 13, 14 Not perfectly effective, but moderately effective.  By putting a tool in the hands of the average doctor, you basically began the process of destigmatizing the disease. 7, 9, 10, 11 To have depression in 1980 was totally different than having depression today. 16, 17, 19 Having depression in 1980 would have kept a politician out of office. 8 Today we have a governor that has had depression. 19 AS: And we can talk about it and people know about it. 10, 13, 14, 15 CR: We can talk about it. 10 Great!  I voted for him knowing that and I don’t regret it at all. 13, 14, 15 I think it’s appropriate.  When we start putting metrics and tools in hands -- not BS, but things that work and really make a difference for people’s lives -- we are going to see. 5, 9, 10, 11, 16 You need metrics. 5, 13 If we need a blood test or if you can measure and quantify something with a blood test, or an x-ray and you have a tool to fix it and it goes to every primary care clinic in the country it changes everything. 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 It is out of the shadows now. 14 It is quantifiable, it’s visualizable, and it’s treatable. 16 Right now addiction is hard to quantify and treatment is still in this shadowy, ghetto corner of medicine. 9, 11, 14, 16 That’s why I think Suboxone should be in primary care clinics, not just to gain access, but to destigmatize. 6, 7, 9, 12 AS: Can you talk about Suboxone a little bit? 10 Is the clinic that you work in in Northfield [Minnesota]?  CR: We actually moved to Lonsdale for practical reasons; they actually have a great space. 8, 10, 11 I know have a Suboxone clinic here in Minneapolis at HCMC. 13, 14, 15 I’m not taking any patients at that now, but I have a Suboxone clinic in Lonsdale, Minnesota in a family practice setting. 10, 14, 17, 18 All the doctors that work in that clinic are family practice doctors. 10, 18 Every other Monday 19 I see patients in Lonsdale.  Yesterday I saw twenty-three patients in five hours. 9, 11, 19 It’s crazy. 16 It’s incredibly rewarding. 12 Yesterday literally two of my twenty-three patients were using heroin still. 9, 19 The rest were sober. 6, 9, 19 I get drug screens, I check their prescription monitoring program, but more so I just know these patients. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I meet with them regularly. 13 One of them was given a cruise as the best salesman in their company. 6, 9 She was awarded a cruise to Hawaii.  One of them just got offered a major promotion at work. 9, 12, 18 These people are really thriving at work and are really happy. 17 It’s incredibly rewarding work for me. 12 Suboxone is like that thing I said about Prozac.  Prozac isn’t a better antidepressant, but it’s safer, so therefore it could be given out more easily in a primary care facility. 6, 7 AS: Can you talk about the difference between suboxone and methadone? 5, 10 CR: Suboxone and methadone when compared head to head have similar effectiveness in keeping people alive, out of prison, stopping injections -- there’s more data on methadone because it’s been around longer -- but every time Suboxone and methadone have been compared they come out about equal. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 What that means is that on nothing, on abstinence based therapy, you could say twenty percent at best are abstinent still after a year. 9, 16, 20 If you just try to do behavioral, talk therapy alone, the outcomes are approximately twenty percent a year, and some have been ten percent in the studies. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 Sometimes it’s five percent. 5, 18 To be fair to abstinence based treatment, twenty-five percent is the high end after a year. 8, 9, 12, 16, 20 Methadone or Suboxone changes that to seventy-five percent, eighty percent in some studies. 9, 16 You are taking a one year abstinence success rate at twenty percent and turning it into seventy percent. 9, 15, 19, 20 Still note that thirty percent of opiate addicts don’t respond to Suboxone or methadone.  This is not a one hundred percent effective treatment. 9, 16 If you do Suboxone or methadone it is not one hundred percent. 5 Seventy percent are going to respond to either methadone or Suboxone as opposed to twenty percent to behavioral treatment. 9, 15, 16 Methadone and Suboxone are comparable in those studies, but there are some differences and I’ll itemize them. 9 Methadone is a full opioid. 11 Both are very long acting and can be taken once a day and will last all day. 6, 9, 10, 19 If you stop taking them you won’t go into withdrawal for three days. 9, 10, 14, 19 In case of emergency or if something happens you have time to get to a clinic if you can’t get it today. 7, 12, 19 They both have very long half lives, and can be taken once a day and last all day, and don’t cause withdrawal for the first three days. 6, 9, 14, 19, 20 They both block other opiates.  If you try to use heroin you won’t feel the heroin. 9, 16 Therefore, it helps you extinguish your heroin habit. 13 Almost all methadone and Suboxone patients, early on, test it; they try heroin on this drug and they realize they are wasting their money. 9, 14, 16 Suboxone may be a little better at blocking heroin than methadone, but they both block heroin. 5 They are both once a day drugs that last long and block opiates. 9, 14, 19 Neither of them get you high if you are tolerant. 7, 8 If you have never touched an opiate before and you take methadone -- yeah, you’re going to get really intoxicated. 5, 6, 10, 15 Even Suboxone you can get intoxicated on if you have never used an opioid before. 9, 10, 15 But, if you are a heroin addict, you aren't going to get high on methadone if it is dosed appropriately. 5, 8 They are long acting, block other opiates, you should be wide awake, not nodding off, not intoxicated. 10 In that sense, they are identical. 17 The difference comes in in that Suboxone has a ceiling effect in approximately forty percent opiate strength. 9, 13, 19 Even if you really wanted to overdose someone on Suboxone you couldn’t because it has that ceiling effect. 12, 13, 15 Suboxone in some ways is dummy-proof. 16, 17 You aren’t going to get oversedated on Suboxone.  If you take Suboxone patients -- I was showing this to a medical student yesterday in the clinic -- if you took Suboxone patients and lined them up with patients who had never used opioids in their life and you took an expert and they had to pick who’s on Suboxone and who’s not, you can’t. 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19 I’m very attuned to this -- the size of someone’s pupils, their eyelids, the rate of their speech. 16 I’m very attuned to opioid intoxication and I cannot pick a Suboxone patient out of a line-up. 6, 10 It’s got a lighter touch. 15 You don’t have to worry so much about dosing Suboxone. 11, 18 If you don’t nothing terrible will happen. 12, 15 Methadone does not have that ceiling effect.  Methadone is a full opioid agonist. 9, 11 Because of that, if you want to be a responsible methadone prescriber you have to work really hard to set limits. 5, 11, 13, 17 There is a dose of methadone which is enough to keep the patient out of withdrawal, addiction managed, keep the patient comfortable, block other opioids, and yet not cause oversedation or, even worse, overdose. 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20 There is a dose of methadone that can do that. 5 There is a sweet spot.  There is also such thing as too much methadone. 5, 18 If you are going to work with methadone you have to work really hard to set limits on your patients. 11, 17 Some of these are patients that don’t like limits. 10 Part of the job of being a methadone doctor is setting limits. 5, 17 If you can set those limits and keep them in that window where they are getting incredible therapeutic benefits without the oversedation, then methadone behaves exactly the same as Suboxone. 10, 12, 14, 17 Suboxone’s advantage is that ceiling effect and you don’t have to constantly say ‘no’ to people. 9 That is the first major difference because you can overdose and die on methadone much more easily. 5, 9, 15, 18 There’re only a few cases of people dying of buprenorphine alone.  You can mix buprenorphine with all sorts of other drugs and die, but buprenorphine alone doesn’t kill you. 7, 14, 17 Methadone alone can kill people. 7 Because it is more potentially lethal that is why it is more highly regulated. 8, 15, 19 That is why we get these clinics and people coming in six days a week. 19 Suboxone is less tightly regulated and can be done out of a primary care clinic. 7 Primary care doctors can prescribe Suboxone and not see the patient six days a week. 7, 19 AS: I’ve heard that there’s a limit on how many patients a doctor can take because of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. 6, 9, 15 Has that changed? 16 First, there were thirty patients per doctor. 9 Then, if you do that for a year you can apply for a hundred patients. 12, 14, 20 Now the DEA has raised it to 275 patients per doctor. 5 That far exceeds what any reasonable doctor needs. 13 CR: Within the last year -- less than six months ago. 8, 9, 20 That far exceeds what any doctor would need. 13 Right now that limit has been raised to almost too high of a level. 5, 8, 9, 14, 20 The truth is that the average primary care doctor has 1500 patients, let’s say. 7, 19 Of those, twenty percent at least are on opioids. 9, 10 That’s three hundred patients on opioids. 10 So the average primary care doctor has three hundred opioid patients and of those ten percent are addicted. 7 The average primary care doctor actually has thirty patients that are addicted to the opioids they are prescribed. 7, 10 The average primary care doctor has a couple dozen addicts in their midst, and they know those patients and they are desperate to do something for those patients. 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 It is incredibly burdensome to their day, to their clinic, to their nurses. 12, 19 They call in all the time, they are running out of pills; they are addicts. 7, 11 Right now those patients are fumbling through with their primary care doctor on Percocet. 7, 14 When the primary care doctor creates a manmade addiction -- iatrogenic addiction -- they created it themselves as a side effect of a prescribed medicine. 7, 16 When that iatrogenic addiction occurs it would be really handy if the primary care doctor had a tool to treat that addiction. 7, 16 It would save everyone a ton of time and heartache.  In that sense, the average care doctor only needs fifteen to thirty spots in suboxone. 7, 13, 17 If they wanted to take on community Suboxone patients they would need more than thirty. 6, 12, 13 When I’m talking to a person and they ask if they should go on Suboxone or methadone, if you are a very complicated patient: mental illness, socially sick, homeless, legal issues, and you’ve relapsed multiple times and you would benefit from very close supervision, methadone is better. 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19 If you need a stronger agent because you have a super sky high tolerance, methadone is better. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 If you basically have stuff together, if your life is together, you’ve got a job, you aren’t seriously mentally ill, you haven’t had multiple life-threatening overdoses and relapses, having a community Suboxone doctor for one month at a time and not get all that supervision; that may be better for you. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 You don’t have to come into the clinic six days a week because you basically have good mental health, good social stability, good structure because you can take medicines on your own. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 You just need to get out of this trap you are in in this opioid addiction. 9, 12, 13 That’s the really basic part.  The reality is what can you get in your community.  Right now you just take what you can get. 6, 9, 12, 14 AS: Right.  In the ideal world where the primary doctor knows how to deal with Suboxone, but that’s not happening right now? 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 That’s not happening right now. 12, 13, 14 There’re not enough Suboxone spots. 20 Only these major metropolitan areas have methadone clinics. 5, 18 If you are in the rural clinics you have to drive hours to a methadone clinic. 7, 11, 14 It’s not safe.  There is this weird patchwork of availability of these different drugs. 14, 16, 17 If you can get anything they just jump at it and take it. 6, 9, 12 It will save your life. 11 In the future if there is greater availability, that’s what a methadone clinic is for: people who need this high degree of supervision. 8, 11, 12, 13, 20 AS: Is there any kind of campaign to get Suboxone out more? 8, 16, 17 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 People talk about campaigns but I don’t know what that actually is or if it will actually affect change. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: The only other question I was going to ask was what an ordinary day for you is and what an extraordinary day for you is. 6, 9, 15, 19 You can limit it to one of your places. 11, 17 CR: There is one other thing I want to say. 13 Another variable in all of this is the research into addiction.  There is incredible work being done right now in the NIH [National Institute of Health]. 9, 12, 14 Nora  Volkow is at the center of this but there are many great researchers involved in looking at where the addiction centers are and all the neurotransmitters involved. 7, 9, 11 There’s a lot of money involved in other pharmaceuticals and treatments. 6, 9, 16, 17 If you can treat addiction more effectively and safely it is a gold mine. 16, 20 There is a lot of interest in it, but it is complex science. 9, 17, 19 I think it’s going to take ten to twenty years. 6, 20 As that science emerges I think it’s a really exciting time.  There is a refocus on clinical science and basic science and the development of pharmaceuticals for addiction. 15, 16 It’s exciting.  That is another way to destigmatize things. 9, 16 If you can define them in analytical terms it removes a lot of stigma. 9, 14, 17 I’m hopeful that we are on the right path. 10, 14 I really am.  I’m not doing any of this science, so I’m really glad someone is out there doing it!  My boss is one of them, so I’m glad people are doing it.  A fulfilling day -- there are two versions of the same day. 19 Either a busy Suboxone clinic or like on Monday I saw twenty-three Suboxone patients. 9, 19 Greater than eighty percent are doing well.  One of them was a pregnant mom who was on pain pills and got pregnant and the doctor abruptly cut her off pain pills. 15 She went into withdrawal and she got desperate and she went and used heroin. 9, 14 She called me and I was able to get her onto Suboxone which was life saving for her and her pregnancy -- it improves her pregnancy outcome. 7, 11, 13, 19 Another one, similarly; I had two pregnant moms. 15, 18 I just had an incredible mix of patients at a crossroads in their lives. 9, 12 I had this pregnant mom who was at a crossroad in her life. 9, 11, 15 Eight years in I’m confident -- I’ve made errors, I’ve had bad outcomes -- but I’m confident I can help this mom who is snorting heroin and get a good outcome. 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 That is exciting and thrilling me to see my eighty plus patients who are living the good outcome and then have the ten to twenty percent that are trying to get there and I feel a real sense of hope and confidence that I can get these patients to cross the finish line to a good outcome. 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 I want both these moms to have healthy deliveries. 13, 14, 15, 18 A similar analogy here is I’ll have methadone clinic days where I’ll just line up the methadone patients and I’ll see maybe ten in the morning talking about dose and side-effects and their life. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19 Some of those mornings it is so fulfilling and wonderful to me even though the majority of them have some problem we are working on, either with their dose or something else. 15, 18 To see these people that were really badly wounded and suffering and sick in a lot of ways, to hear them and their stories and to meet them and understand how they are really leading a meaningful life now. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 Whether it is Suboxone or methadone having those clinics where I can see these folks and sit down and get to know them. 13, 14, 15 Friend isn’t the right word, but I’m friends with some of them and I really appreciate their presence in my life. 11, 12, 14, 18 I had one guy give me a cup of coffee -- he’s a ceramicist -- and I drink out of it every morning. 6, 9, 14 This heroin addict made me this beautiful mug and I drink out of it every morning! 6, 14, 16 Those things are wonderful. 16 I think the worst thing for me is administrative paperwork called a prior authorization that is attached to Suboxone administration. 7, 9, 19 It is January so I am getting nailed with them because it is the beginning of the year. 20 The worst things is when red tape gets in the way of delivering care. 7, 9, 12, 16 Then I have to call my patients and be like, Sorry, there is going to be a three day delay until you can get your medicine. 7, 10, 19 They start crying and yelling. 9, 11 They are angry, scared, tearful, and they’ll relapse. 5, 7, 11, 12, 18 I’ll call them and say there is nothing you can do because your insurance requires this paperwork and they’ll blame me, the pharmacy; they’ll cry, they’ll beg, and I’ll say there is literally nothing I can do. 7, 17 It is all work put on me. 10 AS: It is red tape but also denying access to care. 6, 7, 12 There has been lawsuits settled in other states about prior authorizations for Suboxone. 9, 17, 19 The attorney general has put on notice the insurance companies in the state that she will be prosecuting. 7, 9, 10 A similar thing for prior authorizations on Suboxone. 19 She just put out a memo encouraging this to be a legislative priority. 9, 10, 12, 19 She is hoping that she won’t need to prosecute them because it will be legislative in this session. 13 There’s hope, but it is absolutely the worst thing when an administrative detail prevents the care of a patient and then I feel their pain when I tell them it is going to be days before they get their medicine. 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 AS: Is the prior authorization because it is Suboxone or just red tape from the insurance company? 7, 9, 12, 19 It’s not DEA restrictions or anything? 9, 19 Insurance companies made a practical, financial decision that they used prior authorizations for anything that is costly or potentially abusable or when they think physicians aren’t educated about appropriate use for a medicine. 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 When you talk to the people doing the prior authorizations, like me, they catch a lot of doctors prescribing the wrong thing. 10, 17, 19 There is a benefit to it, but it hurts the well meaning. 14, 16 AS: Thank you very much. 18 I’m so appreciative.  CR: Thank you.  It was fun "
"21","Hooker_Julie","Shelley Roberts Gyllen Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer August 17, 2017 Ely, Minnesota Shelley Roberts Gyllen -SRG Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan I'm here with Shelley and I'm going to let Shelley say her name because it's about to change. 6, 9, 16, 19 It's August 17th. 9 We're at a cabin in Ely, Minnesota and the other noise you might hear in the background is a little puppy named Logan. 5, 6, 8, 19 Shelley do you give me permission to record this? 6 SRG:  I, Shelley Roberts Johnson, soon to be Shelley Roberts Gyllen.  AS: So why don't you start by talking about your childhood, some of the first memories of your life. 9, 10, 11 SRG:  A lot of them are actually up here in Ely. 10, 17 We came here all the time as kids. 19 Labor Day, Memorial Day, a week in the summer, and then eventually two weeks in the summer, and then eventually my parents bought this place and it's great. 7, 10, 11, 15, 16 We had so much fun. 18 I think part of it was just who our parents are and part of it is the childcare that we were at, which is on a hobby farm. 7, 9, 10, 12, 16 We both just developed a love for being outside and boredom certainly entered into our lives, but the answers to it were things like go outside and build a fort or wander around a wetland and play an imagination game as opposed to watch a bunch of TV, which we did, too. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 We were not no-screen kids, but we definitely had that outdoor adventure aspect.  And just so we're clear, you're younger than Spencer? 5, 9, 12, 14 SRG:  Yes, two and a half-ish years younger. 5, 14, 20 AS: So, your whole life is a memory with a big brother. 5, 8, 11 SRG:  Yes, I have flashes of memory from one time when I was in the hospital because we were at a family picnic at the daycare that we went to and there were sheets hanging up. 7, 18, 19 The older kids were all playing baseball and this sheet was their home base backdrop to catch pitches. 5, 8, 10, 14, 19, 20 I was running with my friends behind it and someone swung a bat and I got clocked in the head from the other side of a sheet, hard. 7, 11, 12, 18 This kid was swinging a baseball bat to hit a ball. 8 I have a memory of my dad and my brother visiting me. 5, 12, 13 SRG:  Maybe even younger. 5, 14, 15 I don't know how old I was when that happened. 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 I definitely remember Dad and Spence visiting in the hospital. 12, 13 I think they gave Spence a little hospital gown to visit me in. 12, 13 Who knows if that's a real memory, but it's there. 13, 14, 15 I remember a lot of Sunday nights we would get our laundry out and we would have to fold our laundry and then after folding our laundry we would put it up on the ottoman and get to build forts in our laundry baskets to watch Sunday night TV which was like Life Goes On and The Simpsons and there might have been one more. 10, 14, 17, 19, 20 Sunday night family time, it was great. 11, 18, 19 That was definitely a tradition.  Wintertime, the house was built on a hill and so in front we had a more gentle sloping hill, which was great when Dad would go and scoop it out and make this really cool run for tubing. 6, 9, 11, 16, 17 The tube would sail up the sides and we had a back more steep hill and then the wetland off of that. 8, 9, 19 We would play for hours in the winter outside. 11 My dad would do his [whistles] whistle and it would carry across the wetland and it'd be like, ""I guess we've got to go in."" 7, 8, 9, 10 In the den we had this old, old heater. 20 You'd go and you'd turn it up so that it clicked on and you'd go put your feet on it until your feet burned to try to warm up. 10, 16, 19 AS: Did your property back up to a wetland? 8, 19 SRG:  Our property backed up to a wetland. 8, 19 You can see it from 494, when you're driving north it's on your right side right before you get to 394. 14 We called it “The Island,” like a hump of land in the middle with a bunch of trees on it. 7, 8, 9 We would always just hike out to The Island, more so in the winter than in the spring or summer because it was often so deep. 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 I vaguely remember being able to canoe out there one time but I was really young, I can barely remember that. 5, 14 AS: So tell me about school and your big brother. 5, 8 SRG:  When I was younger I don't remember being like, ""I have a big brother who's in this grade,"" which I'm sure I did. 5, 8, 10, 14, 15, 20 School was just like ""Ahhhhh, this is great. 9, 10, 11, 12 I can just go sit in a corner and read books and have friends."" 9, 12, 13, 18 AS: So you liked school? 8, 10, 18 SRG:  Yeah, I liked school a whole lot. 8, 10, 17, 18 I still like school. 8, 9, 10 If I could be paid to go to school instead of paying to go to school my life would be perfect. 8, 9, 11, 16 I'm a lifelong learner for sure. 11, 12, 15 I almost went on a tangent about learning. 9, 12 I remember maybe like second grade I have strong memories of playing with friends. 9, 12, 18, 20 He, obviously being older, had already established some friendships. 5, 9, 12, 18, 20 I was actually talking about this last weekend at my bridal shower with one of the other moms. 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 We were trying to remember how all of the friendships got forged. 12, 16, 18 She remembers her son who was Spencer's age, also a redhead, came home from school and was like, ""Mom, there's another redhead."" 8, 10, 12, 19 They started playing together. 9, 11 She also has a daughter who's my age and so then we played together and I think were in each other’s classes, too. 5, 8, 20 Within biking distance there were two other families in the district with sons Spencer's age and daughters my age and then another family with a daughter Spencer's age, but they didn't really play, and a daughter my age. 5, 9, 18 There was a neighborhood full of kids all going to the same school. 8, 11 It was fun because then all of the sudden we'd have four families over at the house and have these romping playdates is the word they use now. 6, 9, 13, 14 We'd just go and be in the wetland. 8, 9, 12 We'd have all these adventure games. 10 In the fall we'd have the tractor out. 10 At one point we had a moped and some go-carts. 7 My cousins that were the same age as us would come over and play too. 5, 13, 19 The same thing: we'd always be running around. 7, 8, 11, 16, 17 Of course the older kids would annoy the crap out of the younger kids and vice versa. 5, 14, 20 I'm sure there was lots of, ""It's not fair,"" going on. 5, 15, 17 Just a ton of getting to learn about negotiating as a human being through play, which was really cool. 9, 12, 17 Getting to romp around in the woods and be like, ""Do you think it's a good idea that we're this close to a buck fight?"" 8, 10, 11 Just stuff like that. 9 I think I was in fourth grade and he was in sixth grade, it was the last year we were in elementary together. 9, 20 It was the first year we were home alone after school for a few hours until my parents got home. 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 19, 20 At least I think it was the first year. 9, 20 Spence and I, he had been working on a fort with his friends out in the woods. 12, 18 We were playing in the fort and we heard a buck fight going on. 15 It was so cool. 17 At a certain point Spencer was like, ""Alright, you have to go inside."" 10, 14 Not inside the house because that was too far and you had to go past the buck fight. 6, 9 He was very much like, ""Okay, this is starting to get dangerous."" 9, 10, 11, 18 Didn't come inside the fort himself. 13, 19 The fort had a fully enclosed area and then a top. 10, 11 I did, and then I'm sitting there and I'm like, ""Wait a minute, why does he get to watch?"" 10, 13 Also, I would much rather be able to see it coming if I need to run instead of get trampled. 9, 11, 13, 18 Very cool, but definitely he was a risk-taker. 6, 17 Playing certainly involved a lot of risk and then later on being like, ""Hm, maybe we should do this thing that will keep us safe."" 9, 10, 12, 17 AS: Were you a risk-taker at all? 6 SRG:  I was less inclined to it. 6 I was a ""good kid"" to use really big quotes there, but not also a good kid. 8, 9 I knew how the system of rules worked and especially by the time I was in high school and got over my fear of getting in trouble. 6, 8, 9, 12, 20 I knew how to work the system. 6, 8, 9, 12 Definitely knew how to get around it. 6, 12 I learned how to take risks because of Spencer. 6, 12, 17 Up here there's a part of the lake that has this sheer rock cliff and it's perfect for climbing because there's lots of different handhold levels. 5, 16, 17, 20 It was like a Memorial Day or Labor Day weekend. 12, 19 He had a friend come up, but I didn't. 12, 13, 19 I played with them a lot. 8, 17 They decided they were going to go climbing this thing. 12 I was like, ""Okay, I can go, too."" 10 I followed along. 12 Then at a certain point we're out in the middle of this. 8 I'm terrible with judging distance with my eyes but it's like from here to the cars in terms of height. 7, 9, 14, 15, 16 It's not an insignificant height.  A couple hundred feet, and it's very wide and we're in the middle of it. 8, 12, 14 I remember hearing my mom or my dad on the dock being like, ""Ah!"" 10, 15 I all of a sudden realize and Spence and his friend were just like, ""Follow us, try not to look down. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 If you do look down just accept that that's your fate."" 9, 12 AS: Did you jump into the water? 6 Was it over the water? 6 SRG:  No, it was over the water but there was no safe way to jump. 6, 16 It was enough of a slant in that there were a ton of rocks below us. 20 It was one of the rare parts of the lake that didn't slant in super quickly. 9, 12 There was rubble and rock at the bottom.  It was a terrifying moment that was also a really good growth moment. 13, 15, 17 It was like, ""Oh, hey, you just confront the next thing ahead and you find the next handhold and the next foothold. 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 That has been an allegory in terms of the whole experience with Spencer's addiction and death.  You find the next handhold and if you look down you just think, ""This is my fate now. 9, 12, 14, 20 You hope you reach the top. 10, 13 We did that obviously.  None of us fell to a rocky death. 15 AS: With your parents watching. 10, 16 SRG:  Encouraging, but also like probably half mad.  Follow us and endanger themselves? 12 I think I remember one of them drove over in the boat and was trying to coach from below. 7, 14, 16 They can't see all the nuances of the little holes and handholds. 20 It was literally following Spence and his friend up the side of this cliff and hoping to God that it wasn't some sort of ""I'm going to get you now, little sister."" 5, 9, 12, 14, 17 He never had it out for me. 15 Not at least more than regular sibling rivalry would state. 9 AS: I keep hearing the story that he was very, very shy and you were very, very social. 9, 12 SRG:  Yeah, that is true.  AS: Is there a point where you kind of remember that or where that stands out to you? 9, 12, 16, 17 SRG:  No, because it's just how I've always been. 9, 12, 16, 17 I think more poignant is as the last year and a half has gone by and I've figured this thing called grieving your sibling out I have become less social, and that's different. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 I am far much more in need of my me time. 13, 18 It's one of those weird skills that you can't learn until something super shitty happens that is ultimately I think a self-care skill. 7, 12 I got a lot better at being like, ""Oh, I need to do this for me."" 10, 13, 17 For at least a week there was a whole like, ""I can't do anything else but be selfish."" 9, 10 Then a few months after that figuring out how to function in the world again. 8, 15 A few weeks after Spencer died Prince died.  Everyone cared so much and I'm like, ""How do you care so much?"" 7, 10, 11, 12, 18 Removed from the immediacy of Spencer's death I get it, I do, because people become really important culturally. 8, 13, 19 At the time it was so hard. 11 The end of the year posts because a lot of famous people died in 2016 and a lot of stupid crap happened. 9, 12, 13, 17, 20 People were just like, ""Fuck off 2016."" 9, 10, 12 I was like, ""No this is the last year my brother was alive. 5, 9, 10, 20 How could you possibly?""  Then I'm like, “Oh yeah, people are entitled to their life experiences.” 10, 11 Figuring out how to claim that space and exist in the world. 9, 15 I've always been a super empathetic person, too, which I think goes along with the outgoing in a sense that I just get people. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 I can have empathy with the manipulative behavior of addiction. 14 AS: Did you get your brother, or did it go in and out? 5 SRG: Yeah.  I mean especially when we were kids I got him. 16, 20 I think when you have siblings that's where you do the most of your social negotiation and figuring out how to function in the world. 5, 15 It's this whole different relationship than you have with any other human being. 16, 17 You can't treat everybody the way you treat your siblings because you don't know the backstory. 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Then in terms of one of the hardest things about his addiction—and when he was around, and when we were together and confronting that—was that he would say things and I knew he was manipulating me. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16 He's my brother; he's always known what to say to get under my skin. 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I don't think it was until my late twenties that I finally stopped just letting it roll off my back and being like, ""No, I disagree with you. 9, 10, 12, 19, 20 You're being a jerk.""  These things that at the same time that I need to stand up for myself I'm like, “What if I say something that makes him go use again?” 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 AS: That sense that you have some control, that your behavior can somehow impact what he does or doesn't do. 10, 17 SRG:  Wouldn't that be an interesting character trait, if we could control other people? 9, 10, 17, 19 You can with manipulation.  There are these things, but that's another soapbox for another day. 16, 19 AS: Do you feel like talking about your own struggle? 9, 10, 16 Some of your own mental health struggles? 9, 14 SRG:  Yeah, I can talk about that. 10 AS: That came up in your parents’ conversations, just trying to deal with that. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 19 What was that like for you and how did that play out?  SRG:  I think it was ninth grade. 20 AS: We're talking about what year? 10, 20 What year were you born? 20 SRG:  I was born in 1984.  I'm thirty-three now in 2017. 14 Ninth grade would have been 1997-98 school year. 8, 20 I don't remember if it was the summer before ninth grade or the summer before tenth grade. 15, 20 I just got real lethargic and didn't care about a lot all of a sudden. 7, 9, 12, 13, 17, 19 That was weird.  I'm a happy-go-lucky, horns-of-the-bull, grab life sort of person. 11, 17 It was just all of a sudden like not having any energy. 9, 12, 13 This bizarre irrational sense that I would die in my sleep and then I had a really hard time falling asleep. 7, 11, 17 Then would have a really hard time staying awake because I was exhausted but also terrified of sleeping. 7, 9, 11, 19 Looking at it now and knowing as much now, it was some really hardcore anxiety and puberty stuff. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18 At the time, I agree with the doctor's prognosis that it was a lot of depression. 17 I was put on antidepressants and did a lot of counseling with a wonderful woman in Plymouth. 10, 17 It was so weird to just go and talk to someone. 9, 10, 12 ""Did you feel sad this week?"" 12, 16 Yeah because I have to go and do homework and I want to go play and this boy and that person. 13, 19 I'm a teenager—of course I'm sad! 12 Then at the same time because I'm a teenager not realizing the impact on my personality that medications are having, just figuring out the nuances of side effects. 9, 10, 12, 16 Now knowing what we know now about how brains develop my brain is still developing. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 My personal experience was a very bad one with antidepressants. 16 Ultimately, I became a part of the statistic that antidepressants make young people even more depressed and suicidal. 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 In high school we got a really good handle on it. 8 I was just on a maintenance level and then I went to school. 8, 9, 12, 15, 20 AS: To college? 8 SRG:  To college. 8 I went to DePauw University and had chosen it because they had an education program. 10, 13 It was far away, but not too far away. 16 A big factor was I got a really big financial aid package, too. 8, 10 I got there and they were like, ""We're disbanding our education program. 10, 15 Get a degree in whatever you want and then do a fifth year program."" 13, 20 I was like, ""Okay, because I just worked my ass off to get here."" 9, 10, 12 It didn't even occur to me that I could be like, ""Well this isn't for me then. 10, 15 Thank you.  Goodbye.""  That's another soapbox for another day. 19 I struggled. 9 It was hard. 11 I thought about coming home. 11, 12, 19 I'm also very stubborn. 9 I built these friends. 12, 18 I'm sure I saw moving schools as a failure. 8, 15 I made it through my freshman year and had signed up for an anthropology class and loved it. 13, 16, 20 I declared in my first week that I would take anthropology partially because I loved the class and partially because my first year advisor for whatever my first year seminar was not a good fit, we'll put it that way. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I just didn't want to have to go talk to her about my life and everything. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Sophomore year I moved into the sorority house that I rushed. 6, 8, 9, 20 I had decided not to rush, but they offered me a snap bid, or something, which is just enough of them knew me and thought I was great and a good fit. 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 20 Without reconsidering, you decided not to do this for a reason, I just was like, “Oh yay I feel included. 9, 10, 12, 16 This is great!"" 11 I joined the sorority.  It was fun and sisterhood and all of those things that is again another story. 5, 9, 16 I moved into the sorority house sophomore year. 6, 8, 9, 20 One night just was at my desk and took a bottle of Excedrin. 9, 12, 14, 17, 19 A whole bottle, which will kill you as it turns out. 7, 17, 19 I was up the whole night, the overwhelming constant fear that I was going to die in my sleep, which was irrational. 7, 9, 19 AS: You still had that? 9 SRG:  It came back. 19 It came back out of nowhere. 14, 19 I've gone back and read what I was journaling that day. 19 Nothing about it is depressed sounding. 10, 12 It's a journal, so why would I mince words or anything?  I'm also a pretty open book much to my mother's chagrin for a while. 17, 18 On paper I attempted suicide but I still don't consider it that. 9 AS: Do you think it was the antidepressants?  SRG:  I do, one hundred percent.  AS: Now they know that. 13, 14, 15 SRG:  Even a year later these ads were coming out. 20 I'm like what the fuck? 10 Then I got diagnosed with bipolar.  They're like, ""Clearly blah blah blah."" 10 That's what they knew at the time. 6, 12 I can be angry about it, but it's also the truth of what they knew at the time. 6, 12 Again I can look down and see all of those rocks below me and I got to the top of that cliff eventually and I'm happy for it. 15, 17 I was on all sorts of stuff. 9, 17 AS: That was a misdiagnosis?  SRG:  Yes, that was a misdiagnosis.  I was on an anti-psychotic.  I don't remember very clearly like two years of my life. 11, 20 AS: In college? 8 SRG: Yeah.  I remember some big events but I don't have, I can't pull out. 8, 15 I went back later on when I was doing my education coursework—went back to find a paper I had written on something. 10, 15, 19 I was like, ""Oh, I have that book."" 10 I have no memory of writing this paper or reading the book. 11 I have shelves and shelves of books and plays that have my notes in them and I have no memory of reading them. 11 It's a little terrifying.  It was hard. 11 I know it was hard for Spencer. 11, 13, 14, 15 He definitely, again, would when he needed things or wanted things and was trying to manipulate me would use that as ammunition, which was really hard, too. 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 AS: He would use what? 9 SRG:  Use the attention I took away from him from my parents, with my parents supporting me so much as ammunition. 10, 15, 16, 18 He would say some terrible shit when he wanted to wound me. 12, 13, 15 He could be a really big asshole, a really big asshole. 8 AS: Let's pause this for a second. 9, 20 [Break in Recording]  AS: At what point did his addiction, at what point was that clear to you?  Did you know about what was going on with him? 13, 14, 15 SRG:  I remember in junior high him getting kicked out or suspended because he had brought booze to school and someone asking me out on a date because of it. 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 The unfortunate part is that I super liked this guy and so I totally went out and dated him the way you do in seventh grade for two weeks. 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 AS: Because your brother was cool? 5, 17 SRG:  Yeah, and so therefore I was probably really cool. 17 Fun fact: I was a really big nerd. 8, 10 Then also in high school I got into the things that high schoolers got into. 8, 16 I didn't really drink in high school. 6, 8, 14 I wasn't really a partier.  I did get high starting in I don't know what grade. 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 Then my sophomore year that was kind of my year of exploration. 8, 16, 17, 20 That was my first time that I went to a party and lied to my parents that her parents were home. 6, 9, 10, 16, 19 I got drunk and I got high. 8, 11, 14, 15 That spring also my best friend's little sister died from leukemia and I didn't know how to handle that. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 One of my friends at the time over spring break we just went with her boyfriend and some people that he knew and got in their car and went to St. Cloud and did some drugs that I didn't know what they were with some people. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 She went home in the middle of the night and left me there. 8, 19 She had a ride home with someone. 6, 19 I don't know why we thought any of this was a good idea. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I don't really remember much about Spencer's response other than I was sleeping everything off and he came in and was like, ""That was really stupid. 7, 9, 10, 18, 19 You could have died,"" which in retrospect is what it is.  We didn't really talk about it beyond that. 10 We would smoke pot together.  In college years we would take mushrooms together and would do cocaine together. 6, 7, 8, 20 One day I was like, ""Well this is all very stupid and a waste of my money and I will get into trouble."" 9, 10, 19 I just walked away. 9, 12, 16, 17 I think I called my parents and was like, ""Hey, I have to tell you something."" 7, 10, 16 It was more of a way to keep myself accountable because I get to that point where I'm just an open book. 9, 12, 16, 17 I'm like, ""Hey, I've been doing this really stupid thing. 9, 10 I'm going to change that."" 16 AS: Did you tell them Spencer was doing all that?  SRG:  I don't think so.  I don't know. 13, 14, 15 I don't remember.  This was also during college when I don't remember a large portion of things. 8, 16 I don't think I started doing coke until after I was off the anti-psychotics. 9, 11 I was also super terrified about drug interactions. 10, 12, 14 It was more the last three semesters that I was at school. 8, 9 Then again it was like, ""Well, I'm done with this."" 10 When we were in town we'd party. 6, 19 Spencer would become mad that I was becoming too close to his friends. 12, 13, 18, 19 He'd yell at me for flirting with his friends. 12, 18 I was like, ""Then why are you inviting me to hang out with your friends that you think are cool if you don't want me to become friends with them? 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 Your friends are cool."" 12, 17, 18 I have a different opinion about that now. 14, 16, 17 I think a lot of them are actually all pretty cool people. 10, 17, 18 There was that time—I think for me I was able to walk away from it, so I wasn't really worried that he couldn't either. 16 He just needed to get to the point where he made that choice to walk away, too. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 ""He just hasn't gotten here yet,"" which is a different thing. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17 When he and Jamie were dating and living at the old house they were talking about getting married and stuff. 6, 9, 10, 20 Are you going to continue doing drugs and all these things? 14, 16 Jamie was like very much I don't want this lifestyle anymore. 9, 11, 13, 18 Spencer was saying that he didn't and then they got pregnant and at one point during Jamie's pregnancy Spencer was growing in a closet. 11, 17 He was growing pot. 17 I was like, ""This is the opposite of giving this up,"" but also like very much deferring to Jamie. 10, 11, 13, 18 “I want to maybe tell my parents because I bet they don't want this at their house, on their property that they own. 6, 9, 10, 13, 16 You're going to have a kid.”  It's hard because pot for a lot of people is not problematic. 11, 17 It's less problematic than alcohol.  That's just a thing that exists in the world that is a discussion I constantly have with myself and it changes every day whether I think it's a problem or not. 9, 12, 15, 16, 19 I don't know the answer still and that's okay. 9, 13, 14, 15 It's tricky because I've seen it hurt a ton of people.  There's also the influence of the DARE program and the whole marijuana is a gateway drug, which I don't really think is true. 14, 16, 20 I also don't know because that's not my field of study. 9, 13, 14, 15 From my personal experience I don't see that as a truth. 16 Anyways, that's that. 16, 17 I think for people who were kind of hardwired for addiction it can definitely be a gateway drug, but not for everyone who uses it. 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 SRG:  That's the true thing about alcohol, too.  If you're wired for addiction then it doesn't matter if it's beer or scotch or wine. 12, 20 I definitely, as the years have progressed, have been like ""Am I drinking too much?"" 6, 14, 18, 20 Then I'll just quit drinking for two months just to see if I can. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14 I just don't have that and it's kind of hard to reconcile. 9, 11, 12, 16, 17 AS: It kind of haunts you? 16, 17 SRG:  Yeah, it's like, “What's up with my brain that I can just walk away?” 9, 10, 12, 16 I was just, ""Alright, I'm done,"" and then walked away. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17 The day after Spence died when we went to the sober house and hearing people talk about how that addiction is always there even when you're sober. 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19 I smoked cigarettes a lot. 17 That's the closest I have. 9 It took me a really long time.  We'll see if it sticks this time. 9 I really like smoking. 10 There's a lot of things I really like about smoking despite knowing that it's horrible for me and could kill me. 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 That's the closest I could relate to and it just felt so ingenuine to be like, ""I get what you guys are going through."" 9, 10, 12, 17 I walked away with no problem. 16, 17 Then part of it was feeling that guilt. 16 Was us doing some drugs together contributing to that? 14 Maybe and probably.  Did it contribute in such a way that it caused Spencer to die? 9, 16 No, there were a hundred factors and the main one of them being that he was severely addicted. 10 AS: And to opioids. 10 SRG:  And to opioids, which I never got. 10, 15 I remember getting injured at work one time. 12 He was like, ""When you go to the doctor tell him you can't sleep because it hurts so much and they'll give you blah blah blah."" 6, 7, 10, 18 I remember being at my grandma's, I think we were down there for her ninetieth birthday. 7, 19 He told me he'd found my grandpa's, and my grandpa had died in like 2005 and this was 2009, these pills were dated before he died. 7, 20 Spence found these pills and he just took them. 9, 12 I didn't think anything of it.  AS: He just ingested them or he took the bottle? 9, 12, 17 SRG:  I think he put them in a different bottle. 10, 16, 17 He left the pill bottle but left it empty. 17 I'm sure my ninety year old grandma didn't notice. 7, 15, 20 I don't remember if I ever told my parents about that. 10, 16, 20 It was that whole “the sibling code of secrecy” sort of thing, which was also hard. 11, 17 If I tell Mom and Dad that he did all of this cocaine then I also have to tell them that I did.  It was a silly fear because I told them. 20 I got so wrapped up in what Spence was going through.  He was super manipulative and knew how to say just the right thing to get under your skin. 6, 9, 12, 14 He would be vicious, which is just hard to say about a person that you love that is now dead. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 There were some crappy things about him. 16 There're crappy things about me. 16 AS: Addiction can also bring out things in people that you wouldn't really consider it an inherent part of their personality. 16 SRG:  It magnifies all the worst things. 9, 16 AS: I understand what you mean. 9, 12, 16 I know that you love him. 13, 14, 15 SRG:  I totally do. 17 AS: It does bring out the worst in people. 9 When did you learn that he had a problem with pills? 12 Was it not until he came back from Montana? 19 SRG:  I knew that he kept doing them. 6, 12 Aidan was born in September.  In the months between then—and it was Oscar night I remember, late January, early February. 7, 8, 19 There were three different occasions when Jamie called me in tears like, ""We have to have an intervention."" 7, 10, 16, 17 I was like, ""Alright, I will support you. 10, 14 We'll go over to Mom and Dad's right away in the morning."" 14, 16 Then she'd call me in the next morning and be like, ""No, things are okay."" 7, 10, 16 Finally the third time this happened and I'd been talking to a really good friend of mine. 10, 12, 13, 20 I was at his house for an Oscar party and the phone rang. 6, 7, 9 He saw that it was Jamie and he's like, ""You go. 10 Do your thing.""  It was an Oscar party so we had dressed up. 6, 7, 14 I'm standing outside on the sidewalk on Colfax in Uptown in heels and a dress and my coat probably smoking a cigarette sobbing with Jamie. 9, 12, 14, 19 Just being like, ""We're going to do this in the morning."" 9, 10 Hanging up and calling my parents. 7, 10, 16 She's not going to turn this around on me again. 8, 19 I don't know that I have the strength to stand up to her. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 So much of it was like, “It's your family and I don't want to tell you.” 10, 13, 18 That's a deficit in my personality is that I have a hard time saying, ""No, this is actually really problematic."" 10, 11, 16 For as much as I'm a teacher, I don't want to be overbearing. 13, 18 AS: That put you in such a difficult situation. 10, 13, 20 SRG:  I want the best for him. 9, 13 It was a really tricky situation. 13 I called them and was just like, ""Jamie and I are coming over in the morning because we've got to talk about Spencer."" 7, 9, 10, 12 Usually when they tell this story they don't remember that part of it. 9 They always just talk about how it was Jamie. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 I'm like, ""The fuck?"" 10 That's a small thing to be upset about so I let it go. 17, 19 I called them so many times in the middle of the night when I was dealing with my anxiety and depression and misdiagnosis. 7, 8, 13, 18, 19 That was a really solid, easy thing to remember.  I'm sure I questioned it before then though. 6, 9, 11, 15 SRG:  Yeah, or 2010 because it was January I think or February.  He went into his program.  When someone goes into a program there's a certain amount of admission both on their part and also on your part as a family. 18 Alright this is a problem and we're going to confront this. 14 Then it became really hard because you go through all of that initial, “Why didn't I do anything sooner?” 5, 11, 19 I'm so mad we even have to do this. 15 He would just always be like, ""I just don't believe it. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 I don't understand why I'm here for pot. 9, 12, 16 There are people who are here for blah blah blah.""  Lo and behold we learn all of this later. 12, 20 I don't have a strong memory of him using meds. 9 I remember there were a couple times where he would be like, ""Oh you have this thing. 10, 18 You should tell them you can't sleep because of it and they'll give you this."" 6, 7 I remember him getting appendicitis. 12 He would come to every one of my plays. 13, 19 He was my biggest supporter. 8, 9, 11 I have parents who are super supportive. 10, 12, 16 Even the silly stuff, the stuff my parents couldn't get to he would try his best to show up to see shows. 9, 10, 16 I remember him being at a show that I directed and just being out of it and in pain. 9, 12 He had just gotten his appendix out and they were going to move to Montana soon. 9, 12, 15 Then that the following year when they had lived in Montana for six months I was doing the Reading Corps, it was Minnesota Reading Corps. 8, 12, 20 It's not Teach for America it's the literacy version of that's under AmeriCorps.  For spring break I took the train out. 18 I could kind of tell some stuff was going on just because of the way my parents couldn't give me a real reason they thought visiting Montana was maybe not the best idea. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 AS: So they kind of tried to hide this from you? 10, 16, 17 SRG:  They definitely did.  They definitely were trying to hide it for sure. 15, 16 I went out and things were just tense. 9, 12, 15, 16 Aidan's a year and a half at this time. 20 Things were tense. 15 They weren't outright fighting, Spencer and Jamie. 14 They'd squabble and skirmish more than normal.  Spence was, he just seemed constantly high. 8, 9, 12, 19 I don't remember that he was necessarily smoking pot.  It was just kind of like, it wasn't awful to be around him, but I didn't really want to hang out. 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 This isn't cool. 17 I just played with Aidan a whole lot. 8, 9, 12, 17 He went into the hospital with pain.  Jamie and I went out with Aidan one day. 19 It was becoming apparent that something was going on. 10, 16 I ultimately at the end of that trip when I was getting on the train, Aidan came home with me. 12, 19 My parents bought Aidan a ticket. 7, 10, 13, 16 Aidan and I took the train back and he stayed here for I don't know how long while that situation was getting figured out. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 That was the first of the, ""Okay, there's something going on."" 9 My parents still weren't really telling me anything and Spencer was still like the pain narrative with me. 9, 10, 15, 16 Jamie was just like unless I was there in person we didn't really talk a whole lot about it unless it was stuff about Aidan. 9, 10, 12, 17 That was kind of like the beginning of the unveiling. 16, 17 I remember many conversations with my mom and dad being like, ""Why aren't you telling me these things?"" 10, 12, 15, 16 ""Well, we don't want you to be burdened."" 13 ""That's very sweet of you, but you're actually burdening me more by keeping me out. 10, 11, 12 Now I feel stupid. 9, 16 I feel uninformed. 16, 17 There are other people in the family who are asking me how Spence is and I don't know why the hell they're asking me. 13, 14, 15, 18 Everyone else knows because you talk to your brothers and sisters who talk to their kids about this."" 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 There was a lot of anger around that. 17 You work through it.  AS: Do you think part of them wanting to protect you had to do with their experience with your mental health issues? 13, 14, 15 That they felt that would somehow tip you over the edge or something? 17 SRG:  Yeah, like it would trigger it or something.  I think that's why I was most angry about it.  Why don't you trust me to tell you I don't want to know this if I don’t? 9, 13, 14, 15 I definitely do and there was a lot of anger around not feeling like I was trustworthy. 8, 9, 16, 17 AS: By this point you're in your...?  SRG:  I'm in my twenties, mid to late twenties.  There was a lot of discussion with my mom because she is the opposite of me, or was at that time in terms of being an open book. 13, 15, 17 She was like, ""Don't tell people you're depressed. 10, 12 You don't have to share everything with everyone.""  I share certain things that I've given thought to. 6, 11, 12, 16 Less thought then than I do now. 11, 12, 14 It's interesting to see how she is now where she's like, ""We have to talk about these things, that's how stigma happens."" 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19 Fighting against that “don't tell anyone” narrative. 15 What's the point?  Then you're just sitting there suffering in silence. 9, 12, 13 Then there was a lot of anger around that as well. 17 Her worry that I would just turn around and post it on Facebook, which if you don't want me to and then say, ""Hey don't."" 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 Will I always listen? 9, 15, 16, 17 Not one hundred percent of the time, but I'll frame it in a certain way. 16 AS: At that point she was very afraid of people finding out.  SRG: Yeah, and the stigma around it. 9 I get it.  It's hard when one of your kids is struggling with something and your other friends have kids who are seemingly perfect. 9, 11, 12, 18, 19 That's just because nobody talks. 9, 10, 12, 14 If we change the narrative and we start talking to each other then we understand that we're all struggling and it's great. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16 Then we can all celebrate when things are great and we can help each other when things suck. 11, 13, 16 It's been a rough period. 18 We've gotten to a really nice place with it. 11, 15 There was a lot of having to ask always. 16, 17 AS: Can I talk about this? 10 SRG:  Or even asking, ""Hey, is something going on?"" 13, 15 Like asking ""What's this?"" 13 Then feeling horrible because I'm the last one to know. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Then feeling like I can't get mad and confront them about it because they're dealing with a kid who's addicted to heroin. 13, 16 AS: So you kind of fall in the shadows a bit even under the guise of them wanting to protect you from the hardest parts of it. 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17 SRG:  Then at the same time being the person who just gets and has that empathy. 9, 12, 14 I get why they made that choice. 16, 17 I get it.  While I'm mad about it I also get it.  AS: You feel like you could have been more of a support to them? 16 SRG:  Yeah, and also if maybe you don't want to deal with it ask me and I will cancel my vacation and stay home and hold down the fort. 9, 10, 13, 19, 20 Give me the tools so it's not only ruining my life. 11 It can ruin all of our lives together, which feels terrible to laugh about, but it's easier to go through a shitty time when you have other people to go through a shitty time with you. 15, 16 AS: They did talk about a time when they went to go bring Aidan back and Spencer was here at home or he was in treatment and you were alone at their house and he called. 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 SRG:  He called and wanted to come in. 7, 12, 13, 19 They had very strict rules about it. 9, 12 I was like, ""I'll put this sleeping bag on the porch for you."" 7, 10 He was playing us against each other.  Then I found out later in the morning that he had dug up something in the backyard. 19 I don't know if it was stuff he had stashed there to pawn later. 9, 13, 14, 15 I don't know if it was a key to the house so he could get in to grab stuff. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 He'd stashed something but he dug it up from the yard in the middle of the night. 8, 9, 19 That was crappy.  Then there was the time when they had come up to close the cabin, this was the fall before Spence died, and I had just moved in out of a really shitty living situation. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 I was student teaching. 9 It was the Renaissance Festival and I had just met Jeff who I'm going to marry in sixteen days. 5, 9, 12, 19 Spence was also at home. 19 I heard the TV on when I went to go to the bathroom at like two in the morning. 7, 15 It was Sunday night so I had to go to work in the morning. 19 I'd been at the festival all weekend, which was hot and exhausting. 9, 12, 19 AS: You were working at the festival? 9 SRG: Yeah, I'm a street performer. 9, 17 I walk on stilts and I do puppets. 9 I hear the TV on so I look over the banister and I'm like, ""Hey Spence go to bed."" 9, 10 He got really mad at me for telling me what to do, which should have been the first sign. 9 Then he did eventually like two hours later come upstairs and go to bed. 9, 11, 13, 15, 19 At that time he was just like ""It's really hard to sleep."" 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 All the things he says. 16 We had this really deep conversation, which in hindsight I'm like, ""Oh you were coming down."" 10, 12 He was like going through that cycle of feeling, I think, guilty. 16 He was doing a lot of like, ""I just miss when we were kids. 9, 10, 12, 17 I'm really sorry."" 10 Then he's like, ""I've got to go to the bathroom."" 7, 10 He came back and he was a different person. 16, 17, 19 It was a progression but it just got weirder and weirder and he would fall over. 9, 12 I'd be like, ""Let's go to bed."" 10 He was nodding off.  Hopeful me is like, ""He's fine."" 10, 14 I should have called the police and been like, ""My brother is super high."" 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 Kicked him out two hours later anyways. 11, 16, 17 I went to the bathroom and I found a spoon on the counter and a needle. 7, 13 The side of the tub had been pulled away, which is a place that he stashed things. 9, 11, 16 It was all literally dirty, covered in dirt. 12 He was like, ""This is just really old. 9, 10, 12, 20 I found it because Jamie is making me super mad so I want to send it to her and show her what she makes me feel like doing."" 12, 13, 16 I stupidly, stupidly, stupidly let him dispose of the needle, which I'm sure he didn't do. 9, 13, 15, 19 I don't remember if I told my parents about it. 10, 16, 20 It was the beginning of when everything was going crazy. 16 AS: This was just six months before he died? 8, 9, 12 SRG: Yeah.  They had come up here to close the cabin down for the winter. 13, 19 I think a day or two before he was super sober. 6, 12, 19 Otherwise I don't think my parents would have come up here together to close the cabin. 10, 13, 16, 19 He met Jeff. 5 That's the only time that Jeff got to meet him when he was sober. 6, 13 Then every other time it was shitty.  I promise I have all these really great stories, too. 9, 11, 18 One third this, I don't know. 13, 14, 15 Then everything went back on that rollercoaster of losing hope and finding hope, having hope and everything being in a good spot. 9, 10, 19 I saw him super briefly two or three days before he died. 12, 19 He was at the house. 6, 9 I was coming and he was going or vice versa.  It was just a, ""Hey, how's it going?"" 9, 12 ""Fine.  Good to see you.""  That's the last time I saw him alive or saw him. 9 I'm glad that was a positive interaction. 10, 13, 14 He seemed pretty sober at that point, too. 6, 18, 19 AS: That's what your parents thought. 10, 11, 12, 16 Everybody thought that. 11, 12 SRG:  It seemed like he was doing so good. 19 The thing that sucks about it is it's even more awful heroin. 10, 15 All heroin is awful, but had he maybe not had this exotically strong heroin that he had shot up he wouldn't have died. 7, 9, 10, 15 Is that useful thinking? 9 I don't know. 13, 14, 15 It serves whatever purpose it serves and then you let it go. 19 It was really weird because I was in a yoga class that Sunday. 19, 20 I had a Fitbit, which I was wearing during class. 20 It was linked to my phone and it started buzzing and it was like the last couple minutes of class. 7, 9, 11, 20 It started buzzing and it was my mom calling. 7, 9, 11, 15 It was the first time since Spencer's addiction that I wasn't like, ""Oh no, he overdosed."" 9, 10, 15 I knew. 6, 12 I just knew. 6, 9, 12 I just laid in shavasana and let myself have that. 9, 12, 19 They called back. 7, 19 AS: All these other times your mother had called you, you never thought that? 7, 11, 12, 15, 18 SRG: I had.  All the times she'd call, especially if it was a weirder time of day, I was like, ""Oh is this..."" 7, 10, 18, 19, 20 This time I didn't have that thought, which is how I knew. 6, 11, 12 AS: This is the first time you weren't concerned when she called. 7, 9 How long had you been anticipating Spencer's death?  SRG:  I think for sure at Christmas I was like, ""God, I don't think he can do it."" 9, 10, 15 That Christmas was hard. 9, 11 Here I have my new boyfriend. 6, 12 Welcome to the family. 13, 18, 19 This is just our life. 9, 11, 12 Then before that I remember having a conversation with my dad where he had admitted to me the hard truth of wondering if that was coming soon. 11, 12 Then again the hard truth if it happens: is that the worst thing? 9, 11, 12 It is at the same time that it's not.  It sucks so much but it also sucks so much in both situations. 13, 18 The person he was when he died was an asshole.  He wasn't my brother, but he was also. 5 It sucks so hard. 11 AS: Is it the worst thing? 9 SRG:  It's the worst thing, but it's also a really great thing. 9, 11 There're so many great things about it. 11, 16 He's done with that struggle. 9 We're done with that struggle. 9 It's so selfish, but it's so true.  You feel crappy for saying it, but it's also like my parents got to go on vacation and they didn't have to worry. 10, 11, 16 It was so good.  They went to Ireland and they’ve been to Florida. 8 Now they have to worry about a wedding, but that's a different kind of worry. 11, 16, 17 It sucks and I would change it if given the option, but I also admit that there are things that are better. 6, 16 It is better to not live daily wondering if my mom's calling to tell me my brother died. 5, 7, 15 It is better to not see my brother in that pain and shame and guilt and struggle. 5, 9 It's better that it's over even though at the same time it sucks and I don't want it to be over. 13, 15 There's always that little voice of could I have had him back? 16, 17, 19 Could we have scaled the cliff?  Then feeling really terrible that I couldn't show him the handholds on this particular allegorical cliff. 15, 16, 18, 20 AS: That's a great analogy. 11 SRG:  It's worked out well for this situation. 13 Then going forward and knowing that addiction is a thing that can tear apart families. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 I do what my parents have done? 10, 16 I've always wanted kids and now I've questioned wanting kids. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 I do but it's terrifying and is it worth it?  I think one hundred percent it is.  AS: When you have a kid you give yourself over to the unknown in so many ways. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 That's also how we continue to be a species.  We give ourselves over. 6 SRG:  I think it's really hard to live in that fear of making the wrong choice or having a kid and having them grow up to be an addict. 11, 17 It's not fair to let that change your mind against it. 16, 19 I don't know if it's not fair. 13, 14, 15 I would rather live my life continuing to hope. 10, 11, 13 It was really hard to continue to hope in those last months. 8, 9, 10, 11 One of the times he was sober before he died and I was telling him about the trip we were taking to Costa Rica. 6, 9, 18 He was like, ""You've got to hold a monkey and send me a picture of it."" 10, 12, 20 I didn't get to hold a monkey, but we were at Marcos Antonio Park [Manuel Antonio], that's not quite the name. 6, 20 A big nature park in Costa Rica and one of the beaches has a bunch of little monkeys on it. 8, 9 I held out one of my hands and the monkey came and held my hands. 19 Jeff got it on video and I started crying. 9, 11 This is like three weeks after Spence died.  I didn't get to send him that, but I did get to do it and have that nice memory. 12 That was the birthday trip—the trip on my birthday. 19 A little gecko wandered into our room that was the exact size of the gecko that he had given himself a tattoo of. 6, 7, 10, 12 That felt like a nice little coincidence. 17 I'm not a religious person.  I don't really believe that there is a Spencer out there that is sending me things or anything. 12, 16 I do really appreciate all the little things that exist that remind me of him. 9, 16 Then the hard part is at a certain point I'll run out of the things that I said I'd do. 11, 16 I think there's only one left.  I told him when he was sober for a year 6, 20 I'd take him skydiving. 6 He's now been sober for a year. 6, 14, 20 At some point I'm going to take his ashes with me and go skydiving. 6 I don't think my mom's very excited. 15 I don't know if I've told her. 13, 14, 15, 20 I think I probably won't tell her until after it's done.  The other times I've went she's like, ""I don't want to know. 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 AS: The other times you've gone skydiving? 18 SRG: Yeah.  It's super fun. 12 AS: Thank you.  SRG:  You're welcome. 13, 19 I don't know if any of it's useful. 9, 13, 14, 15 AS: It's all useful. 9 SRG:  It's so hard to sum up a person and talk about it. 10, 11 Thank you for writing this book.

"22","Johnson_Chris","Star Selleck Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 21, 2016 Minneapolis, Minnesota Star Selleck-SS Amy Sullivan-AS SS: I’m Star Selleck.  I give Amy permission to record this. 6 AS: Thank you.  Could you start by talking a little bit about where you grew up and your younger years? 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 20 Your education, career, and up until you became a parent? 5, 7, 10, 11, 16, 19 SS: It is hard to do this fast. 9, 11 AS: You don’t have to do it fast! 9 SS: I’ll try to give you the abbreviated version. 6, 16 My biological parents came over on a boat from Germany. 7, 10, 16, 19 My father was Russian and his family was all killed—the males were all killed in the war. 5, 7, 8, 18 He was released in a camp from Germany. 8 My mother and my brother and sister were there. 5, 9 It was his dream to come to this country. 11, 13, 14, 16, 19 He came to this country and had a hard life. 11, 16, 19 Eventually the fact that he witnessed the murder of his father caught up with him and he ended up being diagnosed with schizophrenia. 5, 10, 12 At that time my mother couldn’t take care of all three of the children so two went to an orphanage and I went to a family at church. 6, 7, 14, 18 That family at the church only ever had me as their child and I was raised at a home where I got to see my natural parents and my brother and sister over the years. 5, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19, 20 Once my father got released from the state hospital. 5, 9 AS: Was that here in Minnesota?  SS: No, that was on the East Coast in the Boston area. 9 I grew up for the most part in Rhode Island where the dad raised me, settled, and had a good job. 5, 8, 17 They lived through the Depression, so they lived life very conservatively. 11 We lived in a nice neighborhood. 8 I grew up with four other girls in the neighborhood and we all hung out and played together all the time. 8 I missed having brothers and sisters. 5, 9 The first few years up until either grade I went to a private Christian school. 8, 9, 14, 20 It was a few towns away. 16, 19 Then in ninth grade I got to transfer to public school. 7, 8, 20 I started first grade at five, so was ready to graduate when I was sixteen. 9, 11, 20 I thought, “Hey, why don’t I go one step further?” 9, 11, 12 I rode my bike to my local college and took the test to go to college. 8, 9 I came home and told my parents I got accepted. 10, 16, 19, 20 I please do second semester in college? 8, 9, 20 My high school had said it was all right. 8, 14 They acquiesced and let me go. 19 I got a 3.2 grade point average. 20 Got my high school diploma and had my first semester of college out of the way. 8, 9, 16 I had a pretty good childhood. 11, 18 We lived near the ocean.  Spent lots of time at the beach. 5, 17 Those girls in the neighborhood, we thought up the most creative games. 8, 10, 11, 12 We had free reign back in those days. 19 Our parents would let us go and as long as we came home either before dark or before dinner we didn’t get in trouble or anything. 10, 16, 19 They didn’t care where we could ride our bikes to or how we got there. 6, 7 It was just don’t go with any strangers and don’t take candy from any strangers. 6, 7, 9, 12 Other than that…we would ride our bikes to the ferry and take it over to Prudence Island and it was a tiny island and bring our lunch and ride home. 6, 8, 19 We would ride to various swimming holes. 6 We would ride our bikes lots of different places. 5, 6, 11, 16, 17 Go eat stuff, and— AS: Until you were how old did you girls hang out together? 8, 9, 20 SS: I was the oldest, so my entire life. 5, 9, 11, 20 Then even when we all left on breaks we would set up the annual Christmas party and draw names and get gifts. 6, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18 I still keep in touch with them. 9, 12, 15 AS: That is so great. 11 SS: We never lost—we don’t talk as often as we used to. 9, 10, 12, 15 I can still contact any of them. 9, 10 I still have a rough idea of what is going on in each and every one of their lives. 9, 11, 18 I had friends at church, too. 12, 18 All in all I had a pretty good childhood. 11, 18 I went to camp at this place called Summit in Colorado. 7, 8, 11 They also had a college. 8 I was going to go back to the little college that I started at, but after going to this camp and meeting all these kids that were going to go to this little, tiny school in Oklahoma, I begged my parents to let me go to school in Oklahoma. 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 19 AS: Where in Oklahoma?  SS: Tulsa.  AS: That’s where I grew up!  SS: I think we might of had this conversation. 12 What college did you go to? 8 SS: Originally  I went to a school that then had a major scandal. 8, 18 I started at American Christian College. 8, 9, 11 Major scandal.  Then I transferred to TU [University of Tulsa] and graduated from TU. 7, 8, 12, 13 AS: We did talk about this! 10 SS: Where did you live in Tulsa?  AS: Not far from TU.  I grew up at 15th and Pioria.  SS: I rented a house through our college on College Ave, which is no longer there I guess. 6, 8, 9, 10, 16 Just down the street from the Arby’s. 9 AS: College  Avenue is still there. 9 SS: Last time Priscilla said… 9 I lived on College Ave.  that ran right into campus. 7, 8, 14 She said that has been eliminated entirely.  AS: Probably.  TU, you probably wouldn’t recognize it today. 19 She said our house is all gone. 6, 9, 19 I haven’t been back there in a long, long time. 19 She went back this year, my roommate. 7, 19, 20 We are still good friends. 9, 12, 18 AS: You have everlasting friends in your life. 9, 11, 12, 18 I remember when—except my husband. 15 He only lasted for five years! 9, 20 He used to tell me when I would cry and we would leave somewhere he would say, “You never lose your friends. 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 They are always still there. 9, 16, 17 You always keep them. 12, 16, 17 You just make new ones. 6, 9, 12, 16 You will just add to the collection you won’t take any away!” 6, 9, 12, 16 I will try and look at it that way. 16 Although I will say he does stay here about a week a month. 8, 9 We still are good friends. 9, 12, 18 He has his own girlfriend but we still get along. 9, 12 AS: What did you major in in college? 8, 18 SS: Nursing.  AS: And that has been your career? 7, 11 SS: Yes.  I did pediatric nursing my whole life. 11 Now, running up and down the hospital floors has gotten harder on me now. 7, 11, 14, 15 Starting my generation with [unclear].  I take care—I am just part of a crew they have for her. 6, 7, 9, 12 I do that still for pay. 9, 16 I was MNA [Minnesota Nurses Association] so now I am semi-retired I guess. 10, 12, 14, 19 I can still do some things. 9, 16 Then I do my advocacy work, which rounds out my life. 8, 11 AS: Did you meet your husband in Tulsa? 13, 15 AS: How did you end up here? 12 SS: I went to church in Tulsa with my two good girl friends. 12, 18 One I lived with and one I had lived with.  The first time we chose to go to adult Sunday school class I met my husband. 5, 8, 9, 15, 19, 20 We got married in Tulsa and had my first child in Tulsa. 9 Built my first house in Tulsa. 6, 9 He decided he wanted a better job in Florida. 12, 13 I had to leave my beautiful house behind and all my friends and everything. 6, 9, 12, 18 It was thirteen years I had lived there. 20 It was heartbreaking for me. 18 I left and went to Florida with him.  AS: Which son was born there?  SS: It was my daughter, Jessica. 5 AS: Sorry.  Your oldest daughter. 5, 9, 20 SS: Then a year and a half later he moved me to North Carolina because the bank he worked for got bought out and we had to move to North Carolina. 7, 8, 20 I had Ian in North Carolina.  The year and a half we lived in North Carolina I had Ian there. 20 Then we moved here. 8 After we had been here a very short time I found out I was pregnant with Nick. 16 Nick, my youngest was born and bred right into this house. 6, 9, 12, 14 He was born at Fairview Southdale, but not very far away. 16 AS: Did you work the whole time during those moves?  SS: I worked what they would call ‘casual’ when we were in Florida and in North Carolina. 7 I would work roughly one or two days a week. 18, 19 AS: That is a term in nursing?  Casual schedule?  SS: Yes.  You have more control over it too. 17 If you don’t want to work one week you don’t necessarily have to. 13 I did keep my hand in it, and worked in all those places. 11, 12, 17 The first summer we moved here—we moved here in May—and I didn’t go to work until August. 8, 9 I started at Children’s in Minneapolis in August ‘91. 9, 11, 14 I had Jessica and Ian—they were four and nine months old when we moved here. 8, 20 Then Nick came. 19 They were, I don’t know, twenty months apart? 8, 13, 14, 15, 20 Not that far apart [laughter]. 20 AS: Can you talk about your mothering style? 9, 10 The way you raised your kids? 5, 16 SS: Well, since there was just me in my family of origin and I grew up in that era of not hovering and this particular neighborhood was not a highly hovering neighborhood—there were a lot of kids that came with the same era of my kids. 8, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 They pretty much…it is kind of an isolated little place. 11, 16, 17, 18 They kind of ran the neighborhood. 7, 8, 16, 17 They were on their bikes all around and there is a little wooded area at the bottom of Oxford, which is a couple of streets over, that they thought was like really far away. 8, 9, 11, 12, 16 There was a pond at the bottom.  People have tried to float things and fallen in. 10, 16 The dogs would escape down there a few times. 10, 12, 18 They would climb trees and do things there. 16 I did, other than the little ones that I was afraid I would lose or whatever, once you could ride a bike, and they were usually with other kids in the neighborhood, they would just—all of a sudden I would have a herd here and then there would be a herd at the other house and be down at the thing. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 Eventually someone would come home crying. 11, 13, 19 “So and so hit me!  Someone left me in a tree!  Jessica did this!”  Sometimes it was just “I fell off this or I fell of that. 5, 9, 12, 15, 18 I wrecked my bike.”  We did have—my youngest Nick was two sitting in a diaper on the front steps cutting up the tissue paper with some safety scissors, which I didn’t care. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: Hospital safety scissors?  SS: Little kids’ scissors!  [laughter]  I had the back door open and had the front door open. 17, 19 I could kind of see him through the front door. 16, 17 I was talking on the phone and turned my back and he was gone. 7, 10, 19 I came down the steps and out to the street because you got a pretty good view. 9, 12, 18, 19 He is gone. 19 There are other kids around, people around, I’m asking, “Did anybody see where Nick went? 8, 13 Did anyone see where Nick went?”  He was in nothing but a diaper.  No one had seen him.  I was standing in the middle of the road my heart racing thinking, “Do I go call 911?” 7, 8, 9, 12 That is my next step. 9, 12 My neighbor that lived in that house—used to be a little house like this—she was one of my best friends. 6, 9, 12, 18 We would wave at each other while we were talking on the phone. 7, 10 She pulls up in her car beside me with Nick in the car. 7 She goes, “I bet you’re wondering where he was!”  I said, “Yes!  I was ready to call 911!” 7 A few nights ago before that we could cut through the bank and walk across Vernon and there was a restaurant side and a shopping center over there. 7, 9, 19 We had taken the family to dinner and then I had let Ian buy a cap gun at the drugstore. 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 19 Nicholas decided he was going to go over there, get a cap gun. 12 He cut through the bank and went just like we had done going to the restaurant. 7, 9, 12, 19 He knew where that cap gun was. 6, 12 She said, “I found him in the Jerry’s parking lot.” 17 She said, “Nicky, does your mom know where you are?” 13, 14, 15 “To get a cap gun!”  She said, “I know this boy’s mother, I know she must be really worried about what happened to him.” 12, 13, 14, 15 She said thank goodness it was in the day. 19 She said, “My name is Barb Trainer. 6 I live across the street from her.” 9 People were still skittish about letting him go with her. 9, 19 Then she said—she was a Hershey representative, and all the kids went to her house for candy all the time. 6, 7, 9, 13 She said, “Oh, I know I should never do this,” but she said, “Nicky, if you come with me I’ll give you candy.” 6, 13, 14, 15, 19 And then someone came up and said, “Barb what are you doing?” 19 And she said since the person called her Barb the rest of the crowd kind of assumed, okay, she must be Barb. 7, 9, 16, 17, 19 She probably explained she was a Hershey representative and that she gives all the kids in the neighborhood candy, and Nick was willing to go with her for the prospect of candy because he knew she was good on her word! 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 They were always going to her house for candy. 6, 9, 16, 17 So she brought him home. 9, 18, 19 That’s not a good—I guess that is an example of my—I mean I was aware suddenly, quickly, that he was missing. 6, 9, 10, 13, 16 But they had a pretty— AS: It was a safe place. 11, 18 I said to Nicky, “Were cars honking at you when you crossed Vernon?” 7 “No, mommy, I was running across Vernon.” 7, 11, 15 AS: Oh, wow. 14 Still a good story. 9 SS: Oh, there are so many stories of kids growing up. 9, 17, 18 A lot of parents were a little more mellow about stuff. 9, 10, 16, 17 The bigger house over there in the white, she is a teacher and we’ve been friends over the years, and this would have been well after the event, she goes, “I had to crack up when I saw Ian and Carson driving that steam roller down the street!” 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20 And I’m like, “Doing what?!” 10 She goes, “Oh, you didn’t hear about that?”  She goes, “Ian and Carson got the steam roller that was parked in the alley. 9 They left the keys in it.  They decided to see if they could drive it. 7, 12, 14 So they parked it in front of a friends’ house as a joke!” 6, 9, 12, 18 She looked out the window and saw them driving by in a steam roller. 9, 14 AS: And never told you? 15, 20 [laughter]  SS: She just thought it was funny! 9, 11, 12 They parked it, they got out, they left it.  She said, “Don’t you know all those workmen who came and said ‘I swear I parked it right here!’” 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: That sounds fun. 10, 16 Sounds like a fun place to grow up. 11, 17 SS: One time I remember my husband and I, I’m not even sure, but he took the boys in the neighborhood and I took the girls in the neighborhood and we were going to take them to a movie, but we raced to see who could get to the movie theater first. 6, 8, 9, 15, 20 Not side by side.  “You take your route I’ll take my route and let’s see who gets there first!” 6, 9, 19 AS: In your cars? 7 Yes.  I loved children. 13, 14 We got the closest in time, but we didn’t do anything excessive. 9 But it was fun.  Lots of birthday parties and various events. 15, 19 Kids all played sports. 8 Played a lot of basketball around each others’ houses. 6, 8, 9, 17 AS: Tell me about your kids as they are getting into their teenage years. 20 They are kind of spread apart? 16, 17, 20 The two boys were closer in age. 8 SS: Right.  So Jessica is the first one. 9 She just gets a little moody like girls get. 8, 9, 12 She was what I would call a very self-regulated child. 7 I guess to some extent I was, too. 10, 15 Maybe I thought everybody was. 11, 12 She didn’t need a curfew. 13 She just really didn’t need a lot of boundaries. 9, 12, 13, 17 She set them tight enough for herself. 17, 20 I didn’t feel like I needed to get behind her and set more. 13, 16, 17 She always asks me why I didn’t do that. 16, 17 I said, “You didn’t need them. 13 You were never out later than concerned me. 15 You were very concerned to stay away from bad things. 9, 16 You were, you know, almost a straight A student. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 I didn’t need to say anything about your homework. 13, 19 You had friends that I approved of.” 12, 18 Although, come to see on her side, she saw her friends were a lot wealthier than we were. 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 She was too embarrassed to bring any of them to our house. 5, 6, 9 All of our kids thought we were poor, and would say that. 11, 12 I’m like, “You guys don’t even know what poor is. 10, 13, 14, 15 We might be poor for Edina, but you have a nice place to sleep, you’ve never gone hungry, you have a mom and dad that love you.” 7, 11, 13, 15 They just see get a new car on your 16th birthday, live in a mansion, have all the money in the world. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19 Jessica was the one because she was really bright so she hung out with the brightest of the bright and all their parents tended to be the richest of the rich! 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 She just was embarrassed to bring anybody—except for the one house over. 5, 6, 9, 12 She was best friends with that girl, and a few houses down she was best friends with that girl. 6, 9, 12, 18 So those two were in our house because they were part of the neighborhood. 6, 8, 9 She barely ever brought the school girls over. 5, 8, 9, 18 Although, in elementary years 11, 20 I had birthday parties and she had friends over in elementary years. 12, 18, 19, 20 It wasn’t until she hit middle school that she said the differences in finances. 8 No teacher ever had a problem with her.  She never intentionally did anything wrong. 15 She got a bus demerit once because she zipped a coat up over her face being silly. 9 That obstructed her view and that was a bus demerit. 9 That really troubled her, but oh well!  Was always in the honor role and graduated high in her class in Edina. 8, 16, 17, 20 Went to Emory with two or three other kids from Edina went to Emory that year. 20 She was very easy.  She didn’t drink, she didn’t do drugs in high school. 6, 8, 14 I know she experimented in college, but that’s all it was was experimenting in college. 8, 13, 14, 15 She realized she couldn’t do what she wanted to do with her education and focus on that. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m sure she drank at a few frat parties. 7, 14, 15 She was usually the sober driver so it wasn’t [unclear]. 6, 7, 10, 14 AS: It makes sense as a mom. 15, 16, 17 SS: It sounded like pretty normal college behavior. 8, 10, 18 Her grades were good. 20 When she first got to Emory she called me up and she said, “Mom, there are people here that are really smart!” 7, 9, 20 [laughter]  “From all over the world!” 15 I tried to reassure her, “Jessica, you’re smart too!” 10, 15, 20 “I know but I have to study here, and they don’t!” 9, 13, 14, 15 [laughter]  She did fine! 14 She was the one that got the TA position in the non-native speaking—to help with the non-native speakers that come to Mankato. 13, 16, 19 She taught freshman English to the non-native speakers there while she was getting her master’s. 9, 20 That was a very sought after position because it also paid and gave you free school. 8, 13 AS: What did she get her master’s in? 9, 20 SS: English as a second language. 13, 20 But her undergrad was English and South Asian studies. 8, 9 And now she’ll get an education— AS: There goes a little guy on a bike! 10, 14 Yeah they still ride around [laughter] 6, 8, 9 And I remember Jessica couldn’t master a bike until about five. 9, 20 Ian hopped on a two-wheeler at three never having had training wheels. 15 “Oh, my three-year-old can ride a two-wheeler? 6, 20 I’m in trouble now!” 14 That was my first hint right there! 9, 14 I would say fairly early age you will see, once they can ride—it kind of was a rule. 6, 12, 16, 17 If you could ride your two-wheeler without training wheels, you could— AS: Did that go for Ian then when he was three? 6 SS: I tried to keep him—well the good thing is Jessica—if he was three, Jessica was eight, and Kelsey next door was nine. 10, 12 If he would hang with the eight and nine year old, I was okay. 20 As long as they were going to stay in a clump because I knew I had reporters that would report back. 6, 9, 12, 19 I tried. 10 AS: Tell me about Ian.  SS: Ian.  Ian, Ian, Ian.  He was the antithesis of whatever I thought was going to happen in a child from the day he was born. 11, 12, 19 Jessica would nurse and fall asleep. 7 Ian would nurse and say, “Okay, I’m refreshed and energized.  What should we do now?!” 14 At just born! 9, 12 At two in the morning.  I’m like, “You just sleep like one little nap a day and you are a newborn. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 This is very difficult!” 20 When I was tired I would go downstairs, lay on the couch, put him in his swing beside the couch. 9, 10, 12 Got to be right there, but dozing when I could because he is five weeks and tearing at things. 14, 16 I remember asking his doctor early on, “Is he still hungry do you think? 9, 13 Should we try some cereal?” 16 Nothing worked.  AS: To try to make him tired? 12, 16 SS: Or full so he would sleep longer. 7, 11 Jessica sat quietly and played with toys. 8 I found Ian getting around at four months old and methodology and getting himelf around. 5, 8, 20 I put him in this little thing that had wheels on it out on our concrete patio in Charlotte. 10, 17 He ran that thing so fast at four and a half months old and he toppled and it was just a little lip that he would go over. 7, 8, 9, 12, 20 He just ran around and kunk! 7, 8, 9, 12 Knocked over sideways. 16, 17 He hurt himself, and I was just like I can’t believe he made that thing go so fast that he could run it over like that. 9, 11, 12, 16 Then, it was, you know, by the time he was eight, eight months old he was toddling around, holding onto the furniture. 8, 13, 14, 15, 20 It wasn’t too long after that—that’s when we made the move. 16 When we got here within a month or two he was walking. 8, 15 I know he pulled a chair up to the kitchen counter, climbed on the chair, climbed on the counter, pulled a knife out of the knife bucket and was like, “Look what I have accomplished.” 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m like, “Oh no. 10 What am I going to do with this boy?”  Needless to say, out of the children he was a bit accident prone. 7, 14 As his pediatrician would say, “His brain is writing checks his body can’t cash.” 8 He would fall off of things. 16 It is a wonder…  I was afraid I was going to get looked at for child abuse. 9 I don’t think he was—no, I was pregnant with Nick.  He wasn’t two years old. 20 He took the Little Tikes car—we had a deck out here—he took the Little Tikes car and pointed it straight at the steps. 6, 7, 9, 12 He wanted to see what it was like to go down the steps. 9, 12, 13 So he went out the windshield flat and face first into the driveway. 7, 9, 14, 16 He had to go in to get his head examined, but he had two huge black eyes. 14, 16 Shortly after that—he was in the process of potty training.  Shortly after that I had Nicholas.  While he had two, big black eyes he had chicken pox. 8, 14, 16 He had big wet stains on his pants and he has his hands in his pockets and I remember his face with chicken pox and black eyes. 8, 9, 14, 16 I was still at the hospital, or maybe I took Nick home, but the two boys had to stay apart for four or five days because I couldn’t bring a new baby into the chicken pox. 5, 6, 8, 9, 19, 20 The parents that raised me were in town with their RV, so my mother watched Nick in the RV and would just let me know when he needed to eat. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 And I would sleep with him out there. 7 Nick came a month early. 8, 19 I would sleep out there with him at night. 7, 19 Steve left to go back to work, so two days he would sleep out there with the other kids while I slept out there with Nick. 7, 19 Ian was very physically coordinated and verbally gifted. 7, 8 You don’t usually expect the two to come together. 10, 13, 19 He was very charming.  Made a lot of friends. 12, 17, 18 Challenged a lot of friends; not in a confrontational way, but I remember getting called to the elementary school about Ian. 7, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18 He would get in trouble for the oddest things in elementary school. 8, 9, 16 He got in trouble because he started a club on the playground that involved doing an obstacle course before you could join. 8, 9, 11 All the boys wanted to be a part of this club and one boy fell and hurt his back doing the obstacle course, therefore Ian was in trouble because he had designed something that caused someone to get hurt, and so he got in trouble for that. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 He and another boy at some point in time put a bunch of smelly lunch stuff in a milk carton in the bathroom, and there was a question about whether or not someone peed in it or not and so there was trouble involved there. 6, 7, 9, 10 One time he did a backflip off the front step of the bus into the grass and he got in trouble for that for being a bus hazard. 9, 12, 19 Then in later elementary school I remember he got in trouble because he punched another kid on the bus. 8, 9 He came in all fuming and I said, “Tell me the story.” 9, 19 He said, “He came up to me with his leather mittens and just started slapping me across the face. 9, 11, 12, 15, 19 So I kind of pushed him away with my fists.” 9, 16, 17 I said, “Who was this?”  And he told me and the father called me that night upset that he had punched his son and I said, “Well did he tell you that he was slapping him across the face with those leather gloves?” 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 20 He said, “Let me call you back!” 7, 19 It progressed.  At some dance in middle school a girl was upset because Ian didn’t like her or something accused him of snapping her thong, so he got sent home from the dance. 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 19 He got in trouble for punching a boy in school there. 8 I said, “Tell me the whole story.” 9 He said, “Me and Morgan,” who is a good friend, “Morgan said, ‘hit me in the shoulder as hard as you can.’” 11, 12 So Ian hauled off and hit him in the shoulder, and Ian broke his hand.  These two fingers here.  And Morgan said, “Didn’t hurt!  Didn’t hurt at all!”  But Ian was in intense agony and eventually someone sent him to the office and they said— AS: What happened? 7, 12, 13, 15 SS: They find out from people, “Well, we heard you punched Morgan.” 15 He said, “Well, he told me to.” 20 They said, “That doesn’t matter, Ian. 20 Anytime you punch anybody it is an instant one day suspension from school.” 8, 9, 19 One day they were snowboarding for the day. 5, 8, 14, 19 He calls towards the end of the day and says, “When you come pick me up from snowboarding we need to go to the hospital. 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 I broke my finger.”  I said, “Well, how do you do that?”  He said, “I heard it snap.” 15 I said, “What time was that?”  “Probalby about noon.”  I said, “Why didn’t you call me sooner?” 7 “I wasn’t going to waste a good day of snowboarding because I broke my finger!” 5, 8, 9, 14, 19 [laughter]  And sure enough he had broken his finger. 5, 15, 20 He was, for the most part, loved by his peers. 13 When it came to the adults they either really took a liking to him or really took a dislike to him. 10, 19 There was not much middle ground. 8, 18 He got sent to the principal’s office in middle school for writing—do you remember Survivor? 7, 8 He folded up a little piece of paper and wrote: Vote Mrs. K off the island [laughter]. 8, 20 That was a send home. 12, 19 I don’t know if— AS: He had a good sense of humor. 13, 14, 15, 17 SS: Awesome sense of humor. 17 And he wasn’t afraid of anybody.  I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I gues she got it from me.  His dad is not like that.  I guess he got that part from me. 10 He got his dad’s athletic ability and my sense of, “They are just people.” 9, 12, 17, 19 He truly loved people, too. 13 He loved people. 13 He was very emotionally wise. 13 The first kid I had that could see right through me. 9, 14 He would say, “I know why you are saying that. 11, 13, 14, 15 And he would have my ulterior motive nailed.  I would be like, “Shoot! 10 This isn’t supposed to happen!” 6, 12 I remember he was ten, and one day he came in and he goes, “Mom! 15, 19 Guess what I figured out! 12, 13 You can’t make me do anything!” 16 SS: Shoot!  You can’t make me! 16 He recognized his own free will.  SS: He would always stand up for the underdog. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 Always. 16, 17 That didn’t sit well with the teachers, but it probably made him friends. 12, 13, 16, 18 There was this one really smart boy. 20 He’s a smart boy. 20 He had a bottle of water and he was drinking his water. 6, 14, 17 The teacher was saying, “Maybe you shouldn’t be drinking so much water because you will end up having to go to the bathroom.” 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 18 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Later on in the class the kid said he had to go to the bathroom. 7, 20 She was like, “I told you not to drink so much water. 6, 10, 14, 18, 20 You can’t go to the bathroom.” 7 “Mrs. So-and-so, I don’t think that is the way it works in life. 11, 14, 16 You know, if you told somebody that there was a well on the property and not to go near the well because you might fall in the well, but the person fell in the well, you wouldn’t say just stay in the well because you are in there because they told you not to walk near it. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 You would get them out!  I don’t think you get to tell somebody they can’t go to the bathroom.” 7 I don’t remember exactly how that wound up, but I remember hearing the story from probably more than Ian! 9, 10 That boy went on to be a famous doctor.  Some teacher told that boy he was stupid, and he stood up for him too and said, “He’s like the smartest boy in school!” 8, 9, 20 He must have had issues when he was young. 14, 15 Those are just glimpses into… 9, 12 So, then Ian tried Peewee basketball, he liked that. 8, 10, 18 Gymnastics, worked his way up to the boys team, and competed in the state. 9, 16 They were trying to put him in line for Junior Olympics, and he was going to have to be in the gym twenty-four hours a week. 6, 10, 11, 16 My husband was all set that he was going to be an Olympic gymnast. 9, 15, 17 Ian said, “I’m done.  I’m done.  I may do it for fun again sometime, but I’m done. 5 There are so many more sports out there that I haven’t gotten to try. 15, 16 I am not going to say this is my only sport.”  “I am not going to just play one sport.” 9, 12 And gymnastics had made it clear it is this or—you can’t play any other sports because there’s no time. 9, 16 So he quit.  Steve was broken hearted. 5 I think Ian played basketball that year. 8, 20 Then he found lacrosse, and he loved lacrosse. 13 He played lacrosse for Edina. 8 He found paintball and snowboarding and he was very good at all of them. 5, 8, 14 Won some big contests. 8, 9 Went on to play semi-pro paintball where he would travel the country—in middle school he would get asked to go on, like to California. 8, 10, 11, 16 He just did a lot at an early age I guess. 9, 10, 12, 17 AS: How about high school? 8 SS: Well, Ian first met trouble I would say right around seventh grade. 5, 9, 14, 15, 20 AS: Okay, so backing up from high school. 8, 19 You mean trouble with— SS: Drugs and stuff. 9, 16 Some of the friends he met that summer had older brothers, too, I think that had access. 5, 6, 12, 18, 20 I know they tried smoking pot and I know cigarettes came in around then. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19 I remember they were going to have a sleepover here. 7 The first night I found pot. 9, 19 I sent everybody home and told everybody’s parents why I sent them home. 7, 10, 16, 19, 20 And then he just went deeper undercover. 9, 12 I had never had any experience, known anybody that had done anything like this. 10, 13, 14, 15 I had never crossed any of this with Jessica. 15 I didn’t know any other kids that were having this issue. 13, 14, 15 I was way over my head. 16 I really didn’t know what to do. 13, 14, 15 Since Nick and Ian were like Frick and Frack—they were one year apart in school and they shared a lot of friends. 8, 12, 17, 18, 20 Nick thought he had to do just about whatever Ian was doing. 9, 11, 12 He got in on the act too. 10 He was still doing okay in school. 8, 9 I’ll tell you when his life really changed. 11, 16 The boy that had asked him to punch him in the arm as hard as he could shot himself in the face with a shotgun and killed himself. 7, 10, 11, 15 How old was he? 20 That really affected him.  I remember telling him, “You’ve got a test tomorrow.” 9 And he goes, “I’ve got a test tomorrow. 9 Does that matter in the scheme of things? 16, 20 I just lost my good friend.” 9, 12 All of his group of friends felt that loss. 12, 17, 18 They ran a group for those boys, but sometimes they would leave Ian out and he would think, “Okay, they care about the rest of them, and they care about me.” 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 19 I believe he probably—I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 When I look back on it I think that was a big changing time in his life. 8, 11, 16, 18, 19 When he went to high school I know he started to get involved because he knew everybody, got invited to—everybody kind of wanted him to be at everything because he was a lot of fun. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 He was sort of electric. 17 He was the life of the party. 6, 11 The girls all liked him, he got along with the guys that mattered in school. 8, 10, 12, 18, 20 My husband was gone a lot, and I really was pretty lost is the honest truth. 9, 15, 17, 18 My mother was dying.  I took care of my father until right around when he died—9/11—so that was 2001. 5, 7, 8, 14 That was the year Ian was eleven. 15, 20 I sent him to my friends in Georgia for a while and she homeschooled everybody for just a few weeks until I helped my dad die. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 A few years after that, in his early, mid-teen years, our basement flooded, my mother was dying, Steve had sort of checked out. 17, 20 I was really overwhelmed in my life. 11 I would count on Steve to be here with the kids, and then sometimes he’d just leave. 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 AS: Like on a weeknight, or weekends, or go out of town? 12, 19 SS: He was—I’m trying—I think it was short trips then. 16 [pause in recording] 6, 9 SS: Sometimes he would leave overnight while I was out of town. 5, 6, 8, 18, 19 Ian got his license at sixteen.  I was at one mom’s and he was going to go to their parents for Thanksgiving. 10, 11, 15, 16 Ian called me, “Mom, we are driving to Pennsylvania, me and Nick. 7, 14 I am in Chicago and I stopped to get my girlfriend a sweatshirt and now I can’t find the car. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20 AS: Where you at work?  SS: I was at my mother’s in New Hampshire.  [pause to turn off fan] 9, 19 SS: So he calls me and I’m like, “Oh no. 7, 10 Dad let you drive to Pennsylvania all by yourself?” 7, 14, 19 I call, “Steve! 7 What are you thinking?”  He decided he wanted to fly the plane a day early. 12, 13, 19 He has a private plane. 13, 14 He was going to fly himself and the boys that was the plan. 8 He decided to leave a day early and the boys didn’t want to so he let them drive. 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 Sixteen and fourteen.  AS: So would you say you two were not on the same page around parenting teenagers? 8, 10, 16, 18, 20 That was one time.  He eventually found the car and he made it to Pennsylvania, and he made it home. 7, 15, 16, 19 AS: Was it stolen or had he just lost track of it? 9, 12, 18 SS: He just lost track of it. 9, 12 Then one time he took the boys and a friend out sailing on a boat he inherited from his brother. 5, 7, 8, 12 They bought alcohol to take out on the boat on purpose. 6, 7 I remember going down in the basement and there was a bottle of alcohol in Ian’s room. 7, 17 I said, “Well, I’ll be taking this.”  He goes, “Well, I don’t know why you’d do that. 13, 14, 15 Your husband bought that for me.” 7, 15 I said, “Really?”  I went upstairs and I said, “Steve…” 9 He said, “I didn’t buy it for him. 7 I bought it to take out on the boat.” 6, 7 I feel like you’re sabotaging everything I’m trying to do here. 16 I explained, read him the [unclear] as to why it wasn’t a good idea and how we aren’t trying to be friends with them. 11, 12, 16, 18 He would do all sorts of stuff where he would just let Ian be the man. 9, 12, 17, 19 He needed to bring the car home from the airport when Ian was thirteen. 7, 8, 13, 19, 20 Granted, he took to stuff like that like a duck to water. 6, 7, 9 He let Ian follow him home on the back roads with a stick shift. 8, 9, 12, 19 Ian was driving the stick shift. 8, 9, 14 Then, a couple of days later, it is funny but a couple days later I get a call from the neighbors going, “Your thirteen year old child is driving the car around the neighborhood.” 7, 8, 14, 19, 20 I’m at work.  I’m like, “IAN! 10 You know better.” 13, 14, 15 When I came home I told Ian, “You know better.” 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 “You guys are just plain stupid. 9, 12 You should never get in a car with a thirteen year old driver. 7, 14, 15, 20 You are putting your life in your hands to do that!” 10, 11 He goes, “Well, dad let me drive home from the airport.” 7, 8, 14, 19 AS: And that’s when you found out?  SS: Yes.  And all that kind of stuff I found. 9, 16, 17 I found his Playboy or something that his father has hidden away somewhere. 5, 16 It was happening. 12, 13 I could never stay on top of what was going on with Ian. 9, 15 They tried to keep it pretty low, underground, although I know things went on here that I didn’t—I probably didn’t know everything. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 Then he found his passion—after he tried every sport. 10 Did well at every sport.  He found his passion was music.  And we got in more trouble.  Police would come by our house more for that. 6, 9, 13, 19 On a nice summer night. 19 Put the band on the deck at 10:02 [p.m.] the police would always be at our house. 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17 They would come say, “Ian, you can’t be out here after ten o’clock.” 13, 19 It was 10:02 they would be on our doorstep with a noise complaint. 9, 12 Then they would get in trouble, accidental trouble again. 7 Nick wasn’t as bad as Ian, but he’d get in trouble accidentally. 7 He was riding his skateboard home from a friend’s house on a Sunday night in the summer at eleven o’clock at night at fifteen [years old]. 5, 6, 9, 12, 19, 20 He says, “I got pulled over and they said, ‘you’re out past curfew!” 9 And Nick said, “It is twelve o’clock on the weekends.” 12, 19 The cop goes, “The weekend is Friday and Saturday. 12, 19 Sunday is not the weekend.” 12, 19 [laughter]  Ian became really good friends with the hockey team his senior year. 5, 12, 18, 19, 20 If I am going to be perfectly honest, let’s see, when Ian was a junior his girlfriend got pregnant, too. 8, 9, 12, 19 But, her family didn’t want anyone to ever know or anyone to ever talk about it. 10, 13, 14, 15, 18 We offered to take the baby, raise the baby, whatever. 5, 6, 12 So his one and only baby that I would have ever had left. 5 So I hope they are together. 10 Anyway, that’s the trouble of the beginning of high school. 8, 16 At the end of ninth grade he really found his passion for music. 12, 20 He dibble-dabbled all along but he started to really excel in ninth grade. 9, 11, 20 I got him really good private music teacher that would come to the house and taught him all the ins and outs of music theory. 6, 9, 13, 14, 19 He ate it up.  He loved it. 13 Started out tenth grade optimistically and went to the first school social event. 7, 8, 9, 15, 20 Took a girl to homecoming, but he had a hard time really buckling down to do the kind of work you need to do for Edina High School. 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 A mom who is moving to Florida with one of his best friends and she was going to homeschool. 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19 She wanted Ian to come, too, so that her son wouldn’t be alone. 12, 13, 19 She would homeschool them both and live at the beach. 8, 19 I agreed because I knew her really well. 6, 12 I agreed and thought maybe it would be a better environment overall. 9, 11, 12 Then, those two boys got into a fight over the same girl, and Ian didn’t go. 8 I had already taken him out of school. 6, 8 School had kind of told me he couldn’t come back in that year. 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 That was very confusing.  I signed him up for an online thing and that was useless. 6, 9 There was no way to get him to do any of that work online. 6, 16 We wasted a semester of school. 8, 9 We come to the beginning of junior year. 8, 13, 19, 20 He’s got—no that can’t be right. 14 That is right. 14 The beginning of junior year things start out good. 8, 9, 11, 16, 20 I went and I sat down with the school psychologist and I said, “He is asking for extra help. 8, 9, 13 Nick has an IEP.  He has this resource room. 7 It really helps him do better at school. 8, 13 I really need—here are all the evaluation things. 13, 16 I really need this for Ian.” 13 Well, it is much harder to make this happen when you get to high school. 8, 11, 12, 16, 18 “We had decided that he doesn’t meet the criteria.” 12, 13 I’m like, “Look, he needs this.” 10, 13 I pointed out the criteria to them and they said, “We are sorry but we are not going to approve him. 10 Sign here.”  I wrote, “I will not sign this.  I believe that signing this is supporting that my son will fail.  I really think he needs this help and I am angry that you won’t approve it!” 13 Exclamation point!  I turned it back in. 19 By the end of junior year he had failed out. 8, 12, 20 I was frustrated, but right about that same time he had gone on the senior trip with one of his best friends. 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 He had gotten, I told that mother before she agreed to let him go with her on that trip—he would get invited to everyone’s vacation—until this time he was always a lot of fun to have on vacation. 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 He was just a fun person. 9, 12 This was his senior trip. 20 It was Mexico, so there was a lot of drinking involved. 6, 14, 17 He went wild. 17 I told that mother, “Are you sure?” 15, 20 I said, “You know, he can be a handful. 13, 14, 15 I’m not sure you want the responsibility.” 13, 15 AS: You tried to talk her out of it. 10 SS: She was like, “No, I know Ian well.” 10, 13, 14, 15 I was like, “You don’t.” 10 But, anyway. 16 Of course the girl was his girlfriend that had gotten pregnant too was on that trip because her mother was chaperoning her older brothers. 5, 12, 15, 20 They were all friends. 12, 18 So then they were re-looking into each other.  He was a basket case on that trip.  When he came back her son and him that were best friends, he distanced himself from Ian, and I think that was the first time Ian has ever had anybody distance themselves from him. 9, 12, 18, 19 He didn’t understand what had happened. 9, 12, 13, 16 He had no clue as to why his best friend suddenly wanted nothing to do with him. 9, 12, 13 That really set him into a depression. 17 He probably was self medicating with something. 10 Jessica and I found him sitting out on the back steps crying one night. 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 We knew he had needed help for a while. 6, 12, 13 We said, “Ian, are you ready to get help?” 13 And he said “Yes.”  Jessica and I drove him to the STOP Program at Fairview Riverside in the middle of the night one night. 7, 8, 14, 19 We didn’t stop to wake up Steve. 9, 10 We just left. 9, 12 AS: What is the STOP program?  SS: I don’t know what that stands for but it’s where you can take minors for admission for chemical use. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 It is a five or six day program. 19 AS: Is it part of their chemical dependency and dual diagnosis— SS: Yes. 9, 12 STOP is for the minors.  SS: Okay.  By the time he has sobered up and realized what a mess he has gotten himself into he wants out of there and is mad. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 At that point I decided I’m not backing down. 12, 19 Jessica was rooting me on.  We got him a place at Hazelden. 11 Unfortunately, though, it was the most awful ride of my life. 6, 10, 11 You have to drive your child. 7, 14 That was the absolute worst. 9 That was the hell ride, wasn’t it? 6 I said if I had known it was going to be like this I would have gotten Steve and Jessica. 10, 13, 14, 15 I would have stayed home. 5, 9, 19 I did not need to— AS: Did he just unleash on you? 9, 12, 13 SS: Yes.  It was awful. 10 We broke one rule, you aren’t supposed to eat. 6, 12 We did stop to eat and it was—not that it would make or break anything, we just thought we would have a meal before we went to Hazelden. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18 He still went in July 4th. 9 AS: What year was this? 20 SS: It would have been the summer before his senior year. 20 He would have been class of 2009, so this would have been 2008. 20 No, that’s not right. 14 He died in 2009 this was two years—it must have been summer of 2007. 20 Then I get the calls from Hazelden. 7 First of all, that first call I get is one of Ian’s roommates. 7, 9 He had helped him see that he was gay and then that guy fell in love with Ian. 13, 15, 16 They had to separate them but they wanted me to know that that had happened. 12, 13, 14, 15 Then I got the call that you had to wear a shirt for basketball because they didn’t want the girls to see them without a shirt on. 7, 8, 13 Ian had taken his shirt off so they told him to put his shirt back on, but he had it around his neck. 6, 10, 19, 20 AS: In true rebel form. 17 SS: The next day he cut big holes in his shirt and they said, “Ian, you know what the theory behind this is. 8, 13, 14, 15, 19 If you do anything like that again, you’re going to get kicked out.”  AS: Was that the ticket? 13 AS: He stayed in? 5, 9 They recommended long term—a program out in Utah or Wyoming or somewhere that I wish maybe I had given a try because all the kids that went away to those one year programs are still alive. 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 Not that they’re done using necessarily, at all, but some of them have been totally—some of them went to what I would consider strictly recreational use. 9, 17 They might drink, they might smoke a joint, but that is the extent of it. 6, 14, 15 AS: But they are not using heroin.  SS: No. And Ian was not using heroin at that point either.  Ian was—any kind of pills. 16, 17 Not even necessarily pain pills. 15 Like Ambien or Xanax.  He liked psychedelics, mushrooms, but he wasn’t using heroin. 7, 10, 18 I don’t think he even ever tried it at that point. 10, 15 He got out of Hazelden and agreed—we reached a compromise. 13 He wouldn’t go away but he would go to Sobriety High. 16 It was a sobriety high school in Edina. 8 He started his senior year at Sobriety High. 9, 11, 20 The Discovery Channel was doing a special called Cocaine Nation where they basically accused Ian of using coke and he never did. 7, 9, 11, 15 Of course, he’s got friends all over the country. 11, 12, 16, 18 AS: You mean the way they presented it on the show? 7, 16 That he used cocaine? 9 SS: That he relapsed and used cocaine. 9, 18 Which, he never had really participated in at all that I’m aware of. 15 If he ever did it was a sample.  It was never his issue. 15 He got calls from all over the country about that. 7, 11, 16 I still have it. 9 I have a copy of the show.  AS: He got calls from people… 7 SS: Friends! 12 He’s got friends all over the country. 11, 12, 16, 18 “Saw you on Cocaine Nation?  I didn’t know you had any problems with Cocaine! 13, 14, 15 Ian was like, “I don’t!” 10 He got accused of something by a girl there and thrown out somehow. 9 That is still a little fuzzy. 9 Nobody was ever very clear with me on how that happened or what happened with that. 12, 13 I thought, “Now what do I do with you?” 11, 12 Because he really wasn’t exhibiting any signs of any heavy usage at that time.  So, he went to Eden Prairie Alternative.  Somewhere in there he had started a band. 9, 11, 15 He had a little band he was playing around town and he was really getting into his music. 15, 19 They weren’t at my house a lot, they were at another lady’s house a lot. 6, 9, 17 I know there was probably alcohol involved, but I guess I wasn’t really thinking and I would put it back—it is hard to know what to let go and what not to let go. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 I know. 13, 14, 15 I totally understand. 9, 12, 16, 17 SS: Their band was playing little gigs. 15 Anyway, he didn’t finish school. 8, 16 He was still short a few classes to graduate. 8, 9, 16, 20 So then a decision had to be made how to get those done. 16 So, now we are up to summer of 2009. 14 He picked back up and he always had this one friend that was over that he played paintball with and they played hockey together. 8, 12, 16, 17, 19 He was about five years older. 5, 20 He was very mad with Ian whenever he used any substances. 9, 15 They had a big falling out after that. 8 He started hanging out at his house a lot that summer. 6, 9, 11, 17, 18 I was very relieved.  I thought, “He’s hanging out with this sober friend. 6, 11, 12, 18 This is a good thing.”  He was teaching him how to work on cars and guy things. 7, 16 Things where he was sleeping over a lot. 7, 17 He was going to finish up school in the fall. 8 The band fell apart and I never really got to the bottom of that. 15, 20 The sober friend and Ian and another guy, a friend, on spring break, they all hopped in Ian’s little Saab and they drove through the Rocky Mountains to Vegas, down to southern California. 6, 7, 12, 14, 18 They surfed, went back through Vegas because the food was so cheap, did this massive, fast road trip and came home. 9, 19 Then, the family where they were always at to do band practice, invited Ian to go on a cruise with them. 10, 15, 16, 17, 18 They thought the world of him. 11, 12, 15 He wasn’t home thirty days because he was on that cruise with that family. 18, 19 Had a really good time.  That all went well.  I told him this time I said, “Ian, do not be excessive. 20 This is probably what got you into trouble.”  They said he was well behaved and didn’t give them any trouble. 6 When he got home from that was the end of April. 12, 19 He was still hanging out with the guy that he took the road trip. 9, 18 They went to the Grand Canyon. 7 They did lots of stuff. 5, 9, 17 He was playing tennis, swimming, and working out at the club. 15 Then he called me—no, then one night an old friend came over for dinner and Ian was acting weird. 7, 10, 12, 19, 20 I said, “You’re altered.” 12 He said, “Why do you say that?”  “I can just tell. 9, 12 You are altered. 12 He wasn’t straightforward with me. 6, 9 I just said, “You are off.” 9, 12 I said to his friend, “Curtis, don’t let him talk you into doing things. 10, 12, 16, 19 This isn’t good for either one of you.  You guys need to fess up and tell me what is going on.” 13 I had to call another boy that was the drummer of the band’s mother and tell her that he had come into my house at two in the morning drunk, retrieving a piece of musical equipment, but it stirred up the whole house, him just kind of walking in at two in the morning. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I tell her, “He can’t just walk in the house at two in the morning drunk.” 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 In the process she said something about, “Well, I heard on the street that Ian is doing heroin.” 9, 15 I’m like, “Really? 10 Well thank you for passing that on.” 13 Ian at this time was working at the UPS store across the street. 5, 9 I had talked to her before he was altered, that’s what it was. 10, 11, 12 So then I said to them, “Word on the street is you’re using heroin. 9 Is that true?”  Didn’t get anything.  But, the next day, because Ian and I had a very close relationship. 19 I don’t mean—we had our fights, we had our disagreements, but he was very demonstratively affectionate with me. 9, 16 He would tell everybody how much he cared about his mother. 7, 11, 12, 18 I got so many—like his roommate at Hazelden and all of his friends who said, “He loved you so much.” 7, 12, 13, 18 He would lay on my bed and just talk to me for hours. 9, 10, 11, 12 None of my other kids were that interactive. 10 The next day he came to me and said, “She’s right.” 14, 19 I didn’t want to overreact, I didn’t want to do anything stupid. 9, 10, 13 But he said, “I want you to know that I already decided that it’s not a good thing to do and that I’m done with it. 12, 13, 14, 15 I’m not going to do it anymore.” 13 I knew nothing at this point. 6, 12 Zero knowledge in this. 13, 14, 15 I’m way out of my league. 16 Still in shock.  He said, “I’ll give you everything. 6 I’m done.  It’s not where I want to go with my life. 11, 13 It’s not doing anything good for my life. 11 I just kind of wanted to see what it’s like, and it’s not something I want in my life.” 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 I said, “Do you want to go back to Hazelden?” 13, 19 He said, “No.”  I said, “If you feel like you need to will you let me know? 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I can make that happen. 12, 16 Let me know.” 13, 14, 15 I remember saying, “If I told you it was Hazelden or the street what would you pick?” 9, 11, 20 He goes, “Hazelden.”  I remember thinking, “Why don’t you just go back?” 9, 12, 19 Anyway, that was right around Labor Day. 14, 16 He went to school that week. 8 He went back to Eden Prairie Alternative and started to finish his classes. 8, 9, 11, 19, 20 His birthday was the 10th of September. 19 The four of us, Steve, Nick, Jess, and me went to Benihana’s for his birthday. 19 Next day was the 11th. 19 He had gotten his paycheck and he was walking up the hill from the bank and he cashed his birthday money and my neighbor who lived one house over’s birthday was also on the 11th. 6, 9, 15, 16, 19 We were going out early at 4:30 to celebrate her birthday. 19 He came up the hill and I said, “Hi!” 19 He said, “How much should I save out for going to dinner with Nate tonight?” 18, 19 That was an old friend that wanted to go out and celebrate Ian’s birthday. 12, 13, 19, 20 I said, “Take about 40 bucks” and that should cover both places they would go. 11, 17 He was supposed to be heading out with Nate at 6:30 I think. 6 I was thinking, “Okay, I know he is going to be some place and doing something. 11, 13, 14, 15 We came home at 7:30 and his car was still in the driveway. 7, 9, 14, 16, 19 He had a habit of falling asleep. 7 Sleeping through things. 16 I mean, not even prior to any heroin use. 9, 15, 16, 19 It was just Ian. 9, 12 He would just wake up and be late for whatever it was and be in a panic. 9, 12 I came in the house yelling, “Ian! 6, 9, 19 Do you know what time it is?” 13, 14, 15 He was lying on the kitchen floor by the door.  I went into the emergency code mode, being a nurse. 7 I taught CPR, did all the things that you teach in CPR class. 16, 20 Gave him his breaths, called 911, and then it all kind of blew up from there. 7, 16, 17 Steve was at his girlfriend’s house. 6, 9, 12 What makes it worse is— AS: Had you and Steve separated at this point? 16 SS: Steve and I divorced December before that. 5 That was December—he didn’t move out until June, but he had had a girlfriend for the whole previous year. 12, 20 He didn’t officially move out until June.  Then he had come up for his birthday and was still there the next day. 9, 13, 19 Must have stayed overnight. 5, 8, 9, 19 I said, “I’m going out tonight. 19 Will you stay until I get home?” 9, 19 His girlfriend lives in Mankato an hour away. 12, 16 “Would you stay until I get home? 9, 19 So I would know someone was here. 13, 14, 15 Or at least, would you stay until Ian leaves to go out to dinner with Nate?” 6, 9 He said, “No.”  He left and when I called him he thought I was just trying to get him to come back for no reason. 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 I remember yelling in the phone, “They think Ian is dead can you please come up here?” 7, 13, 19 The police took the phone away and said, “We don’t have any answers yet.” 7, 16 They pretty well did. 18 “But you should probably come.” 13, 19 He was at least kind to me over that. 9, 16, 17 He stayed for the next week. 5, 9 AS: Was Ian dead when you found him?  SS: Most likely. 10 I didn’t find a pulse.  I had missed him by minutes because was pink and warm. 7 I still, one of these days I am going to go get the medical—not the medical examiner's report because it’s not helpful, but I am going to get the EMT report. 9, 13, 14, 19 AS: What would that tell you?  Why do you want that report? 13 SS: I was just curious whether it would have estimated how long he was gone. 9, 12, 19 My story partially starts with when I called 911 the first responder was a policeman who had known Ian since he was very young. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 They had chatted lots. 5, 17 They knew each other. 6, 12 They would sit and talk, which was very hard on that officer to walk in and see Ian. 10, 11, 13 I looked at him and I said, “He needs Narcan.” 13 He looked at me and said, “Star, I don’t carry Narcan. 7 AS: The police officer arrived first before the EMT? 7, 9 SS: He recognized my address and he was at the Holiday. 14, 19 He was here in a second. 20 That police officer. 7 It happened at 7:30, which is apparently Edina’s change of shift and a lot of them were at the Holiday so they came fairly quickly after that. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 The EMT’s were not very far behind.  My sense of time perception after that was useless. 9, 17 AS: I know the feeling. 13, 14, 15, 16 SS: Apparently one of my dogs tried to grab his arm when he came in so the neighbor girl who had been out to eat with us grabbed my dogs and took them over, they were two golden retrievers they would never hurt anybody but they were probably desperately trying to defend the house from this onslaught, and protect Ian. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 The rest of that night is a blur and sort of inconsequential at this point. 9, 17, 19 [pause] 9 There is a part of the story that is missing. 9, 16 Tons of kids.  Word spread all over the place. 11 Ian was a very loved young man. 13, 14 Six months later I get a call from the third guy on that trip to the Grand Canyon and all of that. 7, 8, 20 He goes, “You don’t know the whole story. 9, 13, 14, 15 I’ve tried to get Nate to tell you the whole story but he won’t so I’m going to tell you because I think you deserve it. 9, 10 That summer Nate’s mortgage was underwater and he was very depressed…” 6, 12 Nate the older guy? 5, 20 The one who is five years older? 5, 20 SS: Yes, and had been sober. 6 AS: He was on the trips?  SS: Yes.  This is the third guy on the trip. 20 He goes, “Nate was really depressed. 12 I’m not proud of it but I got involved.  I tried heroin. 10 Nate decided he would try it to see if it would help with how depressed he was feeling.” 12, 13, 16 This other guy’s name is Lance. 6 Lance said, “You’ve got to promise me you’ll never let Ian know because this would be the death of Ian. 13, 14, 15, 19 Ian cannot see anything like this.  He has that personality that he just can’t.” 9, 12, 16 With Ian being there so much eventually he found the paraphernalia and put two and two together and figured out was going on said, “You guys are treating me like a baby, that’s not fair.” 5, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 Eventually Nate could never say no to Ian and let him do it. 15, 19 This is what they tell me.  This is the best of what I know. 9, 13, 14, 15 That would have been late that summer.  I believe almost any time that they did it, which was just more recreational, was over at Nate’s house. 6, 9, 12 Nate finally talked to me. 10, 11 He said, “Ian would always want to push it a little further, a little further and I was always telling him that’s enough, that’s enough.” 13, 16, 17, 20 Here I think he gets this birthday money and his paycheck and I don’t know why—he went out and bought that night himself. 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 But as to why he’d do it right before going out to dinner with Nate? 14 I read the texts between the two of them.  It was apparent that they were trying to support each other in having stopped and how crappy they were feeling and so on and so forth. 9, 10, 16, 19, 20 Nate must have really had something to do with it because he was pallbearer at Ian’s funeral but he didn’t tell me.  I still to this day never told Nate’s mother the whole truth. 9, 15, 19, 20 She is a nice lady and I question it would do any good. 6, 9 AS: Do you know if Nate is sober now? 6, 13, 14, 15 SS: Nate and Lance are both sober now. 6, 14 Nate got married a few years ago. 20 They enjoy lots of outdoor activities, which is hard to handle a bit. 5, 10, 11, 17 Lance had to go on methadone. 5 He said coming off the methadone was terrible but he did it. 5, 15 Nate was able to do it cold turkey. 20 So, that’s the beginning of my dealing with addiction. 13 The beginning.  Because then you got the fallout of the child that was the brother—that was the closest. 5, 9 Parenting doesn’t stop with the one kid. 9, 10, 16 My mother’s still dying, Steve’s gone, Nick’s flying of the rails. 9, 19 AS: In addiction?  Nick?  I didn’t see it as—Nick wasn’t doing heroin.  He was partying. 6 I didn’t really know how to separate the two out. 13, 14, 15 Ian was way more—except for the heroin—he was way more cards on the table. 7, 16 Nick was way more sneaky, so I didn’t know half of what was going on with him until it was passed. 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 He was very zip lipped out what had happened in his life. 11, 12, 13 Hearing I am back at my mother’s, Ian hasn’t been gone that long. 19 My mother started to really go down hill. 9, 11 I get a phone call from the Edina police department. 7 “We had an emergency call to your house tonight.” 6, 7, 9, 19 Steve was here with Nick.  “There was a report of someone stopping breathing.” 9, 10 He just stopped. 9, 10, 12, 20 Didn’t say anything else.  I about died.  He goes, “A young man was transferred to Fairview Southdale and he’s fine.” 7, 12, 14 I said, “It wasn’t Nick?”  He said, “No, but you needed to know. 13, 14, 15 And he lit into me.  I said, “Well, to the best of my knowledge, my ex-husband was at the house tonight and was responsible for the party. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 I’m in New Hampshire with my mother.”  “Can we have his number?”  “Absolutely.”  So he came up and those guys, they ordered one of those designer drugs off the internet and had taken it. 6, 12, 14, 19 One of them is called R23 or R2 something. 7 The kid that had gotten into trouble I guess I think lithium that didn’t mix well with it. 10, 15 Everybody else was okay, but it affected him.  They had to start CPR—the kids started CPR on him. 9, 11 Nick had to make the decision to call 911. 7, 16 The first thing they did was come in and yell at them all. 9, 13, 19 This plays into my advocacy too.  They just got angry at them, they found pot, they charged Nick with possession of pot, they were insulting and whatever, and the minors that were there were taken—I think Nick was eighteen so these were seventeen and eighteen year olds. 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 20 The minors were taken to the police station to be picked up by their parents. 6, 7, 9, 10, 16 Adults were left here.  Nick got charged with possession of pot and an open house party. 6, 9, 17 So, I go, “Steve!  You said you’d be there!  It was a weekend night! 12, 19 Those are the most important nights to be there!” 19 AS: And you just lost a son. 9, 12 SS: I told him I’d just be in Mankato. 9, 12, 20 I’m like that’s just where you were the other time too. 9, 12 I could never count on him. 15 He was just not reliable. 9, 12 I tried so hard to make that marriage work. 10, 11, 16 Anyway, that boy was fine. 14, 16 Down the road he ended up becoming a heroin addict. 9, 12 And he is battling it right now. 14 I believe he is sober at the moment, but he has battled it hard. 6, 11, 13, 15 He has a lot of mental health issues. 14, 15, 17 My mother—I was back and forth a lot. 17, 19 AS: How were you holding up at this time? 20 SS: Barely.  Plus, I had a job.  AS: Your son just died, your mother is dying, you just had a divorce… 9, 12 SS: My other son is in his senior year of high school, trying to graduate. 8, 16, 20 Jessica had graduated Emory and was living in New York with her fiance at the time. 6, 8 Then her roommate died thirty days before Ian. 7, 19 I had flown to New York to go to her roommate’s funeral with Jessica. 7 Thirty days later we had to make sure her fiancee was home and call and tell her Ian died. 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 Then the two of them flew out the next morning. 7 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 I was in survival mode.  Trying to keep a job [laughter] 12 Nick is—then he got mono really bad.  Then they were trying to have him get an F in a class because of absences. 16, 20 I’m like, “Really, really? 10 Who wants to stand in front of me and tell me that Nick, who lost his brother the 4th day of school, got severe mono, you are going to give him an F in the class because he missed too much school?” 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 I went before them and they voted that he could not get the F.  After, Nick and Ian both suffered through that rule. 12 The third year after that they made it… 16, 20 AS: You could get an F for missing too much of one class? 16, 18, 20 Regardless of how well you were doing in it?  Wow.  SS: Then I guess it got enough push back. 10, 19, 20 A year after Nick they did away with it. 16, 20 That’s one of the biggest reasons Ian ended up having to be at school was because of absences and being forced to take an F. I say, half of his teachers really wanted to work with him and said he could do a project on the side, you know, his American History teacher said, write an awesome essay about the Civil War or—anyway, I will say the Edina public school principal came, after Ian died, and he did say we really dropped the ball on Ian. 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 AS: Wow.  SS: Must have read my note.  AS: Must have gone back through the file. 19 SS: Because I said he is going to crash and burn.  If you guys don’t help him, he’s going to crash and burn. 13 I’m here to be his advocate and I’m mad at all of you basically. 7, 10, 11 I was trying to—they all really tried to pull for Nick at least. 9, 10, 16 Too much story. 9, 18 I was just adjusting my glasses. 9, 12 SS: So, Nick, he’s doing his best to hold it together during high school. 8, 9, 20 He hung out with his friends he had always hung out with forever, maybe socialized a little less. 9, 12, 16, 17, 18 Wasn’t particularly wild, and graduated. 8, 17, 18 Which I am highly thankful that he graduated. 8, 13 After he graduated he was going to go to Normandale [Community College] and he just kind of—he graduated in 2010. 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 My mother got sicker, he got left alone more because Steve didn’t come up much and I had to leave. 6, 13, 18, 19 Jessica was around more because after Ian died her engagement—she couldn’t. 8 She ran off the rails for a little bit and did some wild and crazy things. 7, 16, 17 Not with drugs. 14 I told her she should just come home and get her feet on the ground. 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 She moved home. 8, 19 She was fed up that Nick wasn’t really headed anywhere, doing anything.  She and I were having a hard time being two head women in the same house. 6, 9, 11, 18 My mother was closer to death, things are complicated there, Steve was all la-di-da and in love. 10, 13, 16 Trying to keep the job, going back and forth to New Hampshire. 12, 19 Eventually my mother died in September of 2010.  She died the year after Ian. 20 It was just that year in between. 9, 12, 20 I couldn’t get the house sold immediately, so I had the people that were taking care of her live in the house. 6, 7, 9, 20 I flew back out the next spring to get the house ready and sold the house and moved everything out. 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 20 Somewhere in there Nick decided to go through his heavy duty party era. 6, 12 Then he was having problems with a girl that he was in love with. 13 He made suicidal threats. 16 I had him placed. 11 I had arrangements that nobody was to pick him up. 7 Nobody was to pick him up.  That girlfriend picked him up. 12 I said, “Well, you can’t come here.” 13, 19 The agreement was he was going to go to treatment because he was having issues too, not with heroin but with other things. 9, 14, 15, 16 They went to her father’s house who was an abusive freak. 5, 6, 9, 11 Nick says I don’t know if he pulled a gun at her or something and they showed up at my house at 3 o’clock in the morning. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15 You let them in. 19 Then, they stayed with me but the partying started to get out of control. 5, 6, 9, 11, 17 I thought, “I can’t deal with this.” 11, 12, 13 I told Nick—she left him, then he was really bad. 20 I had to place him again. 11 Then he came home, and now I am starting to become a little knowledgeable. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 I said, “Here is the situation. 13 You can live here but you have to be in therapy and you have to have a job.”  He complied with those things and things were doing better. 16 I’m trying to think what the trigger was. 16 I could tell that he had a lot of mental health struggles. 9, 14, 17 He had been to psychiatrists. 9 He started at Normandale. 9, 11 His first English assingment was writing about his family and he ended up writing about Ian dying, and it was about the third anniversary of Ian’s death and he starts spinning out of control. 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 20 Luckily I’ve got little connections, but one of Nick’s friends from elementary school told his mother there was a post on Facebook I don’t feel comfortable about. 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20 That Nick is downing a bottle of vodka and taking 6 Xanaxs and saying, “F it if I die tonight.” 11, 17, 19 So his mother, “Star, this is Mary Lou.  Don’t say where you heard this from, but there is a post on Facebook. 9, 15 I am sending you the screenshot.” 12, 15 I called the police without even telling Nicholas and I had him placed again. 7, 11, 15 They took him to Fairview Southdale this time.  That doctor said, “Your mom has placed you. 11, 15 This is the third time. 20 It is obvious that you have struggles. 9 You can decide to go to rehab or I will place you some more. 11 You need some help.” 13 “I think it is time for me to go to rehab, mom.” 15, 19 He said, “Could it just be somewhere warm?” 9, 12 And I said, “Absolutely.”  It was January.  So I sent him to Palm Springs, Michael’s house. 6, 7, 9 With the big bad boys. 8 It was an eye opener for him I guess. 10, 16, 17 I mean—but he retained much of what he learned from there. 12, 16, 17, 18 He came back and he physically couldn’t make it to meetings. 7, 13, 16, 19 I’ve come to realize over the years that he has intense social anxiety. 13, 14, 15, 19, 20 I don’t know whether it started—I think he had it even before Ian died, but after Ian died it got really bad. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 AS: Well he had Ian, right? 14 SS: Right, the larger than life… 11 AS: To be the social—to be the leader.  He could be in the background. 8, 19 SS: Quite a few of his girlfriends were hand me downs. 12, 18 [laughter]  AS: Of Ian’s?  SS: Yes.  So, I thought as long as he keeps a good relationship with his therapist and he goes. 6, 9, 11, 12 He had a crappy job.  I made him get a job after school failed. 8, 16 That’s when I said you got to have a job and stay with your therapist. 6, 9 He got a full-time job. 11 It was a crappy job but he was a hard worker. 11 That took almost all the party out of him. 6, 9 It is amazing what a full-time job, how much party that will take out of you. 6, 11, 15, 18 I am really realizing that.  At least he did keep the job and go to therapy. 9, 12 He did take to heart a lot of the things I think from treatment. 6, 9, 16, 17 They sent him home with pretty heavy duty meds. 7, 18, 19 He said, “They make me feel terrible.” 15, 16 That is where we reached the agreement. 13 He said, “I would like to do a ninety day agreement with you. 10, 19 I would like to get myself off these meds and see if I can’t maintain with pot the same way that these meds are.” 10, 16 And they were nasty meds. 9 I said, “All right. 14 I’ll give you ninety days.” 6, 19 I mean really, I have less fear of that than of the other stuff he was taking. 9, 16 They are potent things he was taking. 15, 16 He has done really well with finding herbal things to— AS: Does he get it medically? 7, 14, 16 SS: You can’t get it medically in Minnesota until July 1st. 7, 9, 14 It has been legal for a certain number of things. 16 Now on July 1st it has some added benefits. 9, 14 Except anxiety is still not one. 9 You can in other legal states. 9, 19 When it comes down to that fine of a line as a mother are you really going to say, I’m not afraid when Nick smokes at night if he is going to wake up tomorrow morning. 6, 13, 14, 19 I wouldn’t necessarily feel that good if he had pills in his possession that he could—you can’t abuse pot to the point of death. 9, 16 He could take his medications to the point of death. 6, 10 That is the way I look at it. 16 AS: Because you had suicide issues with him before. 14, 15 SS: Yes.  Yes.  That’s why I felt this was the better option for us. 17 AS: How is that for you as a mom? 15 SS: It is a little conflicting but it is getting less and less so.  Society seems to be changing and especially my friends with children that are addicted. 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 Most of them are all, “If they can survive with pot and not go back to anything else it wouldn’t hurt me.” 19 AS: Right.  Because you aren’t dealing with death. 13 SS: And it’s not like alcohol. 10 It’s not like an alcoholic. 5, 10 It’s not like you are abusing your body so bad your organs are going to shut down. 9 Anyway, Nick works very hard. 11, 14, 16 He got a better job.  He shows up, he has kept it for over two years. 20 He has benefits, vacation, a 401 k, his own business on the side where he makes e-fluid for people that use electronic cigarettes. 9, 10, 14, 16 It is really good.  He is like, “The FDA gets into my business whatever I’m doing. 9, 10 Now the FDA wants to regulate what you put in the e-cigs. 10, 11, 13 Just because the tobacco companies are upset and they want—they are feeling the pinch so they want to put us private guys out of business so they get all the business. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19 It has nothing to do with the safety for consumers.”  He has chronic back pain and he has found a controversial herb that helps with that chronic back pain, it is legal in Minnesota, but now they are trying to make it illegal in other states. 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 He thinks that that’s creeping in—he thinks big pharmaceuticals are creeping in on that too! 8 He says it is kind of like an herbal form of suboxone. 16, 17 But it will relieve his back pain when it gets really bad.  He is a Bernie Sanders fan, he is very upset about— AS: A lot of things right now! 14, 16, 17, 19 SS: Yeah but this is the first time I have ever heard him sit and listen to the debates. 9, 13, 15, 17 He has outside passions.  He has got friends that are screwing up. 12, 18 He sees people that are—he is trying to talk to people about, you know— AS: Addiction? 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 SS: Yes.  He’ll come talk to me because for a while he was drinking. 6, 10, 13, 14, 19 Not everyday, not horrible, but enough to bother me. 17, 19, 20 He is an adult, so I was just watching it for a little bit. 9, 12 Then he said, “I tried drinking for a while. 6, 10, 14 It does nothing more than lock you down into the basement.  Nope, not going to go that way.” 16 I said, “Well, I was thinking that in mind, but I figured it wouldn’t do me as much good to tell you than for you to figure that out for yourself.” 12, 13, 18 He goes, “Mom, I did figure that out.” 13 So, you know, it is around every now and then he’ll decide to have one but it’s not like— AS: How old is he now? 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20 AS: Tell me about the Narcan before we get too exhausted. 9 Tell me how you got involved in advocacy.  SS: I went and was just looking at that when you came in. 9, 12, 19 In my memories on Facebook today was the TPT—the local public broadcasting did a thing on heroin. 9, 19 AS: How long ago?  [pause] 9 SS: Four years ago today I went to do this Heroin at Home program. 19, 20 Here’s how it all started. 9, 11 AS: Send me that, too. 12 If you would, please.  Oh you met Maria [unclear]. 5 SS: Her son died one year after Ian. 20 How did I meet her? 13 Half of Ian’s friends, or a portion of Ian’s friends and Tony’s friends crossed over. 12, 18 Her son and my son’s friends were friends. 12, 18 I don’t know if I met her just because Tony died. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I think that is how I met her. 5 Or maybe she was at that. 9 Anyway, somehow I met Maria. 5, 16 Maria had a guy from Fox  News looking to do a story on someone who had lost a child to heroin. 9 She asked if she could give them my number. 6, 10 They came out and they did a story. 9, 19 It was a very touching story on heroin slipping into the suburbs. 9, 15 Then she connected me with Mary Kay [Barstrow] who headed up the opioid coalition. 9, 18 And she is the one that invited me to this.  Heroin at Home.  I went down and I had met a few more people at that. 5 Then I got referred to Lexi, and met with Lexi. 5, 12 That is when we started formulating the plan for going to the capital. 9, 11, 17 For Steve’s Law.  There were four of us meeting at the Dunn Brothers coffee AS: Right. 13 And I got in on those emails.  I never could quite make it to those. 15, 16 SS: We met reguarly and then we went to the capital. 5 It wasn’t that long ago.  My memory was the law passing and pictures of us at the capital.  Yeah that was two years ago, last spring, like in March. 9, 20 SS: That was probably one of the most memorable projects I ever worked on in my entire life. 11 Just to throw this into my story: I lost Steve at the beginning of 2009, I lost Ian in the middle of 2009, I lost my mom in 2010, and I lost my job in 2011 because the last trip to my mother’s they just decided I had missed too much work. 8, 9, 12, 15, 18 Even though I filed all the appropriate, union approved paperwork, I didn’t ever not show up, I got all my absences approved.  I walked into work one day and they turned to me like I had come in on drugs. 13, 14, 17, 19 AS: I’m sorry. 10 SS: We fought it.  I said, “Isn’t that something where you would get a warning or a verbal warning and then a written warning prior to termination? 15, 19 I didn’t injure anybody or hurt anybody.  Have I ever had any complaints?  Have I ever been counseled ever in twenty-one or two years of employment here?” 20 They were like, “Fight it if you want!” 10, 13 I did and we reached a settlement. 13, 17 And I retired. 12, 19 It was a lot. 17 During the time while we were fighting that, I almost lost my house, I learned where the food shelf was for me and Nick. 6, 9, 12, 17 Nick was probably struggling. 9 There were times when I thought, “I don’t know if I can handle this anymore.” 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 I started with a therapist, sometimes twice a week. 5, 6, 9, 11, 18 AS: And you got through it.  You are a strong woman. 9 SS: Sometimes I ask, “Why such a challenging life?” 5, 11, 18 But then I also say, “I have been blessed to know the most awesome people.” 13, 14, 15 I guess with difficulty comes reward. 10, 13, 19, 20 The Narcan started because of that police officer saying, “I don’t have Narcan.” 7, 9, 11 That was the big push for me. 8 And I really, even more, I saw how they were trying to treat Nick, the more I have become. 13, 15, 16, 19 I have had to come off some medications myself that are really horrible to come off of. 10, 13, 17, 19 They are really [unclear].  AS: When you say how they treated Nick what do you mean specifically? 7, 16 SS: They had him on drugs that you had to sign releases, that it could cause it permanent damage for taking them. 9, 14 AS: These are just anti depressants and stuff? 9, 12 SS: Yes.  Did you know that there are some of them that can cause you lifelong side effects? 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 AS: Like lithium?  SS: Like Zyprexa.  And those booster ones. 9 It can cause tardive dyskinesia where you just can’t sit still. 9, 12, 13 It can even be when you will be like yelling out and— AS: Turrets type stuff? 9, 15 No, I didn’t know that. 13, 14, 15 You start the advocacy work and what is that doing? 9, 11 SS: I see— AS: Both of your sons you are doing this for.  SS: Yes.  And I know how bad it hurt and continues to hurt to have lost Ian. 9, 13, 14, 15 And I didn’t want any other mothers to have to go through that. 13 I wonder if that police officer had had the antidote or if I had had the antidote would Ian have had a chance? 7 He might have had a chance.  I mention that in the most recent—did you see the most recent news story I did? 6, 9, 13 AS: No, I don’t think so.  Kare 11 did a special.  AS: Oh, yeah I saw those KARE 11 stories. 9, 10, 18 SS: At the end they said, “So you think if that policeman had had Narcan that night?” 7, 12, 19 And I said, “Well at least he would have had a chance.” 9 A cool thing: one of the boys that is on Suboxone but doing okay, I gave him a kit to have because I know he is around a lot of people. 8, 13, 14, 15, 17 He sent me a note back one day, saying, “That kit that I got from Star Selleck and I used it on somebody and I saved their life. 7, 9, 11, 19 They are in treatment now. 9, 14, 16 Just wanted to let you know.” 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: You go around—tell me what you have done. 8 With what Steve Rummler has, the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation.  I became what they called a ‘train the trainer.’ 5, 7, 19 Like, the doctor that is currently overseeing the medical part, Dr. Satterly. 14, 16 I sat under his teaching so that he could teach everything he wanted taught in a class so then I am deemed able to teach class for Steve Rummler. 12, 13, 20 When asked, I will teach a class for them. 10, 20 I usually have been able to keep small amounts of naloxone here at the house. 6, 9, 10, 12, 18 However, now the drug companies decided they gave out all these samples. 12, 14 Now they’ve like quadrupled the price of it and won’t give more samples out. 6, 10, 14 During the time where we had those extras, if there was a panic, an emergency—a parent that was just finding out—I mean I had people come to my house, all different times, just hurting mothers, not people I was scared of, that I would teach them and send them onto mom’s groups. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 I have two state Facebook groups that I participate in, and I’ve had trainings for both of those. 9 I used to do it for the Addict’s Mom but that kind of fell apart. 9, 15, 16, 17, 20 But they know about the other groups, most of them do. 13, 14, 15 AS: Your training is to train people how to use naloxone in a situation where there is an overdose, right? 9, 13, 14, 15 How many people do you think you have trained?  Do you have any guess? 10 SS: Mine’s not as much in numbers than it is in emergency. 7, 18 I have done— AS: You mean helping people in an emergency? 7, 13, 16 SS: Doing emergency training for panicked parents at all hours of the day and night. 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 19 AS: Oh, more informal, word of mouth. 17 SS: Emergently available.  I did do St. Paul Sober Living, Pride Institute. 6, 9 These are people that asked us to come in and do the training. 10, 13, 19 The Pride Institute—the rehab is, too? 6, 9, 19 Whatever it is, I went there to teach their staff. 9 Same with St. Paul Sober Living staff. 9 I’ve done a couple at the Lunds and Byerlys open to the public. 17 I have done one with a group of women in Duluth, mom’s in Duluth. 15, 18 I have done one with moms down here and ones at my house. 6, 9, 15, 18 AS: Just wherever and whenever. 9, 15 SS: I have given out kits to people that I thought were in highly vulnerable situations. 6, 8, 11, 12, 13 Like that one boy who took the time to write back. 19 Most people the word gets out that if you are in a jam, or they hear somebody asking they will say, “Star Selleck, can you help this person?” 13 So they will show up in my little thing— AS: On Facebook?  SS: Yes.  And I will make contact with the individual. 10, 16 AS: Thank you.  SS: I just don’t want to keep—it feels like too little too late. 9, 12, 13, 16 AS: How do you feel as a mom now? 14, 15, 16 SS: [laughter]  I realize how ignorant I was at the time that Ian started. 7, 9, 11, 14 I didn’t realize how serious it was. 14 I looked and thought it was more that because he was that personality type, he was going to have a lot harder time. 11, 12, 16, 17 He had to try everything. 16 I remember talking to him about drugs and pot and alcohol when he was young because you had to talk to Ian about everything way ahead of everybody else. 10, 14, 16 He said, “Mom, did you ever try pot?” 16 At let’s just say eight or nine. 9, 12, 19 I thought, “Ian is the type of kid you cannot lie to because he will figure out a way.” 11, 12, 13, 16 I said, “You know Ian, I did try it in college. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 Then I realized the type of major I had and what I was going to do in life, that I couldn’t really keep that up. 11, 12, 14, 18 I couldn’t be serious about studying or doing anything with my life and do that, too. 9, 11 So, yeah, I tried it. 10 I actually, a couple of times, ended up in a dangerous situation where I could have died. 10, 12, 13, 18 It’s a good thing I didn’t.  My roommate and I drove the wrong way down a one way street. 7, 9, 14, 16 So, I’m trying to pass on to you mistakes that I made because I don’t want the same mistakes to happen to you. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 Because you just never know what could happen.” 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 He said to me at this young age, “I don’t think that is the way it works. 14, 16 I think each generation has to work it out for themselves.”  I thought, “Nobody gets a child like Ian to parent.” 10, 11, 12, 16 He just stopped me cold there. 9, 10, 12, 20 I had to look these all up for Channel 11.  Here’s the wedding with Jessica.  This was one of our very first meetings when we were getting the whole Steve’s Law thing off the ground. 8, 9, 13 [pause and look at photos] 9 It never got to the point where he ruined other people’s lives. 15 I don’t have to see him rot in jail.  He didn’t kill anybody else’s kid. 7 There are things worse than death that I can think of to live with. 16 That sounds weird, but it’s true. 10, 16 It would haunt me day and night to know if he were going to get locked up for good. 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Or if he had drove and killed someone SS: 7, 14 Or if he had sold an overdose to someone. 15, 20 Not that he wasn’t dealing that I’m aware of but he could have. 13 AS: We know what the road is. 9, 13, 14, 15 SS: Now, in retrospect, I can see how it could have wound up worse than it did with him ravaging or damaging other lives too.  And a lot of kids use Ian for a reference point. 9, 17 A lot of kids have told me Ian taught them so many valuable lessons, not by his overdose, but by the way he lived life. 11, 15, 16, 17, 20 To look out for the underdog. 10 To always look for the joy in life. 11, 16, 17 To always listen to your friends’ problems. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 To always be there for other people no matter what. 16, 17, 20 To never think that anybody is more important than you, and to never think you aren’t important enough to fit in with anybody else. 14, 15, 20 He could talk to college professors and he could talk to the guy that was homeless on [Lake] Calhoun and they would both enjoy his company. 8, 10, 19 AS: Do you think he learned that from you in some way? 12, 16, 17 SS: No one ever asked me that before. 10 I mean, probably. 16 Out of the family, probably. 18 AS: You are easy to talk to. 10 You seem like you would talk to anyone. 10, 19 SS: You’re right. 14 I don’t say this to my kids, but Ian was the kid I related to the easiest. 9 He’s the one I understood the most. 9 It was very difficult to lose him. 20 The others, like I say, not that way. 16 Nick has a big heart. 8 I see his big heart. 8 I see him growing more that way. 16, 17 He’s very kind, he tries to help people that need help. 13, 16, 17 He says after the third or fourth time when they do stupid stuff 9, 20 I have to learn to distance myself because I want to go someplace. 9, 11, 12, 13 I don’t want to be dragged down with people who don’t want anything good for themselves. 13, 14 I am being choosy about the top five friends. 12, 18 They have to want something out of life. 11, 13 AS: He’s maturing.  He’s growing up. 17 So, am I going to have a cow over the pot?  Nah.  Would I rather him do that than drink a lot? 6, 13, 14, 17 AS: And you’re not his savior.  SS: And I’m not going to sit there in judgement. 13 In reality, if I had to compare alcohol and pot I think pot is probably less dangerous than alcohol. 18 You are letting your child live his own life. 11, 19 SS: Even though he lives in my house. 6, 9 But we have a respectful relationship.  Open and honest relationship. 9 There aren’t any secrets that I’m aware of.  I’m not stupid enough to think—but he makes it up on his own to work. 9, 16, 20 You said she got As on heroin.  But I really don’t think he is on heroin.  AS: There is no comparison.  SS: Right, but now I’m sitting here thinking could I be majorly fooled? 13, 14, 18 I don’t think so.  That was not ever Nicholas’s drug of choice. 14, 17 AS: I can’t imagine after losing his brother that would—that seems— SS: 5, 14, 16, 19 He had a Xanax addiction.  SS: Did.

"23","Johnson_Dean","Kathie Simon Frank Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 15, 2017 7 At the Home of Amy Sullivan Minneapolis Minnesota Kathie Simon Frank -KSF Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan, it’s a beautiful sunny morning, March 15th. 6, 7 We’re at my house in Minneapolis interviewing Kathie Simon Frank. 6, 7, 9 Kathie do you give me permission to record this interview? 6 KSF:  Yes, I give you permission Amy. 6 AS: Thank you.  Let’s just get started with your early life. 9, 11, 12 Whatever you feel like sharing. 16 KSF:  My parents, my mom was twenty-nine and my dad was twenty-six when they got married. 10, 15, 16 I was born when my mom was twenty-nine in 1942 in Berkeley, California. 15 My dad was working on a project; he’d gotten his PhD. 15 My mom had a master’s in political science and I don’t know if she was working. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 We lived in Berkeley.  My grandmother lived in San Andrea which was by Oakland south of Berkeley. 7, 8, 14 My mom had family in that area. 15, 18 Six months after I was born my dad got a job at Illinois Institute of Technology and they moved to Chicago. 8, 9 AS: Was he in science?  KSF:  That’s a hard question to answer. 6, 9, 11 He has his PhD in political science but he was at the University of Chicago and he never really considered himself a political scientist. 9, 12, 13, 15 He worked in city management and things like that. 16, 20 He kind of worked in political science but was really interested in problem solving and decision making kinds of things. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 Eventually in his long life, he lived to be eighty-six, he taught first in a graduate school of Industrial Education at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh where I moved when I was seven. 8, 9, 10, 11 Then he had an appointment jointly in psychology because he was doing cognitive psychology and computer science. 10 He did a lot of work with the early creation of artificial intelligence. 17 You can look him up his name is Herbert Simon. 6 He played a really big part in my life because my mom, and this is relevant, was really wanting a boy. 8, 11, 13, 15 She was the oldest of two girls and was very close with her younger sister. 5, 8, 9, 14, 20 She’d grown up in the Bay Area. 17 She wanted a boy she had decided. 12, 13 I wasn’t a boy.  She was quite disappointed actually which I learned because there was a letter in my baby book which she had written to my great aunt, her aunt, it said that. 5, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19 After her initial disappointment with not having a boy...  Then my next sibling is a brother named Peter. 5, 6 Exactly two years younger and then exactly two years after that my sister Barbara was born. 5, 9, 10, 14, 20 It was always clear to me that Peter was favored because he was the boy my mom wanted. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 My sister was favored because she had red hair like my mom. 5, 9, 12, 15 Beautiful, beautiful bright orange hair, which of course she hated. 6, 7, 12, 14 My mom loved it because it was kind of like her hair. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 I was close to my dad.  I always had quite a troubled relationship with my mother. 16, 17 She was extraordinarily critical and she was a mom who liked things to go the way she wanted them to go. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 She was a very positive woman, very creative, very talented. 13, 14 She did a lot of sewing and tailoring and was highly accomplished in what she did. 8, 17 She did not work when I was growing up. 17 In those days people didn’t. 19 I say I was born in 1942?  AS: Yes.  KSF:  It was always very difficult but my father always came to my defense. 5, 16, 17, 19, 20 I could always count on him. 16, 17 My brother as it turns out had some kind of issues. 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 I’m not sure if that was ever diagnosed as a child but he was extraordinarily defiant and really difficult, very, very bright. 8, 14, 15, 20 Like he had read millions of classics by the time he was ten years old which I hadn’t even heard of. 15, 20 He also was extraordinarily jealous of me because I got along really well in school and didn’t have these issues. 8, 14, 15 We did not ever really have a good relationship because he had decided that our chemistry was wrong or something. 9, 12, 16 I could never figure it out so I could never do anything to make it better. 13, 15, 16 In that sense our home was quite dysfunctional because Peter was always an issue. 15, 16, 17, 19 Like in families where there is an alcoholic that person becomes the focus. 5, 13, 15, 19 Peter was the focus. 15 My parents did the best they could. 9, 10, 16 My brother as he got older, I was his target. 5, 20 He beat me up a lot. 17 He was a lot bigger than me. 8, 17 I was often in physical danger. 12, 15 He wouldn’t beat me pulpy but I always had bruises on my shins from being kicked and on my arms from being punched. 16, 17 Christmas 9 Eve was always a horrible time in our house because Peter with the increased sort of tension of everybody focusing on Christmas Peter would act out more and more. 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 There was always a crisis on Christmas Eve. 9, 16, 17 I’ve gotten over now but it took me a number of my adult years to not be really apprehensive on Christmas Eve that something horrible was going to happen. 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20 My sister was four years younger. 5, 9, 14, 20 The fact that my mother was sort of in the middle trying to legislate relationships, always triangulating, made it really difficult for me to ever really get to know my younger sister. 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 It wasn’t until my parents were in their, I guess my mom was just turning eighty, and they decided to give up their big old house in Pittsburgh where they had lived for fifty-some years. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 My sister and I went to help them clean out their house and move to their condo. 5, 6, 9, 13 We were left together a lot and we just had the most wonderful time. 9, 12, 17 We found out how much alike we are. 18 We could just laugh about things. 9, 12, 16 It was wonderful and we’ve continued to be close. 18 That was in the mid-90s.  My brother, I had little touches of him. 5, 15 Let me jump back. 19 When he was twelve or so, maybe eleven, physically he was getting bigger and he being his violent self and taking it out on me. 7, 8, 9, 15 My parents would try the best they could to keep him from hurting me. 9, 10, 12, 16 They finally decided they were getting some psychological help for him and for themselves. 12, 13 They eventually decided that Peter should go to a residential treatment program. 9, 12, 15, 16 He went to Connecticut from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Madison, Connecticut to a treatment school where he was all year round except for four two week periods spread evenly throughout the year. 8, 9, 15, 16, 20 He got very sophisticated. 9, 10 He would come home at the age of sixteen or seventeen smoking a pipe and wearing a tweed jacket. 13, 19 He was tall, way taller than I was. 16 He had these kind of sophisticated airs. 9, 10, 16, 17 I hardly ever saw him. 11 These visits home were not particularly easy because instead of being physically violent towards me he was verbally violent towards me. 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 They still weren’t pleasant and I couldn’t really develop a relationship with him. 9, 16 At least I wasn’t getting beat up anymore. 9, 13 Then he disappeared. 12 He ran away from the school when he was about seventeen. 7, 8, 16 No one knew where he was. 6, 12 He was just gone. 9, 12, 19 That was a difficult year for my dad. 20 I remember there was some other stuff going on in my dad’s life at the time. 9, 11 I remember him sitting in a chair. 12, 13 Even though Peter wasn’t present he was still a huge presence in our lives by being absent. 7, 9 As an adult learning what was going on at the time when he finally reappeared. 12 He actually showed up in Malibu, California having gone for help to some friends that were many yearlong friends of my parents whom we had grown up. 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20 We knew their family very well. 6, 12, 18 Peter had found them.  They lived in Los Angeles.  They befriended him and notified my parents. 10, 12, 16 Eventually Peter went back to school for another year. 8, 19, 20 There really wasn’t a time in my life for any extended period where my relationship with Peter was very good. 11, 12, 15 I considered him the addict in my family. 12, 18 Although my dad in some ways had an addiction to work. 16, 17 A workaholic.  It was very clear that his order of preference of his focus was his work, my mom, and then us. 15 More me because to talk to my brother and sister now they don’t really know my dad the way I knew him. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Our views of our parents are totally opposite. 10, 13, 16, 17 They’ll talk about my mom and I’ll think to myself, “I don’t know who they’re talking about.” 10, 13, 14, 15 They don’t know my dad the same way I do which is interesting. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 We were all growing up in the same house. 6, 9, 17 I remember once when my dad took me to visit a couple of colleges when I was in high school. 8, 12, 13 I said once to my dad, “How come Peter is so different from me? 13, 16, 17, 19 We were all raised in the same family.” 5, 18 My dad said, “As parents you have one chance with each child and you do the best you can.” 9, 10, 16 That I thought was great wisdom. 11, 12 That stuck with me. 9 You do the best you can. 9 As a parent I’ve realized it isn’t just what I do with my children it’s who they are as well. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 I have some influence but they color where I start. 9, 11, 20 That’s addiction in our family. 18 My parents hardly drank at all. 7, 10, 11, 14, 16 They didn’t really say anything about it.  They’d have parties and they’d pour a little bit of wine.  I don’t know maybe there was a couple bottles of alcohol in our house. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17 My dad I don’t remember ever seeing him drink. 6, 14 My mom would have beer. 15 My mom smoked also. 15, 17 Actually both my parents but my mom really smoked. 10, 15, 16, 17 My mom developed sort of an addict’s way of dealing with it. 13, 15, 16, 17 She would smoke a cigarette under the vent in the kitchen with the fan going so all the smoke was taken out of the house. 6, 9 This was before smoking bans.  She would empty the ash tray in the garbage outside and come back in and wash the ashtray. 13, 19 AS: She didn’t want the house to smell like it. 6, 9, 13 KSF:  I don’t think she wanted any evidence that she had been smoking. 12, 13 It was kind of the denial that she was smoking even though she was smoking. 15, 16, 17 A friend of hers died of emphysema. 12 That was my mom’s wakeup call. 7, 15 This was way after I was out of the house. 6, 9, 16 When she gave up smoking she’d been an incredible letter writer. 12, 19 She would write a letter to the family once a week. 18, 19 She would send copies of that with little notes attached to each individual. 12 These went to my great-aunts who she was very close to and her mom and me. 11, 15 Barbara was still living there. 5, 6, 9 I don’t know exactly who all was getting them. 10, 13, 14, 15 Her mom and her sister and me for sure. 5, 9, 15 When she stopped smoking that was a trigger for her. 9, 10, 20 She apparently would sit down to type at the typewriter and then light up a cigarette. 10, 13, 16, 18 When she wasn’t lighting up a cigarette she wasn’t writing these letters. 19 That was a loss.  You think that things change when somebody gives up an addiction. 6, 16 My mom sort of drank beer in the same way. 7, 14, 15, 16, 17 She’d have a beer before dinner and then she’d wash the glass and put the glass away. 10, 16 It was like there was no evidence that this was happening. 12, 13 She really wasn’t an alcoholic. 5 She had one beer.  I don’t ever remember seeing my parents drunk or even high on anything. 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16 My dad very disciplined person. 6 He developed an ear ache. 16 He had been smoking a pipe and occasionally a cigar.  He one day decided that the ear ache had something to do with, after seeing doctors, the ear ache had something to do with smoking. 12, 19 He gave up smoking and his ear ache went away. 16 He never smoked again. 15, 17 That was years before my mom stopped. 9, 10, 15, 20 That’s kind of our history of addiction. 9, 16, 17 My sister doesn’t have any addiction that I’m aware of. 5, 9 Mine if I can identify it is probably chocolate and paper.  AS: You mean like fancy paper? 16 KSF: Like accumulations of paper.  It’s hard for me to get rid of paper. 11 If those are two things I really don’t have a lot of control over and continue to be issues in my life. 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: Talk about your early adult life and parenting and your kids. 10, 11, 16 KSF:  In terms of growing up and the sort of people in our house. 6, 9, 17 We lived in a big old house in Pittsburgh where we moved when I was seven. 6, 8, 9, 20 My brother was away at school. 5, 8, 16 There was just me and my little sister. 5, 9, 12 When I graduated from high school my mom and dad went to Santa Monica. 8, 15 My dad worked summers for the Ram corporation.  He went out that year and Barbara went with them as she was like a sophomore. 5, 8, 20 Really dreaded going back to school, the school I had gone to in Pittsburgh. 8, 14, 19 It was a public high school but in our neighborhood, a good school. 8 For some reason Barbara dreaded it. 5, 14 She ended up going to a private school in Lenox, Massachusetts. 8, 9, 12, 14, 17 I kind of in a certain way grew up as an only child with this noise from my brother whether he was at home or away at school and with this little sister who was totally annoying. 5, 8, 9, 16, 17, 19 Little sisters are always annoying. 5, 9, 16, 17 Once I graduated from high school when I went home often she wasn’t even there because she was off at school and Peter was off at school or wherever he was once he graduated from high school. 8, 12, 15, 19 That was kind of my upbringing. 16, 17 My grandparents lived one grandma in California and one grandma in Milwaukee. 7, 10, 16 We didn’t see them more than two or three times a year because we had to travel. 18, 20 We didn’t have any extended family in Pittsburgh. 12, 15, 18 I do know, this is relevant, that I was really aware in high school that our family was somewhat different. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 We were an academic family; we were Jewish but not really practicing Jews. 10, 18 We lived in a Jewish neighborhood and so the rule was that I could stay home from school on Jewish holidays if I went to synagogue but I couldn’t if I didn’t. 8, 9, 12, 19 My Jewish friends were all staying home from school and not going to synagogue. 8, 9, 12, 18, 19 There was always this kind of identity thing that was always a little weird. 16, 17 I always identified as a Jew but we weren’t practicing until in high school I did go to Sunday School. 8, 10, 16, 17, 19 From sixth grade on I went to a Sunday School at the temple that was near us. 19, 20 My parents really didn’t participate in that community very much at all. 10, 16, 18 We were different in that way. 16, 17 My parent’s values were; my parents were very green before that was even a known entity. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 They were very, very interested in nature and the outdoors. 9, 11, 19 My mother was a recycler before that was an issue. 15 She cooked really healthy meals, a lot of wheat germ and natural grains and vegetables and not much sugar. 14, 17, 18 That was sort of a point of teasing. 17 My mother had what we called a cookbook lady which was Adele Davis: 7 Cook Right to Eat Fit.  I hated her because even in the chocolate chip cookies which my mother would make had to throw wheat germ in it. 12, 15, 16 That was kind of my parents. 10, 16, 17 We were different in that way and in terms of how we spent our money. 16, 17, 19 I was kind of challenged a lot by friends, the friends I went to school with, about why we were doing this differently. 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 My parents were devoted, not devoted, they really truly deeply believed, they had values that they really stood by. 9, 10, 16 I understood those values and respected them as well and adopted them. 8, 9 It was awkward to kind of defend myself. 12, 16, 17 On the other hand, I felt I had the backing of my parents. 10, 16, 17, 19 In that sense I kind of felt different but I did have a good group of friends that we were very close, did a lot of things together. 12, 16, 17, 18 I’ve remained friends with many of them. 12, 18 We’re not in touch a lot but when we get together it’s like there’s no time that’s passed. 17 They’re really good friends. 12, 18 Then I went to the University of Michigan because my dad being a college professor. 8, 13 My dad was a college professor and taught lots of graduate students. 5, 8, 9, 14, 17 He had really small groups of students that he knew and they were all doing interesting research and they were often at our house. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 19 I would hear them talking. 10 I went to the University of Michigan because I couldn’t imagine not going to a big school. 8, 13, 14 I had been at a big high school my high school class was almost six hundred people, students in my class. 8, 9, 14, 20 I went to the University of Michigan, what a shock because here I was one of a thousand in my freshman psychology class and one of five hundred in my freshman geology class. 13, 20 I hated it. 12 I really hated it. 12 I couldn’t understand what this college experience was. 8, 9, 12, 16 It wasn’t what I knew of as college. 6, 8, 12 I did okay my first year. 9, 20 At the end of that year I went to Santa Monica because that’s where my parents were that year. 10, 12, 16, 20 During the summer I spent a lot of time, I play the piano, I spent a lot of time walking down the street to Santa Monica Community College where I could find a practice room. 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 19 My parents didn’t have a piano in their rental that they had in Santa Monica. 8, 10, 16 I would go over there every day and play piano. 8, 19 I spent a lot of time on the beach. 17, 19 I really didn’t know anybody there. 13, 14, 15 At the end of the summer my mother sort of tentatively said, “So what are you planning for this fall?” 12, 15, 17 When I came home in June I wasn’t going to go back to Michigan but I hadn’t done anything to do anything differently over the summer. 16, 17, 19 I said, “I’m going back to Michigan.” 19 I had decided I would just take courses that I wanted to take. 6, 9, 12, 13 I was interested in communication and in language and psychology. 9, 10, 11, 13, 19 I thought I could take some sociology and things like that and I wouldn’t pay any attention to what the graduation requirements were. 6, 11, 12, 15, 16 I would just take classes 6, 8, 9, 12, 20 I liked and that would be more like what my dad was doing with his graduate students. 9, 10, 14, 18 In a certain sense I did that. 17 I paid attention to what I would have had to take if I were a sociology major for example or a linguistic major which were the two things I had thought of. 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18 I had a really good year. 20 I’d had a kind of difficult roommate arrangement when I was a freshman. 7, 16, 17, 20 It worked out fine and I made lots of friends but not with my roommate who had asked for a Christian roommate from the Midwest and she got a Jewish roommate from the East. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 That really made her very upset. 16, 17, 19 I didn’t care. 7 I didn’t care who I had as a roommate. 7 Being a Jew was a little bit unusual.  A lot of the people that I got to be friends with, one girl I remember from central Michigan told me I was the first Jewish person she ever knew. 6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 20 They found out maybe from me that Jewish people are like everybody else. 9 My friend Mary 12 Barrel who told me that, it was a compliment. 20 She hadn’t known any Jewish people but she was accepting me. 10, 13, 14, 15 It wasn’t a big deal but the next year I had a room by myself in the same dorm. 7, 8, 13, 20 You eliminated that stress. 9 I continued to have good friends. 12, 18 At the end of the year a friend of mine suggested that maybe I wanted to come to New York for the summer. 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 She knew someone who was looking for an assistant in a New York State Training School for girls. 6, 8, 9, 12 It kind of fit in with my interests. 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 I applied and was accepted.  My parents were okay with that. 10, 16 I went home briefly and then I went to New York and lived in this residence in the Lower East Side. 9, 19 I was an assistant to the girls who were in that program. 8, 9 They were sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, pretty much they were runaways. 11, 16, 17, 18 They were difficult kids because they kept running away but their home situations were really, really difficult and that’s why they were running away. 7, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20 I’m totally unaware, I don’t think there were any drugs involved. 14, 17 There was pot on campus at Michigan. 8 I was aware of that.  Things were really tame.  A few of my friends would spend the night with their boyfriends but life seemed, compared to now, so uncomplicated, so simple, so easy. 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19 These girls just needed a lot of love and a lot of attention. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17 Some of them were in school and some of them had jobs. 8 They lived at the residence and they had rules. 12 One of my jobs was, we had sort of a student council and I was the leader of the student council. 9, 11, 17 I did some activities with them. 10 I was responsible for being there to sign them in and sign them out in the evening. 15 I met a group of friends at Columbia through the friend who connected me to this job. 5, 12, 18 I spent a lot of my free time, this job was probably ten to twenty hours a week. 11, 17, 19 AS: Was it just a summer job? 9, 12 KSF:  It was just a summer job. 9, 12 Then because I had extra time I also got a job in the women’s prison that was down in Greenwich Village. 18 I was doing research for someone who was doing a research project on recidivism.  I was privy to the records of the women in jail, the idea being that if we checked out certain factors, like stability factors, how long had they lived in the previous residence, had they had a job. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18 A lot of these women had been picked up for prostitution and things like that. 9, 16, 17, 18 These were not violent crimes.  I don’t remember that there were drug related crimes either. 14 If they had a good rating on their stability measure then they were released on their own recognizance from this jail, awaiting trial. 9, 15 We would follow up and make sure that they showed up. 7, 12, 15, 16 If they didn’t there were big consequences to pay. 8, 16 It was a big study, national. 8, 9 I used to know the name but I can’t remember now. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15 I worked for them collecting data and making phone calls to previous landlords and things. 7, 8, 16 AS: To see how they had turned out? 19 KSF:  To find out so that we could decide whether they could be released on their own.  I did those two jobs during the summer.  I was nineteen years old around New York. 20 I developed these friendships with the three women that I knew from Michigan who were in New York for the summer. 6, 12, 16, 18 Then a group of boys from Columbia who were our same age. 8 We hung out with them at their apartment around Columbia on the Upper West Side. 9, 20 I fell in love with one of them. 13, 15 When I went back to Michigan that fall I made plans to then transfer. 7, 16, 19 I applied to the New School for Social Research.  From what I could see it looked a lot more like what I thought of as college based on what I knew from my dad. 6, 8, 11, 12, 17 I transferred in February after the end of fall semester I transferred to the New School. 7, 9, 12 I finished up there in June of ‘64 which is when I would have graduated. 8 I went to summer school one summer at Barnard. 8, 15 That worked out.  Very shortly after I moved back to New York I broke up with that boyfriend and met someone else, David Frank, who is Rachel’s dad and Matthew’s dad. 5, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19 We graduated and basically went to Pittsburgh and the next week got married. 7, 8, 11 I had just had my twenty second birthday. 9, 12, 19, 20 We were on our way to graduate school at Berkeley. 8, 16 AS: You both were going to grad school. 8 What was your undergrad in?  KSF:  My undergrad turned out to be in Sociology with kind of a minor in linguistics. 9, 16, 17, 19 The New School didn’t really have a lot of linguistics. 9, 17 It was at the New School; I’d been interested in pottery for a long time. 9, 11, 19 I’d also sewn all my life and made all my clothes in high school. 8, 11, 16, 17 I had lots of things that I loved to do with my hands. 5, 13, 16, 17 We went to Berkeley and I had applied to the graduate school in linguistics and was admitted. 8, 9 I had to take Latin and some other baby course my first semester. 5, 6, 9 When we first got out there it was June of ‘64. 9 I found that in the student union which was a few blocks from where we lived there was a wonderful pottery studio. 9 I started doing pottery over the summer and stopped when school started. 8, 9, 10, 11, 20 By that time, we are already very much involved in politics. 18 We were demonstrating against unfair hiring practices at Jack London Square in Oakland and in San Francisco. 7, 8, 9, 10 Then things developed and it’s a whole other long story which you may know parts of. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 The whole issue of whether or not we could solicit to get other people to come demonstrate with us on campus. 8, 9, 13, 15, 19 There were some very conservative people on the Board of Regents at Cal.  They made a big stink about our doing anything political on campus, it being a state school. 8, 9, 16 That escalated and became the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. 5, 19 All of that was going on and I was now transitioning from this wonderful summer of doing pottery to graduate school and baby Latin and I decided I wasn’t into school, I was into politics and pottery. 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 I dropped out fairly shortly after school started to do that. 8, 9, 11, 14, 16 My husband and I were very involved in the Free Speech Movement, not in the administrative part of it. 9, 15 Not in the leadership part of it but very dedicated to the cause. 9, 10 We were arrested with the other six hundred in Sproul Hall in the administration building. 9, 19 Then in January when we were having various meetings with our lawyers I got involved with helping out in the office of the lawyers. 13 Over the next six months or so was sharing a job, unpaid, with another person. 8 We were basically working for the lawyers focused on this case. 7, 9, 11, 15 We were doing some fundraising, writing a newsletter, keeping in touch with all the defendants, collecting things that needed to be collected, carrying things over to the courthouse. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 Those kinds of things. 16, 17 It was really a kind of gopher job. 16, 17 When Albert left, he was the person I was sharing the job with, I took that over and I was ultimately paid one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month to do this job. 8 We eventually closed that little tiny office and moved the file cabinet into my kitchen. 8, 10, 15 I did that job as long as I was in Berkeley.  David continued his PhD and finished in ‘67. 18 We were there for three years. 20 Did I say he was in mathematics?  KSF: I was doing that job and continuing to do pottery.  Then I was pregnant with Matthew.  At the point where David got a postdoc at Oxford University. 9, 13 We left Berkeley in May or June of ‘67 and went to England. 8 Matthew was born in August. 9 We were there for a year. 20 We came back in August of ‘68. 9, 19 We did a lot of travelling in Europe and that sort of thing. 17 For me it was a really, really good year. 20 I was home with Matthew and not having to do anything in particular but have lots of interests and read a lot and got to know some other new moms. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 I put Matthew in a backpack on my back and hiked around the footpaths and went to little neighboring villages with churches and stuff. 9, 10, 14, 19 Then David and I travelled a lot with Mathew too. 17 Then he got a job as an instructor at MIT. 9 We came back to Boston. 9, 19 We moved to Boston. 8, 9 Shortly after that, Matthew was one when we moved back. 8, 19 Then not too long after that I got pregnant with Rachel.  She was born the next summer in July of '69.  In that time, I knew that when we were in England that David wasn't really happen. 6, 8, 12 He's always been very quiet, very introspective. 16, 17 When we came back to Boston I'm not sure what his process was but he eventually decided that he didn't want to be married. 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 I was pregnant.  That was a little complicated. 10 We had an almost two-year-old. 9, 20 Matthew turned two about a month after Rachel was born. 8, 19 David was actually moved out and was gone a good portion of that year. 8, 10, 20 From probably Christmas until Rachel was born. 9 We saw each other.  He kind of came and went. 16, 17, 19 I wanted to be married to him still. 9, 12, 13 He was trying to sort whatever it was in his mind, trying to sort that out. 16, 17 AS: And you're pregnant and you have a toddler by yourself?  KSF: Yes.  Then Rachel was born in July and David did move back in for a little while during the summer and helped me with Rachel and Matthew. 13, 16, 19 Then he knew his instructorship was coming to an end and he had to find a job. 6, 9, 12 He started applying for jobs. 9, 11 I didn't know what was happening. 12, 13, 14, 15 I would see him but I didn't see him all the time.  He'd come over to spend time with Matthew, particularly Matthew. 12, 13, 18, 19 He was interested in Rachel too but less so because she was so tiny. 9, 11, 19 Eventually I was thinking, ""Find a nursery school for Matthew, he's going to be three. 8 What am I going to do with my life? 11 Am I going to keep this?"" 12 We lived in the bottom of a duplex.  ""Are we going to stay here? 9 Am I going to move somewhere else?""  I had to think about myself and these children. 14 David wasn't in our lives really.  He was looking for a job somewhere else.  We talked a little bit about that but one day he showed up and he had gotten an offer from Stony Brook. 7, 10, 11, 15, 19 I think I went with him on one of these job interviews. 6 I went with him to Penn State and thought, ""I don't want to live in this kind of place. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 There's no chance for me.  All these academic wives, everyone wants to do their professional thing and too much competition."" 11, 13, 18, 20 The one other option was the University of Utah. 13 I wasn't going to live in Salt Lake City.  That was later, those were later.  He applied to Stony Brook and he got this job.  He invited me to come down to visit with him to look at it. 12, 13, 19 I thought I was just coming along. 9, 11, 12 We were on friendly terms. 12 AS: You weren't divorced? 5 KSF:  We weren't divorced. 5 We had no arrangements. 7 We were still married but we were living in two different places. 6, 9, 11, 16, 17 He was very clear that he was doing his thing and I was being a mom to these babies. 15 I had a job doing some data analysis for some little company.  I'd get a pile of papers and go through them and process the data and take it back to them. 6, 19 All of a sudden one day he said something that sounded like he was assuming that I was going to come with him. 10, 13, 19 I said, ""I don't know about this."" 13, 14, 15 There was a several week period where he was surprised that I wasn't just falling into place and I was surprised that he was making all these assumptions. 9, 11, 12, 18 We did move with him and bought a house and got there. 6, 7, 9 We were there for five years. 20 He didn't get tenure which was disappointing to him and me. 15 That's when he had these offers from Penn State and University of Utah. 13 AS: Did you live together during those five years? 20 KSF: We did.  It wasn't easy because he had these big swings of moods and he was clearly not totally happy with his life. 8, 11, 17 We had this semblance of a life together. 11 I wasn't unhappy. 17 I just was kind of watchful. 9, 12, 16, 17 Years later, skip to when Rachel's fifteen, a therapist asked me if my first husband was an alcoholic. 5, 6, 9, 10, 15 I said no.  In fact, he like my dad hardly ever drank. 7, 10, 11, 14 However, unlike my dad, he when he drank got really, really mean. 7, 14, 16 That, I've heard, is a sign not of an addiction necessarily but of an alcoholic. 5, 15 This huge mood swing.  He didn't drink very often to his credit. 6, 12, 14, 15 He had these huge swings of moods.  You could never, I'd always feel like I was walking on eggshells. 15, 16, 17 I never knew what I could say or couldn't say because I'd always get this verbal attack. 6, 12, 15, 16, 17 In some ways it kind of replicated my mom's criticism of me and my brother's verbal abuse of me. 5, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 It was something I was used to. 9 I hated it. 12 I always said, I'm pointing right behind my eye, I felt there were tears right here. 14, 16, 17 That I was always on the verge of crying because I really hated the way I was being treated. 11, 12, 16, 17 I realized also that he was the only person that treated me like that outside of my mom and my brother. 5, 14, 15, 16 I came to that realization way later, after David and I were separated. 16, 19 I wasn't happy but I had so much good in my life. 11, 17, 18 I had good friends. 12, 18 I had things I was liking doing. 16 I loved my children. 13, 14 I loved being a mom. 13, 15 I loved Stony Brook. 13 Here I was on the water. 6 We didn't live right on the water but a mile away. 6, 14, 16 I could be at the water all the time. 6 Those things were positives, way strong positives. 9, 13, 14, 16 I had some really good friends that I made at Stony Brook. 12, 16, 18 AS: You were there five years. 20 KSF:  We were there five years. 20 That's when David was applying for jobs for the future.  I wasn't going to go to Salt Lake City and I wasn't going to go to Penn State.  He got an offer from University of Minnesota. 13 I agreed to come here. 13, 19 It looked like a good place. 11 In my mind it was, ""I can have a life there whatever happens with David."" 11, 12 I don't think I ever said that but I knew deep down that here were the elements, I would be in a big city with lots and lots of opportunities and that I could thrive. 5, 6, 8, 12, 17, 20 We did move here.  Within a year we bought a house. 6, 7, 9, 20 Then a few months later David announced, he had a trip to the East Coast and he came back and there was some weird stuff that I was picking up on. 8, 9, 19 He eventually said that he had reconnected with somebody that he had known in college and he was going to be moving out the next day. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 Instead of giving him free reign this time like I did when we were in Cambridge, I said to him, ""Okay. 9, 11 Where's the key?""  He was a little surprised that I was setting that boundary. 17, 18 I'd learned a lot over the years. 12, 17, 20 I was quite clear that he needed to do what he needed to do for his life and I needed to do what I needed to do for my life. 11, 13 We moved here in 1975, to Minneapolis. 8 This was probably '77.  Matthew was ten and Rachel was eight.  David moved out. 8 We got divorced two years later, two and a half years later. 5, 20 David was always, he was attentive to the kids but he didn't spend a lot of time with them. 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 I don't know how my kids really feel about their dads. 13, 14, 15, 16 They learned once we were living in separate houses, I was aware that they learned to deal with him perfectly well. 6, 9, 12, 13, 17 He had some ideas that were the kind of things you rolled your eyes at. 11, 14, 16, 17 The kids kind of rolled their eyes at those things. 14, 16, 17 I never spoke ill of him. 15, 19 I didn't want to have that be a battleground for them. 8, 13 I learned to set some really strong boundaries. 9, 12, 17 Life was not easy but I felt I had a really strong base of friends. 9, 12, 17, 18 Rachel was the younger of two by two years. 5, 14, 20 Matthew was kind of shy which I guess, I'm the oldest and I was pretty outgoing. 5, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 20 I kind of thought Matthew was but when push came to shove and you'd ask Matthew if he'd go to a neighbor he wouldn't do it but Rachel would. 11, 12, 16, 17, 19 Being two years younger. 5, 14, 20 I was always sort of surprised about that. 16, 17, 18 She always had a sort of presence about herself. 16, 17 They both had very clearly defined personalities. 14, 16 They were obviously quite different people. 16, 17 Neither of them were very difficult. 20 Rachel had spent a lot of her really early childhood being very attached to me. 11, 17, 19 She cried all the time if I wasn't there which was a kind of pressure. 15, 16, 17 I don't know whether that, we never knew what was causing that. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 She was physically fine. 7, 14 I had her tested and stuff. 9 She grew out of it when she was two and could talk. 10 She just kind of climbed down off of me and was her own person. 9, 12, 16, 17 Matthew was always more quiet. 16, 17 You couldn't read him as well as Rachel.  Then in 1980 in the end of the year we had our final divorce hearing. 12, 20 On that very day I went out to dinner with some friends of mine. 12, 18, 19 I had been dating a little bit.  I didn't feel like I needed to be dating. 13, 16 A lot of the dating was very boring. 17 I had been introduced by a friend of mine who knew me and her boyfriend knew Richard. 6, 11, 12 Months and months before they had both said that we should meet. 8, 13 We couldn't find a time to do that.  Judith and Fred couldn't. 12 Finally, they were both in town at the same time. 19 We were invited for a dinner to Judith and Fred's house. 6, 9, 12 I took my kids to a babysitter who's going to keep them overnight. 5, 8, 12, 13, 19 I went to this party and met this man. 5, 6 The other people at the party were department of engineering people. 6 Richard's department. 11 I didn't know any of them. 13, 14, 15 The only person I knew there was Judith. 6, 12 During the evening I was aware that when somebody made a joke or something instead of turning to Judith to laugh I would turn to Richard. 9, 11, 15, 16, 19 At the end of the evening I felt fine. 12, 14, 15, 17 He seemed very nice and I wouldn't mind seeing him again. 19 I didn't give him my phone number. 6, 7 I figured he could find out how to get in touch with me. 12, 13, 15 I knew he was going to be travelling on business. 6, 9, 12 Then a couple weeks later I went out to dinner to celebrate or to have some dinner with some friends. 12, 18 It happened it was the night of the end of my divorce. 12, 13, 19 I'd been in court.  AS: It's okay to celebrate your divorce.  KSF: I was really glad to celebrate it by this time.  I had said to my friends on the way home, they were driving, I said to them I'd met this man at a party and I wouldn't mind if he called again but I hadn't heard from him. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 I got home and he called me and invited me on a date. 7, 19 That was in early December.  We went out on that date.  We saw each other at Christmas. 9 We started seeing a lot of each other. 9, 11, 17 He was travelling for a committee he was on.  He was gone in January.  By the end of January, we were engaged to be married. 12 The only real complication was I had Matthew and Rachel who were by this time nine and eleven or ten and twelve. 10 Richard had three daughters who were twelve and a half, fourteen and a half, and sixteen and a half. 5, 11, 20 How old were the kids? 20 They must have been by this time, eleven and thirteen.  Susan was thirteen and a half. 20 She's a half year older than Matthew. 5, 20 At the end of the summer, their mother was very much in their lives. 12, 18 At the end of the summer Richard and I got married in August of 1981. 9, 11, 12 We had these five teenagers. 18 We had a schedule where the kids spent half the time with David and half the time with me. 19 We had worked that out.  It worked most of the time.  David would get a little frantic from time to time and would just say he couldn't handle it. 7, 9, 12 I'd take the kids. 6 For the most part that worked.  The girls had been with their mom about half time. 8, 15, 20 Their mother was livid about me even though I had nothing to do with their divorce. 15 They were already divorced when I met Richard. 5, 11 She decided that I had broken up their marriage not knowing anything about me. 5, 12, 13, 14, 15 I'm sure Richard told her we were going to get married. 11, 15, 20 They had to talk to each other when the kids were going back and forth. 10, 19 That set up a really bad tone for us because Susan, especially Karen and Susan the two younger ones were indoctrinated by their mother that I was a horrible homewrecker. 5, 14, 17, 19, 20 They would spend a week with her and they'd come back to us. 12, 13, 19 It would take us a half of week to get that calmed down a little bit, it never got sorted out until way later. 6, 15, 16, 17, 20 Then Richard and I figured out we could have a schedule where we were with my kids alone one week and his kids alone the next week and the third week we would have by ourselves. 11, 12, 13, 20 The kids were all together for a week, my kids alone, his kids alone, we were alone for a week.  We worked this schedule out.  People were kind of coming and going a lot of the time. 16, 17 Rachel was a teenager and I don't remember that she was so utterly horrible to me. 17 She had a couple friends that we really didn't like. 10, 12, 18 She disappeared a few times. 12, 18 I don't remember exactly what ages. 10 She would not come home at night when she was supposed to. 6, 13, 19 I knew there was a lot of manipulation happening. 6, 12, 13, 17 What I did was pick up the phone and call the parents of these kids she was hanging out with. 7, 10, 16, 18 I didn't know any of them. 13, 14, 15 All of them had gone to different schools in high school. 8, 16, 17 I called a meeting. 7, 13 I guess that when I’m anxious about something I want to get together with people and solve the problem. 10, 13 I invited these parents over to my house, I don’t know what they thought of me. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 They all seemed willing to come. 13, 19 We had dessert and Rachel and her friend Nina were totally upside down upset at what were we going to talk about. 10, 12, 17, 19 I said we weren’t going to talk about them we were going to talk about what kind of rules we had in our houses and who did what and did kids get allowance. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 AS: You’re just going to get on the same page. 9, 12, 20 KSF:  We weren’t going to blow their cover.  Not talk about them. 10 We were going to talk about us and how we were trying to run a home and a family. 10, 11, 16, 18, 19 I said to Rachel and Nina, “You can come back and have dessert with us afterwards but you’re not here for this part of our meeting.” 13, 19 It was really productive.  We really did talk about it. 10 We went around the circle.  Like eight pairs of parents, something like that. 10, 16 It was this little group that was running together. 7, 11 Yes, everybody had to be home for dinner. 19 Yes, everybody got allowance and some got allowance for doing chores and some got allowance just because. 9, 12 Were their restrictions on how they used it? 9, 19 What time did people have to be in?  What was their curfew?  Did that vary by school night versus weekends? 8, 12, 19 All that stuff. 9 How that helped me was later when things were really crazy, I could stand in my kitchen and laugh because I knew that whatever was going on in my house was going on in these eight other houses in the Twin Cities. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 That didn’t solve the problem but it sure made me feel better. 15, 16 It wasn’t just Richard’s and my divorce’s from our previous spouses. 9, 11, 12 We had a teenage girl.  They had teenage girls and boys. 8 Rachel would say as she walked out the door to school, “I won’t be home until tomorrow morning because I’m going to spend it at Elsie’s house overnight.” 6, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19 I’d say, “Who’s Elsie?”  Never having heard from her about her before. 15 “No you’re not.”  It helped me to set some rules, boundaries about what was appropriate behavior and what wasn’t. 12, 13, 16, 17 Meanwhile what was going on in David Frank’s house was he didn’t know how to stand up to any of this. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 She would say, “I’m moving out.”  He would call me up. 7 I would say, “No she’s not.  We’ve already decided you’re eighteen or you’re graduated from high school before you can live on your own. 8, 12 It’s clear to me.”  I was quivering inside too.  It wasn’t hard for me. 11 I’d get back to my parent’s values. 10, 16, 19 I felt like if it seemed right to me and it was respectful to other people and not hurting anybody that it was okay to be really strong and stand up to those kinds of rules. 9, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 Besides that, my kids probably would say we had rules, they were based on let’s be respectful to each other, let’s be considerate and thoughtful, let’s live with good values. 11, 12, 19 Matthew and Rachel will both tell you that I was worried about them.  I’m happy to be accused of being worried. 9, 17 I’d rather do that than just let you go to the winds. 9, 12, 13, 19 That didn’t work out too well.  Matthew was a little rebellious.  Rachel in the scheme of things was probably not as rebellious as a lot of kids. 16, 17 Rebellious enough. 20 I had to call the police a couple times. 7, 18 We went down and got her out of Uptown, that mall of Calhoun Square. 19 We found her and brought her home. 9, 18, 19 AS: This is in the 80s?  KSF:  Yes.  People were buying alcohol for minors which I guess they still do. 7, 9, 10 Worse maybe they’re buying heroin for minors now. 7, 9, 14 She hung out at Uptown a lot. 17, 19 In there is another whole history, we acquired a foster daughter. 5, 9, 12 It was someone Rachel knew slightly who came and spent a night at our house and the next day went home and found that her mother had moved overnight and was gone. 6, 8, 9, 12, 19 Jennifer came back and lived at our house for the next year and a half. 6, 9, 19, 20 We had custody of her. 9 That’s a whole other story. 9 Jennifer was part of that group too.  I had two kids, Rachel and Jennifer, who were dressing punk and going to Uptown whenever. 14, 15, 19 They had to be home at certain times and if they didn’t there were consequences. 18, 19 I was also taking a couple of courses in youth studies at the time and working full time. 9, 11 AS: Where were you working?  KSF: I was working at the University of Minnesota in the Sociology Department as the coordinator of advising in Student Services. 13 This is where I worked for twenty-two years. 20 I was working with college students. 8, 9, 14 I had watched Karen and Susan and Helen grow up and they had their own ways of rebelling. 16, 17 In our house those rebellions were really minor compared to a lot of things. 6, 9, 12, 16, 17 Rachel was the most adventurous of them all.  Very creative.  They were all good students. 9, 14 They’ve all done their own thing in their own ways. 16, 17 Helen, the oldest, was with us most of the time because her relationship with her mother was not good at all. 5, 9, 20 She preferred not to ever go to her mother’s house. 6, 9, 12 She would see her mother from time to time.  She was a mainstay in our house. 6, 9 She left for college the August that we got married. 8, 9 It was her freshman year. 20 She was home but not all the time. 19 She would come home some weekends and she would be home for holidays and school breaks. 8, 12, 13, 18, 19 A few years after all of that was going on with Rachel in high school she actually wrote Richard a letter which just to this day brings tears to my eyes. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 About how she thanked him for having stayed in there with her and hung in there with her. 5, 9, 13 She just appreciated that. 9, 12 She did finish high school. 8 With all these older siblings that all got along well together. 5, 20 She saw them all leaving the house and going off and doing college or whatever. 6, 8, 9, 19 She was determined to not be there anymore. 13 She didn’t want to be the baby. 5, 13 She did summer school and took extra credits in school and graduated when she was seventeen and moved out and moved in with her friend Jessie. 8, 12, 15 They had an apartment over in South Minneapolis not too far from Lyndale and Franklin near the Art Institute. 7, 9, 20 I didn’t know a lot about what she was doing. 13, 14, 15, 17 She was initially interested in getting involved with things like massage therapy and that kind of thing. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 She had danced a lot through high school. 8, 17 Parts of high school. 8 We’d gone on a trip to look at schools for massage. 8 She decided to go to the Southwest. 9, 12 I don’t remember all the details of it.  She fell in with a woman. 15 I can’t remember her name. 6 She was living in the Southwest and I went and visited her in a little town just outside of Santa Fe. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 They lived in a little shack up in an arroyo.  I don’t know what they did for a living. 6, 13, 14, 15 I went and visited once there and stayed in Santa Fe but visited the hut. 5, 9, 12, 13 It really was a hut.  I truly don’t know what they were doing for a living or how they supported themselves. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 I probably don’t want to know. 13, 14, 15 Eventually they moved to California. 8 Then there was a trip Rachel and I made to the East Coast to visit her grandma, her dad’s mom. 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 I stayed friendly with her even after my divorce. 5, 9, 12, 15 Rachel told me then that she was pregnant. 20 She was pregnant with Brianna. 8 I hadn’t met the dad but he was living in this part of California where she and this woman had been. 5, 6 I started making some visits out there. 9, 11, 12, 13 For a while Rachel, when she was in California, was living in the mountains not too far from Reno and Tahoe in Nevada City back in the hills, not in the town. 6, 19 They were in a yurt and had an outhouse. 6, 9 I have no idea how they were making money. 11 She was living with Kent. 6 First they had lived in Seattle. 9 That’s where Brianna was born. 8 Once Brianna was born they lived in a garage that was kind of falling down. 8, 16, 17 At one point Matthew said to me, “How come Rachel likes to live like a homeless person?” 10, 13, 19 I said, “I don’t know.” 13, 14, 15 She always was sort of seeking these creative, interesting ways of living, very challenging about how you really survive on a very basic level. 6, 9, 16, 17, 19, 20 Brianna’s dad was twelve years older than Rachel and had a dad who was in the framing business, picture framing, and had learned those skills. 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 20 He and Rachel started a framing business in West Seattle where they lived. 9, 11 When Brianna was born, I knew something was going on but I didn’t know what it was. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15 It was crazy. 16 Sometimes she’d communicate well with me and sometimes she wouldn’t. 5, 10, 18 I did worry a lot about her. 11, 17 I was working still full time and didn’t have any children at home. 9, 11, 14, 19 I tried to get out to Seattle as often as I could which actually turned out to be at least a long weekend and sometimes a week every five or six weeks. 5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 Then Matthew and his fiancée got engaged and married. 8 Kent and Rachel and tiny little Brianna came to the wedding. 8, 19 Brianna was born in March and that was the following July. 8, 12 She was really little.  At that time the behavior was just so erratic and kind of crazy. 9, 12, 16, 17 Rachel seemed her own self. 19 She seemed a little quiet. 19 She’d go off by herself from time to time.  I loved Brianna. 8, 13 It was no problem for me to be in charge of her and let Rachel and Kent do their own thing. 17, 19 On the last day of that wedding they were needing to get to the airport and we were going to take them. 6, 8, 9, 13, 19 I couldn’t raise them.  I couldn’t get them up.  They were supposed to be meeting us downstairs to get a ride to the airport and they weren’t there. 6, 8, 9, 13 I couldn’t get their attention. 15 Banging on the hotel door.  I was getting frantic. 7 Finally, Kent came to the door. 19 Their room was a mess. 7 I almost said to them, “If I didn’t know better I would think you were on drugs.” 9, 13, 14, 15 I didn’t say it.  I thought, “How can I say such a thing?” 11, 12 It seems so disrespectful. 16, 19 It was so true.  How could I even think such a thought? 11, 12, 15 They bustled around and they got their things together. 8, 9, 16 I don’t know how we got them to the airport but they got everything. 8, 13, 14, 15 Meanwhile Brianna was fine. 8, 14 She was staying with us. 9, 19 She was all ready to go.  I was putting her on the airplane with these two people who I couldn’t even wake up. 10, 13, 15 They went back to California and not too long after that Rachel called David and told him that she was on heroin and that he couldn’t tell me under sort of penalty of death, “If you tell mom I will never speak to you again.” 7, 15, 17, 19, 20 AS: Why did she tell her dad?  KSF:  I think she just had to tell somebody. 9, 12 I don’t know why. 13, 14, 15 He struggled with that for a few days and realized he had to tell me. 9, 14, 19 I was just devastated. 9, 12 In a certain way not particularly surprised. 16, 18 Rachel had in high school, the time I went and picked her up at Calhoun Square...then there was a call when she had been discovered with her head in the toilet at McDonalds in Uptown having drunk a whole fifth of gin. 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19 She was totally out of it and they took her to 20-20 Franklin which is at Franklin and Cedar, the detox there. 7, 10, 17 I think it was for teens.  Then we put her into a program to assess her situation. 10, 13 This was when she was fifteen.  They said, “She isn’t addicted but she has the potential for being addicted. 15 She has some characteristics. 9, 10 She needs to be careful.” 7, 13 There was a program at South High for kids with drug problems and alcohol problems. 14 She participated in that, a support group.  I never knew very much about it. 6, 12, 15, 18 The following summer when she was sixteen she and a friend travelled to Europe together. 12 She was very punk.  Black leather and white makeup and black hair. 12, 16 She was very insulted on the way back because the customs people insisted on patting her down. 9, 16, 19 She had been all the places that one goes. 11, 17 She’d been to Berlin and Amsterdam, all the places that one would be suspect. 9, 11, 17 She and her friend were straight and she was surprised that everybody was surprised that she wouldn’t take any alcohol. 6, 9, 12, 18 In Europe you drank wine with all your meals because you don’t drink the water. 6, 7, 14 She had explained to them that she had an allergy and she couldn’t drink the wine. 6, 14 They found other things for her. 16 She sounded like she was completely comfortable with that. 10, 14, 19 I do think she was sober on that trip. 6 The friend she was travelling with—they were seeing a lot of family friends. 12, 17, 18 To my knowledge she wasn’t drinking through high school. 6, 8, 13, 14, 15 She had that history. 9 To get back into that in a certain sense wasn’t completely surprising. 14, 17, 19 She saw a counselor in Seattle who was really good. 10 Her name was Cathy. 6 I met her a few times. 5, 18 That was an important touch for Rachel. 15 I would go out there and very often she would be sort of acting like she had flu symptoms and was really sick. 10, 12, 15, 17 Somehow she’d get herself together.  I’d be there mostly taking care of Brianna and fixing some meals in this primitive kind of garage they lived in and helping with the shop. 7, 8, 9, 13, 16, 17 Then Rachel would go out to do an errand just before I was about to leave and she’d go and get high. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 She was trying while I was there to get off of her drugs. 14, 16 She couldn’t maintain it.  I wasn’t there long enough. 20 She did go into a treatment program for a while. 9, 16 I went out to try and be supportive. 16 It was while I was there that I realized, I’m paying the rent for this shop while they get on their feet. 11, 14, 16 The money that I’m paying for the rent is freeing up them to pay money for their drugs. 11, 14, 16 I cut that off while she was in the program so I could tell them and they could give her the support she needs. 6, 13 That was really hard because I knew that was their income. 6, 11, 12, 13, 19 They were going to lose their business if this happened. 9, 12, 13 I couldn’t in good conscience continue to pay for the rent if I knew what it was going for. 6, 12, 16 Basically I was buying the drugs. 7, 14 Rachel got out of the program and she walked across the street and got drugs. 9, 14, 17 She and Brianna were in the program. 8 Then she and Kent moved to central California and lived in a commune, a sort of Eastern philosophy commune. 8, 9, 17 Kent’s dad was involved.  They lived there for a while.  I don’t know what drugs she was using. 13, 14, 15 If she was off of heroin by that time or not.  Kent was not.  I know there was a lot of pot. 13, 14, 15, 17 I didn’t ever stay in their garage. 9 I stayed in a motel not too far away. 5, 9, 16 I would go over there in the morning.  There were all these people sleeping on their couch. 7 AS: Were you worried about Brianna? 8 KSF: I was always worried about Brianna. 8, 16, 17 AS: Are you talking about times you went out there before she had called her dad to say she was using? 7, 10, 18 You’re seeing all of this behavior but you’re not aware of what it is.  You’re just kind of observing. 9, 12, 16, 17 KSF: Right.  AS: What made you not confront her when you saw, you mentioned earlier having respect for people, was that what you were trying to do? 16 Or do you think you just didn’t want to look so hard? 9, 11, 12, 13 You didn’t want confrontation? 13 KSF: I think I didn’t realize. 14 I didn’t think about it.  It didn’t cross my mind until she admitted to it.  That’s when I started going, there was Nar-Anon. 9, 11 I forget this.  At the age of fifteen when I learned that she had been drinking and she was in detox. 6, 10, 12, 14, 17 Richard and 11 I were seeing a therapist to sort through all this family stuff. 6, 9, 17, 18 That therapist had asked me about David and whether he had been an alcoholic. 5, 6, 9, 10 He said, “I think you might benefit from Al-Anon.” 14 I didn’t know what he was talking about but I’ll do anything to get out of this chaos. 10, 13, 14, 15 I did start going to Al-Anon. 9, 11 I had been in Al-Anon not when Rachel was first discovered but shortly thereafter when there were times when she wouldn’t show up at night. 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 I would realize there’s nothing I can do until tomorrow morning. 14 The Al-Anon really helped me. 13, 16 Maybe I had been going to Al-Anon just before Rachel’s incident with detox. 9, 10, 12 I remember thinking, “I don’t need to rush over there. 13 I know where she is. 13, 14, 15 I don’t need to go out looking for her.” 13 AS: You already had the tools.  KSF:  I had the tools and I was focusing on living as healthy a life as I could. 6, 11, 14, 15, 18 I don’t know, I can’t remember now. 13, 14, 15 I don’t know if I was suspicious of her. 13, 14, 15 I would worry if I wouldn’t hear from her for long periods of time. 11 She always seemed pretty put together. 10, 16, 17, 18, 19 I believed this flu thing.  Rachel would say she had the flu and I worried about that.  I didn’t ever put two and two together. 10 I have also thought drugs are not part of my life and I think I’m very scared of them. 5, 7, 11, 12, 14 I chose never to really read a lot about them. 15, 17 It’s not my life. 11 That is an element of denial.  I didn’t know that flu symptoms were an indication of someone trying to withdraw. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I never saw Rachel. 15 I would show up to help with Brianna later. 8, 13 Whatever they were doing with heroin earlier in the day it would have worn off. 19 AS: At what point did you start the Nar-Anon in St. Paul? 9, 11 KSF:  When Rachel finally told her dad and her dad told me. 20 AS: Were they still in Seattle or were they in California? 9 KSF: They were in Seattle.  I then waited a full twenty-four hours before I called Rachel to think how it would be best to talk to her. 7, 9, 10, 11 When I did I just started off having a conversation with her. 9, 11, 12 We talked for a while, half an hour or something. 10, 11 Finally, I said to her.  She hadn’t said anything to me.  I finally said, “I understand you have something maybe to tell me.” 9, 12, 16 She said, “I’m not ready to tell you.”  I said, “Okay.  Let me know when you are.” 13, 14, 15 We talked another ten minutes and then she told me lots of stuff. 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 17, 20 I don’t remember what exactly. 10 We had a long conversation. 12 Then when I went out there I looked to see if there was anything.  I don’t remember how I found out about Nar-Anon but I found that there were several groups.  I started going to meetings every time I was out there. 9, 11, 13 KSF:  This was when my parents were moving out of their house. 6, 9, 10, 16 I was still trying to work full time which I did until 2001. 9, 11, 16 Then I took early retirement.  By that time Rachel had moved back here. 8, 19 Rachel and Brianna were living with us. 6, 8 Richard had retired. 11, 12, 19 He’s six years older than I am. 5, 20 He’d retired to do photography. 12, 19 I was—in 2001 I was ready to leave the U and do my own thing. 6 I had kind of a plan for myself. 16, 17 In 1996 that’s when I started to go to those meetings in Seattle. 9, 11, 13 In 1997, in March, I guess at the very beginning of 1997 10 I started looking around at the possibility of doing something here. 8, 9, 11 I continued to go to Al-Anon. 18 The legal issues which fortunately Rachel never had that I knew of, I don’t know maybe there were some. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 Just the impact, the intensity of it and the health risks and the death risks and the extreme money were all way greater than anybody I knew who was an alcoholic. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 There was some hint of something that went on at the First Unitarian Society downtown in Minneapolis. 8, 9, 19 Apparently there was some man who every week, I don’t know because I never managed to get there. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 I thought why don’t I start a group? 9, 11, 12 I’m finding it’s really helpful out there. 13 I already had many years in Al-Anon. 20 It would be helpful to me to know other people who were dealing with drug addictions. 13, 14, 15 Maybe it would be helpful to others. 13 I was in a good place myself. 11 I looked around at possibilities and found that the Y was willing to give us a room for no charge. 6, 7, 8, 17 With two other people from my Al-Anon group, one of whom was a woman who was in recovery from an alcoholic addiction. 5 She never really participated in the Nar-Anon but she helped us get it started. 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 Another woman that I knew from Al-Anon and I sent out letters to therapists and churches and tried to publicize it. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 19 We put something in the Phoenix newspaper. 6, 10, 13 We ran a little ad in the Southeast News. 7, 9 We used our own money. 9 We picked a date and had this room at the Y reserved for us. 7 We showed up and for about five years it was very small. 7, 20 The word was out but it wasn’t very out.  We did the best we could to publicize it. 9 We would have between one and five people.  In the summer often 12, 15 I would be the only one who would show up and bring my books with me.  I’d sit and read the daily reading and wait until seven thirty. 11, 13 If nobody showed up, I’d go home. 7, 19 It was a time for me to center myself. 9 When we first going to Al-Anon we had sent the One Day at a Time Al-Anon book to our family members. 7, 9, 18 We bought a half a dozen copies of it. 7 My mother had read the whole thing in one week.  AS: That’s funny.  The day book she read in a week. 19 It’s a yearlong day book. 19, 20 KSF:  Her response was, “This is a philosophy for good living.” 6 I found that in my own life. 11 This had helped me turn from a shrieking meanie into a person who could deal with things of great import in a thoughtful way, not denying my emotions but not letting my emotions control me. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 It allowed me to be in normal relationships with people in healthy ways. 14, 16, 17, 18 Having come from where I was from my childhood there was tons of stuff I didn’t know. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 It gave me so many options. 7 My first Al-Anon meeting that I went to there were people who were actually laughing. 5, 9, 10, 13 Someone would say something that I could identify with about the dysfunction that I’d grown up with and people could laugh about it. 17 For me it had always been you don’t talk about it because my house is the only house where that happens. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 I thought, “Wow you can get to the point where you can laugh about it.” 11, 12 I would listen really carefully about people would give ways that they had dealt with situations. 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17 I’d think, “I never thought of that.” 11, 12, 15 I’d go home, some things I thought never would work, there were lots of things I heard and I thought, “Gosh I could try that.” 5, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 I remember one time on the phone with my mom, we talked on the phone even though we didn’t have a very good relationship but still she was my mother. 7, 9, 10, 11, 15 I remember on the phone once she laid into me some criticism or the other and I said to her fully expecting to be struck by lightning, I was in my breakfast nook and I said, “Mom, when you say things like that to me, it hurts my feelings.” 7, 9, 11, 16, 18 I thought I was going to be struck dead by lightning and I wasn’t. 9, 11, 12 In that conversation my mom revealed to me some things about how her relationship with her family when she was growing up. 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 I thought, “Oh my God.” 11, 12 AS: Just because you said, “When you talk like that it hurts my feelings.” 9, 10, 16 KSF:  She revealed she had said that to me because whatever I had been doing made her feel insufficient somehow. 16 What an eye opener. 16, 17 Those little incidents, not so little, they seemed little at the time gave me courage to practice what I was learning from my friends. 10, 12, 18, 19 I still do. 9 I still learn from my friends every day. 9, 12, 18, 19 It has so changed me. 16 AS: Your Nar-Anon friends? 12, 18 KSF: My Nar-Anon and Al-Anon friends. 12, 18 I used to spend so much of my life with the most terrible sore throat from shrieking because things weren’t going my way. 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19 I thought yelling about it would change it. 11, 12, 16 I’ve apologized to my children for having done that when they were growing up. 14, 17 I didn’t know any better. 13, 14, 15 I was doing the best I could with what I had which was lacking. 9 Part of my amends also is to continue to live as well as I can. 12 That’s my way of apologizing, making amends to my kids for having made their lives less than comfortable by yelling about things or trying to control things or thinking that I was doing a good job by being in their business. 9, 12, 16, 17 AS: Did you repeat a lot of the things your mother did? 16, 17 In terms of control and managing things? 16, 17 KSF:  I did it in a different way. 16, 17 I don’t remember her yelling.  Yes, the control. 17 Trying to keep things in order and make sure people did what they needed to be doing, that they were where they needed to be at certain times. 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 That may be what my kids talk about when they say that I worried too much about them. 10, 18 I would express concerns about what they should or shouldn’t do to stay safe. 9 We ate meals at pretty regular times. 18 Even if you didn’t feel particularly well you needed to get up and go to school. 8, 13, 16, 18 That was a problem for Matthew.  For years I didn’t know that he had bad stomach aches in the morning. 9, 13, 14, 15, 20 Whether those were psychological or milk allergy we never really knew. 6, 12, 15 I’d make him go to school. 8, 16 If he was throwing up he could stay home. 9, 19 And not realizing that.  Eventually I think he didn’t even tell me about it because he kind of just knew he was going to have to go to school anyways no matter how he felt. 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20 I have regrets about that kind of thing. 16, 17 I knew what I knew and I didn’t know what I didn’t know. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 Al-Anon and Nar-Anon have been so amazing. 15 Just hearing. 9 Even people from extraordinarily dysfunctional situations, everyone does things differently. 13, 15, 16, 17 I can learn from them. 12 I can apply them to a less than dysfunctional situation. 13 There can be a lot of truth and health in what they’re doing, even trying to deal with something that’s totally nuts. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I guess, deep down there’s still this little element of trying to help people and this program is helpful in trying to help people. 9, 10, 13, 16 If we continued to have meetings of one or two people, I don’t think I would have been able to. 13, 18 I am a rather stubborn person and I like to think that that stubbornness can be translated in a positive way into persistence. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 If I find enough satisfaction and rewards in continuing to go then I’m genuinely invested when I’m there. 9, 10, 20 It’s not hard to keep being connected. 11, 12, 18 Over the years, in the early years when I was seen as the leader I was the person who was there every week. 20 Now that we have a good core of people who are there week after week I rarely am the trusted servant or the speaker or the reader. 9 I try to sign up every once and awhile. 16 I signed up for three weeks from now to do something on a topic. 14 AS: Can we pause for just a second? 9, 12, 20 KSF: Yes.  [Break in Recording]  AS: We were talking about Nar-Anon and the benefits that it had on you. 10, 14 You said you started Nar-Anon in ‘97? 9, 11 KSF:  I think this is the twentieth birthday at the end of this month. 8, 12, 19 AS: So ‘97, when you started it where is Rachel and what’s going on? 9, 11 KSF: When I started it Rachel’s living in Seattle. 6, 9, 11 I can’t remember the order of things. 16 In that time, she did go into treatment. 9, 16 Didn’t stay as long as I would have wished she could. 9 I had no say and I knew that. 6, 12 She and Kent were still together. 9 I don’t know if this was because of my Al-Anon, Nar-Anon practice or what. 10, 13, 14, 15 I love this girl and her baby and I trusted her to do whatever was best. 5, 9, 13 It was her life. 11 By this time, I had been in Al-Anon or Nar-Anon for ten years, starting when she was fifteen. 9, 11, 20 This is a lot of long practice. 10, 17 Sitting here today I can’t tell you. 19 I knew she was seeing a therapist. 6, 9, 12 I knew she was trying her best. 6, 9, 12, 16 I don’t think she was going to any support group.  I don’t know a lot about what she did because it wasn’t my business. 9, 13, 14, 15, 17 I truly believe that she would do what was best for her. 9 AS: You really took that to heart because of what you had learned in a 12-Step Program? 12, 17 KSF: I think so.  AS: As a mother you were…?  KSF:  I was always worried how things were going. 16, 17 She wasn’t living in a way that I would have dreamed for her. 6, 14, 16 There was nothing wrong, it wasn’t an unhealthy way she was living but it was way difficult. 6, 14, 16, 18, 20 Things seemed to be okay. 19 The only I guess jumping, after they moved to central California from...I’m confused about it. 8, 9, 10 In Nevada City they were living in a yurt. 6 I also think they were connected at that time to this community. 18 Right now I can’t put that together. 10, 14 They were involved with this sort of Eastern philosophy community. 9, 17 I don’t know what I thought, whether it was drug free. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 I think they went there thinking that that would be a way to get away from drugs. 14, 16 I don’t know if it was. 13, 14, 15 I don’t think it was when they were living in the backwoods in the yurt. 6, 19 I’ve gotten myself off track. 15 Where Rachel was.  Then they moved to central California. 8 Things seemed to be okay. 19 It was more after Rachel came back here that I noticed how hard things had been on Brianna. 8, 11, 16, 19 Having parents who were not able to be fully present because of their drug use. 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 AS: How did she end up back here? 12, 19 Can you tell me that story? 9 KSF: Yes.  They were living in Nevada City. 6 Rachel got Bronchitis or something, she got sick.  I had been continuing to go out there.  They were living in a yurt and then they bought a trailer. 6, 7 It was stuff that was falling down. 9 I knew how primitive they were living. 6, 12 Rachel got sick and was getting sicker and sicker.  I was worried about them and worried about Brianna. 8 Rachel had told me she was in a program. 20 What’s that federal program called? 7 Not first start. 9, 11 AS: Head Start?  KSF: Head Start program.  I knew Rachel was in some kind of a program. 6, 12, 16, 17 I don’t know what my thinking was or how I got to this but decided I was going to try to talk to, I don’t know if it was something Rachel said to me. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 I think she gave me the name of the person of Head Start. 6 She gave me the name so I thought I’ll call her. 6, 7, 11, 12 The woman said to me, “I’m so glad you called because you hadn’t called we were going to start Child Protection proceedings.” 7, 9, 11 It wasn’t that Rachel wasn’t doing anything.  I think they were starting to notice that Brianna was suffering from not having the kind of parenting that a child that is not even two years old needs. 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 She said, “Something has to be done.”  I got on an airplane and went out there. 13 I told Rachel I would come out. 13, 19, 20 I said, “I’ll send you airline tickets.” 6, 12, 13 I had lots of miles. 5, 17 “Come home. 19 Do you want to come home?” 13, 19 Yes, she did.  “I can’t get packed.”  That went on for a few days. 19 She wasn’t making any progress getting packed.  I said, “I’ll come and help you. 13, 19 Is that okay?”  She said yes and I got on an airplane and went out and packed her up. 13, 14 We got on an airplane. 13 We didn’t really tell Kent.  We left a note or something.  I don’t know what Rachel had told him. 13, 14, 15, 20 I didn’t kidnap them because they went willingly.  I don’t think Kent knew. 6, 12 AS: You retrieved them.  KSF:  We stayed one night in Reno to get our airplane back and then got on the airplane the next morning and came home and we had our friend who is a pediatrician come and look at Rachel and Brianna who were both suffering from something. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 It was treatable. 16 We basically let Rachel sleep and she had been trying to get off of, I think maybe she was using marijuana, I don’t think she was using. 7, 9, 11, 16, 19 I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 In my mind it was, and I told her, “You’re welcome to stay here as long as you need to to get to a state that you need to be in and make your decision about whether to go back.” 9, 13, 16, 19, 20 The thought was that she would go back. 11, 12, 19 We had no ticket for her to return. 13, 19 I did say, “If you use drugs you’re out of here but Brianna’s going to stay here.” 8, 9, 14 That was very clear in my mind.  If Rachel decided to go back or if she decided to use that Brianna needed to be protected. 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 That wasn’t based on anything that was true legally.  I don’t think I had a leg to stand on but I said it. 9, 12 I believed it and I would have fought for that.  When Rachel spent day after day in bed sleeping I could take care of Brianna. 6, 7, 8, 19 Brianna was quite traumatized, not quite traumatized but she was traumatized. 8 She would get into these frantic screaming rages. 7 KSF:  She’s barely two. 5 AS: What year is this? 20 KSF:  She was born in ‘95.  I said to Rachel one day, “We think it would help if you saw a therapist.” 6, 9, 13, 19 She said, “Yes.”  We’d been seeing somebody just for normal day to day things. 9, 12, 16, 19 Trying to work out my relationship with my mom who was nearing the end of her life. 11, 12, 15 My craziness with my brother. 5 I was spending more time with my parents because they were needing more help. 10, 12, 13, 16, 19 We set up an appointment for Rachel to see Ellie. 17 She went to see her.  At some point, I don’t know the order of things, she had contacted a number of her high school friends. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 As she once told me they were either in treatment, in a recovery program, or dead. 9, 16, 20 The people she had been in high school with. 8 She started seeing some of her high school friends and got involved in at least two NA groups over at Fairview. 8, 9, 11, 12, 18 One in some kind of a church in Northeast Minneapolis. 9, 16, 17 I knew about my 12-Step Programs. 6, 12 People would call her if she wouldn’t show up for a meeting. 7, 13 Someone would call her, “How are you doing? 7 Are you feeling okay? 16 Can I come over and help give you a ride?” 6, 13, 19 That sort of thing. 17 She continued to do that. 18 Physically she got healthy and with the therapy and NA. 7, 14, 18 Then she also wanted to go back and finish her degree. 12, 13, 19, 20 She had some credits to finish. 12 She started to look into that and eventually did that. 9, 11, 15 Slowly, slowly things changed. 16 She lived with us for I think two and a half years. 20 Then in the meantime she had met Ed who is Malaysia’s dad. 5, 16 They started being together. 9, 11 They decided to live together. 12 Rachel moved out. 8 That was traumatizing for me.  I was so sad. 12 I was so attached and bonded to them.  It was interesting because Rachel and I had had a kind of tumultuous life together. 9, 11, 16, 17, 19 When she was really little she had certain ways of communicating that she always wanted to correct what I was saying. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17 She had these overtones of my mother’s control and my brother’s stuff. 5, 9, 17 It just drove me wild that I can’t even give you an example. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17 Rephrasing what I had just said. 9, 12 It just drove me wild. 7, 9, 12, 14, 17 I was in my shrieking mode at that point.  We had a hard time when she was really little at some point, and David also pushed a lot of let’s do some psychological tests on Rachel to make sure. 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19 I didn’t think they were psychological problems.  At one point we went to see a therapist at HCMC and the therapist did a workshop test. 6, 9, 14 We were in separate rooms totally separately talking about what we were seeing in this particular blot and they were almost identical stories. 7, 9, 10, 17, 18 The therapist could hardly stand it. 6, 9, 11, 12 It was so spooky.  Did you talk to Rachel about this? 10 Have you ever seen this before?  It was my moment of realizing how much Rachel and I see things similarly. 13, 15, 16, 18 How alike we are in many ways. 16, 17 Some of our abrasion had to do with that.  It helped me appreciate how close we could be if we made an effort. 13, 16 We spent a lot of time working on getting along. 17, 19 At one point I had to set a boundary for myself when we were seeing somebody. 17 She had run away once and we were seeing somebody over at this place, The Bridge. 11, 16 We were seeing a therapist there. 6, 9 Rachel said something and I said, “I can’t see you for a while.”  It was about being super critical of me. 12 “I can’t see you for a while.”  We had said we’d take her to work. 6 I said, “I have to stop this now.” 9, 10, 14 “Can’t you just take me to work?” 6, 9, 12 “Nope.  She was living part time with her dad. 6 I said, “I can’t see you for a while.”  That started right then and there. 9, 11, 14 I just wept for hours. 9, 11, 12 I remember I had an Al-Anon meeting that night. 13, 19 I didn’t see her for a week.  I kept a journal of all the things I was thinking about. 16 I invited her to go to a movie for me and out for chocolate afterwards.  While we were having our cocoa she started in on her criticism. 9, 11 I said, “I’m going to take you back to your dad’s now.” 6, 14, 19 It didn’t take too long for me to establish that if she was going to be critical of me I wasn’t going to be with her. 6, 9 We could spend really good time together. 12, 19 Whatever she thought about me I wasn’t going to make her not think it but I didn’t want to hear it. 11, 12, 13, 16 We worked on our relationship.  As she got better and better, she and I both said that there were moments where what the other one was doing was driving us crazy. 13, 14, 15, 16 We knew enough to just keep our mouths shut. 6, 9, 12, 20 We knew there was enough positive there that it could get us by. 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 Whatever was different about it was of no consequence in the big scheme of things. 8, 16, 17 She’s going to do that, it’s different from what I would do and that’s fine. 14, 16, 17 I guess I’ll be in a different room right now. 7, 10, 14, 16, 17 Recognizing that it was totally appropriate of her to move. 17 She was getting healthier all the time. 14 She was living in this recovery community with all these wonderful, amazing people. 6, 15 Brianna was doing way better. 8, 16 I had things to do with my life. 11, 16 I didn’t need to be her mother all the time. 13 I was glad she was still nearby and I could still be involved in Brianna’s life to the extent of helping with her after school care. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15 That’s continued. 18 She’s not afraid to give me feedback. 6, 19 From time to time she’ll say, she always prefaces with do I want to hear this. 13, 16, 17 I’ll say yes. 14 It gives me something to think about. 6 Recently I had a little run in with Brianna. 8, 11 We were doing a decorating job in her house which I own. 6, 9 Brianna’s house. 6, 8, 9 Brianna said I was making all the decisions and just asking for her opinion to be placating. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 I thought, “This is not true.” 11, 12 I sat down and wrote all the decisions we had made and ninety-nine percent of them had ended up with Brianna’s decision. 8, 12, 16 One big one where I said, “It’s fine with me. 8, 14 It’s not at all what I would have done but let’s change this to be the way you want it. 13, 16, 19 You’re living there after all.” 6 I was feeling badly about that for quite some time. 16 I mentioned to Rachel that I was having some communication problems with Brianna which was putting it lightly. 8, 10 She said something about how she could relate to that.  I said, “How so?”  She said to me, “At times when I was growing up I had that feeling too. 16, 17, 18 That you were just placating me. 9, 10, 12 You come across pretty strong. 9, 13, 18, 19 You’re a force to deal with.” 13 I have thought about that. 11, 12 That was probably a month ago that she said that. 8 I didn’t take it personally. 6, 16 I mean I do take it personally but in a constructive sort of way. 6, 9, 16, 17 I’m strong enough to be able to hear that about myself. 9, 20 I know myself well enough to know that that’s true. 13, 14, 15, 20 I’m not happy that I appear to scare people sometimes if I’m being very certain about my ideas. 5, 7, 11, 17, 18 I come across as kind of scary. 7, 13, 16, 17, 19 That is how I am and I need to pay attention the more that I do to how I say things. 13, 15, 16 How I present things so I don’t come across as scary. 7, 13, 16, 19 AS: Thank you so much. 18 Anything else you can think of?  How’s your Nar-Anon group now? 14 What’s changed in twenty years? 16, 20 KSF:  It’s got a nice size.  If it could be helpful to more people I’d be happy about that. 13, 17 It seems to be some of settled at about fifteen to twenty people max who come at any given time. 6, 13, 16, 17, 19 There are people who come back. 13, 19 There are lots of people who are new who do return. 5, 6, 17, 19 Some who’ve been with the group for a very long time.  That’s a positive I think. 13, 14 I don’t know if we were in a way bigger room I don’t know if more people would come. 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 AS: What changes have you seen in the kinds of situations that people are faced with? 13, 16, 17 KSF:  Way more scary drugs now with fentanyl in drugs. 7, 9, 14 Five deaths, three of them in Nar-Anon in the last year. 9, 20 Two in family friends. 12, 18 That happened because of drug overdoses. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: That wasn’t the case twenty years ago? 20 KSF:  One family in seventeen years whose son had some serious mental illness and was in the service and was under suicide watch in the service. 14, 18, 20 They didn’t pay attention enough to him. 15, 16, 20 He killed himself. 7 AS: You’re saying in the past three years then? 9, 11, 20 KSF:  In the past two years, five people in my life. 9, 11, 20 Three of them who are Nar-Anon connections.  I think that it’s hard to know over the years the majority of the people in the program have had adult children that they’ve been concerned about. 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 Just recently in the last six months we’ve had more people in relationships with their partners, husbands or boyfriends or girlfriends. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18 Right now at our meeting the other night out of twelve people there were four who had either boyfriends or girlfriends or husbands that they’re concerned about. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 AS: Whereas it had been primarily parents. 10, 16 KSF:  I’m comfortable however that takes it. 6 I sometimes thought in the olden days that it might be that there were so many people in their forties and fifties and older who were concerned about children or grandchildren. 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20 That might have discouraged some of the younger people from coming. 5, 14 I truly don’t know whether there’s anything about that. 13, 14, 15 Some of the issues are different and the option to get out of it, not that it’s easy, but the option to remove yourself from a relationship that isn’t birth related is very different. 14, 15, 16, 17 AS: Thank you Kathie.  KSF: You’re welcome. 13, 19"
"24","Kazel_Jeff","Verne Wagner Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Verne Wagner -VW Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan it is May 18.  I got it right gals. 14 May 18, 2017 I’m in Duluth, Minnesota with Verne Wagner.  Verne do you give me permission to record this interview? 6 VW: Yes, you have my permission to record this interview. 6 AS: Let’s start with your story. 9, 11 Where you grew up, when you became a parent, some of your childhood, a little background on who you are. 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 19 VW: I grew up in the town of Proctor, just a little bit outside of Duluth. 9, 12, 19 It’s a railroad town. 9, 19 My father was a railroader; my grandfather was a railroader. 5, 7, 9 I grew up there.  Railroad men are known for drinking. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 My dad and my grandfather were no exception. 5, 7 My grandfather was a terrible alcoholic that got into recovery. 5, 7, 15 He left my dad and his mom at a very young age. 14, 15 They separated and he was gone for eight years until he finally got into AA and got very involved in AA. 19, 20 My grandfather was also an international union president which took him to Washington. 5, 7 While he was in Washington, I have some pictures of him and John Kennedy together, fell off the wagon and started drinking again. 6, 9, 11, 14, 15 He ended up retiring. 12 My grandfather, one of the local railroads asked him to be a drug and alcohol counselor for them. 5, 7, 9, 10, 14 He started a program that is used now throughout the United States. 9, 11, 14 Rather than firing people if you agreed to go into treatment they would put you in treatment and keep you working. 9, 10, 12, 16 When I was a little boy growing up I used to see these men that looked like the roughest meanest looking men sitting in my grandfather’s living room. 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 18 I’d say, “Grandma who are these men?” 7 “Oh, they’re just men that need to talk to Grandpa.” 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 Those were sponsors.  He sponsored those men. 12 When Grandpa died, all these people at his funeral came up and said, “Your grandfather saved my life, that’s how I know him.” 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 That was my introduction to the AA.  AS: But you didn’t know about AA until much later? 13, 14, 15, 18 VW: No, Grandpa gave me his big book and I knew a little bit about it. 6, 7, 8, 12 My father also was a terrible alcoholic. 5, 15 My mother came down with breast cancer in about 1965. 9, 19 On July 4, 1967 she passed away. 16 I was twelve years old at the time and my older brothers and sisters were four, five, and six years older than I am. 5, 9, 20 My father remarried six months later and moved us into a stepfamily. 5, 8, 9, 12, 18 My brothers and sisters all revolted and pretty much left. 5, 9, 18 AS: So they were all teenagers. 18 VW: Yes.  I was left in a stepfamily. 9, 12, 18 My dad was gone drinking. 6, 14, 19 My stepmother was very upset that he was gone and was very, very verbally and emotionally abusive to me. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 I was a teenager.  You can imagine as a teenager what that’s like with a stepmother especially. 9, 12, 14, 20 I was born very strict Catholic. 9 Not only did I go to Catholic grade school but I sang in the choir at eight o’clock mass, at ten o’clock mass I served mass, and at eleven thirty mass I usually read the epistle to the church. 8, 9, 10, 20 I had a priest that taught me public speaking skills. 7, 9, 16 This priest abused me, sexually when I was twelve. 9 He basically raped me. 7, 11 I quit the church shortly after. 16 What’d I’d do when I was supposed to go to church… 6 AS: You were still supposed to go so you didn’t tell anyone. 6, 9 VW: I went to the Proctor golf course and I’d hide up there.  I worked there as a summer job so I could hide up there.  I’d come home after church was done and I never told anyone about this. 13, 15, 19, 20 Finally, my father said to me, “You’re not going to church.” 5 I said, “How do you know?” 13, 14, 15 “I know. 13, 14, 15 “I don’t know, Dad. 13, 14, 15 Church does not appeal to me anymore. 13 I’ve learned everything I can learn. 12, 17 I don’t like church. 10 I don’t want to go.” 13 That was my way out of church. 16 I started discovering girls. 8, 9, 11 Girls started discovering me. 9, 11 I was a chunky little fellow. 15 I lost all this weight and the girls started knocking on my door which was very strange for me. 7, 8, 9, 11, 18 As a young boy it was extremely exciting. 14 As a Catholic I was never sexual with girls. 8, 15 My father always said, “Verne you don’t have sex with a girl unless you’re either married to her or you plan to marry her. 5, 16, 17 You never, never have sex with a girl.” 15 That’s how I was raised. 5 I had girlfriends who used to say, “How come you aren’t like the other boys? 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19 How come you never try anything?” 13, 15, 16, 19 I don’t know but I just knew that was not what I was supposed to do. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 I had a secret life. 11 Going through puberty I learned about masturbation. 9, 12, 17 It was extremely shaming to me.  It was a secret.  I used to think, if my mother is watching me how shaming this was. 9 Your deceased mother.  VW: Yes.  AS: That’s so intense. 15 VW: I started doing that compulsively. 9, 11 I hurt myself.  Then I started exposing myself to young girls when I masturbated, girls my age, in Proctor. 8, 9, 11, 14 I’m thirteen, fourteen years old. 20 At fifteen I get caught.  Somebody turns me in. 19 My dad sends me to a psychiatrist. 9, 12 One of my older brothers is gay and my dad could not stand the thought of a son that was gay. 5, 9, 11, 12, 20 This was a World War II, John Wayne, butch haircut, six foot two man’s man. 12 To have a son that was gay was the worst thing in the world for him. 9, 15 Now he’s afraid that his youngest son is gay too. 9, 14 He sent me to a psychiatrist. 7, 9 It was so shaming.  Only nuts crazy people saw, back then. 16, 19 Only crazy people saw psychiatrists. 9, 16 I was a crazy person. 16 AS: What year were you born? 20 I saw this psychiatrist, he kept me from committing suicide. 9 At fourteen I actually attempted suicide. 10 US Highway 2 runs through Proctor. 11, 16 There used to be grain trucks from North Dakota that would come down to the grain elevators and it was a steady stream of big grain trucks. 8, 9, 13, 19 At fourteen I closed my eyes and walked out in front of one. 10, 14, 16, 17 That man, poor guy, slammed on his breaks and went around me. 18 When I realized he didn’t hit me he jumps out of his truck and I took off running. 7, 11, 14 That was my suicide attempt.  At fifteen I started drinking. 6, 9, 11, 14 I started using marijuana and LSD. 9, 11 I was a very out of control kid. 17 The psychiatrist I went to see, I saw him for about a year and then he got arrested for molesting his patients. 9, 19, 20 AS: Where did you see him?  VW: In Duluth.  I’d see this where he had women laying on different cots in different rooms. 7, 16, 17, 18 He’d give them a tranquilizer and then he’d molest them when they were out. 6, 7 One time he came in and he had his pants down and he had thigh high stockings on and a garter belt. 8, 9, 19 What the hell is that?  AS: What did you think of the world at this point? 15 He’s a professional and I’m the one who’s crazy. 16, 20 I was scared of anybody as an adult. 5, 7, 11, 12 I played sports in Proctor. 8 I was scared to death of the coaches. 5, 7, 11, 12 I was scared of people in… 5, 7, 11, 12 AS: Positions of authority. 13 VW: Positions of authority. 13 With my father’s drinking I got very involved in lots of things trying to become a leader in something to get his attention. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 Children of alcoholic type stuff. 5, 9, 14 I struggled to do that. 9 I always thought once I had sex with a woman my compulsive behavior would finish. 11, 12, 16, 17 I met my wife when she was fifteen and I was sixteen. 5 It was a dance that the Catholic Church in the western part of Duluth would put on for teenagers in the summer. 9, 10, 18 I met her, she had white blue jeans on. 5 AS: Those were the days. 19 VW: I memorized her phone numbers. 7 We dated off and on.  She was an extremely strict Catholic. 9 She has two nuns in the family. 18 I’m thinking she’s from the west part of Duluth. 9 If you’re from Proctor you’re thinking west-end girl these women are rowdy. 9, 12, 18 I have to marry one who’s thinking about becoming a nun.  We dated off and on.  We finally got engaged.  After four years at nineteen years of age we lost our virginity together. 9, 20 It was very intense. 15 I felt like I was doing something wrong. 17 “You took her virginity, you asshole.  You selfish bastard.” 9 She was like, “No, it’s okay. 10 I wanted to do this.” 12, 13 We ended up marrying. 12 We’re going on forty years now of being married. 14, 20 I always thought that would stop my behaviors and it didn’t. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 I got in some trouble with the police. 7 AS: After you were married?  After I was married.  I met a psychologist in town. 5, 9, 19 I said, “My grandfather was very big into AA. 5, 7, 8 This feels like a very compulsive addiction, what I’m doing. 16 I’ve tried stopping this my whole life. 9, 10, 11 I can’t stop it.” 9, 10 I made promises to myself, I made promises to God, I made promises to my wife and I can’t stop this behavior. 9, 10, 16 I said, “I’d like to start this twelve step group based on the steps of AA.” 9, 11, 12 He said, “That’s an interesting thought.” 9, 11, 12, 19 I put it together. 10 He was part of this community group of therapists. 6, 9 He said, “Would you put a presentation on to these folks?” 7, 10 This one therapist said, “You’re talking about sexual addiction.” 6, 9, 10 I said, “What?  I’ve never heard that term.” 15 “There’s a doctor in the Twin Cities named Patrick Carnes. 5, 6 He’s written a book called Out of the Shadows. 7, 15 It’s now called Out of the Shadows. 7, 14 You should read that book.”  I went and got it.  Oh my God.  It was like this guy wrote this book about me.  I contacted him and tracked him down to the Twin Cities. 10 He said, “I just started a program in Golden Valley. 9, 11, 12, 20 Would you like to come down?” 10, 13, 19 I was patient number ninety-seven of his.  Pat Carnes is now a world famous therapist. 6, 9, 14, 15 My second son is named after him. 5, 6, 20 I went through his program.  I learned about addiction. 12, 17 I learned about core values that addicts have about themselves, low self-esteem. 9, 12, 17 If people knew what I was really like they wouldn’t like me. 6, 10, 12 For me sex was my most important aid.  I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs. 12, 13 You have very little self-worth, self-esteem, you don’t trust people so therefore you have a very secret life. 9, 11 I learned that. 12, 17 While I was there I started going to Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings in the cities. 9, 11, 13, 14 But when I came up here we didn’t have anything. 19 I started a group in Duluth, still going strong. 9, 11 I don’t go to it anymore but I went to it a year ago. 13, 20 I walked into the meeting and folks were like, “Hi how are you?” 10, 13, 17 “Good.”  “Do you know what meeting you’re at?” 13, 14, 15 “Isn’t this Sex Addicts Anonymous?”  “Yes.  How do you know about us?” 13, 14, 15 “I started this meeting in my living room in 1985.” 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 It’s still going strong. 9 After about two years in therapy I started the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction which was an educational organization. 9, 10, 11, 20 What that did for me though was it got me very involved in the twelve steps. 9, 11, 12 I understood the twelve steps. 9, 12 Starting that group in Duluth I can’t tell you how many hundreds of people who I had coffee with that told me their story that needed help. 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 The county jail would call me up, “Verne we have someone up here who needs to talk to you.” 7, 10, 13 I’d go down to the sex offenders program in Moose Lake and they asked me not to come back because they said, “These folks are going to be here the rest of their lives. 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 We’re not going to let them go. 19 You’re telling them that their behaviors are insane.  The second step of the program is belief in a higher power will restore us to sanity. 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 20 By doing that they’re going to claim that they’re insane and they’re going to try to get out of here. 16 We’ll never let these people out of here. 15, 19 We don’t want you to come back here.” 13, 19 “I don’t think this is the right thing to do.” 14 They wouldn’t let me come back. 13, 19 We started SAA meetings here. 9, 11, 13 I got a call and went up to Canada and did it up in Canada. 7 Long story short, that’s what got me involved in the twelve steps. 9, 12, 16 I worked the twelve steps, I know the life of an addict, I know how powerful an addiction is. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The insanity of that addiction.  I’ve been married going on forty years, we have two children. 14, 20 My wife is a medical social worker. 14 She’s soon to retire.  She started a group called COSA. 7, 9, 11 COSA was the AlAnon version for co-dependence of sex addicts. 12 Both of us have this background. 8, 19 When our oldest boy called us up and said, “Mom, Dad I’ve got a problem. 5, 7, 9, 20 I’ve gotten myself addicted to meth.” 5, 15 We were like, “Oh my God. 10 We’ve been down this road.” 9 AS: Did your sons know about your addiction? 13, 14, 15 VW: I told both my boys my story. 8, 9, 20 VW: Probably when they were seventeen, eighteen years old. 15, 20 I started to be on the news media more and more. 6, 9, 11, 13 I got involved with my work with the church.  I filed a lawsuit against the church in 1992.  What I did is I went to the bishop of Duluth who I knew very well. 6, 12 I had dinner with him several times at my mother-in-law’s house. 6, 9, 18 I called him up and said, “Look, I had a priest in Proctor, Father John Nicholson. 7, 9 He molested me. 9 He raped me.  He did that to a bunch of the kids I went to school with. 8, 9 I’m not interested in suing you. 9, 11, 19 All of this is starting to come out in the media about what’s going on. 9, 11, 13, 19 Let’s do something proactive. 10 Let’s reach out to my classmates and say we heard this happened. 12, 13, 15, 20 What can we do as a church to help you heal?” 13 “Come into see me.”  He wouldn’t see me.  He’s an attorney basically, the second in command to the bishop. 7, 11, 20 AS: So the bishop invited you to talk to him but then the bishop didn’t take the meeting. 6, 10, 13 VW: So then this guy meets me. 13 He tells me who he is.  “The bishop won’t be joining us.”  I told him this guy molested me. 9, 20 I said, “I’d like to do something positive with this. 13, 14 I would like to do an outreach to my schoolmates. 8, 10, 13 I think we could heal together.  I think this could be something very positive that we do together.” 13, 14 He said, “I think that’s a great idea. 11 Let me get back to you.” 19 He never did. 15 A couple months later I called him back. 7, 8, 19 “We’re still thinking about it.” 9 He never did. 15 I’m watching Sally Jessy Rafael.  She’s got Father Tom  Doyle and another priest on the show. 9 Tom  Doyle was a lawyer and he was with the embassy, the Vatican Embassy in Washington D.C. He and the priest were charged by the American Association of Bishops to look into this. 9, 17 This was all starting to happen. 9, 11, 12 “Is it really that bad or is it just a few bad priests?” 9, 12 He came back and said, “No, this is huge. 19 We need to do to reach out to these people. 13 We need to do something about it.” 13 They buried his report and said, “If you two want to have a future as priests you’ll forget this ever happened and bury it.” 9, 12, 13 Here these guys on Sally Jessy and they said, “The only way we’re going to get the church to do something right about this is to sue them. 14, 16 Go after their pocketbook.”  I contacted Jeff Anderson from the Twin Cities. 10 They took me on.  I settled the case. 17 The laws got changed in one of the courts. 16 Jeff Anderson calls me up and says, “Verne your lawsuit is dead. 7 Until this gets appealed to a higher court, your lawsuit’s dead.” 8, 15 AS: Because of the reporting?  VW: No it was just the way the law had gotten interpreted. 9, 12, 15, 16 There’s a lot of Catholic judges. 17 He said, “Verne the church will give me enough money to get my money out of this. 6, 20 I can get you a couple thousand bucks.”  I said, “Jeff I told you when I first started this, this has nothing to do with money. 9, 11, 20 This is about keeping the church accountable. 11, 12 You get your money out of this.  I will settle this thing so you can get your money but I will not sign a clause that will keep me quiet. 9, 12, 17 I want to publicly speak about this.” 13 That allowed me then to continue my work as a volunteer.  I think Nicholson had thirty some people that he ended up molesting. 9, 12 AS: That’s the priest? 9 VW: That’s the priest. 9 Since I started that I think the diocese has about thirty or forty priests that have been identified. 9, 11 AS: What’s the name of the organization? 6 VW: SNAP, the Survivor Network of those Abused by Priests. 9 AS: That’s a powerful story. 9, 15 That interests me being raised Catholic. 5, 9, 19 We were at the point where you said you told your boys when they were seventeen and eighteen. 8, 20 VW: Matthew was born in ‘86.  Patrick was born in 1990.  AS: This isn’t until the 2000s.  But you brought this up in ‘92? 9, 18 This was a long process.  VW: Yes.  It was settled in about ‘95. 17 AS: You started speaking out more because it blew up nationally. 9, 11, 16 Your boys were teenagers and they were going to hear you. 8, 18 VW: They were going to hear me on the news. 6, 13 I told my father, “Dad you’re going to hear in the news.” 5, 6, 13, 20 He felt terrible. 15, 17 He absolutely felt terrible. 15, 17 The reason  I’m throwing this at you was this was the framework that I’ve had to be there to help my son. 13 Sometimes you kind of look about why things happen in your life, talking about higher power stuff. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 My son Matthew is a professional dancer, he does dance and theater. 20 He was out in New York.  He had a partner out there, they would go in New York City, it’s all about who you see and being seen. 13 Somebody said, “You ought to try meth.” 5, 16 “Okay.”  He tried it and it was like “Oh my God, this is incredible.” 10, 12 As a dancer, “I’m losing weight because I’m on this stuff. 9, 18 I don’t have to eat as much.” 18 It ended up consuming him. 12 He lost his job, he lost his relationship. 9 He lost pretty much everything. 9, 18 AS: At what point did he call you? 7 VW: He’d been using for about six months when he called me. 7, 8 He called me in the fall. 7 AS: What year is this? 20 VW: He’s been clean for five years. 20 That was seven years ago, 2010. 20 It was 2012 during our flood that I came down. 19 I had to go down to the cities and pick him up, he’d been using. 14 Probably 2010 when he first...I got him involved in a treatment center in New York. 9, 16 This was a revolving door place. 11 “Come on in.  Thirty days. 19 Goodbye.”  He started using again. 9, 11 His partner was very upset. 13, 17, 19 They were hurting for money. 12 His partner finally said, “I’m done.” 13 Matt started sleeping with all kinds of people so he put his partner at risk too. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17 Matt’s gay and it’s all part of that gay lifestyle of New York. 9, 11 His partner said, “I’m done.” 13 He called me up, “Verne, Matt owes me money for rent. 7, 16 Can you help me out?” 13 “Yes.”  I ended up paying his debts. 11, 12, 16 He’d been gone for two weeks on the streets of New York. 9 Nobody knew where he was, none of his friends. 6, 12, 18 I called the St. Louis County attorney who I know. 7, 13, 14, 15 I said, “Mark do you have any contacts in New York City? 10 I’ve got a son that’s using out there.  He’s using meth. 5 I get somebody to look for him?”  “If they find him they’re going to arrest him and he’ll get a felony. 9, 19 I don’t know if you want that. 13, 14, 15 Although they might put him in drug court.” 10, 14 Finally, he made contact with one of his friends. 10, 12, 16, 18 He said, “Matt I’ve got food and stuff in my apartment come on in when you can.” 9, 13, 19, 20 He put a motion detector hooked up to a computer with a camera. 10, 19 When Matt entered his apartment he had him on motion detection. 12, 20 Matt is so gaunt and so out of it.  This guy finally runs home and gets him and has him. 11, 19 I talk to him on the phone. 7, 10 I say, “Matt do you want help or not?” 13 “I don’t know Dad.” 13, 14, 15 “Here’s the deal son. 13 If you want to stay using, then I’m going to put your mom on the phone and I want you to say goodbye to her. 7, 9, 10, 13, 15 Then you’re going to say goodbye to me.  If you want to be an addict, then you choose that and you be an addict. 13 If you don’t think you have a problem that’s your choice. 17 You’re going to lose your family. 18 You have a choice here. 17 You can either have your family and I’ll be there to support you or you can have your meth. 5, 18 That’s your choice. 17 What do you want to do?” 13 My wife is going,  Are you crazy? 16 Are you fucking crazy? 16 What if he says?”  “He has a choice to make: do you have a problem or don’t you? 16, 17 If you’re going to choose your drugs over your family, it’s pretty tough to say you don’t have a problem.” 14, 18 He said, “Dad I don’t want to lose you guys.” 13 I said, “Good.  That’s the right answer. 14 I want you to come home. 13, 19 I can get you into treatment in Minnesota. 9, 16 We have the best treatment centers in the country.” 9, 11, 16 I flew him and his friend home. 7, 12, 19 I was afraid he might take off. 6 I flew them both in. 7 This was retirement money that I had.  AS: Verne you never told me what it is that you do. 15, 20 VW: I railroaded for twenty-nine years. 9, 20 I blew two disks out in my back. 19 I was retired at age forty-seven. 12, 19 I was a union guy.  I represented railroads in Minnesota down at the state legislature. 7, 9 I had success down there and they shipped me to Washington D.C. I was a lobbyist in Washington for a number of years. 9, 20 AS: A lot like your grandfather. 5, 7, 17 VW: My kids were little and I said, “I can’t be a father who comes home on weekends.” 5, 12, 13, 19 I went from assistant national director to a Cub Scout leader here in Duluth. 9, 14 Talk about a little ego change. 16 That’s my background. 8, 19 We got him home. 19 I called the Pride Institute in the Twin Cities. 6, 7, 9 The former director, Joe Meeko, was on my board for the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction. 5, 14, 17 I said, “Is Joe Meeko there?”  “Joe’s gone. 19 We know Joe.” 13, 14, 15 “I’m an old friend of his. 12, 20 I have this gay son who is coming home who is hooked on meth. 5, 19 Can I get him in?”  “Yes you can.”  I picked him up from the cities and he was home for a while. 14, 19 He stole our car and went to the cities and used. 7, 9, 14, 18 The cops pinged his phone and said, “Verne he’s in the Twin Cities. 7 Why don’t you put a health and welfare check on him? 10, 14 If we do find him we can say, ‘Call your parents they’re worried about you.’ 10, 16 If you file a stolen car report, then he’s going to get in trouble and you don’t want that do you?” 7, 9, 13, 18 “I don’t want that. 13 I just want the boy home.” 9, 12, 13, 19 We got up here the night it started raining, what a hellacious night. 9, 11, 19 We got back to Duluth at eleven thirty at night when it started pouring. 9, 11, 19 I was a Red Cross volunteer at the time.  When I get home there’s a call at one in the morning saying, “The city’s flooding out, can you opening up a shelter?” 7, 11, 17, 19, 20 “Yes.”  We have a big church up on the hill and I called that minister and we opened up a shelter for Duluth. 7, 8, 9, 17 It’s only because I remember how crazy this whole shit was. 16 We did a rule twenty-five. 12 The day of the storm we were scheduled to do a rule twenty-five. 9, 12, 19 The social worker from St. Louis County said, “I’ll try to get to my office.” 16 Mary said, “Great, I will be there.”  Mary took a whole bunch of detours and got there and met with the social worker. 5, 9 She did a rule twenty-five. 12 Then a couple days later I got him down to Pride Institute. 6, 9, 19 He was there for ninety days. 19 He got out, they put him in a sober house. 6, 9, 10 They should have put him in a halfway house. 6, 9, 10, 16, 20 Bought all his clothing, food, linens, all this shit. 6, 17 He was there for two days and he’s gone. 19 We’ve both been down this road. 9 Finally, we talk and he’s living at some guy’s house that’s providing a free place to stay. 6, 9, 10, 11 AS: He’s going to work the program on his own?  VW: “You’re on your own.  Good luck.”  After three weeks he calls me up and says, “Can I come home?” 7, 13, 19 I said, “I don’t know. 13, 14, 15 Here’s when you can come home. 13, 19 You go to ninety meetings in ninety days and you get an NA sponsor.” 13, 19 AS: And then you can come home? 13, 19 VW: Then you can come home. 13, 19 “You have to agree to those terms.”  He went to the Center for Drug and Alcohol and they had an outpatient day meeting. 9, 13, 19 He went there and he started going to NA at night. 9, 11, 19 He got a sponsor, a woman from Superior, Robin.  Robin is incredible. 12 She’s been clean from heroin for about twenty-five years now. 14, 20 AS: Is it Robin E?  VW: Yes, Robin E. AS: Robin’s being interviewed right now by my students. 6, 9, 14 VW: I was going to suggest to you that you interview Robin. 6, 9 AS: I found her on NA.  VW: Robin’s incredible. 12 Robin became Matt’s sponsor. 5, 19 Matt did ninety days. 19 He said, “I’m going to do another ninety.”  AS: Is he living here at this point? 6 VW: He’s at home. 19 For two years he was going to NA every day. 19, 20 Then he got on the area board. 5 Then he became the assistant regional. 5, 9, 19 He’s very involved in NA.  He sponsors a number of people.  I got a call from Douglas County, their jail. 7 I criticized them, their county attorney and their jailers. 7 “You’re talking about locking people up longer. 10 You don’t have a treatment program in Northwestern Wisconsin. 9, 16 You just got done saying if you lock people up longer it’s a better idea. 9, 11, 12 I’m not from here, I’m from Duluth, I’m not here to tell you your business. 9 You don’t provide any type of programming while they’re in jail.  If you believe it’s better to keep them in jail, then why the hell aren’t you offering NA in your jail? 12 “I don’t know why not.” 13, 14, 15 “I’ll tell you why not.  You have a policy that you have to be clean for at least two years and you also cannot have a felony on your record to be in a jail. 6, 9, 20 How many heroin addicts and meth addicts do you know that don’t have some sort of record?” 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 17 I got a call the next day from the county jailer. 7, 19 “We’ve changed our policy. 16 Can you come over and start an NA group?” 9, 11, 13, 19 “No I’m not an addict.”  I said to my son, “Son this might be great service work for you.” 11 Nothing was more sobering for me than to hear that big steel door shut behind me and know I was not locked in. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 I said, “I would really recommend you consider that.” 12 He runs an NA group up at that county jail. 7, 11 AS: So Matt still lives here. 9 VW: Yes.  Matt lived with us for two years. 20 Two years of my life I was taking care of my dad who was quite elderly. 7, 11, 20 I was his caretaker up here and I was taking care of Matt at the same time. 6, 7 My life was extremely full. 11 After two years I said, “Son it’s time for you to go.” 20 “You think I’m ready?”  You’re working your program.  You have a higher power you’ve connected with. 8, 15, 18 It’s time for you to go.”  He started, because he’s a professional dance, one of the dance schools called him up. 7, 8, 9, 11, 20 Then he got a call from a theatrical director, “We have a small company in Duluth to not only do choreography for us but we have a couple of lead roles we’d like you to do.” 7, 14 He’s like, “God, Dad I can’t believe this.” 10 “And you thought coming back to Duluth your whole theatrical life was over.” 11, 12, 19 We talked about higher power action. 8, 10, 11, 15 How this was so much higher power that he needed to recognize. 8, 13, 15, 18 “Son when this happens you need to bank this. 12, 13 When you’re feeling very scared if you can recognize that your higher power has been there for you it’s a very comforting thought. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16 You can recognize you might not have the answers about what’s going to happen in life but you can trust that a higher power does.” 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 He got a call from University of Minnesota Duluth campus saying, “We’d like you to teach a class for us.” 7, 8, 11, 13, 20 This last year they called and said, “One of our teachers is going to be gone. 7, 9, 19, 20 We’d like you to be full time on our staff.” 9, 11 He just finished with that. 9, 12 Matt’s been clean for a little over five years. 20 Now he’s headed down to Milwaukee to get his master’s degree. 9, 20 The college folks have said, “Matt we’d love to have you come back.” 8, 13, 19 He says, “I love teaching college level.” 8, 13, 20 But he needs to have his MFA. 13 AS: When did you start the NarAnon group? 9, 11 VW: Three years ago this June. 20 During those first two years you said were hard, you started the NarAnon group after Matt moved out? 8, 9, 11, 20 VW: Pretty much. 18 He’d been here for a little while when we started the NarAnon group. 9, 11 AS: Tell me why you started the NarAnon group. 9, 11 VW: I wanted to start NarAnon because what we went through and what every parent goes through is the darkest shit. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 You just can’t get over how dark this is. 9, 12 It felt like I had something to give to people. 6, 17 It’s the old thing about turning lemons into lemonade. 19, 20 Trying to do something positive. 13, 14 Three years ago I contacted the mayor of Duluth, Don Ness, and I said, “Mayor we’ve got this opiate problem going on. 9, 10, 20 We can’t rely on the police to do this. 7 This is bigger than the police. 7, 8 We need to start some sort of community organization. 9, 11, 13, 17 Some sort of community task force. 17 I would like to offer you my services to do that.” 10, 14 I started the NarAnon by contacting the police chief and saying, “We’re going to do this NarAnon group. 7, 9, 10, 11 Would you put that on your Facebook page that we’re going to do that at Miller-Dwan Meeting Room at this date?” 10, 20 I did that with the Superior police chief too. 7 We had ten people at our very first meeting. 9, 13 The police, I’m getting calls all the time with them. 7 The mayor said, “I think we need to do more than what we’re doing.” 9, 13 He put me in touch with the police chief and he said, “There’s a group called the Opiate Advisory Response Strategy group, OARS group. 7, 10, 15 I will make it happen that you can be on that group.” 12, 16 I joined them.  I do not have a formal education. 10, 17 I’m a high school graduate. 8 In Proctor High School I was the valedictorian of my class with a 2.7 grade point average. 8, 20 Just kidding. 9 I always joke in Proctor it’s all about trains. 16, 17 I got on that.  It’s a lot of doctors, very professional people. 17, 20 We were meeting just to meet. 9, 12, 13 It was becoming a clearinghouse of information but nobody was doing anything. 6, 9, 17 I got ahold of Maggie Kazel and a couple other people. 20 We have all this talent, all this expertise in this room and we’re not doing anything with it. 7 We need to do more. 13 I started speaking more. 9, 11, 16 I started letting these people know that we have too many kids who are dying of overdoses. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 We’re doing a lot of talking but now it’s time to take this talk and go into action. 6, 10, 14, 17 We started holding public meetings. 9, 11, 13, 20 I got everybody to break off into small groups. 18 We have committees on harm reduction, on support, treatment programs. 9, 12, 16 Biggest thing we found in treatment is lack of access to treatment. 6, 9, 16 Five to seven-week window to try to get into treatment. 9, 16 I got on all those committees.  I started pushing like hell to say this is not enough. 9, 11, 20 People listened. 9, 15, 17 We just put in a one point four million dollar grant to the Department of Human Services. 7, 9, 10, 12 We’re supposed to hear something by the end of May. 6, 12 I’ve been meeting with the mayor. 9, 13 The mayor put the opioid epidemic as her first priority for the state of the city address this year. 9, 10, 14, 19, 20 She’s going to hold a summit. 20 I went down to the legislature and met with some people. 5 We’re all going to get together in one room with county commissioners, legislatures, the mayor, the police, treatment centers. 7, 9, 16 I’ve been pushing for these rapid response groups where if somebody overdoses we go in there with a rule twenty-five, we have a place for them to go, we have people from the recovery community to meet with them and say this is my story. 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 We get them into a program where they stay overnight for a week or two weeks, get them on Suboxone or medically assisted treatment as soon as we can. 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 19 It’s a continuous thing.  The police chief just told me, “We’ve decided to adopt the Gloucester community model.” 7, 9, 12, 15, 20 That’s in Massachusetts. 9, 17 “If people come to our precinct and say 13, 19 ‘We no longer want to do this. 13 Here’s our stuff, here’s our drugs.’ 9, 14 We will not arrest them. 9, 19 We will bring them right into treatment and walk them through the steps so they are not alone.” 9, 12, 14, 16 Now they have Narcan being distributed everywhere. 9 I’m with the rescue squad.  VW: If there’s a car accident, if there’s a drowning, people are lost in the woods, if there’s an overdose, all that kind of stuff. 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17 A lot of the overdoses I get are people who are lost or committed suicide. 9, 15, 17 AS: Do you have Narcan in there?  VW: We do not but we are getting it.  I have Narcan in the house. 6, 9 I keep it here. 12 I let all my neighbors know I have Narcan in the house. 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19 That’s how I’ve gotten involved in this. 15 This is more involved than I wanted to get. 12, 13 AS: You’re still on the committee. 9 VW: The committee gave me this award not long ago.  It’s from the Public Health Department.  It’s an achievement award.  The county gave me this about two weeks ago. 7 “This is for the work that you’ve done.”  I’m a volunteer.  That’s the nice part about being a volunteer.  I can speak my mind and say what I want to say. 13 AS: You’re not at risk.  You’re not beholden to anyone. 20 You’re like the voice of the community.  VW: That’s what they’re calling me. 7 AS: That’s really powerful, especially in this current crisis that we’re in. 15, 16, 20 They stay siloed, this task force idea is great. 9, 11 You can sit around and talk but if you don’t do anything there’s no point in meeting. 8, 10, 13 VW: The folks on the range called me up and they want to do the same thing, “Will you come up and meet with us?” 7, 13, 19 I don’t have any magic bullets on this thing. 19 I’m just trying to get people… 9, 12, 16 AS: You’re saying you don’t have the answers. 11 AS: You’re coming to it from a place of humility. 11 VW: If I had an answer I’d throw it out there.  All I’m saying is I believe in the twelve step programs. 9, 11, 12 I think medically assisted treatment has to have a finite end to it. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 We need to work addicts to a point where they go, “I’ve tapered off of it. 12, 13 Let’s stay involved in the twelve step community and let’s live a twelve step life.” 9, 11, 12, 19 Everybody kinds of cringes when I say this but I want to start a two year or a three-year treatment program where people can come to it and live there for two or three years and get stabilized. 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 It was two years for my son to really get back to his old mental self. 14, 19, 20 He doesn’t remember half of the stuff that went on when we talk about it. 9, 10, 20 As parents you just don’t get it. 9, 10, 12, 16 All you can think of is, “How in the world don’t you realize how bad this is for you?” 14, 15 We talk about at our twelve step meetings about expectations and fears. 9, 10, 12, 13 Don’t have expectations, recognize that the addict can’t do that.  If you have expectations you’re setting the addict up to fail, yourself up to fail. 17 All you’re doing honestly is putting more shame on the addict. 9, 10, 16 Then you’re mad, “Why are you doing this to me?  If you love me, you wouldn’t do this to me.” 13 I think that’s part of the important message that in NarAnon we get to talk about. 10 I try to share that when I do public speaking. 16 As a NarAnon person I say, “I’m a part of NarAnon but I’m not speaking tonight representing NarAnon.” 7, 16, 19 Same with this OARS group I’m a part of.  I say, “I’m a member of NarAnon but I do not represent NarAnon at this meeting. 7, 13 Please know that. 13, 14, 15 I’m a volunteer.”  AS: The anonymity thing worked in the time period that it was developed. 15, 16 There was a need for privacy and anonymity. 13, 15 For some people there is a need for privacy but the anonymous part hasn’t really helped us understand addiction as a society. 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 It’s only kept shame alive.  I think we are about to move into a new time. 6 My experience as a mother of a teenager who was going off the rails that other parents didn’t want to talk to me. 10, 13, 16 I felt ashamed. 17 I wanted to talk but parents of other troublemaker kids didn’t want to talk. 10, 12, 13, 16 They didn’t want to admit they weren’t in control or their kids were struggling too. 9, 13, 17 It was the most alienating thing.  I remember thinking “Why when they’re little babies we’ll talk about the color of their poop and when they’re teenagers we can’t talk about the social problems they’re having.” 10, 18 How can I as another parent help you? 10, 13, 16 I’m talking about long before addiction came into my life. 10, 11, 19 Just normal teenage acting out. 9, 10 We don’t support each other in things we feel shame around. 8, 16 VW: I look at how that reflects on the child.  When the child knows the family is shamed of them what does that do for the child’s self-esteem and self-worth? 9, 13, 14, 15, 18 “I’m the black sheep of the family. 18 I’m the bad one.  They don’t even want to talk about me.” 10, 13, 15 I explained that to my son.  We talked about shame, we talked about the core beliefs of the addict. 10, 11 “Drugs are my most important aid.  If people knew what I was like they wouldn’t like me. 6, 10, 12 I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs.” 12, 13 Those are some of the core beliefs that addicts have to go through.  The major one is “I am basically a bad person. 7, 11, 18 No matter how many times I have tried to stop my addiction I have not stopped. 9, 10, 18, 20 I have to be a bad person.  I have prayed about it.  I have gone to treatment about it. 9, 16 I have made promises to my mother, my father, my wife, my kids. 5, 16 I’ve responsibilities to my children, to my family. 14, 18 I have thrown them all away to take care of my addiction. 6, 7, 16 What an asshole of a person I am.”  That’s a terrible thing to live a life of that. 11, 15 That’s why it’s important that we have this public education and stop that stigma. 9, 10 Do you mind if I read this letter of this kid? 19 It kind of ties into this. 16, 17 AS: You can tell a little bit about it.  VW: A NarAnon mom just lost her son. 9, 12, 15 He took his own life because he was addicted to heroin and he couldn’t stop it. 9, 10, 11 He was ashamed of his behavior.  He felt like a failure. 17 This is an apology letter that he left his mother. 19 “Mom, Words can’t come into place for the way I’ve been feeling for a while now and I know you’re going to want to blame part of this on yourself because you gave me more money. 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 This is the most peaceful way I could have done it.” 16 He put a hose from his exhaust pipe into his truck. 9, 10 That’s how he died.  “It would have happened no matter what but this was the cleanest least sufferable. 9, 12, 13, 20 You and Dad did an amazing job with what life threw at you and not a lot of people would have been able to handle it. 11, 15, 17 I love you Mom and thank you for being the best you could possibly be. 9, 13 Ok suicide by heroin didn’t work.  I know you’re wondering why I did this and I will tell you. 13, 14, 15 Monday I went in to do one of my weekly eye scanners and ninety-nine percent of the time it says I’m clean and I most certainly am not clean. 9, 16, 19 Obviously I started using again. 9, 11 I’m pretty sure probation was going to work for me anymore. 10, 13, 15, 18 I also needed to learn how to get clean off heroin on my own. 12, 13 Probation isn’t going to hold my hand for the rest of my life. 9, 11, 19, 20 I found a way to stay off heroin though. 9, 11, 16 I’ve been smoking weed.  To probation weed isn’t legal so there’s no possible way to overlook that. 10, 16 If you need to substitute drugs it needs to be Suboxone or methadone or destruxin which are no different than heroin. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17 They all get you high. 8 They all make you totally dependent on them and they all make you sick when you don’t use them every single day. 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19 That’s why most addicts are in court systems in the first place. 8, 9, 11 We get sick and we do anything to use again. 9 I can stop using weed for however long I want and I’m sure as shit I don’t get the least bit sick. 9, 10, 13, 15 I don’t even nod off in public. 15 If for some reason I do need to increase my dosage the same thing happens if increased, nothing. 12, 13 I’ve tried just about everything besides this. 9, 10, 12 I know you’re thinking prison would change me but not in the way anyone would want. 13, 14, 15, 16 Most importantly how I wouldn’t want. 13 I’ve met enough of Duluth’s finest in county and I’d rather not meet anymore. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 20 Please don’t leave my body in the ground either. 6, 8 I don’t mind if you have an open casket funeral but please cremate me. 17 I’ve always had the belief that if your body stays in the ground then so do you but if you’re cremated then you get free.” 8, 9, 16, 17 That is tragic.  Thanks for sharing that.  VW: This epidemic is extremely powerful. 15 Those of us that it affects, it affects all of us.  It doesn’t matter if you’re a parent, it affects all of us. 10, 16, 20 AS: You can’t be in a room with more than fifteen people with someone who knows someone. 7, 13, 14, 15 VW: I think of all the children that are in foster care because their parents are in addiction. 7, 9, 10, 14, 16 I think of all the problems those kids are going to have.  This is not something we can sit on and allow people to die. 13 That’s pretty much why I’m here. 18 This is what got me involved with all this.  AS: Thank you.  It’s a really powerful story. 9, 15 VW: You’re welcome. 13, 19 I didn’t say it but with my sexual addiction I had been clean and gotten into SAA and did all the stuff I did and was able to put all that behind me. 9, 10, 15 Thank God for that.  AS: You know it can happen for addiction. 12, 13, 14, 15 VW: I know people who have eating disorders, who have so many other kinds of addictions. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 I have been handing a gift, going through all this crap that I’ve gone through.  I have a lot of insights. 17 AS: Thank you.  [End of Interview] "

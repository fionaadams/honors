"1805","doc4_255","I have not a bad word to say about them.","V7",1,"Bining_Colford_Janie",255

"2207","doc5_83","SD: What do I see?","V1",1,"Brunner_Emily",83
"2208","doc5_84","I guess where I really started to notice things in, you know, I saw this in California when I was living there because I was selling drugs out of a house holder.","V14",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",84
"2209","doc5_85","It was like a low-income kind of housing thing where a lot of people were getting medications.","V13",0.777777777777778,"Brunner_Emily",85
"2210","doc5_86","So they were trading their medications for cocaine.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",86
"2211","doc5_87","And so they would trade me oxycontin, things like that.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",87
"2212","doc5_88","And I would take that, trade them crack for it, and go and sell the opiate medications to somebody else that would go and sell them to rich, affluent housewives in [Loyola], California area which is pretty affluent.","V14",0.454545454545455,"Brunner_Emily",88
"2213","doc5_89","So I saw it back then and how it was really affecting people, but I saw more of the upper class people using it.","V8",0.625,"Brunner_Emily",89
"2214","doc5_90","Heroin wasn't really something I saw too much of.","V7",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",90
"2215","doc5_91","I used heroin for about a month when I lived in California because it was just what was out there for the time, but it was black tar back then.","V9",0.555555555555556,"Brunner_Emily",91
"2216","doc5_92","But I remember the friends I used with having to need it on a daily basis getting sick, and us having to drive around just to get ten dollars worth of heroin.","V6",0.466666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",92
"2217","doc5_93","And slapping people around.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",93
"2218","doc5_94","The old way of trying to reverse an overdose.","V7",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",94
"2219","doc5_95","Throwing them in my bathtub in cold water, and things like that.","V6",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",95
"2220","doc5_96","Trying to bring them back.","V13",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",96
"2221","doc5_97","And luckily that apparently worked.","V4",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",97
"2222","doc5_98","[laughs]","V5",1,"Brunner_Emily",98
"2223","doc5_99","Because it really doesn't.","V3",1,"Brunner_Emily",99
"2224","doc5_100","So I saw it out there, but I guess I started to see it more when I came into the field, and in my internships a few years back that more and more people were coming in for opiate use.","V2",0.416666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",100
"2225","doc5_101","For treatment.","V3",1,"Brunner_Emily",101
"2226","doc5_102","And I think that's when my harm reduction stance changed, because I went into treatment where it was like abstinence based.","V15",0.857142857142857,"Brunner_Emily",102
"2227","doc5_103","You go to NA, you go to AA.",NA,NA,NA,103

"2229","doc5_105","That kind of stuff.","V6",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",105
"2230","doc5_106","Those were like the messages I heard from going to those meetings.","V10",1,"Brunner_Emily",106
"2231","doc5_107","And I stopped going because I didn't want to live in fear the rest of my life.","V5",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",107
"2232","doc5_108","I had lived in fear all my life as it is.","V9",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",108
"2233","doc5_109","And I just thought if this is what I have to do forever, and the other thing is like meditation and some of this other stuff isn't good enough.","V7",0.714285714285714,"Brunner_Emily",109
"2234","doc5_110","I don't want to do that.","V4",1,"Brunner_Emily",110
"2235","doc5_111","It didn't make sense to me.","V13",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",111
"2236","doc5_112","So I stopped the NA thing years ago and started implementing harm reduction in my own life.","V8",0.625,"Brunner_Emily",112
"2237","doc5_113","I drink alcohol.","V6",1,"Brunner_Emily",113
"2238","doc5_114","But I don't use drugs.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",114
"2239","doc5_115","I just can't use illicit drugs because I don't do them well, or I do them too well depending on how you want to look at it.","V10",0.625,"Brunner_Emily",115
"2240","doc5_116","[laughs]","V5",1,"Brunner_Emily",116
"2241","doc5_117","I've had enough of those.","V7",1,"Brunner_Emily",117
"2242","doc5_118","I'm still around luckily.","V11",1,"Brunner_Emily",118
"2243","doc5_119","But I think I saw in my internship like I said was that I had a lot of clients coming in that weren't willing, or weren't ready to stop using everything.","V7",0.454545454545455,"Brunner_Emily",119
"2244","doc5_120","And so I was referring people to places like Minnesota Alternatives, which is more of a harm reduction program.","V15",0.714285714285714,"Brunner_Emily",120
"2245","doc5_121","I don't know if you've heard about that.","V14",1,"Brunner_Emily",121
"2246","doc5_122","I heard of Minnesota Alternatives.","V15",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",122
"2247","doc5_123","I went to a conference out here called MAARCH [Minnesota Association of Resources for Recovery and Chemical Health] years ago early on in school.","V12",0.583333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",123
"2248","doc5_124","Paula DeSanto is the owner, former owner I believe of Minnesota Alternatives, which is like a harm reduction based program where they teach people how to lessen their use.","V15",0.636363636363636,"Brunner_Emily",124
"2249","doc5_125","Because if I don't want to quit drinking completely, but I want to learn how to drink three alcohol drinks a night, or whatever it is and be successful that's how they work instead of kicking them out of treatment because you haven't stopped.","V6",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",125
"2250","doc5_126","And so it had a lot of people coming in that just weren't ready to stop all drugs.","V4",0.428571428571429,"Brunner_Emily",126
"2251","doc5_127","And for me to set them up into my program or to an inpatient program knowing that they're going to need to use and they're just going to get kicked out made no sense to me.","V10",0.272727272727273,"Brunner_Emily",127
"2252","doc5_128","So I was referring outside of the company I worked for [laughs].","V8",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",128
"2253","doc5_129","I was like it's not about my treatment; it's about their success.","V1",1,"Brunner_Emily",129
"2254","doc5_130","So I decided to look into a different realm, and wanted to do something that was more harm reduction and methadone was really interesting to me.","V14",0.555555555555556,"Brunner_Emily",130
"2255","doc5_131","I kept seeing like I said more and more clients coming in that had either been on methadone or were using heroin or prescription pain killers who had lost a ton of people in their lives based from overdose, and I just thought this is where I need to be.","V6",0.277777777777778,"Brunner_Emily",131
"2256","doc5_132","And came to Valhalla Place two and a half years ago now almost.","V8",0.75,"Brunner_Emily",132
"2257","doc5_133","What else do you want to know?","V10",1,"Brunner_Emily",133
"2258","doc5_134","What am I seeing now?","V7",1,"Brunner_Emily",134
"2259","doc5_135","ZM: Could you just describe more of what you do at Valhalla?","V3",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",135
"2260","doc5_136","And what Valhalla does?","V1",1,"Brunner_Emily",136
"2261","doc5_137","SD: Absolutely.","V13",1,"Brunner_Emily",137
"2262","doc5_138","Valhalla is a medically assisted treatment program, so we provide methadone or Suboxone to patients that are opiate dependent for at least one year.","V3",0.363636363636364,"Brunner_Emily",138
"2263","doc5_139","So they have to have been abusing an opiate for a year prior to even being eligible for our program.","V2",0.4,"Brunner_Emily",139
"2264","doc5_140","ZM: Is that like regular—daily, weekly?","V15",1,"Brunner_Emily",140
"2265","doc5_141","SD: You know, it depends on the person.","V3",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",141
"2266","doc5_142","So whether it was something they were maybe originally getting prescribed, and they're supposed to take three of them a day and now they're taking maybe six or eight or ten.","V6",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",142
"2267","doc5_143","But they're seeing withdrawal symptoms when they don't have them.","V2",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",143
"2268","doc5_144","Or if it was heroin on the streets.","V6",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",144
"2269","doc5_145","Things like that based on use, and not being able to use as prescribed.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",145
"2270","doc5_146","Or if it's illicit use and having withdrawal if they don't have their substance around.","V2",0.75,"Brunner_Emily",146
"2271","doc5_147","We can come in and help them with giving them methadone, Suboxone, which can eliminate the withdrawal and the cravings so they don't have to use those substances anymore.","V13",0.444444444444444,"Brunner_Emily",147
"2272","doc5_148","ZM: And the year cut-off—is that just an arbitrary line?","V6",0.75,"Brunner_Emily",148
"2273","doc5_149","SD: Yeah.",NA,NA,NA,149
"2274","doc5_150","It's kind of a weird line that's drawn in the sand that, you know, now it's kind of hard because there are people that will call that are at eleven months, but they just don't qualify for the program.","V7",0.307692307692308,"Brunner_Emily",150
"2275","doc5_151","I believe that's federal.","V12",1,"Brunner_Emily",151
"2276","doc5_152","Like a federal guideline that there's this magical number that a year I have to have been abusing these things.","V7",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",152
"2277","doc5_153","Even though some people can do a lot of damage in six months.","V8",0.75,"Brunner_Emily",153
"2278","doc5_154","Especially now with what's out there.","V2",1,"Brunner_Emily",154
"2279","doc5_155","They just wouldn't be able to qualify for the medication.","V2",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",155
"2280","doc5_156","Their insurance won't, and they're not appropriate for treatment here, which sucks.","V9",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",156
"2281","doc5_157","ZM: Do you see people attempting to fabricate— SD:","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",157
"2282","doc5_158","Yes, oh absolutely.","V13",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",158
"2283","doc5_159","ZM: How do you tell?","V4",1,"Brunner_Emily",159
"2284","doc5_160","SD: Absolutely.","V4",1,"Brunner_Emily",160
"2285","doc5_161","Every now and then we will see people who come in—because we do a screening process with everybody whether it's over the phone, or they physically come in here.","V11",0.444444444444444,"Brunner_Emily",161
"2286","doc5_162","A lot of times, especially in certain communities, the Native communities especially some of the reservations where they don't have treatment options.","V2",0.4,"Brunner_Emily",162
"2287","doc5_163","They really don't have the resources out there.","V1",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",163
"2288","doc5_164","We will sometimes see families trying to come in, or sending their family members here, and they go through the screening process and you can kind of tell they've been coached on what to say.","V10",0.416666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",164
"2289","doc5_165","But if you word things differently, and I've been trained enough to—and being a former...when every word that came out of my mouth was a lie in the past, I'm pretty good at seeing when people are not telling me entirely the truth, or don't know what to say.","V7",0.473684210526316,"Brunner_Emily",165
"2290","doc5_166","So I can word things a little bit differently.","V7",0.6,"Brunner_Emily",166
"2291","doc5_167","There have been times in the past where I've done a chemical health assessment on them first to just kind of get what they've been using, get some more information versus just the screening process of it.","V10",0.6,"Brunner_Emily",167
"2292","doc5_168","And they haven't been coached enough for that.","V13",1,"Brunner_Emily",168
"2293","doc5_169","So then I can see, you know, you're not going to qualify for our program.","V4",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",169
"2294","doc5_170","I think the bigger idea hopefully is that they're family or somebody is trying to get them in here so that maybe they can get the medication for another family that can't get here, or doesn't have the insurance, but for us to admit somebody that doesn't need this program, all we're doing is opening a door to something that's going to cause more harm.","V13",0.421052631578947,"Brunner_Emily",170
"2295","doc5_171","Especially if they're an opiate naive person or not, using opiates to start them on methadone or Suboxone is just going to...cause an addiction problem they didn't have.","V2",0.727272727272727,"Brunner_Emily",171
"2296","doc5_172","We do a little bit of things around that.","V14",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",172
"2297","doc5_173","For the most part I think people are calling because they know it works, and they don't want to do this anymore.","V1",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",173
"2298","doc5_174","We answer our phone here twenty-four hours a day.","V11",1,"Brunner_Emily",174
"2299","doc5_175","If the phone rings and somebody's trying to get in here on a Sunday night and they qualify for our program we'll try to get them in on Monday or Tuesday morning and get them their medication, and start them with counseling here.","V12",0.333333333333333,"Brunner_Emily",175
"2300","doc5_176","So, my job here is a counselor here.","V1",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",176
"2301","doc5_177","I am an LADC, licensed alcohol and drug counselor.","V2",0.75,"Brunner_Emily",177
"2302","doc5_178","I'm also a certified prevention professional through the Minnesota board out here as well.","V2",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",178
"2303","doc5_179","But I still created a new job a year and a half ago or so here, so I'm like the harm reduction specialist is my title [laughs].","V8",0.416666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",179
"2304","doc5_180","Sort of that I made up.","V5",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",180
"2305","doc5_181","I saw a need in the community, not only in our facility, but outside of here where people weren't getting Naloxone.","V5",0.285714285714286,"Brunner_Emily",181

"2307","doc5_183","Colleges, even the colleges I went to—we didn't talk about methadone or Suboxone.","V2",0.666666666666667,"Brunner_Emily",183
"2308","doc5_184","We didn't talk about harm reduction in school.","V15",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",184
"2309","doc5_185","It was like a five minute little thing.","V11",1,"Brunner_Emily",185
"2310","doc5_186","I see how beneficial it is right now especially with what's going on in the state.","V2",1,"Brunner_Emily",186
"2311","doc5_187","That there's a huge need for education out there, so I've spent my own free time educating myself as much as possible.","V4",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",187

"2325","doc5_201","They were overdosing daily over there and nobody was doing anything about it, and the community was begging for help.","V6",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",201
"2326","doc5_202","I've got friends who live there, I've got a lot of clients over there.","V5",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",202
"2327","doc5_203","I really have a great passion for the Native American community.","V1",0.5,"Brunner_Emily",203

"4360","doc7_268","That gave him intel.","V9",1,"Coleman_Brandon",268
"4361","doc7_269","Yeah.",NA,NA,NA,269
"4362","doc7_270","And worked to figure how to not manipulate, but change the system internally to move this movement forward because again the reason it was so easy to get passionate about this work was A, I had previous experience with it, but it was so easy to care for people that nobody else gave a shit about.","V13",0.789473684210526,"Coleman_Brandon",270
"4363","doc7_271","That is why I did it.",NA,NA,NA,271
"4364","doc7_272","And that is what kept me really passionate, and like sober.","V5",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",272
"4365","doc7_273","And I had made that commitment, and I wasn't able to do the good work that I was doing if I was a crystal meth addict.","V5",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",273
"4366","doc7_274","[laughs]","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",274
"4367","doc7_275","Some people can.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",275
"4368","doc7_276","Lee is a good example of one.","V3",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",276
"4369","doc7_277","But I wasn't.",NA,NA,NA,277
"4370","doc7_278","I never tried, but I wouldn't.","V6",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",278
"4371","doc7_279","[laughs]","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",279
"4372","doc7_280","So that was when I went and I called Chuck [Hilger] one day.","V5",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",280
"4373","doc7_281","I met Chuck.","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",281
"4374","doc7_282","Well, actually I met Karen Greensend.","V1",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",282
"4375","doc7_283","She was the owner of Valhalla Place.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",283
"4376","doc7_284","She was crazy, in many ways, a friend of mine.","V8",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",284
"4377","doc7_285","Crazy in a good way.","V14",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",285
"4378","doc7_286","Motivated.","V1",0,"Coleman_Brandon",286
"4379","doc7_287","She didn't have a box either.","V3",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",287
"4380","doc7_288","The only other person I've met like that.","V7",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",288
"4381","doc7_289","And she just came and crashed a meeting one day.","V11",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",289
"4382","doc7_290","She was like, ""Oh, they're having a drug user meeting over at MAP?","V6",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",290
"4383","doc7_291","I'm going!""",NA,NA,NA,291
"4384","doc7_292","She just showed up, and she had started this methadone clinic and was trying to learn about the community and get her clinic going, and it was called Valhalla Place.","V1",0.461538461538462,"Coleman_Brandon",292
"4385","doc7_293","I don't remember when they opened, but now they're the biggest provider in the state.","V1",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",293
"4386","doc7_294","AS: It wasn't even ten years ago.","V8",1,"Coleman_Brandon",294
"4387","doc7_295","AF: Yeah.",NA,NA,NA,295
"4388","doc7_296","AS: Right, if you're talking about 2009.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",296
"4389","doc7_297","AF: Yeah.",NA,NA,NA,297
"4390","doc7_298","And that's when I met her.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",298
"4391","doc7_299","I was working at Red Door and we went to this meeting and she was there.","V12",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",299
"4392","doc7_300","We clicked right away and we stayed in touch.","V10",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",300
"4393","doc7_301","I talked to her about maybe wanting to work there.","V11",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",301
"4394","doc7_302","She ran a methadone clinic.","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",302
"4395","doc7_303","It was a really good overlap of public health and a medical clinic and harm reduction and working with drug users.","V15",0.545454545454545,"Coleman_Brandon",303
"4396","doc7_304","I mean it was a perfect fit for me in my next transition.","V13",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",304
"4397","doc7_305","But it was a private company so it was something I wasn't used to.","V8",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",305
"4398","doc7_306","I was always used to working with non-profits and government.","V1",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",306
"4399","doc7_307","The time came.","V1",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",307
"4400","doc7_308","I met Chuck.","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",308
"4401","doc7_309","He became the executive director and I reached out to him and I said, ""Hey, Chuck.","V5",0.285714285714286,"Coleman_Brandon",309
"4402","doc7_310","I have this big donation of needles that was provided by somebody across the country that mailed"" —I don't remember how honestly I got them, but it was this big pallet full of needles that someone offered me—and I said, ""I would like to store them there, because I don't want to put them in my house, at the Valhalla clinic.""","V1",0.736842105263158,"Coleman_Brandon",310
"4403","doc7_311","And he said, ""Okay, well I'll talk to Karen.""","V10",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",311
"4404","doc7_312","And Karen is like, ""Sure, I don't care.""","V5",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",312
"4405","doc7_313","And I said, ""If I store them there would it be okay if I came once a week and then gave them out?","V9",1,"Coleman_Brandon",313
"4406","doc7_314","Like on a Friday if I gave needles out to people?","V4",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",314
"4407","doc7_315","And we started a little needle exchange?""","V15",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",315
"4408","doc7_316","And he's like, ""Okay, sure.""","V14",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",316
"4409","doc7_317","[laughs]","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",317
"4410","doc7_318","And so that little needle exchange started.","V15",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",318
"4411","doc7_319","I got a bunch of people involved.","V6",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",319
"4412","doc7_320","I used to go to speak at these—the HIV prevention world had interns at the U of M, and public health students.","V2",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",320
"4413","doc7_321","I talked about my passion, and it rubbed off on people and they wanted to get involved.","V13",0.833333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",321
"4414","doc7_322","So then I had all these like bachelor's level, sometimes master's level, public health students that were like running this needle exchange program out of a methadone clinic with me with the support of Valhalla Place, and I thought this is a really good way to get people to come in to a clinic setting, become familiar with it, and then enroll in services.","V1",0.379310344827586,"Coleman_Brandon",322
"4415","doc7_323","It's like a marketing tool.","V2",1,"Coleman_Brandon",323
"4416","doc7_324","And that was kind of like, oh, I started to get into the business thinking of it as like public health and working within a private company and seeing how we were able to do good but make money.","V13",0.4375,"Coleman_Brandon",324
"4417","doc7_325","AS: And sustain yourselves, sustain the business because non-profits are so dependent on grants that are the whims of the government.","V5",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",325
"4418","doc7_326","AF: Right.","V2",1,"Coleman_Brandon",326
"4419","doc7_327","And so I was able to convince them that you should invest money into this because this is good for your bottom line, and it's also good to get people into treatment, which is why we are ultimately here.","V3",0.545454545454545,"Coleman_Brandon",327
"4420","doc7_328","The CFO of organizations may not think that way, but the people who start the programs do.","V2",1,"Coleman_Brandon",328
"4421","doc7_329","And that's all the counselors, and clients, you know, they're all about the treatment.","V2",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",329
"4422","doc7_330","So, and I was all about the harm reduction and started the needle exchange.","V15",0.8,"Coleman_Brandon",330
"4423","doc7_331","And then I asked if I could work there.","V1",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",331
"4424","doc7_332","I was hired as their Harm Reduction Services Director, I think was my title, and I was there for about a year.","V15",0.875,"Coleman_Brandon",332
"4425","doc7_333","The needle exchange was successful, and I went to a conference.","V15",1,"Coleman_Brandon",333
"4426","doc7_334","It was a White Earth Hep C conference in 2015, yes, 2015.","V15",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",334
"4427","doc7_335","It was in May.","V15",1,"Coleman_Brandon",335
"4428","doc7_336","When I was there I got a phone call from Chuck and he was like, ""Oh, you know our CFO is bitching that you're just footing around at conferences and not generating revenue for us.","V5",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",336
"4429","doc7_337","You should really ask around and just see if there are opportunities for partnering and doing something with other organizations.""","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",337
"4430","doc7_338","So I asked around, and again White Earth is my tribe.","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",338
"4431","doc7_339","I ran into Clinton Alexander, and he's like, ""Yeah, I totally know exactly who needs you.","V14",0.375,"Coleman_Brandon",339
"4432","doc7_340","There's this new program they are trying to start called the MOMS program, and they're looking for a Suboxone provider.""","V7",0.375,"Coleman_Brandon",340
"4433","doc7_341","I was like—went over and talked to them and Julie Williams she was the manager.","V15",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",341
"4434","doc7_342","And Mina Spalla, she was the nurse.","V9",1,"Coleman_Brandon",342
"4435","doc7_343","And they were directed by Tribal Council to direct this program in like three months.","V10",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",343
"4436","doc7_344","And they had everything they needed.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",344
"4437","doc7_345","They had the counseling, and the mental health, and the nursing.","V15",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",345
"4438","doc7_346","They had everything they needed to run a program they just didn't have the prescribing doctors.","V2",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",346
"4439","doc7_347","And so I said, ""Can I be of assistance?""","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",347
"4440","doc7_348","They said, ""Well, if you can get prescribing—a doctor for us that would be awesome.""","V1",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",348
"4441","doc7_349","So called Chuck and said, ""Hey, Chuck these guys need a prescriber.","V10",0.714285714285714,"Coleman_Brandon",349
"4442","doc7_350","Is it okay to do telehealth?","V9",1,"Coleman_Brandon",350
"4443","doc7_351","Like how do we do this?",NA,NA,NA,351
"4444","doc7_352","He said, ""Yeah.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",352
"4445","doc7_353","If we can get the software to do this let's do telehealth and we'll just start the program.""","V10",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",353
"4446","doc7_354","So then I met with some folks from administration and talked with them and they were supportive of the partnership and wanted to proceed with a contract.","V1",0.285714285714286,"Coleman_Brandon",354
"4447","doc7_355","We started with a program that had, I don't—I want to say like seventeen days to get the program going and we did it.","V10",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",355
"4448","doc7_356","We met the deadline.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",356
"4449","doc7_357","I think we did it in fifteen days.","V3",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",357
"4450","doc7_358","So, you know, I worked with—Valhalla Place at that time was a big organization, so I had access to nursing staff, and as a team we put it together very quickly.","V1",0.857142857142857,"Coleman_Brandon",358
"4451","doc7_359","AS: Was this before they transitioned to Meridian or Alina?","V1",0,"Coleman_Brandon",359
"4452","doc7_360","AF: Before, yeah this was before.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",360
"4453","doc7_361","So this was Valhalla Place prior to the Meridian merger.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",361
"4454","doc7_362","Right around that time actually.","V3",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",362
"4455","doc7_363","So White Earth did this to address the babies that were born exposed to opiates.","V2",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",363
"4456","doc7_364","And were being removed from the home.","V12",1,"Coleman_Brandon",364
"4457","doc7_365","It was a huge problem on the White Earth Reservation.","V15",0.8,"Coleman_Brandon",365
"4458","doc7_366","All reservations really.","V7",1,"Coleman_Brandon",366
"4459","doc7_367","And this was an approach—they wanted specifically Suboxone.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",367
"4460","doc7_368","They didn't want to do methadone.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",368
"4461","doc7_369","This was an approach they wanted to move forward with because it was what they learned was the evidence based way to deal with it.","V13",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",369
"4462","doc7_370","And there was this reluctance, and it was controversial, but there was also urgency and other things weren't working.","V15",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",370
"4463","doc7_371","The program started.","V7",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",371
"4464","doc7_372","We did the prescribing through Valhalla Place.","V1",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",372
"4465","doc7_373","Patients met with the doctors.","V2",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",373
"4466","doc7_374","We had telehealth and then they got all their treatment and dosing at White Earth.","V15",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",374
"4467","doc7_375","And it was awesome.","V14",1,"Coleman_Brandon",375
"4468","doc7_376","People enrolled.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",376
"4469","doc7_377","They were a little nervous at first I think, you know, going to the program.","V12",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",377
"4470","doc7_378","I was the liaison, the point of contact at Valhalla Place so if they had issues they called me and I would address it.","V13",0.285714285714286,"Coleman_Brandon",378
"4471","doc7_379","And I was really glad to be of assistance to my tribe.","V7",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",379
"4472","doc7_380","Over time—the program evolved very quickly.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",380
"4473","doc7_381","Within months they were changing from just the pregnant women and the women with child protection cases to their partners or the men of the women, the fathers of the babies.","V8",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",381
"4474","doc7_382","Then it was everyone who lived in the house.","V9",1,"Coleman_Brandon",382
"4475","doc7_383","Treat the whole household.","V11",1,"Coleman_Brandon",383
"4476","doc7_384","And then it was the communities demanding access that were not part of the demographic, and it was really apparent within a short period of time, I want to say six months or so, that White Earth needed to provide these services across the entire Reservation, and there was such high demand that they needed to open multiple clinics.","V1",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",384
"4477","doc7_385","And so I decided—the Meridian merger had started to happen.","V1",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",385
"4478","doc7_386","I was not exactly sure—I felt uneasy, you know, uneasy about the future, and so I reached out and said, “Hey, I'd like an opportunity to help start those clinics that you've expressed interest in.”","V1",0.357142857142857,"Coleman_Brandon",386
"4479","doc7_387","And so I was hired by White Earth to do that.","V15",1,"Coleman_Brandon",387
"4480","doc7_388","And there was a year period of time where we worked towards getting the, I want to say four additional clinics open.","V1",1,"Coleman_Brandon",388
"4481","doc7_389","Five, sorry.","V15",1,"Coleman_Brandon",389
"4482","doc7_390","So there were two on the Reservation, then there was one in Bemidji, which is four hours north of Minneapolis.","V15",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",390
"4483","doc7_391","North and east of White Earth Reservation.","V15",0.8,"Coleman_Brandon",391
"4484","doc7_392","And then there was Minneapolis next.","V11",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",392
"4485","doc7_393","There was the MOMS Program started in Minneapolis as well as the medical assisted treatment kind of for everybody, Native American clinic here in Minneapolis.","V12",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",393
"4486","doc7_394","And it was very rapid pace that we moved.","V9",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",394
"4487","doc7_395","I mean getting, you know, I recruited a doctor, and helped with some of the clinic design, and how to set up the dosing windows.","V1",0.571428571428571,"Coleman_Brandon",395
"4488","doc7_396","Just things that I had learned from my work at Valhalla Place.","V7",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",396
"4489","doc7_397","AS: So are the clients coming and getting a dose of Suboxone everyday?","V6",0.8,"Coleman_Brandon",397
"4490","doc7_398","AF: Correct.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",398
"4491","doc7_399","AS: So they're not getting a prescription.","V6",1,"Coleman_Brandon",399
"4492","doc7_400","AF: Correct.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",400
"4493","doc7_401","AS: Why that model?","V3",1,"Coleman_Brandon",401
"4494","doc7_402","AF: Diversion concerns.","V1",0,"Coleman_Brandon",402
"4495","doc7_403","When you have a lack of access, and something is just becoming available, there is a huge demand for—you know demand is there, lack of access is there, you have a black market for it.","V14",0.384615384615385,"Coleman_Brandon",403
"4496","doc7_404","It's worth a lot of money.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",404
"4497","doc7_405","So, what White Earth did, and what I think was a really good idea, was to keep tight control of it until there was broader access.","V8",0.444444444444444,"Coleman_Brandon",405
"4498","doc7_406","Then once it's readily available people can just go into a clinic and enroll—then you can start to look at giving people take-out medications to have at home because the demand has decreased in fulfilling the needs of the population.","V14",0.285714285714286,"Coleman_Brandon",406
"4499","doc7_407","AS: So that is a little bit of a different model with Suboxone.","V2",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",407
"4500","doc7_408","AF: Well, it's a methadone model.","V10",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",408
"4501","doc7_409","AS: Right, it's a methadone clinic model— AF: Rather than a prescription, take it home model.","V3",0.571428571428571,"Coleman_Brandon",409
"4502","doc7_410","AS: Yeah.",NA,NA,NA,410
"4503","doc7_411","And are those common around the country that you know of, or is that unique?","V6",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",411
"4504","doc7_412","AF: I want to say it's unique to tribes specifically.","V10",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",412
"4505","doc7_413","I'm not aware of any other Suboxone only programs that have that tight control and dosing policies and limitations.","V8",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",413
"4506","doc7_414","AS: Okay.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",414
"4507","doc7_415","So that would be a unique aspect of the Tribal program.","V15",0.75,"Coleman_Brandon",415
"4508","doc7_416","AF: Correct.","V12",1,"Coleman_Brandon",416
"4509","doc7_417","And that's what I'm aware of is how they're being operated.","V8",1,"Coleman_Brandon",417
"4510","doc7_418","Now there are also people who probably go to a physician that live near the Reservation and get a prescription.","V8",0.555555555555556,"Coleman_Brandon",418
"4511","doc7_419","So there's nothing that would prevent you from being able to do that other than you can't find the doctor.","V13",0.666666666666667,"Coleman_Brandon",419
"4512","doc7_420","AS: But this also allows clients to be brought into other services and support that they might need.","V1",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",420
"4513","doc7_421","AF: Correct.","V10",1,"Coleman_Brandon",421
"4514","doc7_422","And White Earth always provided culturally based services.","V15",0.714285714285714,"Coleman_Brandon",422
"4515","doc7_423","It was about how do we incorporate culture into programming for treatment, and having people that are Native American providing the services.","V15",0.428571428571429,"Coleman_Brandon",423
"4516","doc7_424","Having it be for the people, by the people.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",424
"4517","doc7_425","Comfort, and culturally based, and connecting people to something that they maybe have never had access to, or have lost along the way.","V10",0.375,"Coleman_Brandon",425
"4518","doc7_426","So that was a really cool part of the White Earth model is connecting culture to treatment.","V15",0.625,"Coleman_Brandon",426
"4519","doc7_427","And probably a really important component of how, you know, to make that work for the people who need it.","V13",0.444444444444444,"Coleman_Brandon",427
"4520","doc7_428","And you know if culturally based treatment isn't what people needed then maybe it's not the right program for them.","V15",0.444444444444444,"Coleman_Brandon",428

"4534","doc7_442","So that's, you know, opiates can be fatal in many ways, so keeping people on Suboxone and providing treatment is very effective.","V2",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",442

"4543","doc7_451","So, yeah, there was actually a lot of Narcan available.","V12",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",451
"4544","doc7_452","And the other tribe that had significant need and White Earth was providing services to out of the Bemidji program was called Oshkimanidoo, was Red Lake Nation, which is thirty minutes north of Bemidji.","V15",0.6,"Coleman_Brandon",452
"4545","doc7_453","So they were going to a White Earth clinic, and traveling because it's a long distance away, so spending time in a van, and having to get from their house to the van, and from the van to the clinic, and then the clinic back home.","V1",0.6875,"Coleman_Brandon",453
"4546","doc7_454","It was—it is quite the ordeal currently.","V13",1,"Coleman_Brandon",454

"4577","doc7_485","I think it's a good route for tribes to go.","V7",1,"Coleman_Brandon",485
"4578","doc7_486","I believe that it does conflict a little bit with the traditional way that like alcohol has been addressed.","V7",0.333333333333333,"Coleman_Brandon",486
"4579","doc7_487","But in my opinion the alcohol use, and all the substances need to be looked at as unique to each other.","V2",0.428571428571429,"Coleman_Brandon",487

"4593","doc7_501","[laughs]","V5",1,"Coleman_Brandon",501
"4594","doc7_502","But then opiates aren't.","V3",1,"Coleman_Brandon",502
"4595","doc7_503","I guess it's a narcotic, but if it's a treatment that works, and it doesn't get people high, which everybody thinks it does, why wouldn't you use it?","V1",0.444444444444444,"Coleman_Brandon",503

"4597","doc7_505","I mean that doesn't address the larger issue in my mind, which is poverty.","V3",0.4,"Coleman_Brandon",505
"4598","doc7_506","I mean that's the true culprit I think of addiction.","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",506

"4602","doc7_510","There's so much around I mean people shouldn't feel that way.","V4",0.5,"Coleman_Brandon",510
"4603","doc7_511","So I guess that's what I would say is needed to get over this issue is addressing the way we look at substance use as a consequence of poverty, and we need to address that.","V2",0.363636363636364,"Coleman_Brandon",511
"4604","doc7_512","Because we can give people Suboxone and we can keep them from using heroin, but at the end of the day they still go back to the same place they were living unless we give them other opportunities.","V4",0.571428571428571,"Coleman_Brandon",512

"5986","doc9_395","And then, in college learned about kids who got into all kinds of trouble.","V9",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",395
"5987","doc9_396","I was always involved in the seventh adventist church school system and they also had no tolerance whatsoever.","V13",0.571428571428571,"Devich_Stephanie",396

"5989","doc9_398","They just got booted.","V7",1,"Devich_Stephanie",398
"5990","doc9_399","So that was, you know, kind of a harsh and fairly one-sided view, but that was my growing up view.","V13",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",399
"5991","doc9_400","And then when I got to medical school all of a sudden, my relatively protected childhood was ended as I got involved in clinical work, taking care of patients, and studying the science of substance abuse, and the damages it could do.","V12",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",400
"5992","doc9_401","AS: Do you have children?","V11",1,"Devich_Stephanie",401
"5993","doc9_402","CG: No, my wife and I were never able to have children.","V11",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",402
"5994","doc9_403","And it was a spiritual and emotional ethical debate for us.","V13",1,"Devich_Stephanie",403
"5995","doc9_404","But what we ended up deciding to do was number one, to throw our lives into our professions.","V3",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",404
"5996","doc9_405","My wife's a dietician, and she did dietetic consulting in all the years in Park Rapids.","V15",0.4,"Devich_Stephanie",405
"5997","doc9_406","And then, did dietetic consulting here.","V4",1,"Devich_Stephanie",406
"5998","doc9_407","And as a historian, you should know this little fact that is not trivial.","V6",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",407
"5999","doc9_408","My wife, Gail Gardner, developed the diabetes Bingo game.","V11",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",408
"6000","doc9_409","which is now very popular, both in places like Oklahoma and other places where there are reservations, and also places where there aren't reservations.","V2",1,"Devich_Stephanie",409
"6001","doc9_410","She and her assistant Paulie Nyson [confirm name] developed a game based on bingo that teaches good diabetes self-care.","V14",0.3,"Devich_Stephanie",410
"6002","doc9_411","It was developed right here about sixteen seventeen years ago.","V6",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",411
"6003","doc9_412","And, a printing company out of Fargo Moorhead area, printed up the games.","V15",1,"Devich_Stephanie",412
"6004","doc9_413","And, a number of them have sold.","V1",1,"Devich_Stephanie",413
"6005","doc9_414","My wife hasn't made any money on it, it belongs to the tribe since she developed it as an employee, but she helped to develop diabetes bingo.","V11",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",414

"6007","doc9_416","I always wanted a big dog.","V1",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",416

"6009","doc9_418","Gail and I couldn't afford to do that.","V9",1,"Devich_Stephanie",418
"6010","doc9_419","And they asked us to take care of their Saint Bernard Golden Retriever mix—Ginger.","V3",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",419
"6011","doc9_420","A wonderful gentle dog.","V1",1,"Devich_Stephanie",420
"6012","doc9_421","And we weren't going anywhere, so we took care of Ginger.","V3",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",421
"6013","doc9_422","And I took her for walks in the neighborhood when I hadn't been out in the neighborhood very often cuz I was busy studying.","V11",0.833333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",422
"6014","doc9_423","And, one of the first walks we were taking, out from an unfenced yard that was about a foot and a half higher than the sidewalk, came a full sized Great Dane running right up.","V11",0.3,"Devich_Stephanie",423
"6015","doc9_424","And, I, you know my life passed before my eyes.","V14",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",424
"6016","doc9_425","And then I thought, my god Fred will kill me.","V10",1,"Devich_Stephanie",425
"6017","doc9_426","This dog is gonna kill me and then kill Ginger, and if I wasn't dead already Fred'll kill me when he got back.","V10",0.625,"Devich_Stephanie",426
"6018","doc9_427","And the dog came up to me and...","V9",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",427
"6019","doc9_428","Pardon me, I respect your space, but this is [acting out the scene]...","V5",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",428
"6020","doc9_429","I'm a storyteller!","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",429
"6021","doc9_430","The dog came up to me just like that and went [licking sound].","V9",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",430
"6022","doc9_431","[All laughing].","V15",1,"Devich_Stephanie",431
"6023","doc9_432","And as I was laughing, and wiping my face off, I said to myself, ""Damn I'm gonna have a Great Dane someday.""","V14",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",432
"6024","doc9_433","So, after we moved to Park Rapids, in 1981, a few years later we adopted our first Great Dane, Chuckie.","V9",0.714285714285714,"Devich_Stephanie",433
"6025","doc9_434","Who was a mis-breed of the breeder.","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",434
"6026","doc9_435","He had a slightly short jaw, and the breeder couldn't sell him for big money, and so we adopted him for less than big money.","V5",0.857142857142857,"Devich_Stephanie",435
"6027","doc9_436","And he died at three and half of osteosarcoma.","V9",1,"Devich_Stephanie",436
"6028","doc9_437","Great Danes get spinal cancer.","V3",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",437
"6029","doc9_438","He died of osteosarcoma Christmas week, when he was three years old.","V11",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",438
"6030","doc9_439","And Gail and I, amidst oceans of tears and anger against fate, said we'd never adopt another dog.","V9",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",439
"6031","doc9_440","And one month later we got a call from a couple in Osage: ""We heard your Great Dane died.","V9",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",440
"6032","doc9_441","We have a Great Dane named Sarah.","V8",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",441
"6033","doc9_442","And, she's been running the neighbor's cattle.","V11",1,"Devich_Stephanie",442
"6034","doc9_443","We're farmers too.","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",443
"6035","doc9_444","We're not willing to fence her.","V14",1,"Devich_Stephanie",444
"6036","doc9_445","Our neighbor came over and just said, 'You know folks, I love you guys, you're wonderful neighbors.","V1",0.555555555555556,"Devich_Stephanie",445
"6037","doc9_446","But next time Sarah runs my cattle I'm getting out my deer rifle.'","V5",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",446
"6038","doc9_447","And so, would you take Sarah?""","V3",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",447
"6039","doc9_448","And Gail and I looked at each other.","V9",1,"Devich_Stephanie",448
"6040","doc9_449","We had said never again will we have a dog, we're not gonna go through that kind of grief again.","V9",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",449
"6041","doc9_450","So, we took Sarah, and we've kept it up through the years.","V8",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",450
"6042","doc9_451","So we've had eight or nine Great Danes and other breeds.","V11",1,"Devich_Stephanie",451
"6043","doc9_452","And we also had cats for a while.","V5",1,"Devich_Stephanie",452
"6044","doc9_453","But, Sarah was our general.","V5",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",453
"6045","doc9_454","Sarah had a higher IQ than me, I'm sure.","V5",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",454
"6046","doc9_455","Not that mine's that high, but hers was well-higher.","V12",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",455
"6047","doc9_456","And she, if we had let her run free, she would've organized all the dogs in the neighborhood into an army.","V9",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",456
"6048","doc9_457","And she was the general.","V2",1,"Devich_Stephanie",457
"6049","doc9_458","Our neighbor was the Becker County canine officer deputy, and he kept his canine at home.","V11",0.4,"Devich_Stephanie",458
"6050","doc9_459","And when the dog wasn't working, it got to run free.","V12",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",459
"6051","doc9_460","And the day I brought Sarah home, she was indignant about being on a leash, and she and I were trying to work that out.","V1",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",460
"6052","doc9_461","And the neighbor's dog came running over to introduce himself, and Sarah yanked the leash out of my hand, turned around, and my god....","V9",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",461
"6053","doc9_462","Sigourney","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",462
"6054","doc9_463","Weaver would have been less terrified of Alien than the snarl that Sarah offered that dog!","V1",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",463
"6055","doc9_464","And she chased the police dog back into his yard.","V1",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",464
"6056","doc9_465","And then she turned to me and looked at me like, ""Well let's get this over with.""","V9",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",465
"6057","doc9_466","So, I picked up the leash and started walking down the road, and that dog came back out again.","V9",0.571428571428571,"Devich_Stephanie",466
"6058","doc9_467","You know, head down, tail down, crouched, and tried to walk up to Sarah and make amends.","V5",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",467
"6059","doc9_468","And she turned around snarled and chased him back into his yard, and he damn well never into our yard again!","V14",0.428571428571429,"Devich_Stephanie",468
"6060","doc9_469","So that was, Sarah, our second Great Dane.","V14",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",469
"6061","doc9_470","And she was wonderful.","V1",1,"Devich_Stephanie",470
"6062","doc9_471","She lived almost thirteen years, which is exceptionally long for a Great Dane.","V9",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",471
"6063","doc9_472","And she enriched our life with laughter and tears and wonder at her brilliance and her organization, and that's how we became dog rescuers.","V5",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",472
"6064","doc9_473","And we specialized in Great Danes for years.","V8",1,"Devich_Stephanie",473
"6065","doc9_474","But, our last great dane a few year ago, Reggie, had congenital hypothyroidism.","V8",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",474
"6066","doc9_475","And by the time I convinced the vet to do a thyroid profile on him, ""Listen Gardner.","V4",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",475
"6067","doc9_476","You're not a vet!","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",476
"6068","doc9_477","You're a family doctor.","V14",1,"Devich_Stephanie",477
"6069","doc9_478","Your problem is you feed him too much.""","V5",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",478
"6070","doc9_479","He weighed 279 pounds.","V1",0,"Devich_Stephanie",479
"6071","doc9_480","And when, the vet finally said, ""Well, bleep!","V4",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",480
"6072","doc9_481","I guess you were right and put him on thyroid medicine.""","V6",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",481
"6073","doc9_482","He got down to a svelte 212 pounds.","V6",1,"Devich_Stephanie",482
"6074","doc9_483","But, when he developed serious heart failure at five years of age, Gail and I couldn't lift him anymore.","V7",0.375,"Devich_Stephanie",483
"6075","doc9_484","so we, decided we better rescue smaller dogs.","V1",1,"Devich_Stephanie",484
"6076","doc9_485","So, we now have a couple of Australian Shepherd Great Pyrenees mix dogs, that weigh about 60 pounds each.","V8",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",485
"6077","doc9_486","And they have double merle syndrome, which renders them partially blind and deaf.","V9",1,"Devich_Stephanie",486
"6078","doc9_487","And we got them from a shelter in Southern Minnesota, who got a call from a shelter in Oklahoma that was a kill shelter, that said: [Feigning a Southern accent]","V11",0.818181818181818,"Devich_Stephanie",487

"6201","doc9_610","So, I went for an interview, and he took me around—nice man.","V4",0.6,"Devich_Stephanie",610
"6202","doc9_611","But he said, when we did the interview, he took me into the Pine Point, little Pine Point clinic, he took me to NATUA, and in the car he said, ""You know Carson.","V5",0.416666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",611

"6211","doc9_620","And then I came and started seeing patients and saw that it was true.","V7",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",620
"6212","doc9_621","And, I was probably one of the most conservative prescribers of narcotic pain medicine.","V3",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",621

"6303","doc9_712","That's when I got involved saying to Clinton, what can I do to help?","V4",0.4,"Devich_Stephanie",712
"6304","doc9_713","And shortly after that, one of our child welfare workers gave a talk at a community forum meeting, and said, ""I just want you guys to know that last year we had twenty babies from White Earth that had narcotic withdrawal syndrome, and we damn well need to do something about it.""","V8",0.318181818181818,"Devich_Stephanie",713

"6306","doc9_715","And so, medical minded people like me sat down and thought about it, and did our OCD thing, and wrote out timelines and flowsheets and said, at a meeting in 2013, late 2013, ""Well I think we can put this together.","V10",0.384615384615385,"Devich_Stephanie",715

"6316","doc9_725","And so, that was the other thing, they asked me to put together a debate position on the negative side 'cuz no one would do that.","V11",0.444444444444444,"Devich_Stephanie",725
"6317","doc9_726","They had some nurse practitioners come up from the Twin Cities and present the positive position:","V1",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",726
"6318","doc9_727","This is why we should have subaxone treatment program for pregnant women on the White Earth reservation.","V15",0.857142857142857,"Devich_Stephanie",727

"6323","doc9_732","And then in 2014, my boss Pat Butler said to me, ""You know we have a lot of overdoses.","V5",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",732

"6329","doc9_738","And that's when she said, ""We need to be teaching nalaxone rescue.","V10",1,"Devich_Stephanie",738

"6331","doc9_740","So, the ambulance manager","V15",1,"Devich_Stephanie",740
"6332","doc9_741","Devon Green and I, put together a teaching program.","V12",1,"Devich_Stephanie",741
"6333","doc9_742","And I went back to Pat, and to the tribal council and said, ""You know, we're having overdoses.","V4",0.714285714285714,"Devich_Stephanie",742

"6335","doc9_744","And so, we need to do this.""","V5",1,"Devich_Stephanie",744
"6336","doc9_745","And that was at the time the Minnesota legislature, I think they passed it as of July 1st, but they weren't gonna implement it until late August or early September.","V12",0.625,"Devich_Stephanie",745
"6337","doc9_746","And I, I said to Pat, ""You know it's silly, I've got the program ready.","V6",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",746
"6338","doc9_747","We could start teaching.","V10",1,"Devich_Stephanie",747

"6340","doc9_749","The sooner we do it the better, but according to Minnesota legislature we can't start.""","V5",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",749
"6341","doc9_750","And Pat said, ""Let me talk to the tribal council.""","V4",0.833333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",750
"6342","doc9_751","And, like three days later they passed a resolution saying that we should start teaching and giving out nalaxone immediately, which for me, I'm not licensed by the tribe I'm licensed by the state of Minnesota.","V10",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",751
"6343","doc9_752","And I thought, holy hell.","V10",1,"Devich_Stephanie",752
"6344","doc9_753","If I do this, and some legislator gets pissed at me, they could yank my license, or have the Minnesota health department sanction me.","V2",0.666666666666667,"Devich_Stephanie",753
"6345","doc9_754","And I, talked to Pat about it.","V4",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",754
"6346","doc9_755","We looked at each other, and we said, well they wouldn't dare!","V4",0.333333333333333,"Devich_Stephanie",755
"6347","doc9_756","The tribal council would raise such a racism argument that they would get backed against the wall.","V4",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",756
"6348","doc9_757","So, we went ahead.","V3",1,"Devich_Stephanie",757
"6349","doc9_758","We started teaching nalaxone rescue here a month before the actual implementation of Steve's Law.","V12",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",758

"6472","doc9_881","There were various narcotic prescribing strategies by IHS doctors, but we had a solid core group from 1999 till about 2005 or 2006, we had no turnover in doctors and nurse practitioners.","V2",0.8,"Devich_Stephanie",881

"6483","doc9_892","This was an individual who was a community member who had pain management issues.","V3",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",892

"6486","doc9_895","And so, I had a visit meeting with this individual and laid out the issues and explained to them that I was going to have to stop their narcotic prescription.","V2",0.714285714285714,"Devich_Stephanie",895
"6487","doc9_896","And, they threatened to bring a gun to my yard!","V4",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",896

"6489","doc9_898","Three of them were by white people in Park Rapids.","V15",0.75,"Devich_Stephanie",898

"6493","doc9_902","And you, know, no harm was done to me.","V4",0.5,"Devich_Stephanie",902
"6494","doc9_903","And so, that happened, but that's not the end of the story because a week and half later I was on emergency call, and this individual came in having a profound severe heart attack.","V9",0.384615384615385,"Devich_Stephanie",903

That was all normal.

Being a little kid, I just wanted to be a little kid. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19</span> I didn’t want to pay attention to if my mom was still doing that same stuff that she did that scared me. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20</span> I remember having a fear that someone was going to put that white powder shit on my lip while I was asleep and I would breathe it in. <span style="color:red">8, 14</span> That was a legitimate fear that I had.  I don’t think any kid should have that kind of fear. <span style="color:red">8, 16</span> I’m not trying to break your guys’ hearts or anything, but that was the reality of being an eight year old for me. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> Howard tried.

At this point in time I’m living in Denver [Colorado]. <span style="color:red">9, 11, 12, 17, 19</span> We moved from Denver to Arkansas and back to Denver, then to Texas, and then to Arizona. <span style="color:red">5, 11, 19</span> He worked for a chain of restaurants, but he worked for the corporation that owned the chain of restaurants. <span style="color:red">5, 17</span> I think they owned Chili’s and all those mall-type restaurants. <span style="color:red">8</span> He moved us out to Arizona.

She still uses to this day. <span style="color:red">15, 17, 20</span> She has never had to face the consequences of her use because of her privileged place in society. <span style="color:red">6, 15</span> She stands behind her rich, white male.  He gives her a safe place to do everything in.  I’m not sure if he knows that’s what she does, but I don’t understand how he couldn’t. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 18, 19</span> Some days when I would go over and see my mom I’m just like Jesus, it’s bad. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20</span> I always thought I was bad and that’s how I know I could do more drugs was I wasn’t as bad as my mom, you know. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19</span> I’m trying to make light of it. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> It’s just a serious thing in my life. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18, 19</span> This is the third or fourth time that I’ve told my story. <span style="color:red">9, 17, 19</span> By the end of it I can see people on the edge of their seats sometimes. <span style="color:red">7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20</span> It kind of makes me feel -- I just hope this is helping. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16</span> Me and Nick started shooting meth. <span style="color:red">5, 13, 20</span> <br> AS:  How old were you?

I was at home with the boys and I just went into the bathroom and shut the door and did my thing. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18</span> Before I knew it, this had never happened before, my eyes started going like this [shakes hands quickly] and the whole world started going. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I remember laying back on the toilet and waking up. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 11, 14, 19</span> I go to go out of the bathroom and I can’t open the door.  I pushed it open a little bit and looked out. <span style="color:red">18</span> Both of my boys had their pillows and blankets and they were sleeping outside the bathroom door waiting for their dad to come out. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> That is burned into my memory; that will never go away. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 15, 16</span> At that point, like I said, I didn’t care. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20</span> I didn’t even see that while it was going on. <span style="color:red">7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20</span> My mom, the insane person that she is, decided that I wasn’t fit to have the boys. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 14</span> She takes them, I don’t know how she does it but she does it. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 18, 19</span> That just gives me an out: <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> my boys are safe and I’m hitting the road again.  Just when I was getting my stuff ready to go, I hadn’t quite left yet, Nick, the guy I told you guys about -- we had this ritual. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> At the time I had a ‘63 Lincoln Continental and there was an eight track player in it. <span style="color:red">9, 17, 19</span> The only eight track we had was Al Green.  On Fridays our dealer wouldn’t drive into Tempe [Arizona] to give us dope. <span style="color:red">17</span> We would have to drive out to Glendale [Arizona] to get it. <span style="color:red">6, 12</span> There’s this freeway there called the Loop 202 that just goes around the whole valley. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> That car pretty much drives itself so I would put my arm over there and he would hit me up and then he would shoot himself up. <span style="color:red">11, 18</span> We would just drive in circles listening to Al Green. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> We played this game where whoever was driving, if the other person nodded off we would whack their heads against the window. <span style="color:red">9</span> It was just this stupid game that we played. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> He didn’t come to when I did it. <span style="color:red">16, 17</span> I’ve only seen it in movies where people overdose and they have foam coming out of their mouth but that actually happened this time. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> No other time has that ever happened. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I guess his heart exploded because the cocaine was really good and it made his heart explode. <span style="color:red">8, 11, 12</span> First, it brought him down -- it was just all wrong. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> I was high too, really high. <span style="color:red">7, 8, 12, 13</span> I missed the exit to the hospital three times trying to get him there. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> Finally, I got him there and I ran around to his side of the car, but for some reason his door wouldn’t open. <span style="color:red">9</span> It had never happened before. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20</span> So, I ran back to my side, drug him over the seat, and put him in a wheelchair and wheeled him into the emergency room. <span style="color:red">5, 11, 19</span> I ran back outside, grabbed my keys, started the car, and drove around the block. <span style="color:red">5, 11, 13, 19, 20</span> I stashed the dope and everything in the bushes, turned around, and came back. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> When I came back the cops were there. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> They put handcuffs on me and told me I was going to jail for, I don’t remember what he called it, but it was accessory to something. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> It still hadn’t dawned on me what had happened. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20</span> We had both overdosed tons of times, but this time got him. <span style="color:red">9, 17, 19</span> The cops told me, “He’s dead.  You’re going to have to call his mom.” <span style="color:red">5, 9, 14</span> I called his mom. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> It still hadn’t really hit me until I was cleaning out his apartment. <span style="color:red">8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20</span> His mom called and she said, “I can’t do it. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I need you to go over there and do it.”  That’s when it really hit me. <span style="color:red">8, 12</span> After that it just seemed like my mom was blaming me for it, my baby’s mom was blaming me for it, his mom was blaming me for it, and I was blaming myself for it. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20</span> I just left town and I stayed gone. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I can’t even tell you all the places I went that time. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I was just drifting, floating. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> My friend Matt, a kid that I grew up with, got a hold of my mom and said, “Have you heard from Brandon?” <span style="color:red">5, 7, 9, 14, 18</span> She said, “No, but when I do can I get him on an airplane and send him to Minneapolis? <span style="color:red">6, 7, 12, 14, 18</span> Or else he’s going to die.”  That’s pretty much what happened. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20</span> <br> AS:  Was Matt here?  BC: Matt was here.  He had an uncle or something that lived in Isanti, Minnesota. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> He came here to get clean. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> He got cleaner; he wasn’t shoving needles in his arm every day until I showed up in Minnesota to get clean. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20</span> I think part of his motivation to get me here was because he’s not the kind of guy that can just go out into a city and find dope. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I just have that resource, or something. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> I can just find it wherever that it. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 16</span> I came out here and learned what Rule 25 is. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> Rule 25 is the first step.  I don’t know what about me made people want to help me. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19</span> I was really more interested in what people had in their pockets that I could get. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 12, 15, 16</span> That’s really what I’m more interested in at this point. <span style="color:red">8, 11, 12</span> I was the worst kind of person. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 16</span> I hated myself.  I couldn’t even pinpoint when I started hating myself. <span style="color:red">5, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20</span> As long as I can remember there was just something that I didn’t like when I looked in the mirror. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> When I was a kid I always lied about myself. <span style="color:red">13, 16</span> I didn’t want people to know who I really was. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19</span> If I saw somebody that I thought was cool I would take some of their story and take that on. <span style="color:red">6</span> I was ashamed of what I had: my mom, my dad. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I came here and did a Rule 25. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I went to this place called Dellwood [Recovery Center, Cambridge, Minnesota]. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> They were like, “Well, you can’t get clean on your own. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20</span> You’re going to have to do Suboxone.”  I was like, “Okay, I’ll do whatever it is.” <span style="color:red">13</span> This was when Suboxone was pretty new because I didn’t really know about it. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 18, 19</span> Suboxone didn’t work. <span style="color:red">5, 17</span> What it did was give me a way to make money. <span style="color:red">11, 13, 16</span> At this time you could get twenty to forty dollars for a little pill. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19</span> I got one hundred and twenty a month.  That became the hustle. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I didn’t have to go out and rob and steal.  All I had to do was sell my Suboxone.  Then I found dealers that would take the Suboxone and give me anything for it.  I still lived out of my backpack. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> I slept by the river, slept in squats, slept wherever I could if I slept.  I went to treatment again.  I went to the Pride Institute [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  That’s where I met Maddie.  We actually stayed clean together for five months. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20</span> Then head first, right away. <span style="color:red">13, 16, 17, 18, 19</span> We hit the road again and she had a habit of overdosing. <span style="color:red">18</span> She overdosed so much. <span style="color:red">11, 18</span> Luckily in Minnesota, Valhalla has it, [Valhalla Place, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota] you can get a little bottle of Narcan. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 18</span> You don’t have to hit a vein you can just go for it right in the shoulder if somebody is overdosing and it will bring them right back in five minutes. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19</span> Over and over again this is how it would happen.  She wouldn’t overdose for a couple of months and then she would overdose.  I overdosed a couple of times between there. <span style="color:red">9, 17, 19</span> I think what really made my decision was I had watched everyone around me die: the kids I grew up with, people I considered my brother, people I knew. <span style="color:red">8, 12, 15, 16</span> I didn’t die.

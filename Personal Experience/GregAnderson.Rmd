Greg Anderson Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Greg Anderson-GA Amy Sullivan-AS 
 <br> <br> GA:  NA My name is Greg Anderson. NA I am the Social Service Supervisor for St. Louis County Public Health Human Services in the area of Chemical Dependency Services. <span style="color:red">8</span> I have been employed with St. Louis County for twenty-four plus years. <span style="color:red">14</span> I have a bachelor's degree in sociology from Minnesota State Mankato. NA I have a master's degree in social work from the University of Minnesota Duluth. <span style="color:red">19</span> I was born in extreme southeastern Minnesota. <span style="color:red">14</span> I grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota, which is forty miles south of Winona. <span style="color:red">8, 20</span> Went to high school, graduated from there. <span style="color:red">7</span> I already described my college life. <span style="color:red">7, 10, 14</span> I was born in June of 1956. <span style="color:red">14</span> 
 <br> <br> AS:  Do you give me permission to record this interview? NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  I just have to say that. NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  Cover the bases. NA In case my attorney calls sometime. <span style="color:red">16, 17</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  So you grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota and then went to Mankato. <span style="color:red">8, 20</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Two years in Winona first, then transferred to Mankato State. <span style="color:red">5, 14, 17</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Oh, okay. NA So does your family have a history of college education? <span style="color:red">7, 12, 14, 15</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Neither my mother or father does. <span style="color:red">16</span> My sister had degrees in both sociology and nursing. <span style="color:red">20</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Did your parents encourage you to go to college? <span style="color:red">7, 20</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Absolutely. NA Growing up in the sixties, early seventies in a small, rural town basically there wasn't a lot of industry. <span style="color:red">19</span> The primary business or industry was farming. <span style="color:red">8, 19</span> I was not in a position to really take on the doo-doo. <span style="color:red">18</span> Allergies and other things. NA I wasn't in a position to carry on with the family farm, so it was real clear. <span style="color:red">8, 12</span> My sister was eight years older than I. <span style="color:red">14, 20</span> She had gone and went to nursing school at Mankato State University. <span style="color:red">7</span> Needed to move on, and I was more of a person-oriented person. <span style="color:red">15</span> If I could have handled calculus I would have been a meteorologist. NA Then I went to look at mass communication journalism, news broadcasting. <span style="color:red">15, 16</span> Spent some time there. NA Realized I couldn't handle the egos that were present in that area of work, so I slipped into sociology. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 10</span> Got my BA degree and spent three summers as the summer rec program director for the Mable and Canton communities. <span style="color:red">7, 18, 19</span> Had this strong love—my first love outside of family is baseball. <span style="color:red">12, 14</span> I spend a lot of time following that when I'm not working. <span style="color:red">10</span> That's kind of that. NA That got me to the Twin Cities. NA From 1978 to 1987 when I got married and moved up here I worked in nursing homes. <span style="color:red">7, 15</span> I was a short-time activity assistant, activity director, and then spent probably eight years as a social service director. <span style="color:red">14, 18, 19</span> Basically coordinated admissions, discharged planning, addressing psychosocial needs of nursing home residents while in the nursing home. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 19</span> Did that, then met my wife and moved up here. <span style="color:red">7, 15, 20</span> Realized I didn't have a lot of job opportunities with just a sociology degree, so I was one of the first graduating class members of—the advanced generalist program—MSW program—at the University of Minnesota Duluth. <span style="color:red">7, 11, 14, 19</span> UMD had basically discontinued their MSW program, and this was the start up of a new program going more into advanced generalist or generalist practice of doing standard basic social work with advanced education. <span style="color:red">14, 15, 16, 19</span> It was a really enlightening experience for me, and it was really unique because in school for the two years in our class of about twenty something individuals I was basically the only one that had worked in gerontology. <span style="color:red">7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19</span> Everybody else was Children/Family Services. <span style="color:red">5</span> There were two or three individuals that were dealing with chemical dependency, substance use disorder type things. <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> My interest at the time continued to be geriatric, elderly, assisting and supporting individuals going through the aging process. <span style="color:red">13, 17</span> Being able to assist and support them and the families. <span style="color:red">17</span> The aging process is an evolving process of grieving because as we age we transition. <span style="color:red">17</span> When we transition we lose certain skills and/or certain access or stages of life, and we have to be able to deal with that and then go into the next phase of life. <span style="color:red">9, 10, 17</span> As one gets older, as I currently am, even having more realization and understanding what I witnessed and experienced in the early years. <span style="color:red">14, 17, 18, 20</span> Got through school at UMD. <span style="color:red">7</span> Had done an internship here at Children and Family Service, which at that time was St. Louis County Social Services. <span style="color:red">5</span> I was able to do an internship at the county nursing home. <span style="color:red">19</span> Finished that. NA Was later hired as a child protection worker. <span style="color:red">5, 14, 19</span> Commuted for over a year and a half to Hibbing, Minnesota. <span style="color:red">14</span> So it was a hundred and forty-four mile trip each day to work. <span style="color:red">16</span> After about eighteen months of doing that our first child was born and I had the opportunity to work for the state of Minnesota at the Minnesota Veteran's Home in Silver Bay that had just opened. <span style="color:red">11, 14, 16, 19</span> I spent a year there working on admission coordination. <span style="color:red">14</span> It wasn't a lot in relationship to discharge [unclear]. <span style="color:red">19</span> Basically it was kind of a last phase of life for veterans and veterans' spouses, and in the meantime the program was also looking at adding an Alzheimer's or dementia unit to the program. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 12, 13, 19</span> I was there for a year. <span style="color:red">14</span> We were starting to train staff as we looked at opening the additional forty beds in the unit for an Alzheimer's group, but then I was able to return to Duluth and get a job at Chris Jenson County Nursing Home as a discharge planner as Chris Jensen was adding a new role in a rehab unit. <span style="color:red">10, 11, 16, 19</span> With my internship and experience I had established nice relationships in the nursing home, and so they were very happy to bring me on board. <span style="color:red">18, 19</span> I spent two and a half years at the nursing home. <span style="color:red">14</span> Came to the realization—I loved the work—but Duluth and St. Louis County Social Services was going to be my employer probably for the rest of my professional career. <span style="color:red">14, 15, 19</span> I needed to come down to the government service center and get myself established here. <span style="color:red">12, 14, 19</span> I came down in 1995. NA Spent four plus years as a contract manager. <span style="color:red">14, 19</span> Basically working on purchase of service contracts for various units and divisions anywhere from children family service group homes, home care agencies, board and lodge programs, assisted living programs, chemical dependency treatment programs, mental health centers. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20</span> I had a very wide variety of experiences within those service areas. <span style="color:red">8, 18, 19, 20</span> I did that until April of 2000. NA In April of 2000 I decided I needed a change. <span style="color:red">14</span> I needed to have more experience, so I became an adult foster care licenser. <span style="color:red">13, 18, 19</span> I was an adult foster care licenser for over two and a half years, and then based on some encouragement I had received from one or two supervisors within the department we were going through a succession plan, we had an iconic adult service supervisor who had been managing both mental health and chemical dependency services for fifteen to twenty years—she was very iconic within the human services community here in Duluth and St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19</span> She was looking at retirement. <span style="color:red">12</span> I filled a position that had been vacant for two years, so I took on chemical dependency adult protection common entry point, and represented pay services, and my responsibilities have kind of evolved and switched, and so since January of 2003 I have been supervising chemical dependency services. <span style="color:red">5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19</span> For the first twelve years I was just supervising services in south St. Louis County, and we ended up doing some restructuring at that time. <span style="color:red">14, 16, 19</span> I took on supervision for all of St. Louis County—both north and south. <span style="color:red">16</span> Got Rule 25 assessors in three different offices. NA We also have a special project, which has been generated through the county board's commitment to support and try to find resolutions to the opioid epidemic. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19</span> I have been directing and overseeing substance abuse prevention, intervention initiatives since probably April of 2014. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 13, 18, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  How have you observed the opioid crisis? <span style="color:red">13, 14</span> You've been dealing with substance abuse professionally since when did you say? <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  You have a decade plus experience seeing what's happening in your community. <span style="color:red">6, 14, 15, 18, 19</span> What have you witnessed? NA Coming in in 2003 the primary substance of choice was alcohol. <span style="color:red">6, 19</span> Alcohol is still seen as number one. <span style="color:red">6</span> There have been a few cycles and trends that have changed. <span style="color:red">13</span> We get into the later 2000s, maybe starting 2006, 2007 we had an incredible upswing in methamphetamine. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 8</span> We were basically dealing with that on two different fronts. <span style="color:red">19</span> Not only the effect it was having on the individuals and family through the use, but also the public health crisis we were dealing with through the manufacturing. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 13, 19</span> A lot of money, a lot of resources were put into that. <span style="color:red">8, 10</span> We actually worked through a collaboration through Children and Family Services unit and through our Financial Assistance unit we were working on setting up a shared family program where basically mothers and/or parents dealing with substance use would be placed into an adult foster home, or actually it would end up being a dually licensed foster home where a parent and child could be placed together to assist and support during the initial phases of the recovery process. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20</span> A lot of barriers in place from a state perspective in regards to funding. NA Funding for adults, for residential services through what is called the Group State Residential Housing Program has significant effects on the Minnesota Family Investment Program, MFIP. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19</span> So using 1) has impacts on others, and I can't get into great detail right now because my memory's kind of faded. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 20</span> We operated it for about two to three years, but there were continuing barriers in regards to getting the appropriate level of funding and getting families to accept what was needing to be done from a financial assistance standpoint. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 14, 17</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  So you were trying to put parents in recovery with their children in order so that their children didn't have to be away from them, but they were being supervised by some other caregiver or adult. <span style="color:red">5, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20</span> Monitoring, mentoring, those types of— <br> <br> <br> AS:  And you weren't able to coordinate the different funding streams in order to make it work the way you imagined it? <span style="color:red">12, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It got to be very frustrating. NA We had actually before I had come into this position there had been ongoing discussions in the past regarding trying to do this for parents dealing with mental illness. <span style="color:red">7, 12, 20</span> This was a continuation. NA There were some barriers in regards to the funding streams. NA The state has worked very hard in trying to get things in place in relationship to the efforts to reduce homelessness and provide permanent support of housing services. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 9, 14, 19</span> I'm not sure if some of those things may have now changed. <span style="color:red">12, 13</span> We haven't really taken a look at that. <span style="color:red">18</span> In recent times we've been looking at other projects in relationship to harm reduction for chronic inebriates who face long-term homelessness. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 14, 17, 19</span> We have a program called the San Marco, which was basically a project that has been modeled in several other communities not only within the state of Minnesota, but also throughout the country. <span style="color:red">5, 19</span> Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment and Center City Housing were key players in that. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 15</span> St. Louis County Public Health and Human Services provided a supportive role in the development. <span style="color:red">10, 12, 19</span> We worked with assistance in utilizing a group residential housing financial assistance benefit to provide funding for those individuals meeting those characteristics. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 13, 15, 18</span> As a matter of fact we're having a ten-year anniversary of it's opening on June 22nd. <span style="color:red">10, 14</span> Alcohol consumption is not a— <br> <br> <br> AS:  Do they call those a wet house? <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> That might be extreme. NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  That's a common term. <span style="color:red">17</span> We've kind of shifted from a wet house to a supportive housing for chronic inebriates. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 13, 19</span> That's just another example of what the collaboration and commitment of a community can do to address it. <span style="color:red">5, 12, 19</span> I wish I still had a DVD—a DVD was made I think two years after the opening—and it's called "There Are No Losers," and it's a very telling story. <span style="color:red">10, 14, 15</span> They bring tears to some. NA I'll have to see if I can find it in my office. <span style="color:red">6</span> Law enforcement was real, I don't want to say cynical, but they had some real concerns about putting this together, and basically the end of the DVD is a very moving statement by our then police chief in regards to the program and what it has done not only for the individuals residing there, but for the positive impact on the city and community. <span style="color:red">8, 12, 13, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  That is a harm reduction model. <span style="color:red">5, 14</span> When you walk out of our office, our building, if you look one block over and up San Marco is there. <span style="color:red">16, 19</span> It is 230 West 3rd Street. NA It actually has seventy units. <span style="color:red">7, 19</span> Thirty is the board and watch component for the inebriates, and we have forty single room SRO units for individuals. <span style="color:red">8, 13, 14, 17, 19</span> Basically the SRO is geared—we have our Human Development Center which is a community mental health center—they provide supportive services for individuals in the SRO in the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment provides the services for the individuals in the board watch. <span style="color:red">5, 12, 13, 17, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  To get back to meth—you saw that was a crisis, you tried to do a housing situation, then— <br> <br> <br> GA:  <span style="color:red">6</span> There were a lot of resources being allocated for this. NA There were enhanced services for Children or Family Services to provide support, direction, and intervention for those families afflicted with the issue. <span style="color:red">5, 13, 17, 18, 19</span> Things kind of, well at least from our standpoint, things fell to the wayside for a period of time, and I think the biggest thing was from a law enforcement standpoint being able to focus and reduce, and not ever totally eliminate, but greatly reduce the labs in the community. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Were they in houses in Duluth? <span style="color:red">6, 9, 13</span> They were in Duluth, rural Duluth— <br> <br> <br> AS:  I've heard of them in rural areas, but you actually had them here in the city? <span style="color:red">7, 8, 9, 20</span> I can think of at least three or four instances of those being in homes in Duluth. NA Basically it wasn't necessarily in lower income areas that this was occurring. <span style="color:red">8, 10, 20</span> It had no boundaries in relationship to income. <span style="color:red">19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Yeah, that myth is being busted right now. <span style="color:red">12</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It's really coming back. <span style="color:red">18</span> Meth is also very, very prevalent. <span style="color:red">10</span> But, things really slowed down probably, and I'm guessing, 2010, 2011. <span style="color:red">10, 18</span> We're just kind of going along. <span style="color:red">17</span> We were dealing with issues, but things were really coming to light, things were really becoming noticeable in 2011, 2012. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 18</span> In late 2012 the then commissioner of the Department of Human Services came up to Duluth with community leaders, I believe our police chief was a part of this panel and presentation, but I want to say it was Lucinda Jesson who was the Department of Human Services Commissioner at that time. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19</span> Long story short she came in and she was discussing the state's direction to put together and implement a substance use state plan to address substance use. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  She came up from St. Paul? NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  She came up from St. Paul. NA I believe there may have been—I think the Minnesota Department of Health and I think another state department was there along with our Chief of Police at the time Gordon Ramsey. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 17, 19</span> We were excited that this was taking place. <span style="color:red">11</span> I attended the session along with our adult service division director Mark Nelson. <span style="color:red">6, 18, 19</span> At the time our north St. Louis County MCD supervisor Mike [unclear], and we also had in attendance a professor from the University of Duluth's school of pharmacy Mark Sneiderhan, and the CEO of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment Gary Olson, Dr. Faris Keeling, and Dr. Beth Bilden from Essentia—at that point it was St. Mary's Duluth clinic. <span style="color:red">5, 7, 12, 16</span> We had some other treatment providers there, but this group started talking after the session, and that discussion led to a series of meetings, which basically was the first step for the development of our Opioid Abuse Response Strategies work group. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19</span> That's an overview. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  You had seen the impact in St. Louis County in 2012 was still there, right? <span style="color:red">6, 12</span> At that point in time the primary concern was focused on prescription opioids. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19</span> As conversations came about reviews, discussions, as time went on basically there came to be greater monitoring and control of prescription medications. <span style="color:red">10, 14, 18, 19, 20</span> When those were no longer easily accessed, the entrepreneurship of others reflecting back on supply and demand basically said they can't have prescription medications, but we have something that will fit their need and we will be able to provide it at a price that will be good for us and affordable for them. <span style="color:red">9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19</span> That started to swing or shift into heroin. <span style="color:red">8, 16</span> The second page of this references an appearance of two OARS [Opioid Abuse Response Strategies] members, which was basically myself and our first Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative team member [Marsha Gertel]. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 14, 19</span> We were interviewed on Almanac North. NA Almanac North is a spin-off of Almanac on Channel 2 in the Twin Cities. NA Basically those questions were posed to us and we kind of went through them. NA There had been a major heroin bust I think the day before—the date we were on Almanac North was Good Friday of 2014. <span style="color:red">13, 16</span> There was a major heroin bust either Wednesday or Thursday of that week, and based on that Channel 8 had called Dana Kazel, the communication manager, and was wanting to get some response from St. Louis County in relationship to this. <span style="color:red">13, 15, 16, 19</span> Through that our department was contacted. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 19</span> Our Adult Service Division director was unable to attend, so basically it went to myself and [Marsha Gertel] and we did the interview with two hosts of the program. <span style="color:red">18, 19</span> The OARS group basically ended up having discussions and leading up to a proposal put together through our then—I think it was late 2000s—our Public Health department and Social Service department merged into Public Health and Human Services. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 12, 19</span> Our Public Health and Human Services department proposed to the county commissioner's developing our Substance Use Prevention Intervention Initiative. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 12, 14, 19</span> Through a unanimous vote in January 2014 they basically approved the allocation of four FTE's to provide prevention/intervention services throughout St. <span style="color:red">10, 19</span> Louis County to address issues relating to substance abuse. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 12, 13</span> That's our latest draft of our pamphlet or brochure. <span style="color:red">5</span> As you can tell—yeah. NA [shows the pamphlet] <span style="color:red">17</span> So, that basically gives you the description of what we do in relationship to assisting and supporting individuals, families, and communities throughout St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">13, 17, 19</span> We will do things from public education, trainings, we'll do consultations within a department and family members or others that are calling and concerned and wanting direction or ideas. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  So people can reach OARS? <span style="color:red">9</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  We're basically an extension of OARS. <span style="color:red">19</span> It was through OARS that this program was founded. NA OARS came first. <span style="color:red">14</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  That's interesting because what I take from that is that opioid crisis led to thinking about substance abuse prevention and intervention more broadly. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19</span> Is that true? <span style="color:red">5</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  I think that's very fair. <span style="color:red">9</span> That's basically what we are looking at. <span style="color:red">19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  You didn't necessarily have coordinated services here, but you decided to expand this to include all substance use rather than just opioids. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 14, 19</span> We are doing a lot of our focus on the opioid piece. <span style="color:red">13</span> We do what is called expedited Rule 25 assessments for Children and Family Services. <span style="color:red">5, 12, 13</span> We have an incredibly high rate of out of home placement. <span style="color:red">5, 7, 12, 18</span> Kids in foster care or other licensed facilities and programs related to parental substance use. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 19, 20</span> We have a parent or parents that come in who are at risk of losing their children. <span style="color:red">5, 14, 20</span> They are in borderline crisis or in crisis. NA If they are willing and wanting we'll do the assessment, oftentimes right then if one of our workers is available, either [Matt Johnson] or [Marsha Gertel]. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 19</span> We also have a social worker in north St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">19</span> He's based in Hibbing, but we'll be able to go and if not exactly that day then the next day. <span style="color:red">13, 16</span> It happens very quickly. <span style="color:red">15</span> Let me see if I can find [rustling through papers]. <span style="color:red">6</span> Minnesota Department of Health has put together some annual—I can probably forward you through the Minnesota Department of Health—it's basically data, statistics on overdoses in Minnesota. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 12, 13, 19</span> It does a county breakdown. <span style="color:red">19</span> I have basically broken things down for St. Louis County through 2015. <span style="color:red">8, 19</span> The 2016 statistics should be coming out at any point, but we are up to through 2015 right now. <span style="color:red">12</span> You can take a look at the overdoses related to opioids. <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> This is based on admissions to licensed chemical dependency treatment programs. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 14</span> It's not necessarily dealing with individuals, but admissions. <span style="color:red">13</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Because some people might go in three times in a year. <span style="color:red">9, 14</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Yeah, as you well know from personal experience. <span style="color:red">12, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Can you talk to me about the climate of collaboration and cooperation that you think Duluth has, and is doing a good job? <span style="color:red">10, 11</span> Why do you think that is? NA What are the factors? <span style="color:red">17</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  I don't know if it is something in the drinking water. <span style="color:red">5, 11, 12, 16</span> I mean it's something that I witnessed when I first came to the community in 1987, and there is just something here that is just part of the culture and the value of being able to work together and support each other even though we may not agree on other various items or values in life. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 10, 14, 19</span> When we have a common purpose or see a problem that needs to be solved we can push our differences aside to work jointly and in a collaborative fashion. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 12</span> We submitted a grant proposal to the Department of Human Services for approximately 1.3 million dollars for the state targeted response to the opioid crisis. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14</span> The state of Minnesota received 5.3 million dollars for 2017 and 2018 through legislation that was pushed and supported very hard by Senator [Amy] Klobuchar to address the opioid crisis for rural communities. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 13, 14, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Did you say the state got five million? NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  That was for rural? NA I'll see if I can send you a PowerPoint and some handouts that will give you even more information. <span style="color:red">6</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  So you just turned that in? NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  We submitted that on April 28th [2017]. NA St. Louis County Public Health Human Service submitted a proposal as the lead partner in a consortium with Duluth Police Department, Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force, Rural AIDS Action Network, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, University of Minnesota Duluth School of Pharmacy, six judicial district drug courts, and Carleton County Public Health and Human Service. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 9, 12, 14</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  So it's for St. Louis and Carleton County? NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  Carleton County will receive no financial benefit from the application, but the things that we're doing will allow Carleton County residents access to particular things in relationship to drug court and probably the star component in this proposal is the development of a medically monitored opioid withdrawal program through Duluth Detox. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19</span> Basically it's a six-bed expansion of the Duluth Detox program, which is managed by the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, who collaborated and helped facilitate the San Marco program. <span style="color:red">12</span> Basically this will be for individuals to go through medical withdrawal with nurses and doctors monitoring. <span style="color:red">5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18</span> There will be medication that they need. <span style="color:red">14</span> The Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment also has the Clear Path program, which is a medication assisted treatment program, which utilizes both methadone and Suboxone. <span style="color:red">6, 8, 12, 13, 14</span> We went through a significant borderline crisis situation back in I want to say 2013. <span style="color:red">9, 11</span> We had a methadone program, and I don't want to get sued for what I'm about to say, but we had a methadone program called Lake Superior Treatment Center. <span style="color:red">12</span> Basically they were going through significant concerns and issues in relationship to meeting licensing. <span style="color:red">11, 12, 13, 18, 19</span> State Rule 31 licensing requirements. <span style="color:red">12</span> I want to say it was either in 2012 or 2013 their license was revoked, which put the state of Minnesota in a crisis situation because they were one of five or six programs under the same company based out of state. <span style="color:red">13, 14</span> In the state of Minnesota when a license is revoked it is revoked for all programs under the parent company. <span style="color:red">13, 14, 20</span> If they would have closed Lake Superior Treatment Center they would have ended up closing I think three or four programs in the Twin Cities, one in St. Cloud, and one in Rochester. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 10, 12, 14</span> [section omitted] NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  But the other place was a licensing issue about the way they were monitoring the methadone? <span style="color:red">6, 8, 13, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Yeah, there was a long list, but things are set up where if a provider appeals the revocation they can maintain operation through the appeal process. <span style="color:red">17</span> The appeal process went through about a two plus year time period. <span style="color:red">14, 17, 18</span> During the initial onset of this we were meeting with the Department of Human Services state contingency plans if something ended up playing out and the program was closed. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 10, 12, 18</span> As a result through collaboration with the OARS group St. Louis County put out an ROP for a community based treatment program. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 13, 19</span> We received a number of proposals. NA We ended up doing personal or presentations by three finals in the area and we basically ended up reviewing and choosing the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 19</span> Gary Olson, the CEO, had been talking about putting something together four or five years prior to this piece, so this raised the level of need. <span style="color:red">8, 14</span> Gary and the Center are just so reflective of the collaboration and the efforts to do things. NA It's a non-profit. <span style="color:red">15</span> He's the chief executive officer that's been working and dealing with this stuff for thirty plus years. <span style="color:red">8, 14</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  You picked someone that also reflects the community itself. <span style="color:red">19</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Yes. NA Focusing on community needs. <span style="color:red">6, 19</span> Gary is very adamant about this being a public health issue because it has such an impact on individuals' families in the overall community. <span style="color:red">13, 17, 19</span> It's very reflective of what we are trying to do as the OARS group. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  Is he on OARS? NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  You keep all the people who've got their hands in this issue around the table? <span style="color:red">9, 13, 17</span> We meet every two months. <span style="color:red">11, 16, 18</span> Our next meeting is June 15th. <span style="color:red">18</span> If your calendar allows you can certainly—I can send you an appointment. <span style="color:red">8, 10, 12, 17</span> We meet on the second floor. <span style="color:red">14, 18</span> It's a really exciting time. <span style="color:red">18</span> Based on what was sent out in relationship to the grant proposal we might be hearing tomorrow on whether or not—they were talking twenty-one days. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 16, 19</span> It's such a tight timeline. <span style="color:red">9</span> The state submitted their plan in January, and basically these programs are supposed to be running by July 1st. <span style="color:red">8, 19</span> Basically the awards have to be done and then the contract and negotiation piece between the awardees and DHS. <span style="color:red">19</span> They basically have the contract signed and get things in place on July 1st. <span style="color:red">11, 19</span> It's been a real interesting process. <span style="color:red">17</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  You were saying one of the things it includes is six more beds, managed detox. <span style="color:red">19</span> What are some of the other parts that you think are special or particular? <span style="color:red">9</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  A rapid response for overdose victims. <span style="color:red">13</span> We're collaborating with Duluth police, the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force. <span style="color:red">8</span> Jeff NA Kazel can give you a lot more detail with that. NA What we are doing through this particular piece we are looking at an expansion of Narcan or naloxone access. <span style="color:red">9</span> Being able to provide naloxone or Narcan and training to use that substance. <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> The target is all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">8, 12, 13</span> I think sometimes I get lost in the details—I'm not sure if that's also going to possibly include other emergency responders, but definitely all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">8, 9, 11, 12, 13</span> We're going to be partnering through our substance use prevention intervention initiative our social workers to provide rapid response in regard to follow up support. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19</span> We're going to try to get out and see the individual in one or two days. <span style="color:red">6, 16</span> If it's a Friday evening we probably wouldn't be able to do anything until Monday. <span style="color:red">16</span> Being able to get out to the individual, provide them a Rule 25 assessment, which is the first step in access in treatment, and provide other alternatives or supports that may be applicable or necessary. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14</span> Trying to establish that contact as early on as possible to get things in place to provide support. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  It's filling a gap where there haven't been enough resources or enough people to treat this quickly. <span style="color:red">5, 9</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  We're hoping that this will be a nice fit in regards to the detox expansion. <span style="color:red">15, 18, 19</span> The thing is we all know the need is going to exceed the supply, but Duluth Detox will be able to bring individuals in and provide a place for them to stay so they can get in the program. <span style="color:red">12, 13</span> Gary Olson and Duluth Detox is going to be working with north St. Louis County Range Detox in Virginia [Minnesota] being able to go into Range Detox and staying at Range Detox until they are going to be able to be brought out to the Duluth Detox program. <span style="color:red">7</span> We'll be working on other ways, too. <span style="color:red">18</span> If possible openings are available. <span style="color:red">10</span> There have been discussions about transportation to and from Ely and bringing people down. <span style="color:red">9, 17</span> The thing that gets lost with St. Louis County is geographically it is bigger than three states within the mainland. <span style="color:red">11</span> We've got a large geographical area. <span style="color:red">8</span> Another thing too, which we're reminded on a regular basis too, is that St. Louis County is so massive we're dealing with services and issues related to both urban and rural settings. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 19</span> We need to be able to understand and put things in place to address things for both areas. <span style="color:red">5, 8, 17, 18, 20</span> It helps me having grown up on a small farm to be able to better connect and understand some of those things. <span style="color:red">8, 10, 17, 18</span> There are always discussions about, "This happens here. <span style="color:red">15, 18</span> That happens there." <span style="color:red">15</span> Well, you've got an apple and you've got an orange. <span style="color:red">7</span> We can't make orange juice with an apple. <span style="color:red">7</span> We can't make apple pie with an orange. <span style="color:red">7</span> Although we can have apple juice and orange juice. <span style="color:red">7</span> May not have been a great metaphor. <span style="color:red">20</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  In an ideal world, from where you stand today, how do you think this crisis can be solved? <span style="color:red">16</span> From your vantage point as being someone who is figuring out where the money is coming from and going. <span style="color:red">8, 10</span> Do you see this being solved anytime soon? <span style="color:red">6</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It needs to be a community effort, and that's why we've got who we've got in the OARS group. <span style="color:red">19</span> It's been so well documented throughout the past four or five years from law enforcement and judicial legal system we can't arrest ourselves out of this problem. <span style="color:red">8, 12, 13, 14</span> We need to address this from both a prevention and intervention standpoint. <span style="color:red">5, 10, 13, 19</span> We need to provide the support and services for those individuals dealing with the addiction, and we need to be able to outreach and provide education and support for the community so they have a better understanding of what addiction is, what the substances, the drugs, can do to an individual, and in the process also communicate the fact that individuals are not dealing with this by choice. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19</span> They are dealing with this because they are afflicted with a disease. NA One of the key points we are trying to work on on a constant basis is the stigma. <span style="color:red">9, 15</span> We need to be able to remove the stigma associated with chemical dependency and addiction. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14, 15</span> There is a similar effort that needs to be done in regards to mental health. <span style="color:red">12, 19</span> With the stigma it is very hard for an individual to come up and say, "I'm addicted to heroin. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 14, 16</span> I need help," because there are so many signs and reactions from people like, "Oh, get out of here. <span style="color:red">9, 11</span> You're not worth anything. NA You're doing this because you want to. NA You're making bad choices because you want to. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 14</span> Just get out of here. NA I don't have time to help you." NA That type of thing. NA I think there has been some progress made. NA Just through discussions and experiences, and fortunately I don't have first-hand experience with this. <span style="color:red">14, 18</span> I've been blessed so far with my own family. <span style="color:red">12</span> In listening to others they've seen what's going on with others, their spouse, their child, or their sibling, and they see and understand the fact that they're not doing this by choice. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 14, 17, 18</span> Through that—that just amplifies the importance of the support groups such as Nar-Anon that Verne Wagner is so involved with because it's through those mutual experiences that people share. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 18</span> It ends up being a snowball that we like to have because good things are going to grow through the passing of this information and communication. <span style="color:red">10, 12</span> We need to address things both from prevention and intervention and prevention. <span style="color:red">5, 10, 19</span> We're not going to solve a lot just by addressing one thing. <span style="color:red">5</span> We are reactive instead of proactive and we have to be both. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  How did you come by your education around chemical dependency? <span style="color:red">13, 14, 15</span> Did you go to school for it? <span style="color:red">7</span> Have you learned on the job? <span style="color:red">10, 11</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  I've basically learned on the job. <span style="color:red">10, 11, 19</span> Through life experience, too. <span style="color:red">10, 18</span> In my younger days when I was down in the Twin Cities and the more social active lifestyle I was in relationships with individuals that started out great and then all of a sudden it was like A, B, C, and D. <span style="color:red">10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20</span> This isn't good. <span style="color:red">10</span> Ended up leaving a relationship and getting into another relationship and all of a sudden the same thing starts happening. <span style="color:red">15, 19</span> And it's like, wow. <span style="color:red">17</span> The interesting piece—I established a good friendship with one particular individual in grad school who was a part of the CD [chemical dependency] group in a veteran's hospital. <span style="color:red">7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 20</span> Listening to his stories on individuals and the dynamics that were tied in relationship to addiction. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14, 19</span> Hearing that kind of explained my earlier life experiences. <span style="color:red">10, 15, 18</span> Basically through the work. NA It doesn't matter if you're doing child protection or working with the elderly: <span style="color:red">14</span> chemical dependency and addiction is going to be part of your work. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13, 14</span> One of the things we are working on from a department standpoint through our Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative is attempting to put substance use disorder training as a core training function for new social workers, new employees coming into the department. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19</span> We're not there yet, but we're getting much closer. <span style="color:red">9, 10</span> We have a wonderful training department within St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 18, 19</span> We've done a lot of work with them basically getting quarterly trainings set up. <span style="color:red">19</span> Parental substance use disorder, the ABC's of addiction. <span style="color:red">6, 12, 13, 14</span> We do SBIR [Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral] training—which is brief intervention and referral to treatment—which is a screening piece that can be done by anybody. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 19</span> You don't need a Ph.D. or a master's. NA You don't need a college education to be able to do this. <span style="color:red">7, 14, 15</span> Basically it's being able to ask some open ended questions and allow an individual to share and be able to listen to their own situation and develop their own enlightenment to the risks that are involved. <span style="color:red">10, 12</span> Where the individual is at it can be as easy as saying, well, you need to get someone to drive you home at night. <span style="color:red">5</span> Or, I have some phone numbers for you to call. <span style="color:red">8, 16</span> I think it would be really good for you to get an assessment to see possibly if you might be eligible or if chemical dependency treatment might be a good direction for you to go. <span style="color:red">6, 10, 12, 13, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Do you see it as an education not just for professionals, but for everyone? <span style="color:red">6, 14, 15</span> We seem to be sorely lacking public education around substance use. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 14, 15, 19</span> It reminds me of sex education and how political it gets, and what a disservice we are doing to young, growing sexual beings. <span style="color:red">10, 12, 14, 15, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It's a tough and very uncomfortable conversation, which is conflicting with values that have been installed with us. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  It's as if we don't have any trust in people to make decisions for their own health. <span style="color:red">9, 14, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Absolutely. NA Part of our program, what I'll call the 'sappy program' is we're trying to get, and we still have to do some work on this, basically being able to—we've had some experiences with school districts throughout St. Louis County. <span style="color:red">7, 18, 19</span> We've worked on trying to provide some support, SBIR training, to employment agencies. <span style="color:red">12</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  SBIR? NA <br> <br> <br> GA:  Screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 19</span> Referral to treatment isn't necessarily going to chemical dependency treatment, but it's referring services. <span style="color:red">12, 13, 19</span> You can find a lot of information on SBIR. NA It was a best practice established in ERs, not necessarily for substance abuse. <span style="color:red">6, 13</span> It can be a very useful tool. <span style="color:red">6, 13, 18</span> It's something we encourage. NA We've done SBIR training now for over two years now within St. Louis County for social workers, probation officers, public health nurses. <span style="color:red">8, 12, 14, 19</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  People who have contact with other human beings and trying to help. <span style="color:red">19</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  Trying to expand a professional or personal toolbox. NA <br> <br> <br> AS:  Thank you. NA This has been really good. <span style="color:red">10, 18</span> I really appreciate the heart you seem to have for this. <span style="color:red">6, 9, 10, 18</span> I don't think people in these buildings with state jobs or county jobs get a lot of credit for the heart that they do have. <span style="color:red">5, 9, 11, 19</span> Even though you're writing grants and doing all this stuff you have your heart in it. <span style="color:red">9</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It's contagious. NA Basically the energy and the commitment of the others that I work with have and display regarding this. <span style="color:red">12</span> You can take some credit for that too with this interview. <span style="color:red">5</span> I've been in situations where you're talking to someone but you're really not sure the purpose and intent, and you get a little guarded and concerned about how you are saying it. <span style="color:red">14, 18, 20</span> Matt Johnson, one of our social workers, and I did a fifteen minute radio piece with KDAL 610 last Wednesday. <span style="color:red">12, 15, 16, 19</span> Tom Hanson, who was the radio person that we were working with, and he was bouncing in and out of weather and international news and local news and that type of thing, but he went out of his way just for conversation to establish a more personal type of atmosphere. <span style="color:red">15, 16, 18</span> Once things started—it doesn't often happen but Matt and <span style="color:red">15</span> I got done with that interview and we felt really good about what we're doing, what we said, what we communicated. <span style="color:red">10, 11, 14, 18</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  It's really good work. <span style="color:red">10, 18</span> I'm really happy to have the chance to come up here. <span style="color:red">18</span> <br> <br> <br> GA:  It's important. <span style="color:red">9</span> Any time we get the chance to share what we're doing for others to experience or read it's an expansion or an extension to what we're doing. <span style="color:red">18</span> We've got an information card that we're going to start producing. <span style="color:red">14</span> Law enforcement will have it at RAAN [Rural AIDS Action Network] where basically for individuals it's kind of on two sides—it's resources: <span style="color:red">8, 9, 12, 13, 19</span> Range Treatment Center, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, United Way 211 information and referral. <span style="color:red">12</span> That's a key piece. <span style="color:red">15</span> On the inside we're going to have risk reduction points: always use a clean needle, don't use with—harm reduction safety points. <span style="color:red">5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19</span> I'm blanking on some of the key points. <span style="color:red">15</span> I'll forward you some of the stuff. NA The Minnesota Department overdose reports. <span style="color:red">9, 12, 13</span> <br> <br> <br> AS:  Thank you. NA This was really helpful. <span style="color:red">9, 18</span>

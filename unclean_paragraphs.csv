"1","doc 9","ga: my name is greg anderson. i am the social service supervisor for st. louis county public health human services in the area of chemical dependency services. i have been employed with st. louis county for twenty-four plus years. i have a bachelor's degree in sociology from minnesota state mankato. i have a master's degree in social work from the university of minnesota duluth. i was born in extreme southeastern minnesota. i grew up on a farm outside of mable, minnesota, which is forty miles south of winona. went to high school, graduated from there. i already described my college life. i was born in june of 1956. ",623
"2","doc 13","ga: cover the bases. in case my attorney calls sometime. ",57
"3","doc 15","ga: two years in winona first, then transferred to mankato state. ",66
"4","doc 17","ga: neither my mother or father does. my sister had degrees in both sociology and nursing. ",91
"5","doc 19","ga: absolutely. growing up in the sixties, early seventies in a small, rural town basically there wasn't a lot of industry. the primary business or industry was farming. i was not in a position to really take on the doo-doo. allergies and other things. i wasn't in a position to carry on with the family farm, so it was real clear. my sister was eight years older than i. she had gone and went to nursing school at mankato state university. that was that. needed to move on, and i was more of a person-oriented person. if i could have handled calculus i would have been a meteorologist. then i went to look at mass communication journalism, news broadcasting. spent some time there. realized i couldn't handle the egos that were present in that area of work, so i slipped into sociology. got my ba degree and spent three summers as the summer rec program director for the mable and canton communities. had this strong love—my first love outside of family is baseball. i spend a lot of time following that when i'm not working. that's kind of that. ",1048
"6","doc 20","that got me to the twin cities. from 1978 to 1987 when i got married and moved up here i worked in nursing homes. i was a short-time activity assistant, activity director, and then spent probably eight years as a social service director. basically coordinated admissions, discharged planning, addressing psychosocial needs of nursing home residents while in the nursing home. ",376
"7","doc 21","did that, then met my wife and moved up here. realized i didn't have a lot of job opportunities with just a sociology degree, so i was one of the first graduating class members of—the advanced generalist program—msw program—at the university of minnesota duluth. umd had basically discontinued their msw program, and this was the start up of a new program going more into advanced generalist or generalist practice of doing standard basic social work with advanced education. it was a really enlightening experience for me, and it was really unique because in school for the two years in our class of about twenty something individuals i was basically the only one that had worked in gerontology. everybody else was children/family services. there were two or three individuals that were dealing with chemical dependency, substance use disorder type things. my interest at the time continued to be geriatric, elderly, assisting and supporting individuals going through the aging process. being able to assist and support them and the families. the aging process is an evolving process of grieving because as we age we transition. when we transition we lose certain skills and/or certain access or stages of life, and we have to be able to deal with that and then go into the next phase of life. as one gets older, as i currently am, even having more realization and understanding what i witnessed and experienced in the early years. ",1433
"8","doc 22","got through school at umd. had done an internship here at children and family service, which at that time was st. louis county social services. i was able to do an internship at the county nursing home. finished that. was later hired as a child protection worker. commuted for over a year and a half to hibbing, minnesota. so it was a hundred and forty-four mile trip each day to work. after about eighteen months of doing that our first child was born and i had the opportunity to work for the state of minnesota at the minnesota veteran's home in silver bay that had just opened. i spent a year there working on admission coordination. it wasn't a lot in relationship to discharge [unclear]. basically it was kind of a last phase of life for veterans and veterans' spouses, and in the meantime the program was also looking at adding an alzheimer's or dementia unit to the program. ",883
"9","doc 23","i was there for a year. we were starting to train staff as we looked at opening the additional forty beds in the unit for an alzheimer's group, but then i was able to return to duluth and get a job at chris jenson county nursing home as a discharge planner as chris jensen was adding a new role in a rehab unit. with my internship and experience i had established nice relationships in the nursing home, and so they were very happy to bring me on board. i spent two and a half years at the nursing home. came to the realization—i loved the work—but duluth and st. louis county social services was going to be my employer probably for the rest of my professional career. i needed to come down to the government service center and get myself established here. i came down in 1995. spent four plus years as a contract manager. basically working on purchase of service contracts for various units and divisions anywhere from children family service group homes, home care agencies, board and lodge programs, assisted living programs, chemical dependency treatment programs, mental health centers. i had a very wide variety of experiences within those service areas. i did that until april of 2000. ",1194
"10","doc 24","in april of 2000 i decided i needed a change. i needed to have more experience, so i became an adult foster care licenser. i was an adult foster care licenser for over two and a half years, and then based on some encouragement i had received from one or two supervisors within the department we were going through a succession plan, we had an iconic adult service supervisor who had been managing both mental health and chemical dependency services for fifteen to twenty years—she was very iconic within the human services community here in duluth and st. louis county. she was looking at retirement. i filled a position that had been vacant for two years, so i took on chemical dependency adult protection common entry point, and represented pay services, and my responsibilities have kind of evolved and switched, and so since january of 2003 i have been supervising chemical dependency services.",898
"11","doc 25","for the first twelve years i was just supervising services in south st. louis county, and we ended up doing some restructuring at that time. i took on supervision for all of st. louis county—both north and south. got rule 25 assessors in three different offices. we also have a special project, which has been generated through the county board's commitment to support and try to find resolutions to the opioid epidemic. i have been directing and overseeing substance abuse prevention, intervention initiatives since probably april of 2014. ",541
"12","doc 29","ga: coming in in 2003 the primary substance of choice was alcohol. alcohol is still seen as number one. there have been a few cycles and trends that have changed. we get into the later 2000s, maybe starting 2006, 2007 we had an incredible upswing in methamphetamine. we were basically dealing with that on two different fronts. not only the effect it was having on the individuals and family through the use, but also the public health crisis we were dealing with through the manufacturing. a lot of money, a lot of resources were put into that. we actually worked through a collaboration through children and family services unit and through our financial assistance unit we were working on setting up a shared family program where basically mothers and/or parents dealing with substance use would be placed into an adult foster home, or actually it would end up being a dually licensed foster home where a parent and child could be placed together to assist and support during the initial phases of the recovery process. a lot of barriers in place from a state perspective in regards to funding. funding for adults, for residential services through what is called the group state residential housing program has significant effects on the minnesota family investment program, mfip. so using 1) has impacts on others, and i can't get into great detail right now because my memory's kind of faded. we operated it for about two to three years, but there were continuing barriers in regards to getting the appropriate level of funding and getting families to accept what was needing to be done from a financial assistance standpoint. ",1632
"13","doc 31","ga: yeah. monitoring, mentoring, those types of—",48
"14","doc 33","ga: it got to be very frustrating. we had actually before i had come into this position there had been ongoing discussions in the past regarding trying to do this for parents dealing with mental illness. this was a continuation. there were some barriers in regards to the funding streams. the state has worked very hard in trying to get things in place in relationship to the efforts to reduce homelessness and provide permanent support of housing services. i'm not sure if some of those things may have now changed. we haven't really taken a look at that. in recent times we've been looking at other projects in relationship to harm reduction for chronic inebriates who face long-term homelessness. we have a program called the san marco, which was basically a project that has been modeled in several other communities not only within the state of minnesota, but also throughout the country. center for alcohol and drug treatment and center city housing were key players in that. st. louis county public health and human services provided a supportive role in the development. we worked with assistance in utilizing a group residential housing financial assistance benefit to provide funding for those individuals meeting those characteristics. as a matter of fact we're having a ten-year anniversary of it's opening on june 22nd. alcohol consumption is not a—",1362
"15","doc 35","ga: that's a common term. we've kind of shifted from a wet house to a supportive housing for chronic inebriates. that's just another example of what the collaboration and commitment of a community can do to address it. i wish i still had a dvd—a dvd was made i think two years after the opening—and it's called ""there are no losers,"" and it's a very telling story. they bring tears to some. i'll have to see if i can find it in my office. law enforcement was real, i don't want to say cynical, but they had some real concerns about putting this together, and basically the end of the dvd is a very moving statement by our then police chief in regards to the program and what it has done not only for the individuals residing there, but for the positive impact on the city and community. ",787
"16","doc 37","ga: it is. when you walk out of our office, our building, if you look one block over and up san marco is there. it is 230 west 3rd street. it actually has seventy units. thirty is the board and watch component for the inebriates, and we have forty single room sro units for individuals. basically the sro is geared—we have our human development center which is a community mental health center—they provide supportive services for individuals in the sro in the center for alcohol and drug treatment provides the services for the individuals in the board watch. ",561
"17","doc 39","ga: there were a lot of resources being allocated for this. there were enhanced services for children or family services to provide support, direction, and intervention for those families afflicted with the issue. things kind of, well at least from our standpoint, things fell to the wayside for a period of time, and i think the biggest thing was from a law enforcement standpoint being able to focus and reduce, and not ever totally eliminate, but greatly reduce the labs in the community. ",492
"18","doc 41","ga: yeah. they were in duluth, rural duluth—",44
"19","doc 43","ga: yeah. i can think of at least three or four instances of those being in homes in duluth. basically it wasn't necessarily in lower income areas that this was occurring. it had no boundaries in relationship to income. ",220
"20","doc 45","ga: it's really coming back. meth is also very, very prevalent. but, things really slowed down probably, and i'm guessing, 2010, 2011. we're just kind of going along. we were dealing with issues, but things were really coming to light, things were really becoming noticeable in 2011, 2012. in late 2012 the then commissioner of the department of human services came up to duluth with community leaders, i believe our police chief was a part of this panel and presentation, but i want to say it was lucinda jesson who was the department of human services commissioner at that time. long story short she came in and she was discussing the state's direction to put together and implement a substance use state plan to address substance use. ",738
"21","doc 47","ga: she came up from st. paul. i believe there may have been—i think the minnesota department of health and i think another state department was there along with our chief of police at the time gordon ramsey. we were excited that this was taking place. i attended the session along with our adult service division director mark nelson. at the time our north st. louis county mcd supervisor mike [unclear], and we also had in attendance a professor from the university of duluth's school of pharmacy mark sneiderhan, and the ceo of the center for alcohol and drug treatment gary olson, dr. faris keeling, and dr. beth bilden from essentia—at that point it was st. mary's duluth clinic. we had some other treatment providers there, but this group started talking after the session, and that discussion led to a series of meetings, which basically was the first step for the development of our opioid abuse response strategies work group. that's an overview. ",956
"22","doc 49","ga: yeah. at that point in time the primary concern was focused on prescription opioids. as conversations came about reviews, discussions, as time went on basically there came to be greater monitoring and control of prescription medications. when those were no longer easily accessed, the entrepreneurship of others reflecting back on supply and demand basically said they can't have prescription medications, but we have something that will fit their need and we will be able to provide it at a price that will be good for us and affordable for them. that started to swing or shift into heroin. ",596
"23","doc 50","the second page of this references an appearance of two oars [opioid abuse response strategies] members, which was basically myself and our first substance abuse prevention intervention initiative team member [marsha gertel]. we were interviewed on almanac north. almanac north is a spin-off of almanac on channel 2 in the twin cities. basically those questions were posed to us and we kind of went through them. there had been a major heroin bust i think the day before—the date we were on almanac north was good friday of 2014. there was a major heroin bust either wednesday or thursday of that week, and based on that channel 8 had called dana kazel, the communication manager, and was wanting to get some response from st. louis county in relationship to this. through that our department was contacted. our adult service division director was unable to attend, so basically it went to myself and [marsha gertel] and we did the interview with two hosts of the program.",972
"24","doc 51","the oars group basically ended up having discussions and leading up to a proposal put together through our then—i think it was late 2000s—our public health department and social service department merged into public health and human services. our public health and human services department proposed to the county commissioner's developing our substance use prevention intervention initiative. through a unanimous vote in january 2014 they basically approved the allocation of four fte's to provide prevention/intervention services throughout st. louis county to address issues relating to substance abuse. ",607
"25","doc 52","that's our latest draft of our pamphlet or brochure. as you can tell—yeah. [shows the pamphlet] so, that basically gives you the description of what we do in relationship to assisting and supporting individuals, families, and communities throughout st. louis county. we will do things from public education, trainings, we'll do consultations within a department and family members or others that are calling and concerned and wanting direction or ideas.",453
"26","doc 54","ga: we're basically an extension of oars. it was through oars that this program was founded. oars came first. ",110
"27","doc 56","ga: i think that's very fair. that's basically what we are looking at. ",71
"28","doc 58","ga: yeah. we are doing a lot of our focus on the opioid piece. we do what is called expedited rule 25 assessments for children and family services. we have an incredibly high rate of out of home placement. kids in foster care or other licensed facilities and programs related to parental substance use. we have a parent or parents that come in who are at risk of losing their children. they are in borderline crisis or in crisis. if they are willing and wanting we'll do the assessment, oftentimes right then if one of our workers is available, either [matt johnson] or [marsha gertel]. we also have a social worker in north st. louis county. he's based in hibbing, but we'll be able to go and if not exactly that day then the next day. it happens very quickly. ",762
"29","doc 59","let me see if i can find [rustling through papers]. minnesota department of health has put together some annual—i can probably forward you through the minnesota department of health—it's basically data, statistics on overdoses in minnesota. it does a county breakdown. i have basically broken things down for st. louis county through 2015. the 2016 statistics should be coming out at any point, but we are up to through 2015 right now. you can take a look at the overdoses related to opioids. this is based on admissions to licensed chemical dependency treatment programs. it's not necessarily dealing with individuals, but admissions. ",636
"30","doc 61","ga: yeah, as you well know from personal experience. ",53
"31","doc 63","ga: i don't know if it is something in the drinking water. i mean it's something that i witnessed when i first came to the community in 1987, and there is just something here that is just part of the culture and the value of being able to work together and support each other even though we may not agree on other various items or values in life. when we have a common purpose or see a problem that needs to be solved we can push our differences aside to work jointly and in a collaborative fashion. we submitted a grant proposal to the department of human services for approximately 1.3 million dollars for the state targeted response to the opioid crisis. the state of minnesota received 5.3 million dollars for 2017 and 2018 through legislation that was pushed and supported very hard by senator [amy] klobuchar to address the opioid crisis for rural communities. ",867
"32","doc 65","ga: yeah. 5.3 million. ",23
"33","doc 67","ga: yeah. i'll see if i can send you a powerpoint and some handouts that will give you even more information. ",110
"34","doc 69","ga: we submitted that on april 28th [2017]. st. louis county public health human service submitted a proposal as the lead partner in a consortium with duluth police department, lake superior drug and violent crime task force, rural aids action network, center for alcohol and drug treatment, university of minnesota duluth school of pharmacy, six judicial district drug courts, and carleton county public health and human service.",430
"35","doc 71","ga: carleton county will receive no financial benefit from the application, but the things that we're doing will allow carleton county residents access to particular things in relationship to drug court and probably the star component in this proposal is the development of a medically monitored opioid withdrawal program through duluth detox. basically it's a six-bed expansion of the duluth detox program, which is managed by the center for alcohol and drug treatment, who collaborated and helped facilitate the san marco program. basically this will be for individuals to go through medical withdrawal with nurses and doctors monitoring. there will be medication that they need. the center for alcohol and drug treatment also has the clear path program, which is a medication assisted treatment program, which utilizes both methadone and suboxone. ",851
"36","doc 72","we went through a significant borderline crisis situation back in i want to say 2013. we had a methadone program, and i don't want to get sued for what i'm about to say, but we had a methadone program called lake superior treatment center. basically they were going through significant concerns and issues in relationship to meeting licensing. state rule 31 licensing requirements. i want to say it was either in 2012 or 2013 their license was revoked, which put the state of minnesota in a crisis situation because they were one of five or six programs under the same company based out of state. in the state of minnesota when a license is revoked it is revoked for all programs under the parent company. if they would have closed lake superior treatment center they would have ended up closing i think three or four programs in the twin cities, one in st. cloud, and one in rochester. ",887
"37","doc 75","ga: yeah, there was a long list, but things are set up where if a provider appeals the revocation they can maintain operation through the appeal process. the appeal process went through about a two plus year time period. during the initial onset of this we were meeting with the department of human services state contingency plans if something ended up playing out and the program was closed. as a result through collaboration with the oars group st. louis county put out an rop for a community based treatment program. we received a number of proposals. we ended up doing personal or presentations by three finals in the area and we basically ended up reviewing and choosing the center for alcohol and drug treatment. gary olson, the ceo, had been talking about putting something together four or five years prior to this piece, so this raised the level of need. gary and the center are just so reflective of the collaboration and the efforts to do things. ",959
"38","doc 77","ga: he's from here. it's a non-profit. he's the chief executive officer that's been working and dealing with this stuff for thirty plus years. ",143
"39","doc 79","ga: yes. focusing on community needs. gary is very adamant about this being a public health issue because it has such an impact on individuals' families in the overall community. it's very reflective of what we are trying to do as the oars group. ",247
"40","doc 83","ga: yeah. we meet every two months. our next meeting is june 15th. if your calendar allows you can certainly—i can send you an appointment. we meet on the second floor. it's a really exciting time. based on what was sent out in relationship to the grant proposal we might be hearing tomorrow on whether or not—they were talking twenty-one days. it's such a tight timeline. the state submitted their plan in january, and basically these programs are supposed to be running by july 1st. basically the awards have to be done and then the contract and negotiation piece between the awardees and dhs. they basically have the contract signed and get things in place on july 1st. it's been a real interesting process. ",711
"41","doc 85","ga: a rapid response for overdose victims. we're collaborating with duluth police, the lake superior drug and violent crime task force. jeff kazel can give you a lot more detail with that. what we are doing through this particular piece we are looking at an expansion of narcan or naloxone access. being able to provide naloxone or narcan and training to use that substance. the target is all law enforcement agencies throughout st. louis county. i think sometimes i get lost in the details—i'm not sure if that's also going to possibly include other emergency responders, but definitely all law enforcement agencies throughout st. louis county. ",646
"42","doc 86","we're going to be partnering through our substance use prevention intervention initiative our social workers to provide rapid response in regard to follow up support. we're going to try to get out and see the individual in one or two days. if it's a friday evening we probably wouldn't be able to do anything until monday. being able to get out to the individual, provide them a rule 25 assessment, which is the first step in access in treatment, and provide other alternatives or supports that may be applicable or necessary. trying to establish that contact as early on as possible to get things in place to provide support. ",627
"43","doc 88","ga: we're hoping that this will be a nice fit in regards to the detox expansion. the thing is we all know the need is going to exceed the supply, but duluth detox will be able to bring individuals in and provide a place for them to stay so they can get in the program. gary olson and duluth detox is going to be working with north st. louis county range detox in virginia [minnesota] being able to go into range detox and staying at range detox until they are going to be able to be brought out to the duluth detox program. we'll be working on other ways, too. if possible openings are available. there have been discussions about transportation to and from ely and bringing people down. ",688
"44","doc 89","the thing that gets lost with st. louis county is geographically it is bigger than three states within the mainland. we've got a large geographical area. another thing too, which we're reminded on a regular basis too, is that st. louis county is so massive we're dealing with services and issues related to both urban and rural settings. we need to be able to understand and put things in place to address things for both areas. it helps me having grown up on a small farm to be able to better connect and understand some of those things. there are always discussions about, ""this happens here. that happens there."" “shouldn't it be the same?” well, you've got an apple and you've got an orange. we can't make orange juice with an apple. we can't make apple pie with an orange. although we can have apple juice and orange juice. may not have been a great metaphor. ",865
"45","doc 91","ga: it needs to be a community effort, and that's why we've got who we've got in the oars group. it's been so well documented throughout the past four or five years from law enforcement and judicial legal system we can't arrest ourselves out of this problem. we need to address this from both a prevention and intervention standpoint. we need to provide the support and services for those individuals dealing with the addiction, and we need to be able to outreach and provide education and support for the community so they have a better understanding of what addiction is, what the substances, the drugs, can do to an individual, and in the process also communicate the fact that individuals are not dealing with this by choice. they are dealing with this because they are afflicted with a disease. ",800
"46","doc 92","one of the key points we are trying to work on on a constant basis is the stigma. we need to be able to remove the stigma associated with chemical dependency and addiction. there is a similar effort that needs to be done in regards to mental health. with the stigma it is very hard for an individual to come up and say, ""i'm addicted to heroin. i need help,"" because there are so many signs and reactions from people like, ""oh, get out of here. you're not worth anything. you're doing this because you want to. you're making bad choices because you want to. just get out of here. i don't have time to help you."" that type of thing. ",632
"47","doc 93","i think there has been some progress made. just through discussions and experiences, and fortunately i don't have first-hand experience with this. i've been blessed so far with my own family. in listening to others they've seen what's going on with others, their spouse, their child, or their sibling, and they see and understand the fact that they're not doing this by choice. through that—that just amplifies the importance of the support groups such as nar-anon that verne wagner is so involved with because it's through those mutual experiences that people share. it ends up being a snowball that we like to have because good things are going to grow through the passing of this information and communication. we need to address things both from prevention and intervention and prevention. we're not going to solve a lot just by addressing one thing. we are reactive instead of proactive and we have to be both. ",916
"48","doc 95","ga: i've basically learned on the job. through life experience, too. in my younger days when i was down in the twin cities and the more social active lifestyle i was in relationships with individuals that started out great and then all of a sudden it was like a, b, c, and d. this isn't good. ended up leaving a relationship and getting into another relationship and all of a sudden the same thing starts happening. and it's like, wow. the interesting piece—i established a good friendship with one particular individual in grad school who was a part of the cd [chemical dependency] group in a veteran's hospital. listening to his stories on individuals and the dynamics that were tied in relationship to addiction. hearing that kind of explained my earlier life experiences. ",776
"49","doc 96","basically through the work. it doesn't matter if you're doing child protection or working with the elderly: chemical dependency and addiction is going to be part of your work. one of the things we are working on from a department standpoint through our substance abuse prevention intervention initiative is attempting to put substance use disorder training as a core training function for new social workers, new employees coming into the department. we're not there yet, but we're getting much closer. we have a wonderful training department within st. louis county. we've done a lot of work with them basically getting quarterly trainings set up. parental substance use disorder, the abc's of addiction. we do sbir [screening, brief intervention, and referral] training—which is brief intervention and referral to treatment—which is a screening piece that can be done by anybody. you don't need a ph.d. or a master's. you don't need a college education to be able to do this. basically it's being able to ask some open ended questions and allow an individual to share and be able to listen to their own situation and develop their own enlightenment to the risks that are involved. where the individual is at it can be as easy as saying, well, you need to get someone to drive you home at night. or, i have some phone numbers for you to call. i think it would be really good for you to get an assessment to see possibly if you might be eligible or if chemical dependency treatment might be a good direction for you to go. ",1523
"50","doc 98","ga: it's a tough and very uncomfortable conversation, which is conflicting with values that have been installed with us. ",121
"51","doc 100","ga: absolutely. part of our program, what i'll call the 'sappy program' is we're trying to get, and we still have to do some work on this, basically being able to—we've had some experiences with school districts throughout st. louis county. we've worked on trying to provide some support, sbir training, to employment agencies. ",328
"52","doc 102","ga: screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment. referral to treatment isn't necessarily going to chemical dependency treatment, but it's referring services. you can find a lot of information on sbir. it was a best practice established in ers, not necessarily for substance abuse. it can be a very useful tool. it's something we encourage. we've done sbir training now for over two years now within st. louis county for social workers, probation officers, public health nurses. ",487
"53","doc 104","ga: trying to expand a professional or personal toolbox. ",57
"54","doc 106","ga: it's contagious. basically the energy and the commitment of the others that i work with have and display regarding this. you can take some credit for that too with this interview. i've been in situations where you're talking to someone but you're really not sure the purpose and intent, and you get a little guarded and concerned about how you are saying it. matt johnson, one of our social workers, and i did a fifteen minute radio piece with kdal 610 last wednesday. tom hanson, who was the radio person that we were working with, and he was bouncing in and out of weather and international news and local news and that type of thing, but he went out of his way just for conversation to establish a more personal type of atmosphere. once things started—it doesn't often happen but matt and i got done with that interview and we felt really good about what we're doing, what we said, what we communicated. ",911
"55","doc 108","ga: it's important. any time we get the chance to share what we're doing for others to experience or read it's an expansion or an extension to what we're doing. we've got an information card that we're going to start producing. law enforcement will have it at raan [rural aids action network] where basically for individuals it's kind of on two sides—it's resources: range treatment center, center for alcohol and drug treatment, united way 211 information and referral. that's a key piece. on the inside we're going to have risk reduction points: always use a clean needle, don't use with—harm reduction safety points. i'm blanking on some of the key points. i'll forward you some of the stuff. the minnesota department overdose reports.  ",740

"59","doc 123","jbc: sure. i grew up in the country outside of cincinnati, ohio on a farm. it was mostly a grain farm, but we had cows and pigs and chickens. i was one of three girls. although i do have a half-brother from an affair my father had. a pretty normal farm girl childhood. i went to claremont northeastern high school. i have a horticulture degree and worked in the horticulture field for a number of years. then moved to minnesota and worked, i think i was twenty-one maybe, when i moved to minnesota. i worked for a landscape, lawn care company in roseville. albrecht landscaping, actually. just did that for the summer. decided that horticulture wasn’t really a good year-round thing in minnesota. so i started working for prudential.",733
"60","doc 124","i came here—actually this is maybe key to the story. i came to be in minnesota because a guy that i met while in college, that i was sort of engaged to, although i think it was more kind of a fling, he came here for chemical dependency training. after he got out of treatment he stayed here. i moved here and we lasted maybe a month. another guy that he lived with, that also had been in treatment, he and i started dating. we ended up getting married and having two kids. my ex-husband is the father of my two older boys. he was in recovery for a number of years, although now he drinks and smokes. as far as i know that’s all. ",629
"61","doc 125","i don’t know what else you want to know. i was twenty-five or twenty-six when i had my oldest son. then two years later had chance. now i have three other children with my second husband.",187
"62","doc 127","jbc: i think i got married in 1989. we got divorced in 1997. we split up in 1983.",81

"64","doc 131","jbc: no, i had for probably a year and a half—i had them during the week and every other weekend he had them. then we switched to i had them for a week and he had them for a week. he moved to the same town that i was in. so we were able to make that work, same school district and everything. [side conversation]. ",314
"65","doc 132","[recording resumes after break]",31
"66","doc 133","so we did week to week for the boys, which worked out well for the most part. although different parenting styles in each house i’m sure was one of our biggest challenges. the fact that the boys stepmother, who was very controlling and very much wanted to be their real mom, made it a little bit difficult. anyways, we did that pretty much up until they were out of high school. probably at least until the older one was. when chance—he’s the one with substance abuse disorder—when he was in high school he started using. maybe even before then. when we started to become aware of that that was when he was in high school. i think it was his senior year that my husband, my current husband, did a fellowship at the mayo clinic in jacksonville, florida. we had to move down there. we moved to jacksonville beach for a year. chance was going to stay here with his dad and finish high school. then he never quite made it to his senior year because he had a dui. i shouldn’t say he didn’t make it to his senior year. he didn’t make it back to champlin park high for his senior year. he went to some alternative sober high school. in january of his senior year, which would have been 2008, he moved to jacksonville beach to live with me and my husband. at the time it was just emma. so he went down there and he got into the public school down there and finished high school. ",1371
"67","doc 135","jbc: what i knew was that he was smoking weed. i did not know that he was drinking alcohol and doing other drugs, which apparently he was. i didn’t really think it was a big deal. [side conversation].",200
"68","doc 136","[recording resumes after break]",31
"69","doc 138","jbc: it did, except there were a couple times when he was in trouble with the police. he was smoking weed in a public park and he got picked up. we did what we thought was the right thing at the time, which was send him to do an assessment and then just an outpatient treatment. he went to anthony louis center. we just kind of monitored him. probably didn’t have my eyes wide open at the time because according to him he was doing many other things besides marijuana that was not obvious to me. ",496
"70","doc 139","i earlier said that he came down to florida to live with us. that really came about because right before senior year started he was picked up for a dui. he went back to treatment at that time, back to anthony louis this time as an inpatient. that was when i was in florida.",273
"71","doc 141","jbc: it’s in anoka i think.",27
"72","doc 143","jbc: they have on-belay house, which is in plymouth, so it’s part of that whole group. anyway, he did that and he went to anthony louis center. then he went into sober school. i forget which one. he’s been to like three of them around here. that may or may not be in existence now. then he started using again. he went back to anthony louis center for a third time probably within like a year and half period. went right from there to on-belay house, which is a halfway house, or transitional house, in plymouth. he was going to a sober high school and got kicked out of there. not for using, but for attitude. imagine that, an addict with an attitude.",652
"73","doc 145","jbc: he got kicked out of there. his dad would not let him back in his house.",77
"74","doc 147","jbc: i was in florida and this was winter. his dad took him around all the homeless centers one night. they were full. this is a seventeen-year-old boy. i guess he was playing the tough love card. nobody had any room at the inn. [laughs] so he ended up couch surfing for a few days. ",283
"75","doc 148","then we bought him a ticket to come down to florida, which was an experience because he got down there and we immediately got him enrolled in the high school. i’d come to find out he needed like one class. this was january into his senior year and he’d been to school maybe cumulatively three weeks out of that whole senior year so far. he only needed one class to finish up school in florida. we made him take a full load and he got a job at the local, little pizza shop down there. again, kind of eyes half closed, he got into drugs down there and was drinking. keeping it relatively secret—not so bad that it became obvious. until a couple months before we moved back here. his boss caught him sneaking beer while at work from the tap. confronted him about it and addressed it and then he kept his job. he was better at sneaking the beer i guess. am i rambling too much?",873
"76","doc 150","jbc: so we came back here—this was 2008. he graduated from neptune fletcher high school, or something, down there. it was in jacksonville beach. that was like in may. in july of that year we moved back up here to minnesota. at the time we lived in champlin. he got a job and he started community college. things were going okay. ",329
"77","doc 152","jbc: yes, he was living with me and my husband. by now i was pregnant with the twins. that went on, and i’m sure he was using and drinking a little bit. it didn’t seem out of control. he was, like i said, working. he was going to school. he was getting good grades. ",266
"78","doc 153","then it was august in 2001 when he went out to new york with his dad and stepmom and brother to his cousin’s wedding. while he was there he was talking to his cousins. apparently he told one of his cousins that he was using heroin. the uncle, the cousin’s dad, overheard this and told my ex-husband. then john, the dad of the cousin, my ex-husband’s brother, called me to tell me. we just weren’t sure how to address this. we didn’t know what to do. we had never in our wildest dreams thought he would be using heroin. apparently he was unique in that he never used prescription drugs. ",586
"79","doc 155","jbc: he just went straight to heroin. i want to say probably went straight to injecting. we decided that he was such a good negotiator and such a good liar that if we just tried to talk to him without support we wouldn’t be successful. we hired an interventionist from somewhere in ohio. her name was jane metts. she came out and we did some planning. we decided on promises rehab center out in california. we had this big thing worked out. the morning of it my husband and i kind of made up some, “we’re going somewhere,” you know, and got chance. it was at his dad’s house. we had someone watching the little kids at my house. we got him over there. i’d already had a bag packed assuming this would all go his way. we do this intervention and then jane said, “you’ve heard from your mom and dad. we’ve got this treatment center.” the director the treatment center had flown out. she was there. this cost us a lot of money. [laughs]. “you’ve heard all this and we’ve got this treatment center, promises, is all picked out for you, they’re ready for you.” i can’t remember her name now. “she’s going to fly back with you.” patricia. patricia meyers. “so what do you think?” he goes, “well what are my other options?” jane said to him, “you don’t have any other options.” he said, “okay, well then i guess i’ll go.” so he went, did ninety days at promises.",1355
"80","doc 157","jbc: yes. he was always, and always has been, and still is very forthcoming once you confront him. once you get him to start talking about it. he’ll do the whole denial thing like, “what are you talking about?” ",211
"81","doc 158","[resumes after break in recording]",34
"82","doc 159","he’s always, once you kind of get past the bullshit, then pretty open about his use. has generally, when push comes to shove and it’s time to go to treatment, he goes. he’s been in inpatient treatment eleven times.",214
"83","doc 161","jbc: eleven times. some of those times were us saying, “this is your only option.” a couple times he’s asked to go back. so he went to promises. is this the kind of stuff you want to hear?",188
"84","doc 163","jbc: he went to promises. he was in promises for ninety days and then went to a very structured sober living house in venice. he was at the west la promises, not the malibu. west la is more for his age group. then he did, i think it was about five months, of sober living at a place called casa del oeste, which is a great place. then he and another boy from there moved out into an apartment on their own. i say, boy, i think he was twenty-nine at the time. they both relapsed. we didn’t know that for a little while. the other boy died, not of a drug overdose, but of septic shock from intravenous needles, yes. it was definitely drug related. chance initiated going back at that point to the sober living house.",714
"85","doc 165","jbc: not back to treatment at this point. ",42
"86","doc 167","jbc: yes, they let him, which seemed to work out just fine for a while. he stayed there for another four months. he got a job and he was working at a golf shop and playing golf when he wasn’t working, doing the whole recovery thing. then he met this girl at work. summer was her name. i don’t know if she was ever in recovery but at the time that he met her she was using. so he relapsed. by the time he relapsed he had moved out of the sober living house and was living with two other people in recovery that had long-term recovery under their belt, still in venice. they found out he was using and they called me to let me know that they would be asking him to move out. he moved in with this girlfriend. no, no, no. he didn’t. he was on the street for a few days and then he went back to promises. he didn’t stay the whole ninety days. he stayed maybe a month and a half. then he moved in with this girlfriend.",913
"87","doc 168","then it got really bad and he and his girlfriend became so, i don’t know what the right word is, they were both using so much. things were getting out of control. they were scaring each other. she finally called me. i’m trying to remember when this was. it was like 2012 i think. he came back here. i convinced him that morning to get on a plane. he came back here and did a detox, went straight from the airport to detox then to treatment. ",441
"88","doc 169","then relapsed and just kind of over and over. he went to a couple more treatment places. he wasn’t living here, he was renting rooms. did a sober living house for a little bit. then he ended up going out to utah for treatment. he came back here, went back out to utah again. there’s just treatment, after treatment, after treatment. relapsed. some of those treatments, ninety days, a few of them were ninety days. he went to hazelden somewhere in between there. he went to a couple different places here. one was lake place retreat. he’s been in different sober living homes.

"89","doc 173","jbc: most of the time.",22
"90","doc 175","jbc: yes, doing all that. almost always looking for the place, finding it, arranging for him to do the intake, to do the assessment. he’s always had private insurance. so he’s never had to do a rule 25 kind of thing. part of me wonders if some of that was a disadvantage, me always doing all this for him. i mean i would be the one making the phone calls. i talked to more treatment centers over my lifetime than i ever thought i would. i was just trying to find one that’s different.",484
"91","doc 177","jbc: one of the treatment centers he went to in utah, he was there for thirteen months. it was really comprehensive, they had a great transitional program, and he did great while he was there, which is his story. he does great when he’s in treatment. he’s cooperative. he’s probably manipulative. he does great and then he gets out and he relapses. yes, i just managed the crisis.

"95","doc 184","jbc: i’m not sure i’m going to get these years right.",53
"96","doc 186","jbc: there was a point, a couple years ago, when he had been to new roads treatment center in utah. that was the place that i was mentioning that’s long term. the first time he was there he just really did their inpatient. he didn’t do their transitional living. he chose to leave before that. lived with a girl that he met there. that ended up being a disaster. he overdosed while living with her. she called 911. fortunately, he was saved with naloxone. they lived together for about eight or so months. then they broke up. he really didn’t have anything keeping him in utah and he came back here. ",600
"97","doc 187","he was living with us for a couple of months. he got a job but quickly went back to hanging with his friends in champlin that were still using. quickly he got back into heroin. quit his job, started doing odd jobs with this guy. i knew when he started using because he stopped coming home. he knew that if he was actively using he couldn’t live here at the time. he got pretty deep down in the hole very quickly, which i know happens. that would have been around may when he moved back here. it was mid-july when he finally asked—he called me one day and said, “can i go back to treatment?” i’m like, “yes. when and where?” he wanted to go back to new roads. i made the phone calls, i got him an airline ticket, and he went out there.

"100","doc 192","jbc: yes. it was like two more nights. they were going to spend that, he didn’t get in there until like nine, they were going to spend that night, the whole day and then go that following morning which would have been a wednesday. as it turned out, he was not only using heroin, but using benzodiazepine. that next day, i had been in communication with them both all day. he was so out of it he couldn’t understand me when i talked to him. i had, unbeknownst to them, it was like four or something in the afternoon our time. i called both of their treatment centers and i said, “i know you guys are scheduled to pick them up, respectively, at this time tomorrow morning. can you go pick them up right now? they’re both at this hotel. here’s the address, go get them.” ",768
"101","doc 193","well, her treatment couldn’t. his treatment said, “yep. we’ll be there.” this was in salt lake city; they were like two hours outside of salt lake city in provo. they said, “we’ll be there in a couple hours.” well i then called a girlfriend that i knew of hers and said, “she’s going to be there overnight by herself because her treatment center can’t. can you go stay with her? so she’s not alone.” so this girlfriend was going to go stay with jerrica. chance’s treatment center was going to come. ",499
"102","doc 194","in the meantime, i get a call from jerrica saying, “chance just took off and i don’t know where he went. he told me he was going to go mow his neighbor’s lawn.” she goes, “i’ve been trying to call his cell phone, and he’s not answering. he just took off without shoes. he had his jeans on and his t-shirt but no shoes and just took off saying he was going to go mow his neighbor’s yard.” i’m like, “jerrica what is he using?” she tells me. i’m like, “he’ll be back.”",466

"114","doc 215","this all happens. he gets there, well then he calls back to tell me, “well we’re not going to detox him at new roads. we didn’t realize how much benzos he had been taking.” like sixteen milligrams a day. the average dose is two to four. benzodiazepine withdrawal can be quite dangerous so they wanted to put him in a medical facility, a hospital, to detox. they took him to a hospital to detox. the next day i’m in a number of conversations with the people at new roads about him being, i can’t think of the right words, belligerent and not grateful. all the things you would expect.

"117","doc 220","this is probably the worst story. that’s why i’m focusing on it. one friday i’d been out on the boat almost all day and i didn’t take my phone. when i got back i have like six missed calls from new roads and messages that, “chance is trying to leave and the only reason that he hasn’t left is because we won’t give him the money that’s in his commissary account.” or whatever you call it. i put $90 in there for miscellaneous expenses. “the only reason we’re able to keep him here is because we won’t give him that money.” i finally talk to chance. i talk to chance and he’s like, “mom i’m leaving. tell them that they can give me my $90.” i said, “first of all you’re not leaving. second of all it’s not your $90.” he’s like, “well then i guess i’ll just sleep on the street.” i’m like, “no, i think you’ll stay there.” he goes, “no, it’s already done. i already signed myself out. i’m leaving. they’re not going to take me back.” i’m like, “yes, they are. i already talked to them. they’re going to let you stay.” he’s like, “no, i’m not staying.” i’m like, “well, you’re not getting your $90. i hope you decide that you’re going to stay.” that was the hardest thing i ever did. i did not know if he was going to stay. i kept calling them to say, “is he still there? is he still there?” he was.

"124","doc 232","finally i get a call from him from the hospital. i could barely understand him. they hadn’t sedated him or anything but by now the adrenaline’s gone and the drugs are there. i asked him, “what’s going on?” “i don’t really know.” “well can i talk to a nurse?” he’s like, “i don’t know how to get a nurse.” finally i call back and i get the nurse’s station and they’re like, “well i can’t tell you what’s going on.” “can you go to his room and get his permission to tell me? he’ll give it.” they did and they’re telling me, “physically he’s probably okay. we did a ct and everything looks okay. we’ll probably be releasing him tonight.” i said, “what’s the tox screen say?” that’s how i knew alcohol, heroin, benzodiazepines, or opioids and benzodiazepines. i said, “can you have him talk to a social worker or something? don’t just like release him and call me before you release him.” none of that happened. they released him.

"125","doc 233","he calls me later after he had been out and one of his buddies picked him up. he calls me to say, “it was just a slip. i hadn’t been using very long. i’m kind of glad that this happened because i didn’t know what else to do. i was going to kill myself.” i’m like, “oh my god.” he tells me this over the phone. i’m thinking, “okay. well that’s really scary but you’ve only been using for like a week.” he’s like, “i’m just going to stop. i’m going to stay in school and i’m going to get back on track.” within the course of a couple days it became really obvious it wasn’t just a slip and it wasn’t just a couple weeks. he wasn’t managing to stay sober.

"137","doc 256","one time, it was a friday, he and ashley went to buy subutex and they also bought heroin. nobody but he and ashley knew that they each had heroin. they each went back to their respective parent’s house and they used that friday night and saturday. then it was on a sunday when he was at home in the basement of his mom’s house. jackie had just talked to him. he’d gone downstairs and she was doing some laundry. the laundry room is downstairs. it’d been ten, fifteen minutes. she went down to switch out some laundry and she heard a noise, kind of a gurgling noise. she’s like, “drew! drew!” she found him on the floor, needle in his arm. he was still warm. they figured out between text messages that it couldn’t have been more than ten minutes because he had just texted ashley and ashley had texted him back. then by the time she got down there it had been about ten minutes. she doesn’t know if he used right after the text message.

[laughs] anything but that. i remember when i was reading about trans people and people who had transitioned the only stuff i really read about were people who were using hormones and people who were having surgery. at that time the concept of hormones was like a whole new thing, so i didn't know how i felt about that, and surgery from the get-go was something i just never really wanted because i was comfortable with my parts and what was going on, but i didn't like myself when i looked in the mirror. when i googled these things a lot of people were like, ""if i don't have bottom surgery, i'm going to kill myself."" and i could never relate to that. i stayed closeted as a trans person for many years because, ""i'm not trans enough to be trans,"" you know. when i look back on that--and i help quite a bit with the trans group here in duluth--i'll have a lot of people who are just starting their journey and they'll come to group and they'll be like, ""well, i don't know,"" and whatever and it's like, ""dude, you are trans enough to be you. you are enough. you don't want to have to have hormones, you don't have to medically transition. if that is who you are then that's who you are."" i decided that testosterone was for me, but still no interest in surgery, which is kind of an interesting concept for people because a lot of trans people that know me view me as some super macho dude, however my nickname is daddy twink bear because there's a good mix of both!",1487
"262","doc 466","sa: did you come up with the gummy bear road? [laughs]",54
"263","doc 467","jd: i did not, that's all maggie! [laughs] but it's hilarious. so, yeah, i came to a point where i was going to take steps i needed to take to transition or i couldn't see myself being on earth. i don't know if you know much about trans stats or anything, but forty-one percent of trans people attempt or complete suicide. that was a very real thing for me and the way i felt was very scary. living in duluth there is a population of eighty-six thousand people. for many years i didn't know or hadn't met anyone like me. yeah, i felt really, really, really alone. i educated myself on the path i needed to take to start t, and so i was like okay i need to talk to a therapist, they write some kind of letter, then i see a doctor who looks at the therapists' letter that says i'm good enough for hormones. it didn't go well at first. i found a therapist and i remember walking into his office and he had his degree's on the wall and his name was very religious. i was like, ""okay, that doesn't necessarily mean anything."" then i take a bigger look around and there are crosses, and he was looking at me like i was an insect. what the fuck is happening. i was like, ""i don't give a fuck. i need that letter really bad."" so, he wants to talk to me, i lay out my whole story, and then he says, ""well, thanks for sharing, but i don't do that. i don't do that."" you think he would have stopped me like fifteen minutes in and been like, ""i don't need to hear anymore. this is a waste of your time, this is a waste of my time."" i felt like he was super judgmental and then obviously couldn't help me and had no one to refer me to. so i was like, ""cool, now i'm just stuck back at square one."" i let a couple more months go by because i felt discouraged, and just didn't know any resources or anyone. then think i did some googling, but there was a woman here and she had gotten her degree, i don't know much about college shit, she got her degree and had to do like supervised hours. she wanted to gain some experience writing letters for trans people. i saw her. i didn't really like her, but i was like, ""alright, i have to jump through your hoops to get what i want."" i remember one day when i was seeing her--she had couches in her office--and i was sitting in the recliner with my feet up, but she was talking about my ex that i was with for five years, and she had asked if i would attempt to get her to come to a session because she thought that would be helpful for us to maybe have some peace or whatever. that made me really angry. so i was sitting up there with my feet and stuff, but i did get like loud, but i didn't move or anything, and she was like, ""you're acting aggressive,"" and i was like, ""or i have feelings and you brought up a touchy subject and i'm going to get loud about it."" ",2795
"264","doc 469","jd: right, like don't fucking ask me things if you don't want--i'm not a robot. i'm going to react to stuff. then i felt kind of icky about her because she was like, ""testosterone can make you aggressive. i don't know if you're ready for that. she pretty much, i felt, was just waving my letter above my head, which was really hard. it was especially hard to see a cis person about this kind of stuff, and i still think that that's not something trans people should have to do. i have to go convince a cis person why i'm trans and have them diagnose me with being trans and have them decide that it's time for me to start t? like bitch i know. i know myself. ",659
"265","doc 470","sa: and then tell you it's going to make you more aggressive. ",62
"266","doc 471","jd: yeah, which actually i've been on t now for two years. i think that when i get angry i'm able to manage myself a lot better. i think that has a lot to do with just being happier as a person. being able to be more present with myself. i got my letter, and i had to wait fucking ninety days until the endo had an opening. even though you receive your letter they have to get a fax from the office. so i finally got this golden ticket, which is fucking worthless, and then they tell me ninety days. but then i had an appointment, took my first shot, and it's real fucking rad. there was a trans group that was kind of meeting that i heard about and so i guess this is before t, so i'm telling it a little backwards, whatever. i had an incident one day when i was really close to starting t before my coming out thing, and one of my ex-girlfriends was a terf, or a trans exclusionary radical feminist, so i told her what was going on, and she was fucking horrible to me. said some of the worst things i've heard in my life to this day. then i decided that i wanted my ex that i was with for five years to come comfort me. i decided to--i was drinking because, you know, that's intelligent when you're angry [laughs]--and so she came and met me at the bar and she was sober and i was just drunk and belligerent and i made her bring me through hardee's and i just acted a little crazy, i bought cheeseburgers, i whipped them around her car because i was angry and whatever. she kicked me out of her car. my phone was dead, and i just wanted to get from superior [wi] to duluth. i walk into this bar and i ask to use the phone and there's this female bartender and one guy sitting at the bar--pretty dead. so i walk in and i show her my phone and i was like, ""hey, i have a phone but it's dead, i just really need to use the phone."" she looks at the dude, she looks at me, and she just kind of laughs. she comes over and slams the cordless down on the bar and she goes, ""it, or whatever, needs to use the phone."" so i grabbed the phone, you know, and i've already had a really emotional day, and so i use the phone to try to call my parents, they didn't answer, i go to make a second, local, free call, and she goes, ""i said you could make one call."" so i was like, whatever, i continued trying to use the phone, and i got off the phone and she just starts calling me and 'it' and she called me a 'cunt' and so i whipped my fucking barstool at her. i was drunk. it was probably the worst day of my life, one of them. of course she called the cops, i was arrested for disorderly conduct, and i was booked for one night in douglas county [wi] and then you get there and they aren't competent with trans issues, and so when it came to handing over the binder they assumed i was smuggling drugs, i must have this strange vest or something stuffed with cocaine was what they thought i had! [laughter] it just couldn't be a binder, and i was like, ""no, it's like a binder,"" and i broke it down for them and on my personal inventory list they wrote down 'binder question mark' and i was like, ""no, that's not a fucking question mark. google this!"" they didn't know where to put me because they have zero experience with trans people, so i sat in a little cement room by myself the whole night, which was a good time. fast forward, on t. so right after that jail experience i found this local trans group that was meeting, so i sat in a room of five trans women i had never met and just started crying about my jail experience or whatever, and then kind of connected with them, took the journey that i explained to you about t. and then that group kind of died off. there was one person running it, and it's fucking exhausting to be a community organizer and have so many people heavily relying on you and looking to you for everything, so i understand why she did that. so, me and a friend and a couple of other people--i guess he wasn't really a friend at that point. there were a couple of trans people in town that decided like, ""hey, let's sit down and see what we can do."" and so that's when i met who is now one of my best friends, and we decided to revamp the group. it's now called trans plus. we have support group and work group. work group is kind of like what can we do to change things on a local level, and, you know, advance our place in the world because not a whole lot of people care about our community. so we kind of revamped that and that's been going on for a couple of years now. we have, i don't know, anywhere from ten to thirty people attend group, which i never thought in my life i would ever know thirty trans people from duluth. and now i, i don't know, i see a trans person just living their life every day and say, ""hi,"" to them on the street. some of my best friends are trans. my partner is trans. and so it's really a night and day difference to my world. ",4881
"267","doc 472","i'll talk a little bit about my work stuff. so i initially started doing harm reduction work for center city housing, and i worked at their san marco location. so, it's a harm reduction facility for alcoholics who are actively using. before san marco existed in duluth many of them were making frequent visits to hospital, jail, detox; it was costing a lot of money, and these people had no where to live. they were just going through this revolving door, which just wasn't helpful to our community, and to those people, you know, more importantly. so they opened san marco and there are two sides: one is low-income housing side. some of them drink, some of them don't. they don't require much care from the staff. they just kind of exist. and then the other side--i can't remember the exact number, i'd say somewhere around thirty. it's for people who are chronic alcoholics, so they are often drinking to the point of black out daily. there are just different ways we treat, you know--some people had to have alcohol plans, so maybe instead of a liter of vodka they got a pint of vodka daily and a six pack of beer, or something. but i felt really good about doing that kind of stuff because of their addiction they have nothing and no one. a lot of their families won't speak to them. while that's sad, you know, sometimes we have to suffer the consequences of our choices while we're using. so, they hadn't personally impacted me so i was able to be friendly and talk to them and be open to them. ",1502
"268","doc 473","sa: what do you think got you started with harm reduction? like walking in the door and knowing you wanted to work there?",121
"269","doc 474","jd: i guess because i like to live really authentically. i'm a trans guy who works at a needle exchange and lives in an artist coop. [laughs] and so i never like did the college thing because, yeah, money is cool and you need it to live, and whatever, but i'd much rather be rich in happiness than be rich in green pieces of paper. ",332
"270","doc 475","so i had worked at a group home with individuals who were mentally ill, chemically dependent, or both sometimes. i was onsite staff there, and i was just kind of sick of living where my, you know i had my own apartment, but i was kind of sick of living on sight. so i looked around and found out about san marco, and then a friend of mine is the sight director there, and she has known me since i was eleven years old. she was actually my parent's case manager at some point. so she knew everything. she knew that i really got it. i really--having been in dark places, dark times in my life, i really want to do that kind of work because i know that those kind of people--nobody wakes up and decides, ""i'm going to be an alcoholic"" or ""i'm going to be a drug addict."" those things are because of trauma and disconnection, and i really understand those things. so i wanted to not wear a suit and tie and be able to say, ""fuck,"" at work if i wanted to say fuck. [laughs] and i wanted to be able to be useful to people, and really let them know that somebody was there that really understands it and doesn't judge them. i think i'm really good at making clients feel that. i'm often told, you know, ""you're easy to talk to. i feel comfortable talking to you. it feels like you get it."" clients are going through things and they bring stuff up, you know, not to take away from their experience, but i'll minimally insert something about my life so they know, you know--in the winter we have clients who come in here and they are cold and they are like, ""my feet are wet."" we get sock donations from a thrift store down the block. and so i'm like, ""hey, man. i've fucking slept outside. i fucking understand."" and we look through the socks and wet socks are the worst. exactly. so, yeah i just wanted to live authentically and actually make a difference with people. ",1862
"271","doc 476","and then i really liked my job there, but that's kind of where i went through my name transition. a lot of them were older, white, cis men, veterans, and those are not very open minded people. so i had a guy, he came up and whipped a bible at my head and told me that's what i needed. some of them threw all kinds of, you know, their booze bottles at me, or an open beer can so i'm covered in beer and trying to work. some of them would come up to the desk and be like, well, you have these parts so that's what you are. or kyra, who was the site director there, ""kyra says we are supposed to call you this now, but this is your ﻿real﻿ name.""",642
"272","doc 477","sa: not a safe working environment.",35
"273","doc 478","jd: right. and the staff at center city were excellent to me. i have not a bad word to say about them. but, you know, kicking these clients out because they are treating me this way is not an option, or not what i wanted because they are the hardest people to house. and it just wasn't working. they just weren't getting it and i was not able to--i just couldn't do it anymore. ",378
"274","doc 479","so one guy came up one night and he was just especially awful to me. and instead of reacting to it because often times when clients go off i don't react to it. i'm just calm and cool and like, ""okay, whatever."" so he goes off on me and expects me to probably engage with him. and i ended up shutting--we had half doors and then top doors if shit go rowdy. so i pulled both the top doors and i sat down at the computer and i just took a deep breath, and i started writing my two week notice [laughs] and i was like this is recording. so i left there because of that. ",566
"275","doc 480","and i was looking around for jobs, and so i was browsing craig's list and there was an ad that was like, i don't remember the exact language, but 'working with difficult populations, need to have a sense of humor, maybe some life experience, a degree preferred,' which was a turn off for me, and so i almost didn't apply for it. but i sent an email and i said, ""hey, this is a little bit about me, blah blah,"" and i knew when i was looking at the article i was like this is some kind of harm reduction thing. they don't want you to know what they are because--they are just being really veiled about this ad. so i was like this is totally probably a syringe exchange for sure. so i emailed back and forth a bunch with maggie [kazel] and then we set up a time when i could come in. and she was working solo at that time, which i don't fucking know--she did that for six months. i work solo for like three days if she is on vacation and i'm like, ""i'm going to die.""",964
"276","doc 481","so we had set up the time for me to come in--",45
"277","doc 482","sa: do you know what year this is about?",40
"278","doc 483","jd: this is early 2015. so yeah i came in and she had a couple of people in the lobby. she was busy doing other stuff, and i later found out she just wanted to see how i would interact on the fly, you know. ",207
"279","doc 485","jd: yeah! [laughs] i came in and she was like, ""uh, go keep those folks busy."" or whatever. and it was a group of young native girls. they were obviously pretty high on what i assume--what i think is meth, actually, and they were just coloring and talking and having a good time. so i just--i don't really treat clients any differently than i treat my friends. i mean there's some shit i wouldn't tell them. but beyond that i just walked up to them and was like, ""how's it going man? what are you coloring? what are you doing today?"" just making convo. so maggie kind of saw me do that. so the ad said degree preferred, but i had almost ten years of experience working with mental illness and chemical dependency and harm reduction stuff, so i had some really solid letters of recommendation, and she saw me interact with those guys. i guess she had interviewed like ten people maybe, and i'm sure several of them had degrees. so, i don't know. she offered me the job and here i am. ",983
"280","doc 486","sa: was your use ever to the point where you had to go to treatment?",68
"281","doc 487","jd: i did go to treatment as a youngin because they didn't know where to put me anymore. so i didn't really need treatment at that point in my life. it was just the place to put me. the state put me in a place because it was convenient. which, funny enough, so i was seventeen when they did that to me. i was, i don't know, i think i left in like two weeks. i'm not trying to get up in the morning. i don't want to go to no fucking group that i don't need to go to. and i don't want your shitty breakfast. [laughs] no thanks, no thanks, no thanks. so they didn't really like me. and then so minors in treatment--but i shouldn't be smoking cigarettes, so they kicked me out for using tobacco as a minor on their grounds. how they kicked me out they were like you have a half hour to figure out how you are getting yourself--and it was from cloquet to duluth. i don't drive. [laughs] and so they were like you have thirty minutes to figure out a ride or a sheriff can come pick you up. i was like that sounds fucking terrible. so i ended up calling my ex that i was with for five years at the time and she was in high school. and at the time i obviously didn't sound like this, so i called her high school and talked to the secretary and i was like, ""yeah this is her aunt so-and-so. there's a family emergency."" so they went and got her and i was like you better come pick me up right now or a cop is going to pick me up."" i don't know how she did it, but she made it from superior to cloquet in like twenty minutes. so that was rad. [laughs] but yeah, so that was an unnecessary adventure. but there were periods of time in my life where i was using a lot of opiates. i have experienced withdrawal. i have experienced just not liking who i was and what was going on in my life. i think a lot of that probably had to do with the crowd i was hanging out with too. i had a lot of friends who were iv using. i'm really thankful that i never did because i probably would not be sitting here because drugs are fun. they make you feel good. if i liked snorting pills or smoking them off tin foil or whatever i'm sure i would have loved injecting them. so i'm glad i didn't choose to do that because i would have been lost or dead. ",2224
"282","doc 488","sa: do you want to just go through what you do here? or what a normal day looks like if there's such a thing as a normal day. [laughs]",134
"283","doc 489","jd: there's not! [laughs] that's a cute question. there is not a normal day. every single day of my life is different, which i really appreciate. i have a lot of friends who do the same monotonous thing all day every day. that's just not for me. so what i do here is syringe exchange or syringe access. i do hiv testing. i do hep c testing. i do narcan training and give out narcan kits. really, i mean it's hard to describe what i do because i don't have any degrees in counseling or any degrees in anything, but i feel like daily i'm a counselor. i help people find housing. i don't know. i had a guy come in and he's pretty seriously ill and he needed three bucks for his co-pay. so i gave him three bucks for his co-pay. i really do just about anything that needs doing. sometimes there will be a young mom in here. she's got her kid. maggie is really good with the young mom's, so i'll babysit the little kids. they look at my piercings like holy shit this guy! i just try to interact. yeah, so really a lot of everything. ",1028
"284","doc 490","sa: have you seen harm reduction change since you've been--you've been working with it for a long time. through a lot of different places. ",139
"285","doc 491","jd: i think one of the main things is that people are becoming more aware of it. people are a lot more accepting of it, which i think is really necessary. one of the comparisons that maggie likes to make that i really appreciate is sometimes when we do presentations we bring out a shot glass. we go, ""how many of you have used this in the mast month or the past six months?"" most people raise their hands. well, alcohol is a drug, and a shot glass is a way you administer the drug. it is a drug utensil. so why should we look at people who are using a different drug and they need a different utensil? we are all altering our state of mind just in a different way. so i think i'm seeing a lot of people coming around to that. or people who have never heard of it and i explain it and they are cool with it. just, ""wow, i've never heard of that, but that's cool."" ",864
"286","doc 492","i guess when i first started doing this job i was talking to my grandparents about it and they were like, ""wait, wait. so you're giving syringes full of heroin to people?"" and i was like, ""we do not have a budget like that!"" [laughs] right, like--i mean supervised injection and all that shit is really rad, i wish we could do that. maybe some day. but yeah, just taking them from a very ground level and being like, ""no, honey. no."" [laughs] ",443
"287","doc 493","i guess while i'm on this little tangent i'll talk about something that happened just recently. so i posted an article from december 2016 that was posted by nbc, so really mainstream--i find that sometimes when i post stuff like that on facebook they are more receptive to it. however, i totally post cowgirls riding syringes that say ""fuck safe shoot clean"" so there's a little bit of everything in between there. but so the nbc article was 'overdoses now kill more americans than car crashes.' i had, i don't know, twenty-seven comments on that status from people all over my life. one of which i was really surprised with. we used to work together. he is religious and he is now a police officer. he was like, ""how can i get narcan? do they sell it at cvs? i really want this."" and so i did not expect him to be open about it at all. there's a shit load of positive comments between he and i. and then at two in the morning this fucking idiot that i used to work with at san marco, so he's done harm reduction with alcoholics, comments and says, ""well why do we give a fuck if drug addicts overdose?"" right. and there's been people in my life that i've told this story to recently and most of them are supportive. i'm part of an intersectional feminism group and i told them this story and it got a couple hundred likes and people were all over it. so anyways he comments ""why do we give a fuck about drug addicts overdosing."" so, i won't use his name, but i said, ""you know,"" and i tagged him in the comment, ""i want to write this big long thing and break it down for you, but we fucking work together doing harm reduction for people using alcohol, so i don't understand why you don't get it."" then last year, sometimes we'll browse craig's list ads just kind of to--what's the fuck climate in duluth? what are places we could target for testing? or whatever. so i remembered last year i was browsing craig's list and there was an ad titled 'tranny,' which is you know a horrible trans slur. so it kind of irritated me, but i was curious because duluth is so small. i was like i kind of want to fuck with this person and get them to send me a face picture. so i played them and i got them to send me a face picture. well it turns out it was the guy who commented 'why do we give a fuck about drug addicts.' so there's that back story. so, yeah, 'you should get it, we've done harm reduction work together, also i know for a fact that you're cheating on' and i tagged his girlfriend's name. they live together, they've been for four years. i said i'm too tired right now. it's three in the morning, but hey girl let me know if you want that screenshot tomorrow.' and i dug it up and i sent it to her and she broke up with him. so he could have just scrolled by, but his hate and his stigma for drug addicts was so strong that he felt the need at two in the morning to say why the fuck do we give a fuck about these human being dying!",2936
"288","doc 494","sa: and differentiating them from alcoholics. ",46
"289","doc 495","jd: right! and he is at the bar every single night. i would feel comfortable saying he's an alcoholic as well. so there was just something really satisfying about him trying say bullshit and i'm not terribly close to either of them, but i felt bad for his girlfriend ever since i have had that information, and it's a face picture of him with their dog. and so that's what i sent--and it had the title of his ad and whatever. and so he got that bomb dropped on his skull because he had to go be hateful for no reason. he could have kept scrolling and thought whatever thoughts he had to himself, and he still be in his relationship and everything would be find. [laughs] karma rained on his skull! i've since been unfriended and blocked. but his ex-girlfriend is still my friend. so there's that.",796
"290","doc 496","sa: any stories that you feel comfortable sharing about clients that have come in that have really affected you?",112
"291","doc 497","jd: i have so many fucking stories. one that always sticks out to me. young guy, early twenties. he robbed a gas station and he stole a couple rolls of lottery tickets and cigarettes, whatever, and so he got caught and they just flew his fucking mug shot all over social media, all over the newspaper, just everywhere. he was booked. he was there for only a couple of days. so he gets out and he came in and i could tell he was just like looking at the floor like really embarrassed or whatever. so i just walked up to him and like playfully tapped his arm and i was like, ""what up, mr. famous. what's going on."" and it made him giggle. so he was able to kind of come out of his shell a little bit and he was able to ask for what he needed. and he overdosed and he died that weekend. i know that at the end of his life he was experiencing some really hard stuff. and to have him feel comfortable enough to walk in here and have that happen to him, and be able to kind of--",972

"293","doc 499","jd: yeah. yeah, yeah. so that felt really good. it's just so hard to think of like individual stories. one thing i guess i'll say though is i live like three blocks from the exchange here, and so people see me all over all the time. it's really cool because a lot of people are really comfortable  talking to me in public, and they talk to me like i'm their friend. i can walk down the street and say, ""hey man, how's it going?"" and talk about the wild game, talk about my dog, or whatever they did last night. ",511
"294","doc 500","another thing that's been interesting working here is you know duluth is small and i know a lot, a lot of people. i've had friends of mine come in here--people i've known, and one of them is just like--well one, came in, saw my face, turned around and walked out. facebook messaged me and came back a few days later. then another friend of mine came in and we just had a long discussion and i was able to hook her up with stuff and she was just really thankful that i didn't judge her. obviously i would never speak to anybody about that. that's her business. she, you know, she probably thinks i saw i wouldn't judge you to her face because i'm trying to make her feel good or something but i'm sitting here talking to you and you don't fucking know her and i don't judge her at all. i'm happy she came in and talked to me and was comfortable coming in to get stuff and is using clean stuff. that's good. like i said there're just so many clients. ",949

"296","doc 502","jd: there're only two hundred and twenty exchanges in the country. i wish that there was more access for people who use drugs. i wish that there were more places like this so i could talk to people who do the work i do because that's one thing that's really hard about doing this work is, you know, i can talk to my partner about it. my partner has a really long title, i can't exactly remember it, but they're the glbt director at the university of minnesota duluth. so i can talk to them, but what we do for a living is very different. my day has often started before i have my first sip of coffee with somebody coming and being like, ""i need narcan. my friend died last night. i brought him back to life. oh my god."" so i'm holding space for that person before--i'm not even awake. i don't have coffee with me. i just unlocked the door. i've barely got the lights on. so i can unpack that with my partner and they are fucking fantastic, you know, they are really kind and understanding and listen to me. but it would be a world of difference if i could call the harm reduction center in west duluth and say, ""hey, you know how this goes. can we meet up for coffee sometime this evening and just unpack this."" especially with client deaths or really traumatic client stuff. so i'm super grateful for maggie. yes, we are co-workers, but maggie is my family. i call her mom-dad. that's my name for her. we are there for each other through a lot. we are able to talk to each other in a way that most people who work together can't just because of the intimate work that we do. so that's really valuable. ",1603
"297","doc 503","sa: is there any place like this anywhere nearby? ",50
"298","doc 504","jd: there is. it's across the bridge in superior. they have a syringe exchange. it's aids resource center wisconsin. there is one staff member that works at that location. and she also does hiv case management for positive clients in six northern wisconsin counties. so she's almost never there. and then as with anybody in the world we all don't get along and whatever. i don't feel like her and i click. i would never call her and talk to her about anything. we see each other at world aids day, and we see each other at pride. we have our friendly small talk. i don't want to talk to her about my shit. no thanks. but it would be cool if there were people i felt comfortable talking to. and people that i could bounce stuff off of or whatever. or just get their tips and tricks about this stuff because i've been doing this for a long time, but i'm not perfect. harm reduction work is--you don't have much time to think. it's a lot of on the fly reacting. i have to be different with every person. even tone and the way i say things. if some rowdy guys come in i have to be like, ""hey guys, one at a time. you need to go back and sit there. you can come up it's your turn."" whereas maybe the next minute i have a young, single mom come in and she's crying. so when she comes in maybe i'll go up there and offer her kid a coloring book. i'm kind of softer with her and i'm like, ""hey, want to come up? what's going on today? you look upset. i've got some cookies. i've got some hot tea."" you know? so you really just have to know how to interact with people in different ways very quickly. and i can oftentimes have those interactions back to back. i really have to be mindful of myself, too because if i'm having a fucking shit day and someone comes in i need to be able to hold that space for them and put my own shit aside because the way i serve them could determine a lot about what they are going to do in that day. i need to be mindful that i just need to be a certain way sometimes. which, you know, i often on the weekends like to drink beer, go hiking, play with my dog, be with my friends. i have to do the stuff i love. being a native duluthian i am always doing something in lake superior. i have already been kayaking this year, which was frigid. i went underneath the lift bridge in between the canal--in between the piers. a fucking big boat was coming out. a big thousand footer. i was with a friend i was like, ""rachel i'm going to die!"" she was like, ""just keep paddling, dory. just keep paddling."" so i wave my paddle in the air and i'm like, ""i hope you see me giant ship!"" try not to tip and die in this current. the water was super cold. the surface temp right now is like thirty-seven degrees. and she--so my friend is tiny so all her life jackets are mediums, so i'm like it's on the kayak and i'll grab it, but i'm not wearing that! so, yeah. i definitely have to find ways to relax and just kind of decompress in my life, which i'm pretty excellent at given my own trauma. i know stuff that i've had to deal with and apply that. i've had to be a grown up for a lot longer than most people my age. ",3126
"299","doc 505","sa: do you see any difference between minneapolis--the cities--versus up here in duluth? are you in contact with anyone down there?",131
"300","doc 506","jd: i've talked to some people who do similar stuff down there, but they're busy as fuck. we're busy as fuck. so we see each other at conferences or trainings, but i won't get a change to really know them. i don't really go to the cities that often. everybody is like, ""ooh, the cities!"" i go there for sports. i go there for concerts. i go there for work. but it's big. it's full of people. there's no grass. where would my dog pee? so that's just--i really like being in the woods and being away from people. i don't really care to go there. ",544

"307","doc 520","zm: so where amy has historically started is just talking a little bit about you. a question she likes to start with is what was your childhood like?",149
"308","doc 521","sd: [laughs] my childhood. i grew up here in minnesota. i grew up in minnetonka. only child. parents were together, and no communication in my home. we just didn't talk about anything. so when i started using alcohol at the age of thirteen dad kept that hidden from mom when i got caught. ",289
"309","doc 523","sd: yeah, at thirteen. and he never said a word to her. he just cleaned up the vomit. [laughs] so i learned early on if mom doesn't find out think are okay, and how to keep a secret. from there it just, for me it was drug abuse after that. i went on to weed, pot, or lsd, pcp, mushrooms, and kind of continued on. i graduated from out here, but i was high on graduation day. [laughs] yeah i was on pcp when i walked. so, yeah. my childhood, you know, no abuse. some verbal abuse and such, but my family history on my mom's side definitely a lot of mental health and drug addiction problems. all on my mom's side. ",613
"310","doc 524","zm: where you aware of this when you started experimenting, or not?",67
"311","doc 525","sd: no. saw it later on. i noticed it with my mother. i recognized it now that she had a problem with alcohol. her mother definitely, and i know my aunt had prescription painkillers were her thing for many years. so she's part of the opiate problem. ",250
"312","doc 526","zm: what happened after graduation?",35
"313","doc 527","sd: after graduation a few years later i moved to southern california. i had done some traveling to san diego and decided after we had that halloween blizzard. you're probably too young to know about that one. [laughs] but in like 1991 where we got hit with like a foot of snow and i decided to get the hell out of here so moved the day after christmas that year and moved to san diego, but all i did was bring my own stuff with me, for the most part, so it was just me bringing my problems and unhappiness along with me and started using methamphetamine out there. got very much into using whatever was in front of me. it did not end well for me in california. [laughs] california i have six felony convictions from living out there. sales charge, transportation of narcotics, went to prison for a couple years in california. got out of prison june 30th, 2009. moved back home on parole [unclear] in minnesota. i was on parole here because they transferred me up here and california parole ninety days later i moved back out here. got off parole after a year. started using again. crack cocaine was my thing. i tried heroin. did opiates for a little while. it wasn't really my thing. i definitely liked the upper thing. crack cocaine, needle abuse, like everything. i overdosed on cocaine. died. wound up in a hospital icu for several days. woke up in handcuffs. went to prison from there. ",1391
"314","doc 528","zm: that was back here?",23
"315","doc 529","sd: that was back in california and then moved back up here. then moved back out here shortly after i got out of prison. did a couple of years in the prison system in california where they set you up to fail. send you with two hundred dollars gate money when you get out of prison and nowhere to go. [laughs] as a drug addict and a drug dealer there's only, you know, i don't really have too many options of things to do. so, i tried to get out here as fast as possible and move back out here and started using about a year later again. and put myself in treatment. while i was in treatment i applied for school, and wanted to become a drug and alcohol counselor. [laughs] figured who better! all based on a journal i had written in prison and i was reading it while i was in prison and one of my goals was to become a counselor and i thought, sure, why not? ",859
"316","doc 530","so since then i have my license in alcohol and drug counseling from metro state. bachelor's from there as well as a certified prevention professional, and have been working at valhalla place for two and a half years after working somewhere else a little bit. so i've been in the field going on four years now i think with internships and everything. ",350
"317","doc 533","zm: you've only been working for four years, but what do you see?",65
"318","doc 534","sd: what do i see? i guess where i really started to notice things in, you know, i saw this in california when i was living there because i was selling drugs out of a house holder. it was like a low-income kind of housing thing where a lot of people were getting medications. so they were trading their medications for cocaine. and so they would trade me oxycontin, things like that. and i would take that, trade them crack for it, and go and sell the opiate medications to somebody else that would go and sell them to rich, affluent housewives in [loyola], california area which is pretty affluent. so i saw it back then and how it was really affecting people, but i saw more of the upper class people using it. heroin wasn't really something i saw too much of. i used heroin for about a month when i lived in california because it was just what was out there for the time, but it was black tar back then. but i remember the friends i used with having to need it on a daily basis getting sick, and us having to drive around just to get ten dollars worth of heroin. and slapping people around. the old way of trying to reverse an overdose. throwing them in my bathtub in cold water, and things like that. trying to bring them back. and luckily that apparently worked. [laughs] because it really doesn't. ",1304
"319","doc 535","so i saw it out there, but i guess i started to see it more when i came into the field, and in my internships a few years back that more and more people were coming in for opiate use. for treatment. and i think that's when my harm reduction stance changed, because i went into treatment where it was like abstinence based. you go to na, you go to aa. that's the only thing that's going to work for you and if you don't do those things you're going to die. that kind of stuff. those were like the messages i heard from going to those meetings. and i stopped going because i didn't want to live in fear the rest of my life. i had lived in fear all my life as it is. and i just thought if this is what i have to do forever, and the other thing is like meditation and some of this other stuff isn't good enough. i don't want to do that. it didn't make sense to me. so i stopped the na thing years ago and started implementing harm reduction in my own life. i drink alcohol. but i don't use drugs. i just can't use illicit drugs because i don't do them well, or i do them too well depending on how you want to look at it. [laughs] i've had enough of those. i'm still around luckily. ",1178
"320","doc 536","but i think i saw in my internship like i said was that i had a lot of clients coming in that weren't willing, or weren't ready to stop using everything. and so i was referring people to places like minnesota alternatives, which is more of a harm reduction program. i don't know if you've heard about that. i heard of minnesota alternatives. i went to a conference out here called maarch [minnesota association of resources for recovery and chemical health] years ago early on in school. paula desanto is the owner, former owner i believe of minnesota alternatives, which is like a harm reduction based program where they teach people how to lessen their use. because if i don't want to quit drinking completely, but i want to learn how to drink three alcohol drinks a night, or whatever it is and be successful that's how they work instead of kicking them out of treatment because you haven't stopped. and so it had a lot of people coming in that just weren't ready to stop all drugs. and for me to set them up into my program or to an inpatient program knowing that they're going to need to use and they're just going to get kicked out made no sense to me. so i was referring outside of the company i worked for [laughs]. i was like it's not about my treatment; it's about their success. ",1290
"321","doc 537","so i decided to look into a different realm, and wanted to do something that was more harm reduction and methadone was really interesting to me. i kept seeing like i said more and more clients coming in that had either been on methadone or were using heroin or prescription pain killers who had lost a ton of people in their lives based from overdose, and i just thought this is where i need to be. and came to valhalla place two and a half years ago now almost. what else do you want to know? what am i seeing now? ",516
"322","doc 538","zm: could you just describe more of what you do at valhalla? and what valhalla does?",84
"323","doc 539","sd: absolutely. valhalla is a medically assisted treatment program, so we provide methadone or suboxone to patients that are opiate dependent for at least one year. so they have to have been abusing an opiate for a year prior to even being eligible for our program. ",266
"324","doc 540","zm: is that like regular—daily, weekly?",39
"325","doc 541","sd: you know, it depends on the person. so whether it was something they were maybe originally getting prescribed, and they're supposed to take three of them a day and now they're taking maybe six or eight or ten. but they're seeing withdrawal symptoms when they don't have them. or if it was heroin on the streets. things like that based on use, and not being able to use as prescribed. or if it's illicit use and having withdrawal if they don't have their substance around. we can come in and help them with giving them methadone, suboxone, which can eliminate the withdrawal and the cravings so they don't have to use those substances anymore. ",647
"326","doc 542","zm: and the year cut-off—is that just an arbitrary line?",56
"327","doc 543","sd: yeah. it's kind of a weird line that's drawn in the sand that, you know, now it's kind of hard because there are people that will call that are at eleven months, but they just don't qualify for the program. i believe that's federal. like a federal guideline that there's this magical number that a year i have to have been abusing these things. even though some people can do a lot of damage in six months. especially now with what's out there. they just wouldn't be able to qualify for the medication. their insurance won't, and they're not appropriate for treatment here, which sucks. ",591
"328","doc 544","zm: do you see people attempting to fabricate—",46
"329","doc 545","sd: yes, oh absolutely. ",24
"330","doc 547","sd: absolutely. every now and then we will see people who come in—because we do a screening process with everybody whether it's over the phone, or they physically come in here. a lot of times, especially in certain communities, the native communities especially some of the reservations where they don't have treatment options. they really don't have the resources out there. we will sometimes see families trying to come in, or sending their family members here, and they go through the screening process and you can kind of tell they've been coached on what to say. but if you word things differently, and i've been trained enough to—and being a former...when every word that came out of my mouth was a lie in the past, i'm pretty good at seeing when people are not telling me entirely the truth, or don't know what to say. so i can word things a little bit differently. there have been times in the past where i've done a chemical health assessment on them first to just kind of get what they've been using, get some more information versus just the screening process of it. and they haven't been coached enough for that. so then i can see, you know, you're not going to qualify for our program. i think the bigger idea hopefully is that they're family or somebody is trying to get them in here so that maybe they can get the medication for another family that can't get here, or doesn't have the insurance, but for us to admit somebody that doesn't need this program, all we're doing is opening a door to something that's going to cause more harm. especially if they're an opiate naive person or not, using opiates to start them on methadone or suboxone is just going to...cause an addiction problem they didn't have. ",1722
"331","doc 548","we do a little bit of things around that. for the most part i think people are calling because they know it works, and they don't want to do this anymore. we answer our phone here twenty-four hours a day. if the phone rings and somebody's trying to get in here on a sunday night and they qualify for our program we'll try to get them in on monday or tuesday morning and get them their medication, and start them with counseling here. ",434
"332","doc 549","so, my job here is a counselor here. i am an ladc, licensed alcohol and drug counselor. i'm also a certified prevention professional through the minnesota board out here as well. but i still created a new job a year and a half ago or so here, so i'm like the harm reduction specialist is my title [laughs]. sort of that i made up. i saw a need in the community, not only in our facility, but outside of here where people weren't getting naloxone. they didn't have the education; not understanding why medication assisted treatment is so beneficial for opiate addiction. colleges, even the colleges i went to—we didn't talk about methadone or suboxone. we didn't talk about harm reduction in school. it was like a five minute little thing. i see how beneficial it is right now especially with what's going on in the state. that there's a huge need for education out there, so i've spent my own free time educating myself as much as possible. going to conferences, flying to san diego last year for the harm reduction conference. just trying to get as much information as there is on harm reduction services, be it there's more than just needle exchanges. i spend probably about forty percent of my time outside of my office doing narcan trainings throughout the state. we are the largest provider of naloxone in the state of minnesota.",1334
"333","doc 551","sd: yeah. we dispense, last year, over six thousand kits i believe. we provide minnesota aids project with their narcan. rural action aids network. i've been working with little earth, the native american community over in south minneapolis for about a year and a half now. i used to sneak in narcan through people i knew lived there, and teaching them how to reverse an opiate overdose, but the tribe at the time wouldn't really let it happen. i couldn't actually go do a training for the community. we just kept sneaking it in because people were dropping like flies. they were overdosing daily over there and nobody was doing anything about it, and the community was begging for help. i've got friends who live there, i've got a lot of clients over there. i really have a great passion for the native american community. so, over the past year or so i've probably donated four hundred, five hundred kits to little earth. last year—reported to me, not 911 calls, because they don't call 911 too often—we had eighty-six opiate reversals. i only know of a few deaths over there so far. it has made a huge difference.",1116
"334","doc 552","there're certain areas in minnesota, especially the rural areas, but some of the poorer areas, where they don't have the services and no one is doing anything about it. and little earth is one of those places that i think just continues to get the short end of the stick because they don't have the resources. and they're a poorer community. they're all section 8 grh [group residential housing], so low-income housing. just in the neighborhood the park is infested with needles. people are actively using and overdosing all over the place. it's just—something's got to give. so i try to give as much of my time to them as possible because nobody should have to die from this shit. ",682
"335","doc 555","zm: i just had a follow-up about valhalla. who funds it?",56
"336","doc 556","sd: minnesota is amazing. we are really lucky in this state because treatment is funded through most insurance companies. so, whether somebody is straight medical assistance and they don't even have a provider yet, if they're straight medical assistance whatever county they're in will pick up the tab. we fill out some paperwork, have them sign some stuff, i do a chemical health assessment on them, i shoot it over to whatever county they're in, and say hey, they need methadone or suboxone, will you pay for it? and they'll sign off on it. the counties will pay for it. if they do have state insurance, say medica or blue care through the state based on low income that will pay for it. if they're private insured most times that pays for it. sometimes there's co-pays. and every now and then you get people that don't have an insurance even though we're supposed to and they'll pay out of pocket. but if they're low-income or no-income we cannot take their money. we have to fill out the forms and do the stuff to make sure their county will pay for it. we can't legally take somebody's money that doesn't have the capabilities. it's like twenty-two thousand dollars a year, which—",1185
"337","doc 557","zm: and i'm assuming anyone working here wouldn't—even if it wasn't a requirement. ",83
"338","doc 558","sd: no. so we just kind of go through the rigmarole to get them whatever coverage they need to get the methadone or suboxone. methadone for sure will be covered by all providers. suboxone—it just depends because it's more expensive. and so then the county won't pay for it. [laughs] yeah. so, there are certain barriers. like especially hennepin county, that's the county we're in, the largest county in minnesota, and they will not pick up the tab for suboxone. ",463
"339","doc 559","zm: what's the price?",21
"340","doc 560","sd: methadone costs about eighteen dollars a day. suboxone is twenty-six. nine dollar difference, or so. but if you figure on how many people are currently in treatment, and maybe how many people they're funding—thousands and thousands of dollars. you know? residential treatment program, thirty days—if people are sending people to there they're shelling out eight grand a month. year's worth of dosing. if they're paying for that for a year or even six months you're looking at three, four, five, six thousand dollars. you times that by however many are in treatment. in our clinic alone i think we have about eleven hundred clients just in this clinic alone active dosing right now. valhalla is the largest provider of medicated assisted treatment in the state of minnesota. and there are seventeen programs in minnesota. we have currently now four. we were recently merged with meridian behavior health. so alliance was another methadone clinic that's now ours. and then pinnacle up in brainerd is now ours as well. so they're all turning into valhalla's. ",1060
"341","doc 561","valhalla is—i'll give you a background of valhalla's because the story is awesome. [laughs] valhalla is norse mythology, but it's basically the fight between good and evil. our former owner was a patient on methadone at another clinic. he was a business owner, had a tremendous amount of finances and things, and just didn't like how he was treated at the other clinic that he was at. so he had missed an appointment with his business partner and he was supposed to fly out to arizona and was late for their meeting. when he got there she was like, ""this is baloney. we can't keep doing this. this is a hassle. what do you want to do?"" he said, ""i want to open my own clinic."" and so that's how we were built. we were built on somebody that gets addiction because they've been there. understands methadone, and had an opiate problem, which i think makes us different than a lot of other places because we're really about the client. we're about the people, the person. ",969
"342","doc 562","zm: if you could in more detail describe your experience in treatment versus the treatment at valhalla. ",104
"343","doc 563","sd: i think—my experience as a client in the past? i've gone to treatment in california on a couple of occasions. i think three maybe? three or four out there. my experience out there was that i was the same as everybody else. we all did the same stuff. nobody asked me questions about my history, or maybe trauma, abuse, things that i had been through. it was cookie-cutter treatment. we were all the same. we all did step one, two, and three. it was a lot of abstinence-based for sure. ",488
"344","doc 564","zm: was it like minnesota model, twelve-step?",45
"345","doc 565","sd: minnesota model for sure. absolutely. but, they throw around words now and you hear 'client-centered' or 'client focused' or whatever it is, and that wasn't really the case. we were all the same. so i never got treatment that was catered to what i needed. i got treatment that was catered to what people thought i needed. and they thought i needed the same treatment as the next guy right next to me. and that doesn't make sense because we've all got our own story. and the same expectation that i've got to quit everything right now. that's a lot of pressure because if i look at it and i had had a magic medication to get me off of crack cocaine because there's minimal physical, a lot of mental that came with it, but i still got to smoke some weed along side of it i might have been like, okay, i can do that. i can do one. but that wasn't an option. you get kicked out. you use and they kick you out to the curb. and what else am i going to do? i'm going to go to the same thing i've always done. i'm going to pick up again and continue to use. ",1054
"346","doc 566","my experience out here i think was a little bit different, but i think it was because i was different. and i think i was ready to do something different. i realized where the ball had been missed in the past and went and like [unclear] and said, this is what i need. and told them the things that i had been through because i knew those were certain things that i know if i didn't work on i would get help on them and really put forth a different effort. although, the programs i went to were still minnesota model for the most part. ",534
"347","doc 567","zm: right, so it required a change in your attitude.",52
"348","doc 568","sd: i think so. i think a lot of it was because i was ready. i don't think necessarily that a person has to—i think that people can still be successful if they're per say mandated to treatment because it's jail or probation that's making them go. i mean the choice is still theirs because unless they're in a locked facility they can walk out. there's still, even back then on probation you're required to go to treatment pretty much every time. it's not that i didn't learn anything. i still remember some of the things i learned. i just probably wasn't there at that time, but i didn't feel like an individual. i just felt like a number. and being from the prison system i didn't really need to be another number. i'm cool on that. ",734
"349","doc 569","zm: right, so that was mandated out in the state of california?",63
"350","doc 571","zm: something that i'm currently interested in and researching is just were those costs borne by the state of california?",121
"351","doc 572","sd: yeah, california paid for those things there. they have something called prop 36, which funds for treatment and it comes with like the criminal justice system somehow gets it out of that. [laughs] so those were all paid for.",228
"352","doc 573","zm: were those treatment courts?",32
"353","doc 574","sd: i did not do drug court. drug court out there is different than drug court in minnesota. drug court out there you're mandated to. they choose you to go to drug court. drug court in minnesota—you choose to go to drug court. i sat in courts at times in california when i was waiting to go to probation and out there is was extremely shaming if you had came in a couple minutes late to court you were handcuffed immediately. you were arrested if you'd missed dates. if you used you were incarcerated for thirty days. when i've sat in on drug courts and worked with my clients even on drug courts out here it is so uplifting and supportive where the clients choose to be in this program. for one, they know how long the program it is, so they say, yeah, i want to do this. even if they pick up, they use, they relapse, whatever it is they don't get kicked out. they don't get arrested. they continue to work with the team of the people they have. they are like, what did you miss? what do you need? when they graduated i've seen the judges come out from behind their chambers and give them tokens and certificates and hug them and treat them like they're real people. you don't see that super disconnect and that power differential out here as you did in california. it's just something that if i had a choice between that and minnesota i might have been more successful a lot faster. ",1385
"354","doc 575","zm: so in minnesota it's not contingent on sobriety?",52
"355","doc 576","sd: not necessarily. yes, they want you to be sober, but you're not necessarily going to go back to jail. ",106
"356","doc 577","zm: right. my understanding of treatment court was if you break sobriety you're incarcerated.",93
"357","doc 578","sd: no. if you continue, yes. but out here they will work with you on certain things. maybe you need to do treatment. maybe outpatient isn't enough so they'll continue to monitor these things and what's going on with you. then they earn phases and things like that. then i believe at the end of their time their record is expunged. which is great. [laughs] if you've got some charges on you like i do that would be great to have that stuff disappear. it's really empowering here in like how the clientele moves up. in certain phases they have to write a letter on why they think they've earned that phase increase for drug court and why they shouldn't have to come to court as often or whatever the phase increase stipulates. yeah, out here it's just completely different. it's about the person. everybody's different, and i think that we've missed the mark, especially the minnesota model. i think that they've just thought that everybody is the same, and addiction is all the same, and it's really not. there's some brain chemistry and science behind it and genetics and things like that, but the stuff we go through in active addiction isn't the same as what the next person went through. even if our story is exactly the same how i perceive it and how somebody else does can be two totally different things. ",1312
"358","doc 579","i think we've missed out on specializing on certain things and having more involvement when it comes to trauma, and being more open to even the thc thing. if you smoke weed you get kicked out. i think we need to be more open minded, and that's why valhalla i think it completely different. even if you're still actively using you don't necessarily get kicked out of here. we'll work with you. we've got a 'it depends' model. [laughs] there's a lot of 'it depends' here. ideally we ask for one source of opiate, so that means us. if you're choosing to get your medication from us that means you cannot be picking up prescriptions from another provider. so we will check to make sure. we'll run their names in a prescription monitoring program [pmp] to make sure they're not picking up opiates from a provider. things like that. ",827
"359","doc 580","zm: is that a statewide network?",32
"360","doc 581","sd: prescription monitoring is actually a program that actually is all over the united states. anybody can use it. anybody can run a pmp on somebody. any provider. you need to have some credentials. but any doctor, any prescriber can run somebody's name to see if they've been picking up prescriptions or whatever it is. ",321
"361","doc 582","zm: that was post oxycontin bullshit?",37
"362","doc 583","sd: yes. so now a lot of states are mandating that if they are going to write a prescription for an opiate that they run a pmp on somebody. minnesota does not have that. it is still an option. we do it anyway. but the average prescriber doesn't necessarily do that and then we have a lot of shoddy prescribers out here. ",320
"363","doc 585","sd: there are still some out there, yeah, absolutely. there are some names that we see and we're like, oh we cringe when we see they are picking up a prescription from somebody. some of the pain clinics, some of the prescribers out there still definitely need to the dea pay them a visit sometime in the near future. the difference with us is that we don't necessarily kick you out based on elicit use. if the opiate thing still isn't working maybe we'll refer you to a higher level of care, which could mean outpatient on top of working with us here going to like groups. we have an outpatient they would attend for like three times a week for nine hours total. if that's not working maybe we do look at residential treatment, but that doesn't mean you stop here. you still work with us. you still get your medications.",820
"364","doc 586","zm: this is medication and some counseling at valhalla?",55
"365","doc 587","sd: yes. so, federally, methadone clinics are required to do counseling. it's not just what i've been called, a legal drug dealer. they think the clients just come in here and get their medications, walk out, and there's no treatment involved. they are required for the first fourteen weeks to meet with their counselor for at least fifty minutes a week. we do a creative treatment plan with them, we do a chemical health assessment, or a rule 25, on them just to get a baseline and see where they're at. if funding were to drop we have that done. we can shoot that off to the county. and then we update them yearly to kind of see where they're at and where changes have been made. ",682
"366","doc 588","after the first ten to fourteen weeks they're required by the federal law to meet with us for at least one time a month for fifty minutes. if they are willing to do that, then yes, you can earn a spot up in here as long as you qualify in the other areas, too. you have to have counseling with it. there's a reason why we use. there's a lot more to it than that. we do provide the counseling and there're groups and a lot of other things here that they can get. mental health services, and such, as well from us if they want to do that. ",536
"367","doc 589","we don't freak on thc. for us, clients can continue to smoke their pot. ",72
"368","doc 590","zm: does it even come in any kind of chemical analysis?",55
"369","doc 591","sd: we do do drug screens on them, and it will show on that. obviously if the county is picking up for the treatment costs here sometimes they have a problem with it. if the thc use is not interfering with their life—i think sometimes the county people that maybe don't spend a day in a clinic such as this don't realize that for us—most of these clients aren't sitting smoking bongs everyday, and i think a lot of times that's they're perception. somebody that may have thc in their system. but for us i see a client that may have walked in here on day one with a two gram a day iv use habit of heroin that six months later maybe has used twice. but, that's a huge success, but they've smoked pot the entire time. so, when you're looking at drug screens a lot of times across the board that's a failure. for us that's a huge success. you're not going to overdose on that. there's no 'harm'. the risk over harm is so much lesser that many of my treatment plans say i'll smoke more weed instead of shoot heroin. cool. smoke all the weed you want. my friends smoke pot and own businesses, and they're able to function and do their job everyday. if that's the lesser of the risk, if that's the worst thing someone's doing, smoke the fricken weed. if it's unmanageable then we discuss it. i have some clients that realize it has become a problem. great, then let's look at stopping your weed. let's stop the thc use as well. ",1421
"370","doc 592","there's a lot of other drugs we see as well. the amphetamine use has made a huge comeback recently. a lot of that i think is due to the strength of the opiates out there. the reports i get from a lot of my clients is they hate how high the high is because of the fentanyl that's in there. they're like, i want to be high. i want to be well. i want to be high, but i don't want to be falling out high. so, then i use some meth because it kind of evens me out and gets them a little bit more leveled out on that end. you know, the opiates that we are seeing out there—it's insane. the stuff that i'm seeing, that i'm hearing, the education i'm doing with the carfentanyl now being out there. i saw that coming last year. i knew that was going to hit us eventually. ohio had two hundred and some odd overdoses in a small amount of time. so i've been talking about carfentanyl with my clients and the education that i do outside of here since august of last year waiting for it to hit us. first of all it was cheap. you could get it for two thousand dollars from china and send it over here. when it wasn't classified it was super easy. i'm a former drug dealer, so i would have been all on board if i could have gotten crack really cheap from somewhere else sent to me. it would have been an easy deal. ",1300
"371","doc 593","but the potency of the stuff that's out there right now, and i saw a carfentanyl overdose december of last year because it took eight shots of narcan to revive somebody. luckily when it happens in front of me and i have as much narcan as i want i'm able to save somebody's life. but the average person is going to have one kit with two doses. by the time 911 gets there and they've got maybe two nasal things there the chances of them surviving still are slim to none. they're not going to be able to do that. this kid, you know, with the amount of shots i put in him plus the emts coming along he never should have survived. he never should have survived, and there's no doubt in my mind it was carfentanyl. and the five we've had this year i knew two out of the five people. and now we're waiting on five more pending that we're hearing that probably is. ",857
"372","doc 594","i know when it comes to this epidemic, and i use that term loosely, i think it's going to get worse before it gets better. i hate to say that. i would love to say this year things are going to get better because we're paying more attention, and because we have more access to naloxone and things like that. the reality is the drug is too fricken potent out there right now. it doesn't matter how much naloxone i walk around with. if there's carfentanyl in it, or the amount of fentanyl in there, or noscapine that's now in the stuff. there's too many fricken types of opiates that people are getting their hands on. noscapine is called c3. it is normally used for cancer patients after chemo for a pain reliever. but it has hit hennepin county in december. last year hennepin county put out a little blip that it was out there. december 2016. so, that was being sold as heroin. the prescription painkillers are being sprayed with liquid fentanyl. we had the liquid fentanyl bust in november of last year. ",1005
"373","doc 595","nothing is getting any better. we are taking notice because this epidemic—because a lot of more rich, affluent, white people are dying from this disease. it's become a more noticeable problem because people are speaking out. i think that people are speaking out or people are potentially being more heard because a lot of times who they are. families from little earth are losing handfuls and handfuls of their loved ones in that community. no one has been listening to them for years about what's going on. but, if i speak out and i live in edina, suddenly i get heard. as long as people are hearing something and saying something now and we're doing something i'm all for it, but i think we could have done something about this a long time ago. ",747
"374","doc 596","i've watched it just escalate. the numbers are skyrocketing. the amount of deaths that i hear about on a daily basis from the clients that i work with—it's unbelievable. the numbers that we have for here aren't true numbers of how many people have died. because not everybody first of all are going to do tox screens on everybody. we don't know how many people are truly dying from the opiate itself. they look at complications in other things. i think our numbers, and i don't even have the totals yet for 2017, but i'm guessing in the seven hundred for minnesota statewide. for hennepin county one hundred and fifty three. it went up to thirty-nine percent from 2015. ",670
"375","doc 597","zm: i noticed that when i was driving up here there was a billboard. ",69
"376","doc 598","sd: yes. no overdose hennepin county. so, i'm working with the sheriff's department. hennepin county decided to do something this year to do kind of a no overdose thing and do as much education as possible. ",207
"377","doc 599","zm: this is paired with mandating emts and firefighters carry naloxone?",71
"378","doc 600","sd: it is kind of paired with that, and then just doing as much—right now what i'm seeing is that the billboards are out there, we're doing monthly meetings where a lot of providers and people such as me and parents of people that have lost their loved ones, police departments showing up with what we're doing, but i think everyone's afraid finally. they should be because for the longest time it's been this whole nimby thing, not in my back yard, that if it doesn't affect me, it doesn't affect me. but it does. we are losing everybody. every time you turn around it's another person. i've lost too many fricken clients. we've lost too many here, and the reality is we've lost way less here as a clinic than my clients have lost with people that are not currently here, and that should be maybe in treatment. but i think that because they're getting the treatment services and things like that and they have access to naloxone with us, all those kind of things, and they are very much educated by the staff here, and the use obviously isn't as big as a problem as if you weren’t here, but i think that we're still missing the mark. ",1135
"379","doc 601","zm: is there protocol for naloxone distribution for clients? ",61
"380","doc 602","sd: for us to give to clients?",30
"381","doc 604","sd: it is allowed! so, if you are any sort of treatment provider, treatment program you can administer naloxone as part of steve's law. there are some kinds of stipulations that you fill out some little form and it's written in you variance in your program thing saying, we can administer naloxone in my residential treatment program so they have it. i go and do a training. they fill out this little form. that way they don't get a fine for—the reality is if they get a hundred dollar fine versus somebody dead i'd rather pay the fine. there are stipulations that other programs have to do in order to administer naloxone. for us we have a variance because we have prescribers. we have a doctor that prescribes a medication, it is basically a [unclear] medication in here. because naloxone is now available anywhere, any pharmacy, over the counter. any pharmacy. it used to only be cvs pharmacies. i don't know. they are the only ones that kind of have an open mind. [laughs] i don't know! they were the only ones that were willing to test the waters even though not that many of them had it. you would have to call and make sure and then explain to them what it was half the time. shit show. but now any pharmacy in the state of minnesota can give out naloxone. they just have to have a prescriber. if they don't have one they can use the medical fricken—the main medical guy for minnesota. whatever it is. ",1409
"382","doc 605","but for us because we have a standing [unclear] medication our doctor prescribes it. all we have to do is train the client. train the trainer kind of thing. i train the client on how to reverse an overdose. i fill out a little bit of a form. i don't really get much information i just want demographics on where it's going. the year they were born, culture. i want to see where it's going. i want to know where it's going and then i want to know if you used it i want you to come back and tell me. i want to know how fast it worked. the more and more i know it was successful the more and more i can get it out there. ",618
"383","doc 606","we dispense a huge amount. this year alone, what is it may 1st now? i've dispensed probably thirteen, fourteen hundred kits so far this year. yeah. huge amount of them come out of here. clients know that i am the self-proclaimed narcan queen.

"384","doc 607","zm: still the drug dealer!",26
"385","doc 608","sd: [laughs] that's right. i'm dealing drugs on a different level now, though. a completely different level, which is funny because on sunday i met a friend of mine the last place i ever used at. i met him at cub foods. what he was bringing me was the auto injectors for naloxone because they're expired and i give them out to some other people that are out on the street. because they still—",392
"386","doc 609","zm: is that like through your position at valhalla, or do you just do that to do that? training and stuff. ",107
"387","doc 610","sd: it's now my job. it is now part of my job. but before it was something that i just started doing almost a year and a half ago. a year and a half ago i had my first client overdose. ",185
"388","doc 611","zm: and you were like, i don't want to do that again?",53
"389","doc 612","sd: yeah. i sat here until eight-thirty at night. we leave at two o'clock in the afternoon. i was here until eight-thirty at night waiting for his family to call me and tell me if he was alive or not. i couldn't go home until i knew what i was coming into the next day, or if i needed a day off, honestly. i couldn't leave. i thought to myself, if i'm feeling like this and this is my client i can't imagine what a family member, or somebody that really knows somebody personally on a different level than i do—even though i probably know more about my client than their family does quite often—but how it affected me feeling and waiting to find out if they were okay or not that nobody should fricken have to feel like that. so i started to go just kind of haywire with the narcan thing. ",789
"390","doc 613","zm: how did you transition that into a part of your job?",56
"391","doc 614","sd: a lot of it was with little earth. i went a did a training with them finally. i'd snuck it in a few times, and did a big training for the community there. then started doing some education at the colleges. mctc, and century college. got some of my professors talking about medically assisted treatment. by word of mouth people started hearing my name. it turned into a bigger, way bigger than i expected. my caseload got dropped because this is part of my job now. ",469
"392","doc 615","i was just kind of doing it on my own time. i had a full caseload. on sunday's or at three o'clock in the afternoon, or if it was in the middle of the day i would schedule my work around it, and i would just do whatever it took to make sure i got this stuff out there. i was just like this is it. i found my niche. and then talked to, you know, our bigger bosses and things like that. chuck hilger, who is one of my bosses here and the vp of our program here. he knew what i was doing. he gave me—he pointed amy in my direction! it was something that i just—we were missing it. where else do you get narcan from? the average person is not walking into a fucking cvs pharmacy and saying, ""can i get narcan?"" because first, i'm going to be judged. do i have to give you my name? am i going to have to pay for it? an active user sure as hell isn't going to go and get narcan from a pharmacy. they're not going there to get their needles anymore because they usually don't give them to them. so, why would they go. ",1011
"393","doc 616","i just started doing as much with the clients and the staff here and just, yeah. word of mouth. i've trained from here to kenyon police department, which i didn't even know the town of kenyon existed. very small, like a thousand people. i went and trained their narcotics unit, the police department, and the first responders, but the first people to respond in a small town like that are the police. so, they all have our naloxones. i've been to kenyon, i've trained as many treatment programs as possible. meridian did not have narcan at all in their patient residential sites open until i came along. i was like, ""this is bullshit. if we're going to work together you guys have to have that."" i've trained all their staff, all their nursing, all their residential programs have that. ",787
"394","doc 617","zm: are they an abstinence based sobriety—",42
"395","doc 618","sd: they're abstinence based, absolutely. but that doesn't mean people don't die. so, i was like, you know, we still should have that. and have been educating more about harm reduction and methadone. i was at rccs—restoration, counseling, and community services i think it is—last week doing narcan training with them. mat, methadone assisted treatment 101, kind of education with them. anybody that's interested. i do emts, i do save-a-life corporation, which is like first responder classes a couple times a month. i just come in, spend thirty minutes doing narcan training, talk about opiates, and get out.

"396","doc 619","a lot of it originally was volunteering. it's like i said no one—to start my day off is checking to see how many of my clients didn't dose the day before. and if they're not normally people that miss days in a row, if i notice that they've been gone two or three days and that's not their normal m/o i start looking through the jails to see if they've been arrested. and then i look at obituaries. and the fact that my day starts at 5:30 in the morning with me looking at obituaries to see if i recognize any names is bullshit. that shouldn't be my job. that shouldn't be anybody's normal day. it just really, really shouldn't. until we do something and really address the problem and fill the gap and talk about this stuff it's not going to matter. we're not going to make a difference. we haven't talked about it. we ignore it. we ignore drug addiction. there's so much fucking stigma that comes along with that. ",915

"398","doc 621","sd: yeah. addiction is not going anywhere. hasn't gone anywhere in forever. it's not going anywhere now so why should i have to be anonymous? and why should i be shamed because i'm on methadone or suboxone if i go to a twelve-step meeting? why can't i say that i'm using this as a tool along with treatment. ",308
"399","doc 622","zm: is that not accepted?",25
"400","doc 623","sd: not so much. depends on the group, but they quite often get shamed and told that they're not clean. we try not to use words like clean and dirty here because if i'm clean that means at one point i was dirty. as a person that's been in active addiction and has shamed themselves to death nothing you say can do any worse than what i'm telling myself all day long. so i don't need that from people that are supporting me. you can't tell me how to recover. the only way to not recover is to die. it doesn't matter. i don't fucking care how you recover if it's a light bulb and some methadone and a plant is going to work for you then do it. i don't care. or if smoking pot is going to do it for you, or if the risk is going to be less than the iv use and i'm going to start smoking it, and then hopefully maybe i slow down and i go a different direction and i add methadone into the mix or iv treatment, or it's teen challenge. i don't care. i don't care. but i think that we've told everybody that there's one way to do things and that's the only way to do it. the reality is that's bullshit. we have extremely high success rates. medication assisted treatment is extremely successful for long-term use. most people need to be on methadone or suboxone for at least a year. anywhere from 365 to 442 days is the research i've done. but it took you a year to qualify for this program, it's going to take you probably about a year to get your life together. ",1456
"401","doc 624","zm: is that the average length you see?",39
"402","doc 625","sd: it all depends on the person. some people are here for a year, year and a half, a couple years. then they are kind of ready to titrate or taper off of the medication and go on their merry little way. some people have no intention of ever leaving and that's okay. and some people don't know, they say they're not quite done yet, and decide to back out for a little while, and then they come back. and we always just hope they make it back. we have a lot of clients that readmit to our program over and over again. and shit, i'm just thrilled when they walk back in the door and they know they made it because a lot of them aren't. ",634
"403","doc 626","we need to do something different out here. i think education is a huge part of it. educating and being honest. i think the education piece needs to be done by people who get it. people who have been active users—even the ones that are actively using. people who are maybe on methadone and are doing well. people who maybe still are actively using. and then the families. by people who get dirty and see it. because the suits, and society, or people that maybe trained in certain things but don't see it all the time. i think we ignore a lot of stuff. i think we've been ignoring it for a long time. even the fucking war on drugs. that worked out real well. [laughs] ""just say no."" i'm a product of ""just say no."" it didn't work. what that did was gave people the idea that you had a choice. ",792
"404","doc 627","zm: i also think it was a race thing. ",38
"405","doc 628","sd: absolutely. it didn't work. and, ""if you just say no you'll be okay."" but if you say yes then you're weak because you had a choice to say no. and that's what it freaking put on everybody because society still sees a thing, ""why can't you just quit?"" why would you need another medication? just stop. it doesn't fricken work. having to explain that to my father years ago, you know, when you said you were going to quit smoking and then by six a.m. you're at the holiday gas station buying another pack of cigarettes—that's how i am with crack cocaine. i can't not stop it. and so if, you know, for him to try to quit smoking you guys have one of those little inhaler things—that's my methadone. he was like, oh, this is like my methadone. i was like exactly! that's harm reduction. that's less harm and you're weaning yourself. however you've got to do it i don't care. it absolutely works. ",895
"406","doc 629","i think we need more access to treatment. i think that we need programs—for the opiate piece—we need programs that accept everybody no matter what medication they're taking including methadone and suboxone because not everybody does. and i don't think it's fair that you can make a deciding factor on what somebody is taking for their medication because you're going to take them if they're taking lithium or gabapentin and those are abused drugs. they can cause sedation, they can cause a combination of things if you take them with other fricken medications. so who are you to say we can't take them because they're on methadone. we'll take them on methadone, but they have to be on sixty milligrams or less. well who the fuck are you to say what that person's magical dose is? because you don't know anything about them. i think you should leave it up to the experts such as us and our doctors and things here to make that decision before you say they can't come to our program. because then again you're outed and there's that shame and that stigma of, well, i'm not good enough to go to that program. only a couple of them will take me. no sober living's will take me. it's just not fair. we're alienating a huge population of people that the most amazing people i've ever met in my entire life that don't have a fricken fighting chance because we won't allow them to based on judgment and a lack of education. there's my soap box. ",1437

"408","doc 631","sd: in an ideal world where i was in charge i'd get a raise! then i think that naloxone should be with every first responder, police included, because quite often they are first to the scene and not every police department carries them. i'm speaking minnesota only—we should be able to open the doors to anything. continue to educate each other. this should be in the school systems. we should be educating clinicians going into the field. i think that the doctors and the medical field needs to be educated on what's going on out there. i don't think they really have a clue, and when another person comes in on an overdose there should be a referral process going through. there isn't one. you're usually in there for about three hours and then you get discharged. ",767
"409","doc 632","it depends on the program, the facility. north memorial starting the eighth of this month will be giving out an optional narcan kit to anybody that comes in on an overdose. that comes with some referral information and stuff like that. so, they're finally getting it. but even talking to the providers there in the emergency department: why are we giving them needles? is the response. so, there's always this stigma and lack of education. we're like, well, this would be partially cost, but this is the reason because dead people don't recover. that's my short answer for you, but why would we not? because this could be your kid. ",632
"410","doc 633","i think that the problem is not enough of us have been affected. and that's shitty that we all have to fricken have lost somebody or see somebody struggle in order for this to be a big deal. because we just don't know. i think that we need to—minnesota being the land of ten thousand treatments we have a million and one treatment programs that anyone could get into, but i think narcan should be on site at every single one of them, they should be opening the doors to anyone on medication assisted treatment, i think our detox processes of people are going to straight detox and doing a detox program instead of doing mat or anything like that—it's scary. i think having to wait to get in is a huge barrier because if i'm going to have to wait two weeks to get into freaking detox? i'm not going! forget it. and the perception of addiction that i need it right now—that's why we answer the phone all the time—is that you don't care. well, they didn't answer the phone and they only answer monday through friday from eight to four. well, two weeks from now? that person might be dead two days from now. so the urgency and trying to just get people straight through. and that's part of the policy piece here. a straight shot from that phone call they make that maybe there is a bed waiting in a detox and maybe then we give them that option to do you want to start on suboxone or methadone? is that something that interests you? get them started on that because the withdrawal while waiting to get into treatment you're not going to stay. you're going to walk out in two days if you last that long. so from that getting them set up and somewhat stable, or at least somewhat comfy for a few hours out of the day, and then going from there to any treatment program if that's something they need. but having everyone's doors open and the problem is there's always going to be a waiting list for treatment because there's too many clients and not enough programs no matter how many we have out here there's always going to be a wait list, and then there's going to be the ones people want to go to or are referred to more often than others. ",2137
"411","doc 634","for us for the opiate piece there are certain areas—no one's going to take anybody that's in withdrawal. we have to figure out, you know, we're referring people to treatment there's dimension one, which is all about withdrawal. and if they're at too high of a number they're not going to take them. you've got to go to the hospital first. well, great. i've missed my bed. no one's going to hold a bed for you because they're going to put the next body in there. so, we're just missing a lot in order to do so. i think we all have to act like i guess the aids crisis, which you know took us forever to fucking recognize too. ",624
"412","doc 635","zm: at least the nomenclature of epidemic harkens back to that sort of level of—also level of ineptness to deal with it currently. just to sort of sum up it sounds like you're recommending an integration of harm reduction into the already prevalent minnesota model, twelve-step in-patient as well as on-site withdrawal? maybe?",326
"413","doc 636","sd: maybe. if they could figure something out like that that would be great. if somebody was willing to do that. at least always having special beds available in like st. joe's or fairview for people that don't want to get on medication assisted treatment. yeah, something to that effect. or if they're going from one treatment to another, especially for the overdoses, if someone overdoses there should be an automatic phone call. let's make a phone call to this place. or at least, you know, here's a card. call these people. it doesn't have to be valhalla. this isn't a plug for us, but you can't just have somebody come in from a near death experience and say, alright see you later. nothing. even quite often when people overdose they don't know or remember what's happened, but the family knows what's happened. we see it. we're affected by it. society as a whole has a huge fucking ripple effect. so then why aren't we doing something?",942

"419","doc 642","sd: exactly. at least one might sound better than the other. our clients walk in and they aren't mandated to treatment here. nobody says you have to come to treatment at valhalla place. i think there was maybe one person that probation said they had to come here. our clients come in because they want to come here. wherever they are in the state of change. whether they are here just because it's going to fill in the blanks between their use, or because they really want to stop. however they get here they get here and they fricken walk in, which is the hardest thing for someone to do is say, you know what? i can't fricken do this anymore and i need some help. and when somebody does that we should be high-fiving them and giving them kudos and support and acknowledging that instead of shaming and making them feel like shit because you couldn't just quit. so, we're missing a lot of stuff. ",897
"420","doc 643","and we need a whole lot of money. narcan, grants, all kinds of stuff we pay out of pocket. not everybody can afford that. oh, and the jail system. that's my biggest goal is the jail and prison system. naloxone is in there, but new york has an amazing program out there that all their jails and prisons, and i think they have fifty-four jails and prisons in new york state, but prior to an inmate being released they have the option of having a narcan training and having narcan in their property. how fricken amazing is that? the highest risk of people coming out is treatment and jail of overdose, so why wouldn't i set them up to protect them and having their family be trained as well? why wouldn't we have that? and then why should we cut them off cold turkey if they're on methadone or suboxone when they get incarcerated? yeah i made a mistake, yeah i did this and that, but all i'm doing is setting them up for failure if they're in there for three days, ten days, three years if i don't have any treatment and no coping skills i'm going to get out and do the same damn thing. opiates don't go away short term. and they don't go away because you're in a bubble. ""well, you've been in jail for two years. you'll be fine."" i did prison for a couple years. i still wanted to smoke crack when i got out. so, the craving process when i'm in a safe little bubble was sights and smells and sounds our memory sticks to those things, so why wouldn't we start somebody up even if you're not doing them while you're incarcerated. but sending them up prior to that. ""i saw that you maybe used opiates in the past."" they talk to somebody about, you know, medical people there and some of the treatment programs. setting them up with something is an option coming out in our jail programs. ",1783

"446","doc 680","re: okay, well i was born in 1956. i'm sixty-one today. i was born as the last child--i have five siblings--my father was married before my mother and had one daughter, and then met my mother and had four of us. then when i was fourteen my mother took in a foster child who i consider a sister. we lived in southern california. my mother was from superior, wisconsin and my father's from ottumwa, iowa. my mom was born in 1919 and my dad was born in 1911, so i was kind of a late child, bit of a late child, compared to my brother's and sisters. being the youngest my next oldest sister was eight years older than i am. i had a niece who was seven years younger. my half-sister was twenty-two years older than me and she passed a few years ago. none of them have addiction issues. compulsive overeating, but not any kind of substance abuse issues. my father was what i think of as a periodic drunk. whether he's an alcoholic or not would have been his decision to make, but he was very unpredictable. he had long periods of not drinking followed by short periods of heavy drinking. when he drank he was really violent. was very physical with my mother in front of us kids--on purpose in front of us kids. he'd get us up in the morning and the middle of the night and drag us into the living room and call her names and berate her. made sure we knew what he thought of her and that kind of thing. ",1396
"447","doc 681","when i was five my mom had saved enough money to move out. my oldest sister barbara had come to live with us for a while and then had gone back to live with my dad's sister, her aunt, in virginia. and then she had moved on and gotten married. in fact she was married the year i was born. then my next sister marlene had already moved out. she had gotten married. ",363

"449","doc 683","my mom and i and my sister kathy moved to redondo beach. my mom worked two jobs, so my sister had to take care of me. my sister kind of picked up where my dad left off. she resolved all her emotional issues through violence. again, it was a periodic kind of thing. it wasn't an everyday kind of thing, but when it occurred it was pretty severe. it didn't really stop until one time she really, really went a little too far and i had climbed out my bedroom window and was hiding in the garden of my neighbor. she found me--the mother--and she had me call my mom. of course, back then, you know, you didn't call your mom at work because she could lose her job. i had to call mom at work and she had to come home. i have no idea what she said to my sister because that was behind closed doors, but what she told me was she needed me not to make my sister so angry. she had to work and if she was going to support us she couldn't lose her job and she had to depend on kathy to keep an eye on me. she needed to depend on me not to make my sister angry. so, i learned at a really young age how to be responsible because i was going to make sure my mom could depend on me. i really loved my mom. ",1189
"450","doc 684","kathy and i kind of found our way. i think the difficulty for me with kathy was that she was one person behind closed doors and another person out in public. it was kind of like that beatles song, eleanor rigby: keep a face in a jar by the door. that's pretty much how it was. but i had a very loving relationship with my mom and with my sister, it just was mixed with this unpredictable kind of thing. i think i learned also at a really young age not to trust what you saw. you know, you just didn't know--especially with my father--you never knew what you were going to get. i never knew if i was going to get this loving, caring father or if i was going to get this violent, alcoholic stranger that i had to be afraid of? my trust issues ran pretty deep pretty young. ",771

"456","doc 690","re: high school. well, again, it was a real tough thing for me because i was bright. in eighth grade i had taken classes up at high school already. i was a very good student. i had no problem with learning. my mother read to me as a kid and, you know, you went to bed at eight o'clock and read for half an hour and then it was lights out. i learned to explore through literature. book learning came easy for me. i did really well in my studies, but i wasn't this straight-laced kid who had the 2.3 kids at home and dad working and mom--that group of kids that tended to be in the honors classes and those kinds of things tended to be the ones whose parents were paying attention to them. my mom paid attention to me, but it was a different environment so i felt odd man out there. then i wasn't a sports person by any stretch of imagination--basketball, but that was about it--and so i didn't fit in there. i didn't feel real girly, so i never felt like i knew how to accessorize or whatever. probably because my sister was really good at it! [laughs] it was just easier to not make that important because i didn't feel good at it. i probably felt the most at ease in my orchestra class because that was kind of a mix of kids, but didn't socialize outside of class. by the time i was a freshman i started making friends outside of school. older kids. ",1351

[laughs] that worked really well for me. that was something i did on a daily basis. pot was a lot different than it is today. it wasn't as potent. it was just--nobody knew i was high. my mother never thought something was going on. and then i started finding--benzodrine. we used to get little white crosses. loved those. didn't care too much for downers like reds [seconal] and that kind of thing because i felt a little out of control. i didn't like alcohol for the same reason. i didn't like that feeling of behaving in a way that i couldn't stop myself from behaving. it didn't remove inhibitions. it removed everything who i am. pot didn't feel like that, and neither did uppers. i did some lsd and some mushrooms and stuff like that, but again it wasn't my thing. ",1311

"468","doc 702","re: they were already my friends. it was something that i was not ignorant about people going to jail for. it wasn't something i was interested in--i didn't need the money. it's not like i was trying to be a drug dealer. that wasn't the idea. and i didn't really know 'drug dealers' or what i thought of as dealers--i would eventually know dealers, yes. i had a connection at school because--that kind of thing. i wasn't known as somebody you'd go get something from. i had a very tight inner circle of friends that that portion of it was for. ",544
"469","doc 703","sa: what happened after you graduated high school?",50
"470","doc 704","re: by then, my senior year in high school like i said i had gotten in with a group of a bit older--maybe four years older than i was--and they left hermosa beach and went to florida. a couple of them were going to go to school there. i went on to the junior high and i was there for about a month and i couldn't stand it. it just did not work for me. junior high in california is fifteen thousand students. it was a big school. i just didn't know what i was doing there and i wasn't comfortable there. i was having trouble with my mom at home because my mom had become very successful. she became an entrepreneur and very successful. she worked all the time. when i was a senior--she was able to hire people and do all that, and so she was home and around a lot. my oldest sister--my sister that had lived with me--had moved out when i was ten. from ten until i was eighteen i was making my own decisions pretty much. i had restrictions and all of that, but it wasn't like i had someone saying, ""well this is what you should wear. this is what you should pack for lunch. it's time to take a bath. time to wash your hair."" whatever. i mean it wasn't like that. suddenly at eighteen my mom is in the picture and she wants to play that role. i'm looking at her like, ""who are you? i don't think so."" it began this strife between us. there was always a little bit of that because i was pretty independent at fourteen, and i could get pretty mouthy, but everybody in my family is mouthy. it's just kind of how we are. again, i love my mom and we got along. we would do things together, and i was her plus one in a lot of cases. she was a member of the business and professional women's clubs and would bring me in and i would sing and play guitar and do their entertainment for them, and i got to know all these women. i learned to really love women and the friendships they showed one another. it was a women helping women orgainzation, so that was very strong in my upbringing. ",1976
"471","doc 705","so, as a senior in high school and then after graduating i was not prepared to have my mom telling me what i could and could not do on a decision--like i was home sick one day. i had a cold. it was a saturday. i just kind of layed around in my pajamas and watched tv. i thought, ""i've got to get out of here."" i called kenny and eileen and i said, ""what are you guys doing?"" i mean we didn't--we weren't out getting in trouble. it was, oh, we're playing spades and kenny played flute and i played guitar and we would all get together and jam and smoke weed. that's just kind of the way it was. my mom said, ""you're not going anywhere."" i'm like, ""excuse me?"" ""you've been sick all day, you're not leaving."" i said, ""i'm just going over to kenny and eileen's. i'm just going to be inside their house. what's the problem?"" it turned into this enormous battle of will. i finally gave in because it came to the point where were about to be violent with each other and it scared me that i could go there. ",1000
"472","doc 706","on monday morning mom went to work and i went to her bedroom and got out the pass book that had my college funds in it. it was a joint account, and it had at that time $11,200 in it. i remember like it was yesterday. i went to the bank and i took out $1,200, which i thought was a nice round nubmer and i left her ten grand. i called my friends in florida and i said, ""i'm coming out there."" i bought a ticket and had my friend maria bring me to the airport. i left a note on the kitchen table that said: have gone to florida. will call. that was my big 'f' you to my mom. we'll see whose in charge of my life. that's how i left high school. ",642
"473","doc 707","sa: what was life like in florida?",34
"474","doc 708","re: it was pretty cool. i roomed with four people. i rode a bus to get around. they had really good public transportation unlike southern california. i got a job at the court house in the tax assessor's office, which was only a few blocks from where i lived. i went to the clubs at night because you had to be eighteen to drink there. i dind't drink much but i went dancing a lot. i met a boy. he was five years older than me, john, and i thought i was in love. i'm sure for who i was at the time i was about as in love as a person could be, i suppose. i had this unfinished responsibility at home and it didn't feel right. after about--not long--maybe five or six months i went back. made things right with my mom. i did a tecnical school for medical office stuff, or whatever. i don't even remember. john courted me long-distance and he wanted me to come back. i told mom, i said, ""i think i want to go back."" i was waiting for her to scream, and she just said, ""what is it i can help you do to pack?"" ",1004
"475","doc 709","so, i went to florida. lived down in the keys. poor as poor could be because you can't make much money there back in those days anyway. we smoked a lot of weed. that's about all we did was smoke a lot of week. i worked as a waitress and he worked as a heavy equipment operator at the dump. after a year we decided to get married. we got married. then moved around different places in florida, and then i just needed to come home. i needed to come back to be with my family. ",474
"476","doc 710","i drug this poor florida country boy back to los angeles, and he did not do well there. i did. i got a job at a company--my sister helped me get a job--and i ended up just [makes blowing wind noise] up the scale because the business was growing by leaps and bounds in the telecommunication industry. i was really good at business processes. i set up stuff and i did really well. and then i found cocaine. my girlfriend introduced it to me, my friend maria. she was single and i was still with john. pretty soon i didn't want to be with john anymore. i had lost a lot--the quick cocaine weight loss program, you know, so i was looking pretty good and was getting a lot of male attention. i was a different person by the time i was twenty-four than i was when i met him at eighteen. and he was already twenty-five so now he's going on thirty and he's pretty much the same guy he's always been. god, he was such a nice guy. could have sold him to anybody; i mean it. get him up on the auction block and--anybody, they'd fight over him. he was just a really great guy. but i didn't understand any of that at the time and i just wanted to move on. i believe, i guess, in serial monogomy. i'm not a player, but i couldn't move on and do something behind his back. that didn't match my morals. so, we split. he went to live with my mother, which was another bone of contention because she just knew i was 'going through a phase' and it would all be okay, and he was a hell of a nice guy, like i said. but i started doing a lot of cocaine. i had a lot of money, and there was a lot of cocaine, and so was everybody else doing a lot of cocaine. it was a very popular, popular drug at the time. ",1685
"477","doc 711","sl: this was in the late seventies?",35
"478","doc 712","re: let's see--when was that? i graduated in '74, so we're talking '79, '80? almost the eighties. drinking margaritas, smoking weed, and doing coke. it was the perfect world. it really was. i was doing really well at work and feeling like everything that defined me was work oriented. i wasn't playing my guitar anymore. i wasn't playing piano. i wasn't doing any of that. i hadn't touched my violin since i left high school. the other interests--i got this real big ego, you know? i was young, and the administrative manager of a major telecommunications corporation. i was traveling all over the united states, opening offices, hiring and training people--at twenty-five. it was a big deal. so, i didn't have a problem. i was still working. in fact, this was golden. ",769
"479","doc 713","sa: until it wasn't. ",21
"480","doc 714","re: then i met tim. i didn't do alone very well. i met tim, and he was very different from john. he was much more cynical. he was very well-read. john was borderline illiterate. not intellectually, but his skills were not there. tim read the la times cover to cover everyday. he was interesting. he became a longshoreman. he was making some good money. we moved in together and were living together for a year, and i wasn't telling him about the cocaine. that was my business. he started coming home and he would pass out on the couch. i thought, you know, this is not my beautiful life. what's going on here? he needs to stop drinking so much. he did, he drank a lot. an irish guy, definitely the stereotype. ",710
"481","doc 715","i thought, you know, the problem is that we're not doing the same drug. [laughs] if he would just do coke with me then everything would be okay. so, one day he came home. we were together five years--we lived together for a yera and i think we were married for three. it was proabably in our second year. i kind of lose track. it's been a while. [laughs] i am sixty-one. i don't know the timeline well, but the storyline was that i decided to say, ""hey, guess what i brought home?"" i brought out a little bindle, little gram of coke, and i said, ""do you want to snort some coke?"" i've been doing this for a long time. he said, ""hell no. i don't want to snort that shit."" that's exactly what he said. i thought, ""my secret's out."" it was my secret. i knew at that time that i was probably spending more money and energy in using this drug than was probably socially acceptable. again, nobody talked about addiction back then. they didn't tell you they could cure you on tv like they do today. i looked at him and i remember being just devastated. i thought, ""i'm going to lose this relationship."" he said, ""but i'll fix it."" i said, ""what's that?"" at that point in time i don't think i could have gotten high anymore much because i had been using so long through snorting that this was not working so much anymore. he says, ""hang on a minute."" he had a rig, he had a tookit. well, it wasn't the drinking that was making him pass out. he was using heroin. he was chipping heroin. ",1478
"482","doc 716","sa: and you didn't know. ",25
"483","doc 717","re: i had no idea. right. we were very functional. there wasn't that stereotypical idea that you gain from poorly done newsreels and shows on addiction--or not addiction, because they didn't do shows on addiction--but the heroin addict or the alcoholic was always somone on skid row. it was never the bank president. i was up for it. i was like, man, this is a new way i can get high. and i did. i started getting high again. it had just gotten to the point that i was using because i had to use. i wasn't getting high. well, that--for about a year that worked for me. then i was just crazy. i had to have more drugs, i had to have more, i had to have more. he's like, ""you need to chill out. try some of this. so, what ended up happening was i would use coke to get high and heroin to come down. then go to work and function and do all of that. it became this back and forth thing. ",883
"484","doc 718","i started embezzeling from work. not paying my taxes. we were renting a house from my mother and wasn't paying her any rent, we weren't paying our bills, we weren't doing--and then tim wasn't going to work. it was becoming quite a problem. then it got to be that i was using coke to get high and heroin to get well because i was strung out on heroin and i would get sick if i didn't use more. and i got pregnant. i'm like, ""he needs to do something about his problem."" again, i was in such denial of my own--i mean, i go to work everyday. he's not going to work! this is not okay. how i judged how well i was was i'm about my job. i was almost four months pregnant before i even realized because i was so out of tune with my body. i did go to see a gynecologist. i did tell him that i was using because that scared me. he said, ""i can never repeat this, but i'm going to tell you--"" he had me come back. he did some research and then i came back, and he says, ""look, i've been in touch with the people from haight-ashbury area in san fransisco, and we don't want you to go on methadone because that's really hard on the fetus. we don't want you to kick because we don't want the baby to go through withdrawal. what we want you to do is start to cut yourself down."" ",1265
"485","doc 719","i turned my addiction over to the care of my husband. he did. he started weening me off. he got on methadone maintenance, but by the time--again i'm not sure the storyline. he did go into treatment. i did try--i sabotaged that as soon as he got out. i was like, ""no, no, no, no."" you like hugging people i don't even know? this is not okay. this was my first exposure to treatment. my mom was going to the family group stuff. she kept going while we didn't. my daughter was born hooked. that was 1985. ",502
"486","doc 720","sa: how much had you weened off by this point?",46
"487","doc 721","re: i was almost not using. i mean i was using, but there wasn't much there. they put her on phenobarbital as a detox for about three, four days. she was pretty--her health was good. she was small, but she was okay. well, we knew what was going to happen when we got into the hospital because they screen parents. it's considered child abuse. they put a hold on the baby--tim's mom took her temporarily for custody and then at thirty days we had a hearing. we met before the court in east l.a., which was really quite a joke because we were probably the only white couple in the courtroom with a white judge, and all these cases were being called and parents not showing up, parents not showing up, parents not showing up. kids in foster care and stuff. and then we're there, right, in our business suits and grandma and great grandma and everybody's all prim and proper. the social worker said we do not recommend you give custody, and the judge was like, ""are you kidding me?"" these are white people. they can't have a problem. so, they let us have her back full-time with monitoring. well, monitoring in l.a. is kind of a joke because they are so overloaded with cases, so i think we saw her once in a year's time. ",1218
"488","doc 722","i stayed clean for four months. went to a program, an outpatient program. tim stayed clean and then one day he came home and his eyes were pinned and i looked at him and said, ""you better have brought me some."" and we were off to the races again. so, that was 1985. i lost my job. well, i went in and quit my job before they could find out i was embezzling money from them. i didn't exactly lose my job, i gave my job away. that was really bad. that was really bad. my mother was dying. she had cancer. she was at my sister's house, and i would go into her house and take things and hawk them. i mean it got really ugly really fast. it was probably worse getting clean and then going back than it was before i got clean. i think the demoralization was really overpowering. my mother-in-law was really a life saver. she helped my daughter. was watching my daughter more than i was certainly. tim took better care of her than i did. ",931
"489","doc 723","i guess she was fifteen months old, and i just couldn't do it anymore. i called my brother and told my brother i needed help. my sister tells me that i called her off and on all night long and my brother off and on all night long, and they were just ignoring me. my brother says finally after twenty-four hours of calling me off and on he goes, ""i figured you might be serious."" i packed up kaitlyn's stuff and handed her to tim. i said, ""you go stay at your mom's. my brother's going to be here. he will kill you if he sees you."" because my problem was because of tim. everything was because of tim. and that was convenient for me. that was fine with me. they could think that. i went into inpatient treatment. on my fourth day my mom died. so that was pretty rough. i was lucky that i was in treatment because i probably wouldn't have even known. they were able to come and get me and i was able to see her. i asked her if she could ever forgive me and she says, ""i have nothing to forgive you for, robin. but you're really sick so you need to stay. finish."" i couldn't get out of there fast enough. i was like,  ""take me back!"" ",1131
"490","doc 724","so they kept me a little extra long, and then they had--they started--that program was really intense. they had--it was the raider program out of st. peter peninsula hospital. you started in inpatient, and you started outpatient at the same time. their outpatient program was monday, wednesday, friday. mondays and wednesdays it was three hours, and friday it was two hours. you spent the first hour in--the family members were in their group, and the family went through this whole thing at the same time for as much as you did. the families were in their family groups and the addicts were in their groups, addicts and alcoholics, and then they'd have an hour where you'd come together and they'd do an education kind of thing. a presentation, lecture, movie, whatever. of course the counselors were all talking about you and your respective family members. then you would come together in mixed groups. it was pretty--there was a number of people. there were probably fifteen of us in treatment and then all the people who were still going to the aftercare and stuff. ",1071
"491","doc 725","my family came. of course tim was not--he was still using, so there was no way he was coming. it was okay because we did inpatient all day long, then you went to aftercare for three hours--and i mean there was no phone. no magazines. no tv. we smoked and drank coffee and went for walks under armed guard just about. i tried to leave once. that didn't work out too well. ",371
"492","doc 726","sl: was it a thirty-day program?",32
"493","doc 727","re: it was a thirty-day program. they kept me a little longer. because tim was a union guy they gave a five thousand dollar--it cost five grand. pretty cheap back then, but it was probably a ten or twelve thousand dollar program at the time, which would be probably thirty thousand today. there were so many treatment people coming in through the welfare office at the union that they gave them a volume discount i guess! [laughs] i don't know. it was a really good program. that was november, 1986 and i've been clean ever since. ",531

"496","doc 730","re: my brother came with my father actually to come pick me up. i was furious, furious, that he brought my dad. my brother--today i have a completely different relationship with my brother. he's become a different human being in his own right. at the time he was very prejudiced, very angry, had no tolerance, patience, or understanding whatsoever in anything i was doing. i was despicable, and he treated me that way from the time he picked me up until the time he left the hospital. i tried to leave, you know, and i turned around and my dad, actually, fronted that five grand. he was retired by then. i turned around to bolt. when it started out it was a good idea. by the time i'm starting to kick and they're having trouble getting me in and it took four hours and i'm getting sick, i--this is not such a good idea. i turned around to leave and i ran smack into him. he--i'm fighting him and he's holding me and he was not going to let me go. he whispers in my ear, and he says, ""robin, it's not that you're a bad person. you're not a bad person, but you really need help."" that's probably the only time my father ever said anything to me--and he ended up saving my life because i'd have left. ",1199
"497","doc 731","sa: how did you maintain sobriety after that?",45
"498","doc 732","re: well, i am a social person. i do like people and like being with people. the fellowship was very appealing to me. i had been a member of that business women's club that my mother helped charter, and i learned a lot of leadership skills there, which fed into my success in business and so forth. i liked doing that. i liked going to conferences and being with the gals and all of that. the fellowship provided that for me. that had been missing in my life. it was--i was a part of the cool crowd in recovery, you know? that kind of thing. ",542
"499","doc 733","at the time, in '86, at that point in time people were very serious about their recovery. i mean, yeah, you showed up on a nudge from the judge, or your parents were going to kick you out, or your family was going to disown you so you show up, but they stayed for different reasons. ",283
"500","doc 734","sa: have you seen that change? how?",35
"501","doc 735","re: yeah. sometimes a meeting can feel like when you were in high school and they sent you to detention. that's the attitude. that happens everywhere, not just here. but we're smaller fellowship here in duluth. now, when i got clean it still was a small fellowship. plus, there weren't hardly any females. one of the principles we have is called attraction rather than promotion. that worked for me because i was very attracted to being with the men, and not having to deal with women on an equal basis. that was really attractive to me. but, still, i can remember the anderson meeting was at the anderson men's halfway house. oh, and i went to a halfway house for four months when i got out. ",693
"502","doc 737","re: no, when i was still in california. i used to come back here for summers when i was a little kid and visit my cousins and stay for six weeks and be down in wayzata. but california. so, i'm at the anderson's house meeting and we had it in the living room. there were fifteen, twenty people. that anderson meeting is like two hundred people come now. it's in a big hall and you have to go talk on the microphone. it's a whole different ball of wax than it once was. i was a little stunned to go back. i was asked to go back and tell my story and i shared my story at a meeting there. and people were getting up and they were walking around. it was just this kind of disrespect that i think is just a microcosm of our society. you find that everywhere today that you wouldn't have found in the eighties. in the seventies, you called people's parents by their 'mister' and 'misses' johanson, i mean you didn't call them by their first names. it was just a different kind of respect that was expected as a social norm. yes, i don't--you have to really...",1053
"503","doc 738","then i came here. so i was clean four years. i got another job very similar to the one i had. i was gone from six in the morning to six in the evening. my daughter was in preschool all the time and i thought, ""she's being raised like i was raised."" you know? i don't want it to be like this. my mother had left me quite a bit of money when she passed, and i made a decision to use that money to go to school. i had never gone to college. i figured then i could be home with kaitlyn while i'm going to school for four years. then i'll come back--and then i decided to come back here to do it in superior because a) i have a support system. i couldn't afford to do it in duluth without working too. and it was a gentler, kinder society to raise my daughter. my intent was to leave--you know, come back then and be the cfo. i had no intention of staying here. my sponsor at the time said, ""don't you fall in love because you'll never come back."" and she was right. [laughs] ",971
"504","doc 739","so, when i came here though the fellowship was so immature. very cliqued, almost incestuous. people were all dating each other. ",128
"505","doc 741","re: it was exclusive. i don't think they understood that they were. i don't think that they were intentionally that way. but just because they had all--it was really tough. i hid out in aa for a while, and i put my toe back into na every now and again. when i was in l.a., see, you got raised by people who said, ""work the steps or die."" you know? if you were outside of the meeting filrting with some guy some female that you don't even know would come up and grab you by the shirtsleeve and say, ""recovery happens inside the meetings."" and would drag you into the meeting and sit you down next to her. and then she'd put her arm around you and say, ""hi, my name's so-and-so, here's my phone number."" and would adopt you. it's like, ""i don't know you. who are you?"" but she'd adopt you. ",788
"506","doc 742","i can remember my sponsor getting a sponsor and her saying, ""we're all going to coffee. come with us."" and i said, ""okay, i'll meet you there."" she said, ""no. no, come with us."" i said, ""i have a car. i'll meet you there."" she said, ""if you get in your car by yourself you will not come."" she said, ""we'll bring you back to your car. it will be okay."" it was different. it was different in the sense that people adopted you. you just became--and then you were expected to adopt others. you called each other out on your bullship so to speak. our basic text says we are each other's eyes and ears. if we're not going to be that why do we need a fellowship? if we could do this on our own... ",690
"507","doc 743","but here--i move out here and you're all so 'minnesota nice.' it's like what do you mean you're not going to say anything? you mean you're going to minnesota nice these people into their grave. i'd hear people relapse and somebody would say, ""oh, i saw it coming."" it's like, ""really? what did you say? what did you do? how did you address that?"" that did not exist in the fellowship here when i got here. very minimally. i kept coming, kept coming back. finally, i was sponsoring a gal in aa who was--she was a professional, and she worked in an oral surgeon's office and was sneaking drugs from the oral surgeon's office and replacing it with saline. poor people they were issuing it to. she couldn't stay clean. she couldn't stay clean. i said, ""you're never going to stay clean talking about alcohol. you have to go and be where you can relate with other people. as pretty as you are and as sophisticated as you are, you're a hope to die dope fiend. you are in denial of that."" i brought her to a meeting. it was a brand new meeting and had been started by some young folks, i mean seventeen or eighteen year olds. they were so excited that we were there, so welcoming and all of that. i thought, you know, this is what i remember na being like. so, i started coming back more regularly. just decided to be the change, you know. i would go to aa to get fed, and i would go to na to give what i had. until na here became strong enough that i could do both in the rooms of narcotics anonymous. it has become that. ",1516
"508","doc 744","i had a really lovely compliment. i have a number of sponsees and i said, ""okay, i have too many of you to do all this. we have to do a group."" we started a group to work through all the steps. this was about a year and a half ago and we are just finishing step twelve. we are in this little group and there's just--it started out about nine of us and there's just about six or seven of us still. i said something about something and the comment back to me was, ""but you've left a legacy here."" and i said, ""a legacy?"" ""yeah. you've taught us and we've taught our sponsees."" she said, ""i mean i know that it isn't just you alone that created this legacy here, but you're a big part of it of a very small handful of people."" and that is the sad story that at thirty years clean where are my peers? they've gotten well? i don't know. they've died? i've buried a lot of people. clean and miserable? i still go to meetings. i still can still service. i sponsor. i have a sponsor who has a sponsor who has a sponsor. i believe in this. i believe that--you know our message is hope and our promise is freedom. freedom from active addiction. that is my story. na gave me hope when i thought there was no hope. they loved me when i didn't know what it was to be loved. i certainly didn't know how to give love. i've learned that it's not about what kind of a friend i am. expectations. why do i have expectations? why can't i just accept things to be the way they are? well, that's a character defect that i have, so if i want that to stay in it's minimal status i have to go to meetings to remind me that that's who i am, and that my thinking gets skewed. so i'm not so disappointed. ",1677
"509","doc 745","that relationship with my brother at, i don't know how long ago it was, must have been fifteen years ago, maybe longer. he called me and said, ""i need your help."" who is this? he says matthew, his son. wanted by the police. ""if i don't get him out of here he's going to go to jail. he's got an addiction problem."" he sent his son to be with me for a while. matthew has some mental health issues and he's not so much an addict as he is mentally not sound, and he's been able to accept that and seek the treatment he needs for that. it's really broken my brothers' heart. my brother called me, and his son went through some treatment and my brother went to family group and called me, and he says, ""is this robin?"" again, he didn't call! and i said, ""yeah?"" he says, ""look, i need to tell you something."" i said, ""what's that?"" he says, ""i need to tell you i'm sorry i wasn't there for you when you went through treatment. i didn't understand. i should have been there for you. i said, ""okay."" he says, ""alright."" ""is that all?"" he goes, ""that's why i called."" ""okay. bye."" ""bye."" [laughs] and he hung up! i balled like a baby. my husband came running up the stairs. he thought somebody had died. i said, ""you don't understand. my brother gets it. he gets it that i'm not a bad person."" that was really phenomenal. ",1313
"510","doc 746","my expectations of my brother was that i would call him and expect him to be an asshole. true to form he'd always be an asshole. my [unclear] said to me one time, ""have you ever thought about just calling your brother and saying he's probably going to be an asshole. i wonder what kind he's going to be this time."" and just make it kind of a game. what started happening was i stopped reacting when he would be an asshole because i'd go, oh, yeah, there he goes. instead of, ""he doesn't love me! what's wrong with me that he's doing this!"" it was just like oh, there he goes. what happened from that was that he didn't have to change. i changed. i changed how i saw him. he had to defend us. he had to knock my dad out at fourteen years old to keep him from beating my mother. he is who he is. what's funny is that he has changed in regard to how he relates with me now. he didn't want to be an asshole. he couldn't understand why whenever we'd get off the phone i'd be crying. so who wants to talk to me when all i'm going to do is cry and he didn't understand how he was hurting my feelings or any of that. when that stopped he was able to not put his foot in his mouth so much. so those things changed. those are lessons i would have never gotten if i hadn't opened my mind to it's all about me. it may not be much, but i'm all i think about, you know, kind of a deal. ",1372

"512","doc 748","re: yeah. i'm a do-it-yourself sponsor. i will not put more into your recovery than you're willing to. i learned that one the hard way. i've had sponsees, new people come to me, say, ""i want you to sponsor me. i need somebody who's really tough like you."" if i sit next to one of my sponsees they'll laugh. like, ""she is so not tough. she's not tough. she's not going to kick your ass. she's not going to do any of that. she's just going to be there for you when you need her. i can't get it to you. that whole you can't lead a horse to water. you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink kind of thing. i'm not even going to lead it to water. here it is. you're all grown up. you want what i have to offer you've got to be willing to do what i did to get it. otherwise you'll never have it because i'm not doing anything different than my predecessors. ",869
"513","doc 749","i met my husband here. he's in recovery. he's got two years more than i do. he had left and been down in minneapolis and moved back at the same time i moved here. he got a--was volunteering, was running an aftercare at miller-dwan when they still had their program. he was in school for his master's in social work and was an in-take counselor--or a, not an in-take counselor. what do they call it? anyway, he was a trauma counselor for veterans with ptsd. he is a veteran with ptsd. combat vet. we met because i volunteered there to do the same thing. new each other for a year. dated for a year. lived together for a year, and we've been married since 1993. my daughter came to me when she was seven and she said, ""what am i going to call rob?"" i said, ""what do you mean?"" she says, ""well, you're getting married."" ""yeah."" because he proposed to her and me. she said, ""you're getting married so he won't just be rob anymore. what am i going to call him?"" i said, ""kaitlyn, you've got to figure that out for yourself."" she came back in a little while and she goes, ""i can't call him dad because that would really hurt my dad's feelings. i'm going to call him 'pa'."" she still calls him pa. her friends call him pa. ",1216
"514","doc 750","when i went to move to leave california i had fifty-fifty legal and fiscal custody so i really wasn't supposed to take her out of state. i couldn't find tim. he was out there using. my mother-in-law had died. it sent him over the edge. when she was three--he got full fiscal custody because i was in treatment and he had no legal record that he was an addict. then, i had visitation when she was fifteen months old. then when he was three he decided to go into treatment so i got her full-time and he had visitation. he had relapsed, and then his mother died. he felt so guilty that he just went off the deep-end. i didn't even know where he was. about a week, maybe ten days or so before i was--i mean i was packed. i was ready to go. i got a knock on my door and it was him. he says, ""i need help."" he was septic. he had blood poisoning all through his system. his arms were like popeye arms. they were all swollen. i kept him well. gave him money and kept him well until we could get him in some place. he got in. he came to my going away party. signed the papers to let me take her. i forced him to sign the papers. [laughs] and he's been clean ever since. i think i have four years on him, and i always let him remember that. [laughs] we're very good friends. we made a decision at that point in time that we were both from broken homes, we're both from being made the rope in a tug-of-war between parents and we refused to do that. he has come to stay with us every christmas. my husband and i and kaitlyn would go out to visit him and so forth. two years ago he decided--he was fully retired--he decided to move back here, so he moved to duluth. he can't stand it. he's leaving, but at least he got a couple years with his daughter and be her dad. that's been really good. she's had three parents. she says she's had three parents to raise her. ",1852
"515","doc 751","we've done well, and again i think that's because we all come from the same process. we process our feelings through the same steps. when he's irritated with me he can go and deal--it's his problem. it's really not my problem. when i'm irritated with him it's my problem, not his problem. i get to go and process that and then bring it back and try to talk about what we can do different or whatever. it's made it work. and now my daughter is in recovery because our stories weren't enough. she had to have her own damn story. she never saw any of us loaded. never saw us use. all of my friends are in recovery. she knew clearly about addiction, and she got hooked on meth at a young age. she is thirty-one now i think and has four years. she's our area chair. she sponsors people. she does all the steps. i guess the family that uses together can recover together too, right? we didn't use together! i wouldn't say that, but you know what i mean. ",948

"517","doc 753","re: we can recover. there is hope. it doesn't matter why you come. if you don't come you won't hear our message. if you don't hear the messge you don't know that there's hope. i think that drug court has done society a great service because they allow convicts to find a way out that they didn't have when i was younger. that stigma once an addict always an addict runs deep. it's nice to know that women are coming out of their shame. for some reason society accepts males as addicts easier than they do females. ""good mothers have their children. what's wrong you that you would use?"" those kinds of things. a lot of shame attached. it's not about that it's legal or illegal. it's completely irrelevant. completely and totally irrelevant. maybe if they put as much into anti-drug wars or the fighting the legality of it as they put into education and creating fellowships before people have addictions. that might be a cool thing. it's not happening at church. and that we come from all walks. and that our anonymity isn't about protecting our last name. it's about being the same. it's about it doesn't matter if i get here in a cadillac or on the city bus. it doesn't matter. we're all the same when we walk through the doors. that's why our anonymity is important. it doens't matter who we are out there. it matters who we are in here. i'm just another addict. good luck with your project. ",1395

"523","doc 769","ll: she got remarried when i was probably twenty i think, which unfortunately was to another alcoholic. that marriage did not last very long. maybe a couple of years. then she swore she would never get married again and she hasn’t. she is just this wonderful lady. positive attitude. very, very strong, but i think that’s where i get my optimism from and my positive attitude. i try and look for the good in things because i could very easily spiral down.",455

"526","doc 775","ll: i know! so that’s what i did for a while and went out and had fun with my friends. we did the bar scene back then, too. just had fun. i was working at a bar called hog’s breath up on rice street, do you know where that is? it was packed every saturday and anyway that’s where i met my husband. but, it wasn’t until i had my second child that i really took a look at my life and said, “okay, i have two young children here. what am i going to do?” he was bartending too and doing construction. i started going to school for nursing. ",536
"527","doc 777","ll: it is interesting because no, i had no idea i would be interested in the healthcare field. after i had ryan—would work different shifts. i just wanted to be home. i love being a mom. i just wanted to be home with my kids. i didn’t want to miss anything. i opened up a home daycare. i did that until ryan was in first grade, jenna was in kindergarten. ",355
"528","doc 778","while i was doing home daycare was when i went through school. i would get up before the kids would come in the morning. i would study. i would study during their naptime, and i would study at night. i would lock myself downstairs and tell keith, “you have to watch the kids.” i was very driven and i wanted to get a’s and do my very best. ",340
"529","doc 780","ll: i went in the evenings and he was home with the kids. it was very tough because i went part-time until i went to st. kate’s and was in the nursing program. you have to go full-time evenings. i think just being with the kids—there are always sick kids, and nurturing them, and figuring out what they had. that led me to nursing. ",332
"530","doc 782","ll: i started out, once i graduated back then, you could only work in nursing homes. i started in a nursing home but quickly moved to—they call it a sub acute unit. patients from the hospital not quite ready to go home. i think now they call it transitional care. i just loved that. i remember one guy with an open chest wound, that’s why he was there because his wound wouldn’t heal. he had open heart surgery. it was open and we had to clean it with triple antibiotics and pack it and i just loved it. there are some people who just couldn’t do it. i knew i wanted to go into med surge. i quickly transitioned and went to hudson hospital at that time and worked on the med surg unit.",685
"531","doc 784","ll: yeah, post surgery. anything really can come into a med surg unit. that hospital was really small so they cross trained you in every area. i wound up working in the emergency room, which was funny because i ended up working with an er doctor that i went to school with. i remember looking at each other and i’m like, “are you butch?” and he’s like, “are you lori?” it was really funny. from there i went to regions hospital because i was really interested in working in a bigger hospital. started working in the er there. that was after i had had my third child. worked in the urgent care for our clinics and then the hospital and i was working like the 5:00 pm to 1:00 pm shift. then transitioned to ob, which i worked up until three years ago. because i had a back surgery so i can’t go back to nursing. i could, but not on the floor. which really bums me out because i love patient care.

"532","doc 786","ll: i work at the isnt department with computer programs for, i don’t know if you have heard of epic, but it’s electronic healthcare. everything is electronic. and anaesthesia for the surgery. it is still really fun and allows me to apply my nursing because they need nurses and physicians—all kinds of people to take the clinical piece and bridge a gap between technical people who are just focused on computers. it is nice because it gives me another avenue to apply my skills and still have that connection with healthcare. i would love to go back to nursing. i miss ob nursing.

"534","doc 790","ll: yeah. i’ve ended up having another surgery since then. i have had two within the last four years. they said you probably shouldn’t go back. some of these women who have c-sections and they are three hundred pounds and you have to lift them and help them. but, you know what, i love my job that i’m doing and someday—even if it is phone triage—i love the education piece of the nursing, and that is why i loved ob i think.

"537","doc 796","ll: well we were—i say ‘we’ as in me and my husband—we were very invovled with our kids. that was our focus. i come from a family of five and i wanted to have a big family because i just loved it. it was so much fun and that’s what i wanted my kids to experience. that was our focus. if someone wanted us to go out to dinner or do something, which was it good or bad? probably not—we needed our time alone, too, but if there was something going on with the kids we did that. whether it was sports or swimming or girl scouts, whatever. plus, it was fun. i’m a really outgoing person and i like to sit with the other moms and chat. you know? so, it was, that was our time too.",674
"538","doc 798","ll: yeah, yeah. so, we always were very involved with them. always very honest with the kids. very open. there were some times when you are too open: “quit being a nurse.” we would talk openly—",193
"539","doc 800","ll: ryan and jenna are a year apart. ryan and jenna were in the kitchen and we were making something to eat and ryan’s friend zach who lived right up the street was sitting here. we had started talking about, oh, in class they were learning about health and sex education and they were in high school and talking about diseases and all this stuff. i said, “that’s very important. you need to wear condoms. you want to make sure you are ready. you don’t know what is going to happen in the heat of the moment,” and zach is beet red. just beet red. tall and skinny and curly, curly hair and he is laughing hysterically. i’m like, “what is so funny? do you guys not talk about this at your house?” he is like, “no, that is why i love being over here!”",748
"540","doc 801","so, we were always open and we still are. we always told the kids, “don’t worry about the consequences about something. if you are somewhere and you are drinking and you don’t feel safe—i don’t care if you are in duluth, i don’t care—we will get you a ride home. always reach out to us.” but kids, they don’t. and we always told them there will be consequences based on what the action was and the outcome, but know that you can always call us and we will be there for you. ",474
"541","doc 802","but even as the kids got older—the kids when they were younger, ryan was just going on nine and i had wilson our last son. for years there were—it was funny because when i told the kids we were pregnant again ryan said, “oh, that’s it. i’m never getting to disneyland.” so, when wilson was a year and a half and ryan was nine and a half we took all the kids. when they were younger we did so much as a family. when they got older into junior high and then high school that’s where you could see the definite separation between the older two and the younger two. ",562
"542","doc 804","ll: four, yeah. jenna is my only daughter. she is twenty-four. cal is twenty. wilson, our youngest, is sixteen. ryan would have been twenty-five. you could definitely see the separation. then it was harder because they are teenagers and they wanted to go off with their friends. the younger two, we were still all involved in sports and clubs and groups. you know what? i was the mom, too, who i always knew—i thought i knew—where my kids were. what they were doing. who they were with. i was always the parent that as they got older i would call and find out, talk to the parent where they were going if they were invited to a party or a pool party or whatever. “who is going to be there? how many chaperones?” all of ryan’s friends knew, his friend’s moms would call me because they knew i would do it. even wilson now, he’s like, “mom, you do not have to do this!” i’m like “wilson, i will do this up until you are eighteen! i want to know where you are!” ",959
"543","doc 805","i’m probably a little bit overprotective. controlling, yeah, which i have learned i have no control over anything. except for what i eat and what i wear. [laughs] we just were involved with our kids. ",200
"544","doc 807","ll: ryan was in his junior year at tartan. jenna was a sophomore. we suspected he was smoking pot, but we never had any proof or anything. one night i came home from work and i was nursing so i was working the evening shift. it was like midnight and i heard something downstairs, so i thought, “oh i’m just going to go check.” he was smoking pot downstairs. that told me if he is comfortable enough doing it in the house, he has been smoking for a while. at that point i went and got my husband up and we dealt with everything. i wasn’t naive enough to think that was it and he was going to stop. ",597
"545","doc 808","after the third time of him getting caught downstairs we got him into an outpatient treatment at new connections in st. paul. it was a thirty-day treatment where he actually went to school there, too. it was all day long. after the thirty days he went back to school and finished out his year as a junior. the whole senior year was really uneventful. ",351
"546","doc 809","at that time jenna wasn’t doing anything. in fact, jenna was dating this big jock in high school. she was a volleyball player. they would go to parties and they would come home and i’m like, “you guys just left an hour ago.” “well, there was drinking there so we left.” and i was like “good job.” anyways, it was really uneventful. he was about twenty when he moved out with his girlfriend camille. yeah, i think he was twenty. anyways, everything was fine.",457
"547","doc 811","ll: he tried college a couple of times. actually, just wound up stopping going, which frustrated me. if you didn’t want to go you should have just come and told us. now we are $4,000 now are considered f’s because you didn’t go. we did some kind of petition thing because he was really depressed at that time, too. all this was happening at the same time. we got him on antidepressants, which he refused to take. he didn’t like putting pills in his body, which is interesting in the way things panned out. ",506
"548","doc 812","he went back, tried again, and just didn’t like it. he actually job hopped from then on quite a bit. he, though, is very talented. he taught himself how to play the drums, the guitar, the keyboards. he did photography, painting, drawing. that was when he was the most content. that is what he wanted to go to school for. we said, “well, let’s try that.” and he just never went back. when he was living with his girlfriend we suspected that there was some pot smoking and possibly other stuff. we confronted him and he’s like, “you know, don’t worry about it. i’m on my own.” ",575
"549","doc 813","we never really thought anything. no legal troubles, he’s working. then we started to see it decline in his girlfriend. he would ask us for money for rent because he couldn’t hold a job. in hindsight now, looking back, you can see the progression. one day she called me up and she just said, “you know i just got off the phone with ryan. he’s at the apartment. i’m really worried about him. he’s saying that nothing matters anymore. he doesn’t want to live.” ",459
"550","doc 814","so i call him up and he sounded really bad. i must have been off that day. i don’t even remember. i went over to his apartment and noticed that he had some cuts. to me, that was just a cry for help. whether he was really trying. we are not going to ignore this. i convinced him to go into regions er. it was during that visit that they found benzos in his system and narcotics. ",378
"551","doc 815","we would find out that he took from me after my back surgery.",61
"552","doc 817","ll: pain meds. so, oxycontin. no, oxycodone. i went to look for him and sure enough they are gone, and i don’t know how many were in there. i had it after back surgery and only needed so much andn i didn’t lock them up. i didn’t think we had to. so, whether he had been using them before and realized i had some or realized that’s what started it. i don’t know. he went back home because that was at the end of november, and i think it was the end of december, january, he was like, “you know what? things are very stressful. i haven’t found a steady job.”",556
"553","doc 819","ll: nope, this would have been—because he graduated in 2009—must have been around 2012. so, he was fine for a long time after that. after he graduated from high school. went on a long time. a couple years. but, so anyways, he said, “can camille and i and the dog,” which is a 120 pound sheep dog, “move in until we can get caught up on stuff?” i said, “sure, as long as you are doing it for the right reasons. you will get a job.” and, his girlfriend, i always loved her. she comes over every once in a while. and the dog, everybody loved the dog.",547
"554","doc 820","at the end of that time—they moved out in the end of january—i noticed that you couldn’t even have a conversation with ryan. he was so, he was moody since he has been out of the womb. that’s just the type of kid he is. but really, really moody with john. lost a lot of weight, looked pale, was sick a lot. i never expected, you know—we question, are you using anything? never thinking heroin, but you know, are you using narcotics again, or what is going on here? so this went on for a while.",492
"555","doc 822","ll: no, don’t bother me about it. he would get really irritated. he would leave. so, he would get sick of it and he’s like, “i’ve had enough of this. i’m going to move out.” he moves out with his buddies. we don’t want—we want to make sure. “i know you are in a bind, too,” and i said, “you’re welcome to stay here until you can find a place.” ",344
"556","doc 823","so, we loved her. she was just a really good gal. but, so shortly after that, he had brought laundry over for me. we dropped him off and some of his buddies picked him up and i thought i would do the laundry, and that’s when i found the needle. i was like, “what the hell was going on?”",286
"557","doc 824","so, i call camille and she’s like, “you know what, i can’t get a hold of him either,” because she was trying to get to him through a friend of his. through that phone call they suspected he had been using as well, which i found out from him later as well. they actually knew he was using. and you know what? they didn’t know what to do. they are twenty-two. they flat out said, “we’re coming up with a plan. there were three of us that were going to take him against his will and take him up to duluth for a week.” ",515
"558","doc 826","ll: their brains aren’t developed. they don’t know. one of his friends really had a hard time, brent. he has been over here a couple times. the more he comes over the more he divulges. he feels tremendous guilt, and i understand. two of his other friends were just over here two weekends ago and they sat here for four hours talking. these are twenty-four year old men that wanted to talk to, you know, it was so much fun. tears and stuff, too. i think it’s good for them to talk, too because it helps them work through their guilt. ",533
"559","doc 827","at that point, when we found the needle—i don’t remember all the details because you are just in crisis mode. we took him into the er. we took him into st. john’s at that time. i know he had to be going through withdrawls at that time. he was still actively using. an er doctor was going to discharge him. i went to go to the bathroom and told the er doc, “how can you discharge him? he’s going through withdrawls. you did testing. you know he is using something. you can’t detect heroin. it comes up as a narcotic. if you discharge my son here, he will probably die and i will hold you responsible. i don’t care what you have to do.” they went in and talked to ryan and put him on a seventy-two hour hold. i had left because he was so irate and upset. i figured the best thing to do was just leave for a while. i get a call from my husband. they are discharging him, and i couldn’t believe it. i couldn’t believe it. ",918
"560","doc 828","i wound up going there before they discharged him. we came up with a plan, talked to a social worker. the social worker, after talking to him, she said, “he needs inpatient treatment.” i’m like, “yeah, and the er doctor was going to discharge him.” they tried to look for a bed. as you probably know there is nothing. i think hibbing was the closest one, and we couldn’t get him in for three weeks. we took him home, helped him go through withdrawls. watched him the whole weekend. then they called up and said, “we can get him in. we have an opening in outpatient treatment at st. john’s. would you like to do that?” well, “sure,” while we continued to look for a bed. well after about two weeks, we wound up getting a call. he was going to outpatient treatment. he seemed to be doing okay, very emotional though, crying a lot, which i thought, “okay, he is working through things,” but he was still using. so, he wound up in the er so sick from withdrawals. so, they said we need to kick him out of teatment because he has been using.",1036
"561","doc 830","ll: yes. when all that stuff happened when we found out he was using it around june. it must have been 2013 now, yeah. again, there are no beds open anywhere. so, we wind up going to, what is it up the road here? i can’t remember what it is called. canvas health. so, he’s in an intense inpatient treatment in the evenings so he can continue to work his day job, which he did have a really good job at target. and aa meetings. ",427
"562","doc 831","so, that went okay for a while. then, in october he relapsed. not relapsed, he was continuing his using. at that point i called up st. john’s again and i said, “this is ridiculous. we need to find a bed for my son. i don’t care what i have to do.” i sat at this counter and called every ficken inpatient facility. i mean even outside of minnesota. trying to find, and there are no beds. ",387
"563","doc 832","so, anyways i was just frustrated. i wound up getting ahold—at this point i didn’t even care if our insurance covered it. i wound up getting a hold of hazelden. they actually had somebody leaving and they did have a bed. they didn’t have anybody on the waiting list, which i found was odd. it is me sitting here. everything happens on a friday where you are like, “i need to get through the weekend with my son.” you are so anxious as a parent. they did a phone interview with him. did a phone interview with me. we got him in on monday for a chem dep [chemical dependency assessment] because nobody would take anybody without a chem dep assessment. trying to find someone to do a chem dep. quite frankly, heathpartners, we have good insurance. i know the ins and outs, and still it was a battle.

"564","doc 834","ll: i knew who to call. i knew the back door numbers. like you say, you are in crisis. i feel so bad for parents who don’t have the resources or the knowledge because i felt like i was on my own trying to deal with this. ",221
"565","doc 835","anyways, we wound up getting him into hazelden. by this time it is like mid-october. he was in, of course, only twenty-one days. quite frankly at that time i didn’t understand heroin. i didn’t understand the disease of addiction. i didn’t realize how severe this was. i wish to god somebody would have said to me honestly, all these counselors—and he’s at hazelde! the best place. one of the best places. i wish they would have said, “if your son does not find recovery it’s not a matter of if he’ll die, it is when.” that’s harsh, but—and quite frankly it’s all in hindsight. would i have been more frantic and anxious? i don’t know back then—",644
"566","doc 837","ll: i don’t feel like we were given enough resources. i was googling stuff.",75
"567","doc 839","ll: we did. we went to the parents and siblings. it was a four day—i asked all the kids to go. jenna was furious at the time. she didn’t want to go. i didn’t find out until later, the first day she didn’t go. then i just begged her to go. she said, “do you know why i don’t want to go?” i said, “of course not.” she said, “he had dealers calling my phone to get through to him. i have had enough, mom.” she was upset with him, too. i said, “you know what, jenna? this is a reason you have to go.” we all went, and it was very beneficial. we all learned a lot during that four day time. just even talking to other parents. it was very good. ",640
"568","doc 840","but i remember sitting down, too, in that group where we had to introduce ourselves and i couldn't even speak. it was just a flood. i was crying so hard i was heaving. but i wasn’t the only one. it was very good. it was beneficial for the kids, but looking back now they were just so angry at ryan because of what the disease was putting everyone through. our focus was on ryan for a year and a half. this is the time where jenna was out looking for places to live. we should have been giving her some of our time. cal was graduating from high school. we should have been looking at colleges. wilson wanted to go to creighton, a different high school because he hated tartan. it was unfair to them, too. they didn’t have any of our time or attention. if they did we were so stressed out. we couldn’t focus.",806
"569","doc 841","he was there for twenty-eight days. then they discharged him to home. during this time we went up to visit him, too.",116
"570","doc 843","ll: he was at plymouth the first time, yes. they thought at his age he would be better with teens and young adults. you could tell every time you went back to see him he looked healthier. his sense of humor was back. he was laughing. he was interacting with us. he was having fun. he gained twenty-five pounds i think when he was there. twenty-five pounds in a month. he just looked really good. ",396
"571","doc 844","he was discharged. it must have been early october when he went in and it was early november now. within three days i noticed again what was going on. confronted him about it. ",176
"572","doc 846","ll: he’s at home. later, we would find out that he used the same night he came home. he had it stashed somewhere in the house. we called up. he went back into hazelden for a two-week time frame. this time he went to center city. we got discharged from there and—",262
"573","doc 848","ll: at that time they had put it on the one that starts with a b—",65
"574","doc 850","ll: yes. he was on that while he was there. he was discharged with vivitrol. they gave him the vivitral shot before he left there. we were responsible for finding a place. he did go to iop, intensive outpatient program, but because he wasn’t going consistantly, he ended up getting kicked out of there, too. they give me the vivitrol. they are like, “you are a nurse. you can administer it.” i asked the counselor, and i said, “do you know anything about vivitrol? if i give this to my son while he is actively using he could overdose and die.” i’m like, “you have to do a urine test first. i don’t have a urine test at my home.” again, here i am in crisis mode. ",663
"575","doc 852","ll: it’s on me. yes. it is ridiculous. i called up our clinic in woodbury. he went in with the vivitrol. they sent him back home. he was super pissed off: “they can’t do vivitrol there they don’t even know what it is.” so, i called up a nurse there who wound up being very helpful. i used to work up there at that clinic. she said, “let me know what i can do to help.” i’m just balling. i don’t know what to do and i don’t have any resources. it’s ridiculous. she wound up getting us a number for valhalla place in woodbury. ryan did go there. they did the urine test. he must not have had anything in his system because they gave him the injection. he was going there for a while. ",682
"576","doc 854","ll: no, just to get his vivitrol shots.",39
"577","doc 856","ll: yes. he was doing good again for a while. again, we are talking five or six weeks because then it was january 3rd or 4th. i was at work and got a call from my daughter. she said, “my car won’t start.” i said, “is ryan home?” she said, “yeah, he must be. the jeep is here.” i said, “go downstairs and see if he can give you a ride.” within minutes and she was calling me, frantic, and had 911 on the other line. he was blue and his eyes were bugging and his tongue was sticking out and she was terrified. i just said, “hang up with me. i am on my way home. stay with 911. i will call eileen,” she’s our next door neighbor. she’s a nurse. she came over and the paramedics were here within minutes. i met them at regions.",722
"578","doc 858","ll: i do not believe he was given naloxone. by the time we got to the er he was on the monitors and everything and i had to constantly remind him to breath because his respirations would go down to ten… six. the alarm is going off, beeping, and no one is coming in. so i know how to work the freaking alarm so i’m silencing it. finally, i go out and i’m like, “do you know his alarm is going off constantly because his respirations are six? i have been silencing the alarm.” she said, “don’t do that.” i said, “well no one is coming in.” just the whole experience. ",565
"579","doc 859","we wound up leaving him there that night on the advice of doctors and counselors. they said, “you guys are enabling him,” which is hard for a parent to hear. but it was true. they are like, “leave him here. this is probably not the first time he has overdosed. he needs to figure this out and you need to leave him here. he needs to figure out his own ride home.” my husband and i left. that was when we were in january when it was twenty below. it was terrible. ",463
"580","doc 861","ll: the er providers. not a counselor. an er provider and the nurse. this nurse was wonderful. we had been in the er before. they find out it's addiction and they treat you like crap. i don’t care. this one was really was empathetic. she was just like, “i’m sorry. we see this a lot. the best thing you can do right now is leave him here.” it was heartfelt. monty and i came home and he showed up when he got discharged. i found out when his friends came over two weeks ago. that it was mike was the one that gave him a ride home. i had no idea.",545
"581","doc 863","ll: yes. i had packed a suitcase and left it by the door. he thought he was going to stay here. i said, “ryan, you can’t. i have everything in this suitcase. i don’t know where you are going to go.” monty and i were up all night. we were sick to our stomach. it was frigid. people die in that! he wound up staying with a friend that lived over there and after two days he called and said, “can i please come home?” i said, “under the conditions that you go back into treatment.” and he did at hazelden. ",503
"582","doc 864","here is the other thing, too. i didn’t know that we had other options at the time. you are in crisis mode and you go to whoever has a bed open. i don’t feel hazelden was the right place for him. one reason was because they follow the twelve-step, but they are very faith-based. we’re spiritual, ryan was spiritual but—we went to church when the kids were little, but cramming that down his throat. but i didn’t know. i just didn’t know. he got discharged from that one. i said to the counselors, “i don’t know where he should go. i feel like he is using at home. he shouldn’t be coming home.” my husband and i were not on the same page through this whole thing.",661
"583","doc 866","ll: no. he didn’t want him to go to inpatient treatment. he thought ryan and him could do it through aa meetings. ",114
"584","doc 868","ll: no, that ryan would go. but i started going to al-anon after the first time ryan was in. the first four or five meetings, i would go for ryan. then at the sixth meeting i was like, “oh my god i’m here for me.” i learned a lot about myself. a lot of good skills to use on ryan. ",281
"585","doc 869","in fact, ryan had said one time, we were in the kitchen, you know how they tell you to talk about the: “i feel, i think, i need.” i started doing that with him. he knew exactly what i was doing because that’s what they learn. he said, “i don’t like how you have been changing.” i would not argue with him. i would give him a reason, which is really hard. you have to practice this. ",382
"586","doc 871","ll: i tried to get my husband to go. i said, “the skills i’m learning are working on him. i’m not going around and around in these argumentative circles like you are.”",167
"587","doc 873","ll: yes. it was just funny though because we both stood there and laughed, ryan and i, when he said that to me. i knew it was working and i needed to keep going. we would go on saturdays. he would go to aa and i would go to al-anon. ",233
"588","doc 874","end of january until around may—he was sober for a long stretch of time. him and his girlfriend had come back together. he said, “i want to make dinner for someone tonight.” and i said, “oh, okay.” because she cut all ties, even with us. she changed her phone number. she wanted to have nothing to do with it. i give her credit. she needs to be strong. i said, “okay.” and he said, “i don’t have any money.” i’m like, “oh, shit.” i go, “i’m not going to give you cash but here’s where my credit card is. you can take it and go to the store, but i need a receipt.” he did. he went, and here i walk in and it’s camille. my heart was just—i was so happy. they got back together during this time. he was really trying. he loved her so much. i kept telling him i said, “i know you do but you need to do this for yourself. i am worried that you are back in a relationship and with her. not that we don’t love her, but because you’ve got a relationship with her and you know her you could get right back there faster. you know what i mean?",1032
"589","doc 876","ll: using. yes. because she just loved him, too. i can’t believe she did not see what was going on.",99
"590","doc 878","ll: no. i found out later again that yeah, they would have friends over, they would smoke pot, they would take pills. ryan wound up getting way out of hand. she didn’t tell me. it was around may i think that we started noticing again. we had sat ryan down after they got back together and i was like, “here is the deal. here are all our concerns. if camille suspects anything she will confront you. she will tell me. i will confront you. we want to support you in your recovery.” he was all for it and everything, but it was around the middle of may that we suspected he was using again. i found out later that his friends, i don’t know what friends, dropped him off in the er. outside of regions hospital because he had overdosed. ",732
"591","doc 880","ll: i don’t know the details. left him there. the reason i found out was because i got an ambulance bill because even at regions the er cannot go outside of the building and pick up the patient. you have to call 911, which i have been in that situation before. where there is a guy outside regions having a heart attack and we had to call 911. something about legal—that was may 15th. ",385
"592","doc 881","we had suspected again so got him back into hazelden again in june. this time there was a big change in him. he did not want to be there. he was not getting anything out of treatment. he was so depressed. it was terrible going up there. he was angry. it was over fourth of july weekend that camille and i went up there to see him. i talked to his counselor and said, “he’s different. what is the plan for him?” he’s like, “he’s got to want to do this for himself.” i’m like, “i’m sick of hearing this. i’m telling you my son is going to die. you’re telling me that my son needs rock bottom.” i was “like rock bottom is death.” i couldn’t. ",639
"593","doc 882","as a parent that is the one time i did lose all hope. i was hopeless. i was sick to my stomach. he was mad at me. we got into an argument. i started crying. i left. finally he came with camille and i was crying and i just told him, “ryan, this is hard for me, too. i am sick to my stomach. i am worried. i am scared to death of you.” he even said too, “i am sorry. i am too. i am scared too. they are weaning me off of suboxone.” he was going to go to a sober house because we told him for sure he couldn’t come here. ",518
"594","doc 884","ll: yeah. because of that we are trying to sneak around and find a doctor that gives suboxone and i said, “ryan they will test you positive for suboxone and kick you out of the sober house.” it is maddening. that is a risk we were willing to take until we had time to find somewhere else. monty went and picked him up on monday when he was discharged from hazelden. he brought him over to the sober house. he was so pissed off at us, he didn’t want to talk or anything. monty went to help move him in. that was just how ryan was. he would get really pissed about something and after a day or two he would come back and talk rationally about stuff. that’s just the way he was, so we didn’t bug him and tuesday night he did call me. we talked through things and he was like, “will you bring me my blanket and pillow and some differnt things from home?” his favorite licorice. “i will come over after work,” because i was working in st. paul then and the sober house was very close. ",980
"595","doc 885","i went and picked him up and we went grocery shopping and talked about things. he pointed out over there in st. paul, i don’t know if you know where it is, it is an old brewery they were converting into artist’s studios. we would talk about the future and he did seem a little bit agitated. i asked him if it had something to do with his girlfriend. she was in wisconsin dells with some friend and it was the first vacation she had ever taken in her life. he was jealous because there were guys there, too. i know. i’m like, “she needs to go have fun, too. she is working through this. she is sticking by you. she loves you. you have to understand that. you have to let go. she needs to have fun.”",697
"596","doc 886","we went back, dropped them off. he took his stuff. i just remember, this is just hilarious, i just gave her a super huge hug and he just looked so good. i tell him i loved him and how good he looked and he was like, “shh, the windows are open the guys will hear you!” i was like, “i don’t care!” i pulled away and part of me wanted to just take him out for dinner or something. i knew he was agitated. i know ryan, and he just needed time. i called him up and i’m like, “oh, i left the licorice in the car,” and he was like, “oh, i’ll get it tomorrow,” and i was like, “i’ll stop by after work tomorrow.” ",605
"597","doc 887","that thursday i had a lunch in mears park with two of my colleagues and we were walking back and i got a phone call from a st. paul police officer. he said, “can i come to your work?” and i’m like, “why?” all this stuff going through my head. he said, “well, your son ryan overdosed.” i said, “okay, he has overdosed before. where is he? what does this mean?” he said, “can we just come to your work and talk?” i said, “okay if this has anything to do with my husband or kids you have to tell me right now.” that’s when he told me.",531
"598","doc 889","ll: yes, they actually came to mears park and met me and drove me to my car. part of me so still—july 10th it will be two years. i am angry at hazelden for discharging him to a sober house where 1) they won’t let them have medication, and 2) the sober house was going through a transition of house leaders. yeah, which did worry me. they told me at that sober house, we talked to the guy, the lead that was leaving, and for an hour on the phone. every kind of detail he could think of. he had told me that during the week the guys have to be out of the house from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. they need to be looking for jobs. whatever. which i thought, “that’s weird. how do you hold them accountable? are you doing drug tests when they get back?”",739
"599","doc 891","ll: he overdosed at the house on thursday at 11:30 am they figure. my questions is—",83
"600","doc 893","ll: his roommate who had also been in hazelden—ryan was breathing really heavy at around 10:30 am. he was probably in the process of dying at that point. he was snoring and so he left to go out in the commons area because ryan was so loud. when he came back up around 11:30 am that’s where he noticed ryan wasn’t breathing and called 911. ",339
"601","doc 894","again, why weren’t they checked on? him and his roommate, they were supposed to be out of the house. why weren’t they? i’m just pisssed because if anyone would have checked on him they would have been able to arouse him at 8:00 am when he was supposed to be out of the house. and the stupid roommate. why didn’t he try to arouse him? ",334
"602","doc 896","ll: yes. someone in the house had given him $20, which they are not supposed to do. he had a bus pass. we had gotten him a bus pass. so what they think was he took the bus, made the connection, came back to the house, and used. it shows that the heroin addiction was way bigger than he was. he did want to get sober. he even said to monty one night, “dad, am i ever going to get better?” when i would talk to him, too, i was like, “please help me understand. help me help you because i don’t understand.” he just said, “mom, it’s not just the physical craving when i’m in withdrawals. it is psychological. that is all i can think about.” i said—he was so worried when they were weaning him off of suboxone. because the vivitrol didn’t work for him",747
"603","doc 898","ll: he’s like, “the suboxone is so helpful for me. it helps with so much of the cravings.” he was worried, too. part of my frustration too is, i think him name is marv seppala. one of the directors at hazelden. i did get a hold of him and talk to him. i had requested all of ryan’s progress notes and read through everything. ",326
"604","doc 900","ll: this is after ryan died. i got all the progress notes. every single progress note was from a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor: “is at high risk for relapse if discharged.” ",181
"605","doc 901","what is interesting is the way we got in contact with him was i went to an all-day seminar. it was on heroin in the community. it was so good. but there were people there i knew, too. another director from hazelden, a lady—i can’t remember her name—stood up there and said, which just pissed me off, she’s like, “we cannot be telling people that they need to hit rock bottom. their rock bottom is death. we are now starting to use suboxone,” which they did start using with ryan when he was there. “we believe in medicaid.” ",524
"606","doc 902","when she was done and the group got to ask questions i asked three really direct questions to them. after i went up and talked to her and said, “i have to tell you i am so pissed off right now.” i sat there and talked to her and she was wonderful, she was listening and here she has a son in active addiction right now. she said, “i want you to talk to marv seppala and share your story with him.” he called me and was very gracious and very nice. we talked through everything. he said, “would you be willing to talk to these counselors?” i said, “yeah, but i want you to read through all the progress notes i read through. you can contact me and you can point out the errors. and you can understand why i’m so frustrated. why there has to be change.”",751
"607","doc 904","ll: i know. now i am at the point where i’m really frustrated. i want that sober house investigated. i want to hold hazelden responsible for not helping us get him into the right place. when i told them that i don’t feel that they know about the sober houses that they are sending people to. i’m at the point now where my grief is turning into frustration. ",357
"608","doc 905","i’ve had two years now to attend all these different things. learn about the disease of addiction itself. all these different resources, talking to other parents. a lot of this was preventable. it was ryan who needed to get sober himself. i don’t think he had enough support and tools in the places that are supposed to be—hazelden is—there are so many errors. i think with me being in the medical field and being a nurse and able to identify those—i feel that ryan was failed by the healthcare system as well. there are a lot of things that i think we can change. when i share my story i am so involved in getting change to happen.",632
"609","doc 907","ll: it is a combination. i had my second back surgery a month after ryan died. i was off—because this time i had effusions—i was off for three months. i had a lot of time to process; to educate. people gave me so many different books, which were very helpful. ",260
"610","doc 908","a month before ryan died another young man in the area had died that ryan knew. you would think that that would scare him. his mom was actually a st. paul police officer. i have since been in contact with her. another boy died. a good friend who lived in the area said, “i’m really sorry. i don’t want you to—but have you heard about so and so?” “no, i haven’t heard anything. i haven’t been on social media. i have just been isolated.” here it was a friend of wilson’s, our youngest. he played baseball with him. his older brother died of heroin overdose. they weren’t releasing what it was, but we knew what it was. she was a concerned parent, too. she was like, “something has to be done.” i’m like, “i know. i have been trying to look into this.” i had been contacting the st. paul pioneer press. the washington county sheriff, the hennepin county sheriff—anybody i could to figure out how we could get a forum. i had already been working on this. ",952
"611","doc 910","ll: yeah. i saved all the e-mails and contacts and everything, too. that just fueled me. i’m like we have to do something. i just couldn’t sit there. part of it was grief. part of it was anger. so, that continued to get me to move and as a result, got me connected with the right people. pete orput the district attorney. his two boys are actually in recovery. he fights like… i love him. he got me in touch with cheif mueller and sheriff hutton and know the truth program. that is when we stared doing the forums around here. they were only gong to do one forum, and i said, “one forum is not enough. you need to do a forum for each city.” the good thing is chief mueller has five kids that go to stillwater, and he is right in that. he knows the statistics. so he helped fight for more forums. we had one at tartan, one at woodbury—",834
"612","doc 912","ll: one at north. in the schools, yeah. i had been working with the schools, too. directly with tartan, and the head lady at the district—she was like, “i don’t know if we can have something like that in our school. we have to pay for it.” because we are in washington county she found mueller, who said, “they don’t have a choice, lori. this is my county, this is my jurisdiction. they will be holding one. we just need to work on dates.”",439
"613","doc 913","i finally wound up getting in connection with all the right people. at that time too, we were working with the st. paul officer because we were trying to figure out, okay, what all did ryan pawn? we didn’t know we were missing it until we went to go get it. we got connected with a st. paul officer, sandra kennedy, who happens to live out here. it is just weird the way it all—she was very helpful because we were fighting with the pawn shop because they were telling us we had to file charges—",495

"615","doc 917","ll: yes. i’m like, “my son is dead.” i finally called her up, just was balling. she was like, “okay, i am on vacation now. i’ll be back. you are off on medical leave right now, right?” “yeah.” she said, “does it matter what time i stop by?” “no.” she came over and returned some of the things because she searched the whole area and returned some of the things. some of the things must have been sold. i can’t find my laptop, his laptop, which makes me sick because there are pictures on there that i’ll never retrieve. she was really helpful. she told me, “you need to come to a group called survivor resources in st. paul.” it is right in the police department. there are other officers there that lost kids to heroin. one of them was ryan’s friend that had died the month before he died. that is his mom who is a st. paul officer. thank god for that group. it is other parents that have lost their kids. they know exactly what you’re going through. i feel fortunate. i’ve got very good friends, supportive work environment. we are a very close family. i have so many people to lean on. there is no way of knowing—nobody can know. these people knew and it was a group of parents who had lost their kids to either drugs or accidents. some people were twenty years out. we had more coming that were new. it helped me to know that—honestly monty and i walked around for six months in a fog. even still now i don’t remember things. i could be in midsentence and i don’t even know what i’m talking about. it is because i am still preoccupied with saving my son. it’s all that would’ve, should’ve, could’ve. just some of the things that you’re feeling that you can’t even tell anybody else because they think you are crazy. they know. they get it. they helped us get through first holidays, birthday, all that stuff and what to expect and that it is okay. it was so helpful.

"618","doc 920","each one of them has gone through trying to deal with it. we talk about ryan all the time. it is hard. sometimes we get choked up and cry but we keep him present. on his birthday they made burritos because that was his favorite thing. i told all the kids, “i don’t care what you have to do, but be here.” i just wanted everyone to say what you miss about ryan because i think it is important for them, too. it was fine—we did laugh a little bit. we were teary. we actually signed—have you ever seen those floating lanterns? we all signed it and said ‘ryan’ and it started raining and we still have it, we haven’t done it.

"620","doc 922","unfortunately cal, the nineteen year old, well he’s twenty now, never grieved ryan, which we knew. it breaks my heart because he’s my—cal is really quiet, but, very attuned to your feelings. he has been ever since he was little. just so loving. i remember one time i was pregnant with wilson and cal was like three. i was just huge, fat, i had been tired of being pregnant, and i almost started crying. i thought, “i can’t cry with him here,” and i was trying on maternity clothes. he looks up at me—and his little cheeks—and he goes, “mom, you are so beautiful.” and i thought, “you are going to make some woman the happiest.” he is one of those kids that is really quiet and he takes everything and he started drinking more and more and more. and this girlfriend he was with, she had heroin issues. psychological and chemical issues. actually, her mother it turns out, graduated a year after me and my sister. ",912
"621","doc 923","cal recieved a dui back in october. he has all those court issues then. on easter he just never comes home, which is unlike him. for consumption. call the jail: “cal’s in here. we haven’t posted anything yet because he was booked a few hours ago.” anyways, he gets a second dui. shortly after that he is up at the park at 7:00 o’clock at night with his girlfriend. she calls, she is hammered. i said to monty, “i can’t deal with this. cal is so drunk.” i had to go out in the car to get him in. monty drives his girlfriend home, and during this time cal wakes up a little bit and just unloads. we had suspected. he just looks at us with hate in his eyes. this is this kid who had—it is just pure hate. i suspected. i said to my mom, “i think he blames us for ryan’s death.” she said, “no he doesn’t.” i said, “mom, you don’t know the way he looks at me. yes, he does.” he was drunk and everything came out: “i blame you and dad for ryan’s death. if you would have let him come home this wouldn’t have happened. you don’t understand. i lost my friend. i looked up to him. i lost my big brother.” and my heart just broke. he went on and you know, “he came to me in a dream the other night. told me how much he liked my art and that i was doing a good job.” and just, god, my heart. ",1280
"622","doc 924","anyways, later that night, i had him lay on the couch. i was in here doing something and monty finally came home from dropping his girlfriend off and monty yells at me” “lori, get in here.” cal is unresponsive. i did the sternal rub and he was just flopping and i’m like, “call 911,” and monty is like, “i can’t.” just mental block from stuff with ryan. he is like, “lori, i can’t.” i’m like, “we need to get into the car now and get to the er.” brought him to the er and even as a parent i’m like this is more than alcohol. i begged the er doctor to do a drug test and he wouldn’t. and later, now we found out, now that cal is in treatment, he had done xanax that night and alcohol. had we not found him he would have died. i have yet to write a letter to the er doctor that treated him that night but—",803
"623","doc 926","ll: because cal is eighteen and he can, “well, let’s wait for him to sober up and sign a consent to do it.” again, these er doctors need to listen to the parents. you don’t know my son. i know my son. i know this is not just alcohol. part of cal’s legal stuff is he had to get a chem dep. he started going to outpatient treatment. he told them he was drinking with his girlfriend the night before. he had snuck over there to see her to bring her a little turtle that he found here in our yard. [laughs]",502
"624","doc 928","ll: no he didn’t know he would be kicked out. we had to go there and get everything and they told us. and cal is like, “i didn’t know, i was just being honest.” i’m like—",170
"625","doc 930","ll: i know. they recommended inpatient treatment. again, three week wait for a bed. i told monty i said, “i cannot watch him for twenty-four hours. i don’t have the energy to do that nor do i want to do that. i don’t want to worry.” we called his sister-in-law. she lives up in nekoosa, wisconsin out on some land up there in the middle of nowhere. that is where he went until his bed was ready. he has two cousins: one six months older and one six months younger. his cousins would come down here and stuff. they haven’t seen each other for a while, but that’s where they went. someone called us and said, “we are able to get him here earlier.” i said, “okay he is up in nekoosa. we need three and a half hours, more than that, a day to go get him.” and yeah, so that’s where he stayed. i can’t lose another son and go through this again.

"626","doc 932","ll: i pick him up on wednesday, it will be twenty-five days. they would only do twenty-one days. i know. that’s another thing—",126
"627","doc 934","ll: he’s twenty. he turned twenty in april. again, i have huge concerns. when i was talking to him on the phone, i’m like, “they are discharging you on wednesday? that’s not even…” he thought it was twenty-eight days. i’m like, “that’s not twenty-eight days.” i go, “cal, i’m really worried about you,” i said, “i’m really worried about you coming home.” he wasn’t getting liquor here at all. he would get somebody to buy it for him. his counselor said, “i’m not worried about him coming home because that’s not where he got it.” he said, “you guys don’t want to have liqour at home.” i said, “you can’t hang around your friends. they all drink. not to the extent that you do. casual drinking, on the weekends. you can’t be around that. i don’t think you are strong enough. i think eventually you will get there.” his response was, “mom, you don’t worry about it. you don’t have anything to worry about.” ",905
"628","doc 936","ll: i told his counselor. i said, “that’s a red flag to me, and it should be for you, too.” if he was ready to come home he would have said, “mom, don’t worry about it. this is my plan. i don’t plan on hanging out with those guys for a while.” whatever. here i am frustrated. right now i could see cal going either way. i don’t think he’s an alcoholic. i think after ryan’s death that caused it to get worse. i think he’s at a point right now where he could go really either way. as a parent i can’t. we told him too, we’ll support you in recovery. my husband and i are consequences—",583
"629","doc 938","ll: we talked to the counselor: “you have a very supportive environment. he understands this is an addiction and it was more powerful than ryan. alcohol is more powerful than him right now. they had him write a letter to ryan, which he read in front of the whole group. it was very—he just let loose and was very emotional. they’ve already gotten set up to go to intensive outpatient treatment. i guess we will just support him into his recovery. it is really hard for us because i know the outcome. some people say, “oh, alcohol is not as bad.” yes it is. yes it is. ",568
"630","doc 940","my poor sixteen year old. he has been through so much and seen all this. now he is sixteen and he’s going places. i’m like, you know, i go through the same things. call parents and everything and he is like, “mom, i’m not going to do drugs.” “that’s what ryan said, that’s what jenna said, that’s what cal said.” three of my four, you know? he goes, “mom, i’ve already been to parties where they have offered me that and i just say no.” i’m like, “oh my god, wilson, i’m so proud of you for doing that.” ",504
"631","doc 941","but, quite frankly i think for myself when i was a teenager and that’s a thing you try and get across. i had a picture of an addict—this woman wearing a bomber or whatever. that is not it. these kids come from really good families. they are with these friends and their friends have done it. they feel safe, they feel comfortable. goes out the window, you know? i was that age, too. thank god that that didn’t come because if my friends were doing it and those were my good friends and i trusted them and was with them all the time.",532
"632","doc 943","ll: yes. it is so scary, you know? it’s not just our kids. it’s grandma who went in for knee surgery and got hooked on vicodin and didn’t wean her off of it and now she’s buying it from—it is anyone. i have hope and i’m optimistic. i’m trying to raise awareness and help change some of these things within our own healthcare organization, at hazelden, at these sober houses. especially for medication assisted treatment. if there is something out there that will help them. we both thought that would’ve helped my son. we weren’t given the chance. whatever we can do to try and prevent it and bring awareness. even the symptoms for other parents—",646
"633","doc 947","ll: for a parent to know all of those signs. the flu type symptom, the nodding off, long sleeve shirts, spoons missing. i couldn’t figure out where the frick—i would go to target and buy spoons because… ",203
"634","doc 948","that is another thing about cal because that night when he was drunk—he has talked about it in counseling. he feels tremendous guilt. looking back he knows he drove ryan to dealers’ houses. because ryan said, “stay in the car i’m just going to run in and get my phone charger that i left here,” or whatever. he also saw ryan taking spoons and knew what he was using them for and didn’t tell us. he feels a tremendous amount of guilt, too. i want him to understand that even if he had told us that wouldn’t have changed the outcomes. the disease was bigger than ryan. ",567
"635","doc 950","ll: oh yeah. i think for me—the avenues i have taken of speaking out, being involved, and trying to make change happen helps me. it’s my therapy because it helps me continue to fight for my son even though he’s gone. i look back now and monty and i always—god if we would have—we were ready to mortgage the house to put him in the hazelden fellowship inpatient program for three months. but then we are like, “okay, we spent $40,000. is that really going to help him? and what is that taking away from the rest of the kids?” it is such a dilemma. we think about that, too. if we had gone and went to a different sober house. if we had identified the symptoms sooner. if we—again it is so out of our control. ",708
"636","doc 952","ll: you still feel that way.",28
"637","doc 954","ll: if i had stayed and taken him out to dinner that night because i recognized that he was agitated. would that have prevented him from getting the money, going on the bus? it is all that stuff. you drive yourself absolutely crazy. ",233
"638","doc 955","i never used to have anxiety. i have tremendous anxiety now. i am still thinking about ways that—what could i have done? it is frustrating. your emotions are all over the place. there are times where i feel ryan now. i used to hate it when people would tell me that because i’m like, “i don’t.” ",295
"639","doc 956","i dream about him, i feel him now. i can feel happiness. there are days, too, where i see cal’s pain and i think god dang it this disease is still affecting our family. i am angry at ryan for dying. we were supposed to work through this together. i never know where i’m going to be when i am going to break down next. if i smell him or hear a song i completely lose it. it is just—our lives still seem unmanageable. not to the extent that it was when he was using, but we isolated ourselves back then because we didn’t want anyone to know, or we were exhausted, or we never knew what was going on with ryan. we still do that now. we don’t care about the same things. the things that mattered before don’t. ",706
"640","doc 958","ll: nope. don’t have the energy. it’s not that we don’t care. it’s just that it’s not what matters anymore. i don’t know. it is weird. it is hard to explain. some of the times even going to family functions shortly after ryan died. i’m like, “you guys we are going to go. we are going to cry. it is our first holiday without him. let’s time box it. if we stay for an hour and we just really need to get out of there, that’s fine.” my family understands. that is kind of how we are now, too. we go out and do stuff but you will be sitting having dinner at a restaurant and someone will start crying. that’s okay. let’s just go to the bathroom. we will finish our meal and leave. ",678
"641","doc 960","ll: yeah. whenever i speak at those forums there are always parents that come up after and they are like, “thank you. this is what i’m seeing and at least now that i know i’m not alone and there are other resources.” i’ve had other parents contact me and say, “you know what? my friend so and so—this is what they are dealing with.” ",333
"642","doc 962","ll: yes, absolutely. at health partners they did a story in our newsletter and it goes out and it hits 25,000 employees. just the comments that i got on there, through social media. they said typically they get like five hundred to nine hundred hits. they had over 20,000 hits. that tells us. i’m like that is what i’m trying to tell people. people know that people are suffering but then people may not know that their neighbor is going through this. a big part of it is the stigma and people won’t talk. ",506
"643","doc 963","i mean that is another thing. we hid it from our family for six months. i have a very close knit family. the first time we would make excuses and the second time he went in and i was like, “ryan, i need support, too. i told grandma and my siblings.” he almost went white. you could just tell, even for him, it was such a relief to not have to hide this. everyone sent him letters. i think the way he thought people would react to him was just not. ",448
"644","doc 964","that was good, too, and that showed me that quite frankly the people that are going to support you are going to support you through anything. it doesn’t matter what it is. the people that don’t and are uncomfortable. some people at work. i recognize they can’t deal with it. they avoid me and that’s okay. i’m fine with that. there are people that come up and say, “i don’t know what to say. i just want to say i’m sorry.” it is odd. death is odd. especially for a young child. ",478
"645","doc 965","so yeah, it has helped me. it has really helped me with my other children, too. in fact, the other things that don’t matter to me—i sepnd more time, not that i didn’t before. we were so busy running running running. the counselor. when i went up to cal, when i went out to family, i could only go a day, not the four days. i had to write a letter to him and he had to write a letter to me, and he hadn’t told anyone that his brother had died. after i read the letter, everybody was crying. the counselor came up, and i said, “i know you are struggling with your brother’s death. this has a lot to do with it. i know you hate me and blame me and that breaks my heart. if you can deal with that the rest of your life and you are sober and can deal with your emotions i will take that.” the counselor came up and said, “cal, i didn’t know your brother died. you didn’t share that with any of us.”",893
"646","doc 966","there were eight of these guys and he said, “how many of you are in here for heroin addiction? cal, i want you to talk to these guys. i want you to try and understand for your brother.” he said to him, which shocked me, “your brother did not die in vain.” it caught me off guard, too. he goes, “lori i’m going to tell you something.” because cal had to read his letter to me, too. it was very apparent that he looked up to ryan a lot. i didn’t realize they were as close as they were. he said, “if he looked up to ryan as much as he did it was just a matter of time before he would follow in ryan’s footsteps and eventually tried it. he may have saved your life, cal.” and all this time i had never, ever, ever thought about having another child at—it didn’t even cross my mind. ",779
"647","doc 968","ll: use. because they looked up—i don’t know if that would happen, but it scares the hell out of me. it was interesting. every time i attend anything i learn something more. i attend whenever i can. ",199
"648","doc 970","ll: no. in fact, i went back—for me it is probably just some mental thing but i can’t go. i went back once by myself and hated being there because when i had been there ryan was in the ambulance. and my two friends that i had met through hazelden wanted to go there, too. they were like, “will you go with us?” and i was like, “sure,” and i can’t go back. ",356
"649","doc 972","ll: no, because it is a different group—but anywhere. survivor resources is good for me, which i should go back to. i can’t go back to al-anon. i know it is probably a mental block. i really do, but i can’t. i learned good tools there but it’s just too painful for me. because ryan and i would laugh after at al-anon. do you go to al-anon?",339
"650","doc 974","ll: i don’t know if nar-anon does it, but you would put a little saying out and they would pull it out and it was just funny because ryan was telling me on the way there that i was such a perfectionist. i said, “maybe i am but i have to be in control of things because otherwise, for me, i feel like things aren’t getting done.” there are certain things. that thing i had read that morning was something about you can’t control—something about perfectionists. i go here and i handed it to him and we both started laughing. he was always telling me, “you work on your program, i’ll work on mine.” it’s just that. it is too heartbreaking. you know we should have still been doing that. no, life had a different course. i can’t go back, but i did learn a lot.",756
"651","doc 976","ll: i still feel that i am a terrible mom because i couldn’t save my son. that is a thing i have to work through. i’m like, “did i do something wrong? is there something  i could have done better? am i a terrible mom?” my poor daughter she is like, “stop, mom.” i just will always doubt myself. that there could have been something i could have done for him more. i could have understood him more. i could have spent more time or spent more time with him in his art stuff. there is always going to be that. ",507
"652","doc 977","as far as the other kids i pick my battles more. i realize that some of these little things truly do not matter. but the things that do i am going to confront you on it. there are going to be consequences. i just told them, “you have to understand that i can’t. this is the way i have to deal with things now. because of what is happening. i can’t help it.” i said, “call me on it.” in fact jenna, monty, and i were sitting in the kitchen just last week and we were talking something about cal and i was talking a mile a minute and jenna was like, “good god, mom. settle down. you are so hyper,” and i was like, “am i? i don’t…” so you know that is fair. call me on it because i don’t understand. ",697
"653","doc 979","ll: i’ve tried to, yeah. i think it is important. i don’t know what else to do. i’ve let go of some control because i know… part of it is i’ve let go of control, but i’ve set expectations and i’m trying to follow through now. we lacked that i think with ryan, which is unfortunate for the other kids too because it is like, you know—",333
"654","doc 981","ll: for sobriety, for honesty, if i am asking you to do something i want it completed. i am holding you accountable. it is hard because one day cal was standing in the kitchen and he came home sometime after his second dui. i checked his eyes, i checked everything: “where were you?” everything. he even started crying. he’s like, “mom, please don’t do this to me. i’m not ryan.” it just broke my heart. i realized that i am interrogating him. i’m not coming from a loving mother it’s coming from fear. it is hard to keep in check. you know, i do my best. that’s all i can do. i have slowed down a great deal since. i was that mom who was involved with everything with their kids. doing all the right things ",708
"655","doc 985","ll: i know. it is interesting that you even say that because even just now sitting here talking with you i have these other mothers that come to me and they are exactly like i am. they have done all the same things. yet i tell them, “you know what? you are a good mom. it’s not your fault. it’s out of your control.” isn’t that funny? but it is hard. i will always feel that there is more we could have, should have done.

"658","doc 991","ll: i can’t think of anything. i mean we just miss him dearly. there is a huge, huge, huge, huge void. it is weird because you want to say you feel that presence that he once had here is completely gone. you knew when he was here. he was harassing his siblings, he was loud, he was obnoxious, he was funny, he would always try to get a rise out of you. he was always playing his guitar. there is just this silence. it’s just hard. i feel bad for any parent who has to go through this. not even any parent. any family. and the friends. when his friends were over here the other day i get it that they are struggling, too. thank you for taking this on, too. i had a really nice time sitting here chatting with you.",712

"673","doc 1020","when i see that impacted in my nuclear family—extended or otherwise—that’s a real frustration for me. fortunately my birth children are pretty good for the most part. they grew up with the same thing as i did as far as their understanding of marijuana and knowing it was around and not having a push one way or another. i certainly did not ever sit down and smoke with my kids until they were adults. once they were adults and were making their own decisions—that was a different situation. my oldest daughter is going to be thirty. i’m not going to dictate what she does or does not do. she’s a big girl now. one of my children is completely sober, one hundred percent, and has no desire to ever use. it is just a spectrum of things. i go from a standpoint of transparency and honesty and i’m not going to bullshit around. i may not be willing to admit some of the things i’ve done, but i’m not going to deny them or lie about it.

"674","doc 1021","i have been an only child for the first ten years of my life and i was very secluded. my mother would go party and do things like that so i would spend a lot of time alone. then i got these two sisters i ended up taking care of. not long after that i started having my own children. my youngest is now twenty and in the last year or so i have gotten to a place for the first time in my life when i have actually been able to worry about me, outside of the normal mom and kid stuff. i’m fully responsible for myself and it is incredibly liberating. now if i could just get the rest of them to stop taking my money, time, and energy i’d be in good shape.

"675","doc 1022","overall i’ve come out relatively unscathed and have learned a hell of a lot. it has been quite the experience. now i’m working with my children. a great example was my daughter was going to go pick up my alcoholic stepdad last night from the rez and bring him down. she looked at my wednesday night and said, “i can’t do it. i talked to him and he is buzzed up and i just can’t deal with it.” she loves her grandfather to death. they are very connected, but she has now been able to establish that pattern and see that she can just go with him and have fun, but she sees the consequences and understands the impact of it. we talk about it. we have talked about it with him now because part of it is unlearning our enabling behaviors of the past. ",746
"676","doc 1023","the interesting thing for me was when i was in my second marriage and working at dis [department of information services] in the hiv field part of my responsibility was doing training around hiv systems and we incorporated methamphetamine because it was such a big deal. we had expertise from mia weber who was at the methamphetamine resource center, and she came to do the trainings with us. as i was dealing with all this stuff personally i was also getting education professionally, so what is interesting to me is that my two lives have taught me —my personal life and my professional life—in this role have collided unbelievably over the last ten years or so. that’s kind of a benefit when we are talking about the opioid issue because i already have experience with the other epidemic crises in my opinion and have had those conversations and dealt with personal things that you have to reconcile. i think it takes a lot of strength to do this work. if you have any of your own internal baggage it hampers that. i’m grateful that i’ve gotten to do some of that and can be more clear headed.

"678","doc 1025","so many people try to silence the issue, for example the opioid response. everybody is talking about the opioid response. to my point exactly, “fine. get somebody sober. then what the fuck are they going to do?” especially if they are dealing with issues of sexual orientation or identity or any number of things. how do you talk to them in a way that says sobriety is the way to go? and these are the reasons why. all on top of the physiological effects it has on your brain. so you already feel like shit and then you want to say, “oh there is a better life” and i am realizing that as i talk to my younger children that are millennials.

"679","doc 1026","in addition to the whole epidemic of abuse there is also this whole thing understanding that this ‘adulting’ thing sucks and what is the benefit? why do i have to work my ass off to pay bills and accomplish nothing? there is a whole different ideology going on with this group of people that are younger. if they get hooked into that messaging about using and it makes them ‘feel better’ i believe we are going to have an even harder argument because they are already saying, “this grown-up thing is fucked up. why am i working my ass off to not accomplish anything or not have the things i want? you have raised me in a society where i am going to get everything i want at least information wise and all of these things are right at the tip of my fingers, but this work thing means you don’t see progress all the time.” if i hear one more person say, “i don’t like doing that.” when did we ever get to say we don’t like doing something? are you kidding me right now?

"680","doc 1028","mm: absolutely. across the board. i think everybody is looking for their buzz of choice. part of it is about access and part of it is about history. with the extended family my stepsiblings grew up with my alcoholic stepfather, who i love to death, and their mother who would take anything. she liked to inject anything. we found a needle in their couch fifteen years ago before this was even on the radar. that whole community of folks—there are a lot of people who are episodic users. i carried that woman, not literally, but in her wheelchair, to treatment, three different programs. i remember specifically being at the er at hcmc [hennepin county medical center] and saying, “what is your drug of choice?” because i let her get shit faced before i took her in. that was the only way they were going to take her. she didn’t answer the question so i answered for her and said that she was an opportunistic user. vodka is her drug of choice, but she will take anything. she said, “that’s right!” ",998
"681","doc 1029","my point is that when you get to that level where you just need to be inebriated it’s not going to matter what it is. she was doing pills. one of her best buddies that was using at that point in time was a woman my age that i went to school with and she's actually a couple years older than me. she was on the verge of dying. she is on an oxygen tank and has been for years. my stepsister a year ago had heart valve replacement surgery and now has a pig valve in her heart. she’s forty-two years old and has no teeth. no one in that part of the family has teeth. my twenty-two year old nephew is waiting to get dentures and is so emaciated and so out of it. not only that but he can’t maintain sobriety. he was in a halfway house here and got caught using k2. it’s not about making good choices, it’s not about going back to that to get the buzz, it is “this is what i have access to and what is available.” ",908

",874
"684","doc 1034","there are many people i know who have hiv who have gone to treatment to attain sobriety and they get released and are homeless. if you are going to release someone and they are homeless how do you expect them to not get triggered? dhs has changed rule 31 a few years ago to include hiv training and education. we had a conversation with them a few years after that and i talked to rick moldenhauer and i said, “do they talk about sexual health in groups or any treatment?” “the programs might or might not.” “when you get out of treatment one of the first things you probably want to do is get laid. if you’ve never gotten laid without being high then that is a trigger for relapse. is it not?” a light bulb went off in his head and he went, “oh my god.” ",755
"685","doc 1035","we started doing hiv and chemical health systems trainings based on that. the training that was developed went along with the matrix model that the state uses in doing assessments and things like that so that people could understand the correlations between different levels of use and their sexual risk. that has not necessarily been successful in the long run because it is a whole other area of expertise that the counselors need to have around hiv and sexual health. and there is the reluctance to have those conversations, yet it has been identified. all of those corollaries and those triggering factors relate back to it which is why i think there is such a deep connection in those two fields of work that go very hand in hand.

"690","doc 1042","anyways, i made a decision at that point that i knew i could come back to minnesota and raise my two children, i was by myself, and i had family support and friends and other things. we moved back here and moved to the cities because i knew it was going to be more marketable for me to get a job. from there we just rebuilt our lives. my first husband subsequently followed us here and we ended up having our third child together, and then finally called it quits. after that we tried and tried, but he had a hard time not having more than one relationship at a time. it doesn’t work when you have three kids.

"696","doc 1051","mm: we are actually celebrating our twenty-fifth anniversary this year. i am super excited. the organization was started by a woman named linda brandt who saw a need for services for people living with hiv in greater minnesota. she actively worked to start building these networks. the network model, while it may still not be exactly as she envisioned, i think we have retained it in spirit. what i love about it is we are regional. all of our staff with few exceptions live in the communities they work in. they understand what is available and how to access programs there. they also, for the most part case managers in particular, already know resources and services available. they have a broad array of experience that they brought with them. some of them were working in mental health in the past doing case management, some are experienced in the [wyvern] system. they all have this different breadth and experience that they bring with them. ",951
"697","doc 1052","i just recently wrote a proposal where i figured out that even though we have some fairly new staff to the agency collectively we have over seventy years of experience working in hiv and providing services. i probably am a little bit off in that estimate, but that’s what i can safely say and that makes me really proud to understand that we have the breadth of experience that spans twice what the epidemic has been around for, which i think adds value. it makes us able to be scalable in our responses that are related to the same group of people. i challenge that a lot of the clients that we work with are folks that other systems are connecting with on a regular basis; people that are dealing with substance use, people that are dealing with mental health issues, people that are homeless and experiencing a whole lot of other health related disparities. ",861
"698","doc 1053","part of our hiv work has included hepatitis c, primarily testings, but we took it to another level because that was highly unsatisfying for staff. we are really more actively working to connect people who test positive to care and follow them for a little longer, even though that falls outside of our grant parameters, because that is how we do business. we are about relationship building and meeting the needs of the individual. there’s nothing worse than giving someone a diagnosis that they are unfamiliar with and then just walking away. i don’t know if it is statewide, but i believe it is, our positivity rate for hepatitis c is thirty-nine percent, which is kind of off the charts. we are one of the highest in a community based setting that there can be. we are getting results. we know we are working with the folks that are impacted. the wonderful thing is we are not testing people positive for hiv at that same rate. in fact our hiv rate is incredibly low, including the population of people that chooses to inject. our syringe program we are not identifying people that are hiv positive, but we are identifying hepatitis c. we know that our hiv prevention efforts are being successful.

"699","doc 1054","i don’t know if you are aware of this, and maggie can confirm my statistics, but approximately fifty percent of people who inject acquire hep c within six months of beginning to inject. my mother in law, or stepmother that i mentioned earlier that i took to treatment was hep c positive. not a big surprise. she got tested in a methadone clinic, so it wasn’t great, but it was just another little extra-added layer because she chose to keep using, so of course her health wasn’t what it could have been. i’m pretty sure she never got treatment for it. i am digressing and going back.

"700","doc 1056","mm: right now we have offices in mankato, st. cloud, which is our central office and main location, moorhead, grand rapids, and duluth. all of those locations for the most part we offer prevention and care services. they usually have a prevention worker and a case manager so we can represent both sides of the hiv spectrum. duluth and grand rapids are split where care is in grand rapids and duluth is prevention. we are probably going to be adding some more here and there.

"701","doc 1058","mm: we are funded primarily through federal and state grants. a lot of it is federal pass-through money. all of our case management programs are funded in white funds. we get state money from mdh for prevention related work, which includes a small carve out for some syringe supplies. that is the one contract where our syringe program is specifically listed under. as long as we are using state funds they can pay for the supplies. as you know there is a ban on federal money being used for syringe supplies. it is ludicrous. they loosened it up a year ago where we can actually buy staff time with federal money for the syringe program, but we can’t buy supplies. it is just goofy.

"702","doc 1059","this dhs proposal that is out right now and due for submission next week is a grant that is based on the cures act [21st century cures act, 2015] money that was released last fall. it is an attempt to really respond to the opioid crisis. the interesting thing, like i was saying before, was that group that we work with that is pretty much reflective of a bunch of different areas, and because of that a couple of years ago we were asked to start distributing narcan, some people call it naloxone, for opioid reversal. when we got that grand we started diving into that area a little bit more. they already have that exchange so it made sense and was a great fit for there. ",674
"703","doc 1060","the next year we added on statewide distribution, so now we have narcan in all of our offices and all of our staff have been trained to distribute it and train others in its administration. now we have been able to take that statewide and because of that dhs has recognized us as an entity to work with moving forward with the cures grant money. they have applied for over five million dollars a year and we have been targeted to receive a big chunk of that. the intent of that would be to expand our intent services because my goal since i walked in the door has been to have services all over the state. basically replicating the program we have in duluth, which i think i am going to say publically is the gold standard. i believe it is. we have more hours than any other program that i am aware of. we are open thirty hours a week on average. we create an environment where people can come in. i provide socks, mittens, gloves, and blankets for everyone because staff will meet these clients where their needs are. some of them don’t have access to water because they are homeless, so when that happens we get them water. ",1126
"704","doc 1062","mm: yes. and maggie and james are really great. they just started it as an after school program, and it really does make sense. in the middle of winter there is a pot of water going for people to have hot tea. sometimes folks have been roaming around all night, or whatever the case it. it is one place in their lives they can interact and not have any judgment passed on them. they can come in and have their needs met, sit down for a minute if they need to, get a cup of coffee, sometimes there are other treats. the staff have collected and they have boxes of all the little shampoos and personal care items. we collect those from hotels when we stay and donate them back to the program because sometimes—you wouldn’t believe what a little bottle of shampoo or conditioner can do to somebody. we go to the dollar store and pick up little bottles of nail polish and stuff like that because sometimes that’s the most interaction where somebody has had where they are treated like they are any normal person. it is amazing. ",1024
"705","doc 1063","what i love about it is when i go up there and work, whether i am covering or just hanging around, i am almost invisible. they don’t recognize me as somebody that’s not there everyday because they get the same level of treatment and that is what they have been acculturated to. they are just as open and offer sharing with me than they are with any of the other staff. it’s really interesting to see that dynamic at play because it proves to me that we have garnered a lot of trust.

"706","doc 1065","mm: not deliberately—i walk around with this because i was so impressed. this is a survey that i just completed a few months ago. apparently it is done pretty regularly, but they had missed it in ‘14. this page is talking about syringe distribution specifically in ‘14, but it was very limited questions. that was page one. it was just our basic detail and information. this is just some demographics. there is a specific page i am—right here it starts into distribution.",471

"711","doc 1076","what i can tell you is that i have a picture on my phone that i can’t share of a mom and her baby. the mom was driven to treatment by maggie, when she found out she was pregnant, the baby and her are both fine. they are together. the baby is thriving. they came in on her first birthday to play with steph. i am getting goose bumps. maggie didn’t know who it was until she heard her voice. when she heard her voice and when she recognized her and knew who it was because she had changed so much and mom and baby were doing amazing. we know of two moms and babies that have successfully been dropped off at treatment and are still together. we hear outcomes here and there. steph stopped tracking the number of reversals that they were getting from narcan because it was so depressing. in the first roughly three months that we were doing narcan distribution there were seventy-five reversals. that means that seventy-five people that might have died that we had a hand in reversing—those numbers were too staggering to keep track of. i think they had program fatigue. understand these folks—maggie’s background is an artist.

"714","doc 1082","mm: you may have heard this before, but there are some fabulous program staff that are not necessarily the strongest people on the admin side, and that’s kind of how you want them. in fact that was part of my conversation with maggie this morning, “you guys need to shore up your admin stuff because you’re not reflecting what you’re doing.” they had just found a stack of papers that had never gotten entered. i had said, “your numbers are not accurate because we have been on an upward trajectory the whole program and we are down. your numbers are wrong.” it’s that mom with the eyes in the back of your head thing. i tell them all the time, “you guys! i know, see, and hear everything. if you think you are getting away with something i find out about it!” so the same with the numbers and then poof, two months later guess what? “oh, we found the papers!”",860
"715","doc 1084","mm: in light of the current political situation, particularly with so many people in power that do not necessarily believe in sexual health education and the importance of that, i have started thinking strategically that because the opioid response was one of those things that is so neutral and truly bipartisan because so many aspects of society have been impacted that we might have to step back our really visible hiv and hep c work approach and really focus more on our opioid work from a political stand point moving forward. ",532
"716","doc 1085","so far what i have realized is our composition did not change a lot with respect to the actual state of minnesota. we did not get much shift in the folks that were elected, so we have been in these environments for a long time. federally, i think we are going to have a much different impact because we don’t know what is going to happen and it’s just a crapshoot. ",365
"717","doc 1087","mm: the cures money is going to explode and really help up approach the whole opioid epidemic. with that we will bring our hiv and hep c work along with us because in my estimation they go hand in hand. if i am trying to encourage people to keep medication on hand so they don’t overdose or someone they love doesn’t overdose then why don’t you get tested at the same time so we can see what other stuff is going on. part of that is being actively a part of a community and engaged in the response. again, that’s where the benefit of my staff being in these communities brings their own passion into their work in that community.

"718","doc 1088","to be honest some of them are reluctant with the narcan stuff. i think they feel uncertain about it and we have that same dynamic. our staff is very reflective. i have people that are very progressive and really have a good handle on things in a larger sense and how those things interact with each other. i have some folks that are from a small community and have the intent to keep doing that work in that community and don’t always have a broad view of the world for lack of a better way to put it. that’s a very small portion; my point is we are very reflective and represent that breadth as well. i think that is important because it is a challenge if you have someone that is not capable of doing the work at a certain level, but there is also a time when those individuals are appropriate for a different aspect. you know what i mean? it is that give and take.

"725","doc 1099","i am very much into relationship building so a lot of times it is projects like yours where we can be of some kind of assistance. part of our mission is to educate and advocate for people living with hiv and i don’t feel like i can do that unless i am talking about that very actively with everybody. it relates to all aspects of life. i just participated in an aids action day. ",379
"726","doc 1100","some of it is reconnecting with other people in the community. it is interesting because i am very connected to the metro community of providers and other folks, so i have the benefit of getting to work with them. i get to work with clients because of other work i have done in the past. i don’t get the benefit of being able to be in one of those communities all the time, so i’m not super visible to everyone we are working with, but i hope to be approachable. it’s kind of like the best of both worlds. i can literally be running from one end of the state to the other and meeting with people about various things and program stuff, or covering for them even sometimes. then at home a good chunk of the day can be spent on the phone. i don’t talk to family on the phone anymore. the last thing i want to do is make a phone call. ",832
"727","doc 1102","mm: right, or we are strategizing issues that are client related issues that come up. there are programmatic related issues. we have reporting, so i oversee and am responsible for all the staff too. i’m not responsible for all of them directly, but i supervise all the program folks and the narcan stuff because so much of that is legislation related right now and it’s beneficial that i’m in the cities because then i can just go to the meetings and do what i need to do. plus, i have my previous connections to other aspects of the world. dhs was a phone call to me saying, “do you want to distribute narcan?” because i have this longstanding relationship with chemical health area. ",685
"728","doc 1103","part of it is who i have been and what i can bring to it and i have this amazing team of people. the case management coordinator for example has been with us for ten years. we have two case managers that have been with the organization for ten years. they can give me the perspective and historical standpoint. then the leadership team helps guide my decision making on some of the bigger, problematic stuff. this expansion of the opioid project was my dream child when i started working for the organization. i said i wanted to be able to expand the work that we were doing and put some syringe exchanges in all of the offices. we methodically started doing that. our mankato location is primed and ready to go and all we need are the funds. we have the physical space; we have the go ahead from our landlord. that is the other thing—",835
"729","doc 1105","mm: it will be once we get everything going and get some funding that is tagged to be the next one. we learned that diabetics are selling their syringes to folks that are using. when you talk about the public health implication of it, it is staggering. when you have nurses coming to you and saying, “will you please open a syringe exchange?” it illustrates the need. ",368
"730","doc 1106","that is one of the places i have had staff for ten years, so she’s got a long-standing history and is very approachable and that is one of the things that is beneficial about our regional model. we connect with folks. it is really popular because people like to do the work in other areas and they want to partner with us all the time and one of the things i am very clear with is i can do a one-time event or something, but i don’t want you tip-toeing in our areas and then leaving because you don’t come back. ",512
"731","doc 1108","mm: well, like minnesota aids project will say things like, “let’s do this, let’s do that.” ",92
"732","doc 1109","a great example is there’s a syphilis outbreak right now in mille lacs, i think i told you about that, and so we have been doing these weekly events on each of the districts on the reservation. minnesota aids project was involved as well and one of the proposals someone had was they do two events and we do two events to mitigate staff time and i said, “absolutely not. we are going to be at every one of those events because they are never going to come back out here and interact with this community whereas we are. we will be at every one of them because that is an investment that we will make.” that is about relationship building. ",638
"733","doc 1110","i went and did narcan distribution at two of the events and i’m going to the fourth one next week. at the two events i gave out seventy kits. one of them was to a person that took twenty kits. the interesting thing was i was connecting with the actual people who are using and are connected to the using community. the health department has been talking to tribal folks and so the health department is a little removed and the tribal folks are very much removed, so they are having all these conversations that are going to result in nothing. what we are doing is building the relationships at the ground level and getting our name out there so that people know. it is preemptive for the cures money, so it is a colossal tax on my schedule right now, but i think it is a good investment in that relationship building and continuing to do that work, because we are going to continue giving out narcan no matter what.

"734","doc 1111","we are also working with the drug courts on the samhsa [substance abuse and mental health services administration] grant where they are doing care fares and testing with drug court participants, so that’s going to be super exciting to see how that comes out too. ",263
"735","doc 1113","mm: for testing. it is kind of a backwards way of doing it with the response. with the drug court they are supposed to be on contract. we are supposed to distribute narcan, so i was on a call with the administrator of the program on tuesday. i was like, “okay, so this whole narcan thing—we are kind of confused.” ",314
"736","doc 1115","mm: no, they don’t want needles, but the fact that they were even willing to give it out to the participants—that program is running more on a harm reduction model. they aren’t automatically kicking people out. it is a different approach. ",239

"741","doc 1132","a couple of interesting things about my background. i went to boarding school at age fourteen. i went back out east. i spent my high school years away from home. in some regards, that may have been the sanest thing that could have happened. i was a good kid, but i didn’t take things for granted. i would push my dad’s buttons and we would get into round and round discussions. i think that it was probably a good thing that allowed me to begin to see those ideas and opinions and independence which probably brought us closer when we did get together at holidays and summer were really enjoyable times. they liked to hear about what i was thinking versus the day to day stuff. ",678
"742","doc 1133","i went to college. i originally thought that i would like to be a broadcast journalist. i thought i wanted to be the next jane polly on the today show. interview interesting people. hear their stories. i quickly learned that the route to become that was not something i was interested in. i didn’t want to—by who, what, when, and where. the kind of life of a reporter. i found that i was really interested in telling deeper stories. i wanted to know why organizations weren’t talking about all these other things. they said, “oh you need to be in public relations.” i had no idea what that was. i took a pr class and the very first day of class we talked about the definition and building mutually beneficial relationships and helping organizations create understanding. and that’s it! that’s pretty much what i focused on in college and started my career in public relations. met my husband while i was still in college and we got engaged and got married right after i graduated.

"743","doc 1134","that takes me into my motherhood piece. i had been working for about nine months and i got pregnant. in 1988, ‘89, there was not job sharing. there was not flexible hours. we didn’t have email! ",194
"744","doc 1136","rm: there really weren’t any of these things. i remember going to my boss and saying, “you know, i’m not sure that i can come back full time after this baby comes.” they said, “well, put together some sort of proposal.” “what do you think?” and my daughter ended up being born three weeks early and i never got my proposal put together. they started calling me and saying, “hey do you think you could at least finish the newsletter project? do you think you could work on the publicity for this client?” i was able to freelance and be a mom. it was pretty incredible. baby one: ‘89. i was freelancing a little bit part time. mothering, young mother at age 23. three years later baby two came along in 1992. ",707
"745","doc 1137","at that point i was still doing some freelance work and a lot more volunteering like in a montessori school and these kinds of things. i had an opportunity through a freelance project to go back to work full time in 1996. i did. i loved that opportunity. working full time. we were lucky to have some nannies that worked out really well for our family. and then we got pregnant with baby number three. and we said, “oh my gosh. i loved my job. let’s just see what happens with trying it this way.” so i had been the stay at home mom with the freelancing and i had been the full time mom and it worked out really well with baby number three to continue working full time and not freelance. that was in 2000. that’s kind of the motherhood journey.",745
"746","doc 1139","rm: great relationship. in fact, because of the three year difference between julia and ryan, ryan and i were really close. she was in montessori school. in the mornings, drop her off for a couple of hours and then ryan and i had a lot of one on one time together. which was really special. i think to this day we have a close relationship. we enjoy spending time together one on one. i credit it back to those early years. we would have those mornings together. then, pick julie up from preschool, go home, have lunch, naps. i would work on projects. life was pretty good. ",574
"747","doc 1140","ryan always had a good sense of humor. he was always a very mature kid. he would hang out with his older sister and her friends. he was kind of the tag along in the neighborhood. he was the youngest in the group of six or seven kids that all hung out together. the interesting thing with ryan is he was always so good natured and happy and everything. every once in awhile if he would get out of sorts or fussy or irritable, backtalking, what not. i would get frustrated and send him to his room or something like that. the interesting thing is that generally within a matter of minutes he would be asleep. or he would be getting sick. ",636
"748","doc 1141","i came to recognize when he was out of sorts he was either exhausted and needed a nap, or was, you know, an ear infection was coming on or a cold. the getting sick would maybe show up the next day or something. it was intersesting because at the time you don’t realize it. this kid is being crazy, or separation. then you would go, “oh, now i get it.”",351
"749","doc 1142","like anything you would recognize, “oh, i need to pay more attention. just because he isn’t taking naps anymore regularily i need to see if he is tired.” and say, “don’t react to the behavior.” so fast forward, i wish that had been in my mind. hindsight. i can say, “oh, we missed some things. but they were there.” ",316
"750","doc 1144","rm: i think when he would, he got into high school we started to notice he was struggling around junior year. didn’t want to participate in a lot of family things. back talking, argumentative, keeping to himself, breaking the rules. not anything bad. just little stuff. didn’t seem interested in anything. he has always been such a smart kid that school was always kind of boring. we got concerned about that and went to the doctor to rule out if it was depression or who knows what was going on. even at that point my husband and i said, “do you think he could be using drugs?” we didn’t have any real, hard reason to believe it. but we weren’t naive enough to think that his behavior and his mood couldn’t be related to that. that is one example of the differences in how he is behaving. he is not the same person right now. what else could be going on in his life? he will tell us now that he didn’t feel like he fit in. and yet, he had tons of friends. ",957
"751","doc 1145","he would say he didn’t feel comfortable in all these social situations and yet he was always mister center of attention. i think there are a lot of times where your perception of yourself is not necessarily what other people are seeing and experiencing. my thought now is when there is this big gap between what one person perceives and what the self perceives, you need to stop and figure out why and what. ",408
"752","doc 1146","so, we noticed it. we tried to stop it. couldn’t get at anything. at that point he couldn’t articulate what was going on. no. there is nothing. you couldn’t even have the deep conversation to get at it!",202
"753","doc 1148","rm: we took him to a doctor. that was actually very disappointing. my husband took him. they had been very close throughout childhood. you know, boundary water trips, coaching sports, watching movies. just really lots of good, active father son time. it was my husband that actually identified it. said, “i think something is off.” i was a little more like, “yeah, you know, teenager.”",385
"754","doc 1149","they went and that ended up being somewhat dissapointing because the doctor ruled out anything physical. “maybe some family counciling would help. it’s tough being a kid these days.” my husband asked the doctor, “did you do a drug test?” and the doctor said, “i don’t think that’s what’s going on. i just think its really tough being a kid these days. he’s a good kid. just some counseling.” i don’t know if anything would have shown up at that point or not, but i am apalled that as long as they were doing blood and urine tests anyway that they wouldn’t at least check. and again, it might have come and said no, there is nothing in the system.",646
"755","doc 1151","rm: exactly. that was one of the first frustrating things. from there we did go to see a counselor. both independently and together. the counselor would talk to us and say, “yeah, it sure sounds like maybe that’s what’s going on.” and then he would talk to our son and he couldn’t get anything concrete. so, there are these two different things going on. i believe the counselor knew there was drug use, but because my son wouldn’t come right out and say it, or he always had some kind of excuse, he could snow ball or tip toe around. we had group sessions and it just didn’t work. ",582
"756","doc 1152","when we started finding marijuana and that kind of stuff then it would just get into the arguments over, “well it’s good for you, or everybody does it, or get off my back, or it should be legal.” again, it just went round and round and round. we did find evidence senior year of high school that it was more than pot. we kept saying, “this just doesn’t seem like it could only be pot.” you know? yet we didn’t—",410
"757","doc 1154","rm: we found strips of aluminum foil with burn marks in the car. took it to the police who said, “yeah, it’s likely heroin. could be meth or something. likely heroin.” ",168
"758","doc 1156","rm: this is his senior year at this point. and yeah, ask him about it. “i’ve never seen it. i don’t know what that is.” and we said, “you know what, you are responsible for other people in your car.” he would just come up with all kinds of wild things. “well, maybe someone was in my car when i was at class.” [laughs] i mean this is the type of thing. we would get into these logical things that were, you know, if someone was watching us they would be like why? there was just all these circular arguments. you would just get lost in it. so, whether it was him or someone he was with, clearly someone was using heroin. ",621
"759","doc 1157","fast forward a couple years after that when he was in inpatient treatment. he comes forward in our first family meeting and says, “i want to tell you i’ve been using opiates and heroin.” and we just looked at him and said, “yeah. we know this.” and he thought it was some big confession and he still made it sounds like it had only been a few months. ",351
"760","doc 1159","rm: at least a couple of years. if he had been using full time, or regularly, it was there. i thought back to all the times that i had found a roll of tin foil in his backpack or a roll of tin foil in the car. all those things and you are like, “it’s been there.”",263
"761","doc 1161","rm: yeah. right in front. and we knew it. but you can’t—what can you do? i mean you can do plenty. you can talk about it, you can encourage conversation. we went and got smart, we went and got knowledgeable, we found out about it. but when i say, “what can you do?” the cliche that always comes to mind is you can always lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink. and the adage that you can salt the oats. i feel like that was kind of—",445
"762","doc 1163","rm: yeah. and not even necessarily more difficult, but you can make more encouragement. you can say, “hey, we can help. college is possible when you go to treatment. we might be able to help you out with the car. we can do things.” because the drugs have hijacked his brain, even if those offers sounded good he couldn’t give up. it takes a long time for parents to, or anybody that loves somebody that is using, to come to understand that there is really nothing you can say or do that is going to be compelling enough for them to go, “this thing that i survive on, that i enjoy, or that maybe i don’t enjoy it anymore but i survive on it, i can’t give that up.” they can’t see that road forward.",697
"763","doc 1165","rm: we maintained regular contact. call, text, have him come over for dinner. we probably did see him at least once a week. sometimes maybe it was— ",148
"764","doc 1167","rm: yeah, while he was using. most of the time it was pleasant enough. as long as we avoided talking about use. or talking about going to treatment or something. we would have this back and forth between should we continue to try and talk it through and get him to see what is going on and get some help? which would usually escalate and not go anywhere. or, should we just let him know that the family is here and the home is here and that we love him, and that he is welcome, and let him know too that guess what? while he is choosing these other things right now, our life is going on. guess what, we are going on vacation? guess what, we are going to a movie. our life is still going on and you could be part of that. ",722
"765","doc 1169","rm: some of both. early on, right at the start of 2011, things had really gotten out of control. i will back up a little of the history. he had graduated in june 2010. he had a scholarship to go to college and then decided not to do that, and he was using. we had a horrible summer of running away, and being out at all hours, and sleeping all day. he was living the addiction lifestyle. we were still figuring out what was—i mean we knew he was using pot. we had found the strips of tin foil. we knew things weren’t right. we were in that sorting out period, and seeing a counselor off and on.",594
"766","doc 1170","he decided at the end of the summer that he was not going to go to college. which on the one hand was disappointing because a) he had this scholarship and b) we were excited for him to be out of the house. [laughs] he announces that he is going to go to community college and keep working his job. we are like, “then the ground rules are,” and that ended up being a horrific semester. we could tell that his… he wasn’t happy. he was always angry. he was always tired. ",468
"767","doc 1172","rm: he was living at home. i would check the mileage on the car. he would say he was going to be one place and not. during this, the counselor we were working with, our son was a tennis player, ryan did decide that he might go to school that second semester. we jointly decided that it would be good if he stayed in tennis. so, we paid for him to stay in tennis at the health club and continue working with the team. it was a very talented team and in fact was a team that qualified for nationals. some of these kids played at state and went on and did phenomenal things. he would go to practice, but somehow the miles between home and practice were a lot more than they should be in the car. we know in hindsight he was making his rounds. he would say, “oh, after practice i’m going to such and such with so and so.” of course, that wasn’t what he was doing. ",860
"768","doc 1173","we just kept catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie. for a while, it was data finding. like being a detective. then after a while you keep finding the same things and it still doesn’t make any sense. all you can say is this is addiction. this is bad.",279
"769","doc 1174","anyways, at the last minute, he did decide he would go second semester and the school said they would honor his scholarship. a spot on the men’s tennis team was still open. this is when things really—this is the turning point. we took him up on sunday and said goodbye and that week didn’t hear from him. i texted him a couple of times. i thought, you know, part of it is he needs that space. ",393
"770","doc 1176","rm: up in duluth. st. scholastica. not that far, a couple of hours. i was headed out of town for a business trip and my husband and younger son were going to come with me and spend a weekend. that morning i tried to contact him again. didn’t hear from him. the whole weekend we were in new york didn’t hear from him. didn’t hear from him. we both said you know, if something was wrong i’m sure we would have heard. ",415
"771","doc 1177","so, that sunday when my husband got home, he checked the phone records and there had been no activity on the phone. this is not good. not good. we could see some calls coming in. that night, at the hotel, i got a phone call from ryan and—let me back up. when we dropped him off for school that sunday i’m giving him a hug and i’m saying, “clean slate,” and he said, “i know mom.” he said, “i won’t fuck up again.” so that sunday when he called me he said, “mom, i fucked up again.” and i said, “what happened?” ",511
"772","doc 1178","the way it went down is that that friday night, he and the college kids had been partying. drinking and what not. drinking, marijuana, and some pills and i’m not sure what. he passed out in the snow. this is january in duluth, subzero temperatures. he was taken by ambulance to the er and then put into detox. at that point the school was trying to work with him and the coach was trying to work with him. the coach, when we had been talking before, and i had said, “you really need to keep him on a short leash. school and tennis.” we talked a little bit. i didn’t ever tell the coach what had been going on those six months, but i just said it has been a really rough six months and senior year was rough. i said, “you don’t know how much he needs to be on this team and in classes. if he’s got structure maybe he’ll find a path forward.” the coach said, “yeah, yeah, yeah.” after this had happened the coach said, “i didn’t realize. now i know what you mean by a short leash.” and again, we couldn’t control it. he couldn’t control it. but, maybe he would have gotten more than a week, i don’t know. ",1103
"773","doc 1179","so, fast forward again a couple weeks later. i get a phone call, i get home from teaching. it is about ten o’clock at night. this time it is the dean of students: “mrs. mckinney, don’t worry, ryan is okay, but i need to inform you that we have just sent him in a taxi to a hotel and we are going to put him up for a week. he has been using drugs in the dormitory. he has been talked to. he has ignored our conversations. therefore, we are revoking his housing privileges.” he wasn’t kicked out of school because he wasn’t failing his classes. talk about a rock and a hard space. you can go to school here but you can’t live on campus and eat in the dining hall. where does he live? what does he do? we’ll put him up for a week in a hotel. oh my gosh. ",751
"774","doc 1180","well, he just plummeted. at this point he is using all the time, he is not making friends, well, not those friends. depression is sinking in. he doesn’t have anywhere to go. we are trying to—is there an apartment, is there someone you can room with? he isn’t a problem solving—at all. he doesn't actually want to solve this problem at all. and then he does. he stays on the sofa at somebody else's place for a while. then, of course, he gets sick. it is difficult to get transportation to class so then he’s not going to class. by the middle of february, he’s not going to class, he doesn’t have a place to live, he has no income. it’s a disaster. ",648
"775","doc 1181","at that point, this is a long answer to your questions, i had sought out a therapist because this was a lot to deal with. i had had one appointment and was kind of describing what was going on. it was on a thursday. saturday my husband and i were going to go up and see my son and sit down and have a face to face with him. try to figure things out. so, we go up there, we pick up his stuff at his friend’s place, we have that in the car. we go and have lunch. overall, it was a friendly conversation. one of the things he had been interested in was the military. even at the end of high school when he wasn’t sure he wanted to go to college, he thought maybe he would go into the air force or do something like that. he went down for his meeting and he admitted that he smoked marijuana. they said, “okay, you have to wait for thirty days. don’t smoke for thirty days and you will be fine.” of course he couldn’t do it. he kept postponing that. another thing that had come up in high school was he looked into the naval academy. he had started the application process. he did not finish it, but he started the process. he was in the top twenty candidates. he had a high likelihood of getting accepting. this shows how smart he is.",1231
"776","doc 1182","so we are at lunch and we said, you know, you could always reopen your application and try that direction for next year. there is still time. just trying to get him to think about options. my husband had gone to the bathroom. i said get your laptop and we can pull stuff up and see what we could do. he looks at me and he goes, “mom, dad’s going to kill me. i don’t have my laptop.” and i said, “what do you mean you don’t have your laptop?” “i sold my laptop.” and then, “i sold my laptop because i had to pay some rent to the people i was staying with.” well we know it wasn’t for paying rent. ",596
"777","doc 1183","that was the, “oh my gosh.” at that point we said, “you know what? we are going to get into the car and go home. you are welcome to get into the car with us and head down 35 back to minneapolis. and that will give you a couple of hours to figure out what you are going to do. because you know what? you are not bringing this chaos back into the house.” that was crazy talk.",373
"778","doc 1185","rm: well, counseling.",21
"779","doc 1187","rm: right, because at that point we didn’t really know that that was what he needed. we didn’t quite have the handle on what he was using, how he was using, and any of that. at that point then he came back. he lived with some family friends that would benefit from some rent. we paid for him to be able to stay there. we thought close with trusted people but not in the same house where things will turn into these round and round discussions. ",444

"787","doc 1197","a couple days in, we got the call that he was okay, not talking to him, the counselor. he was okay, he hadn’t quite gotten into the groove. he was being polite, participating, and everything. we would have a chance to talk to him the next week. couple days after that get the phone call from the counselor: “is there more information you can give us, things you can share? he has got the guys here convinced that he doesn’t belong here. the guys are convinced he doesn’t belong here. he is insisting. you don’t have on here that he uses opiates. are you sure that he’s not using opiates?” i said, “well, we found the foil and i have a picture. we can send you the picture.” he said, “because he is behaving like somebody who is withdrawing from opiates. he said he insists that he doesn’t. he insists it’s just marijuana.” we are like,”yeah, see, this is what we have been up against. he doesn’t behave like someone who just uses marijuana. we found the foil but we don’t know for sure. and he never injected so there were never marks.” ",1037
"788","doc 1198","he ran away from that program a week in. runs away; no phone, no wallet. crazy stuff that happened from there. we hired a private investigator to find him. got him back to the twin cities because we thought he should at least be close to home. that was another one. we couldn’t pick him up at the airport. some neighbors picked him up for us. with the idea to find out where he wants to go. the options were go to treatment somewhere else. go somewhere.

"792","doc 1206","rm: mostly. we were mostly on the same page. we realized very early on, and we have a strong marriage, that we needed to be unified. we would make decisions together. we would talk things through. a little bit of that balancing each other out. i think some of it is probably gender. i was more of the let’s find out what is going on, let’s talk about it. my husband is more “i’m going to sit him down and he’s going to…” [shouting] i’m exaggerating, but it was really helpful that we would talk things through and support each other’s decision. ",545
"793","doc 1207","it was also important because there were also times that we weren’t both available to make decisions. for example, when he had told his counselor that he wasn’t staying at treatment. between the time he said that and the time he actually took off, there were lots of phone calls back and forth. when he finally did leave that morning, the counsellor called and said, “he left. we’ll let you know if he shows back up.” i had a major client presentation i had to go on. i could have said something, but i thought, “you know what? there is nothing i can do. my husband is on it as well. we just made that decision right then and there. in the next two or three hours if you have to make a decision, you make that decision and i’ll support you and i won’t second guess it.” ",770
"794","doc 1208","that was also a really good turning point in our marriage as parents because we continued then for several years to have those points where ideally we would both make a decision, but sometimes we had to let the other one do it. sometimes it just didn’t make sense because you’ve got other kids, other responsibilities. we couldn’t put our lives on hold every time that something crept up. which happened a lot. ",411
"795","doc 1209","by that point i had been going to nar-anon which i found helpful. i did a—called serenity summer. i did a blog post about that. i started taking friday afternoons off and i blocked the time out on my calendar and i would sit outside every friday afternoon from memorial day to labor day with a pad of paper and a stack of books. and these were things like the four agreements and buddha. i had an abbreviated version of the tallmud and i’m not jewish. and poetry books and i had been learning to meditate at that point, too. so, a lot came to me during those periods of meditation, which i never realized. that brought me a lot of serenity and peace. being able to weather what was—during that first chaos. well, it wasn’t the first chaos. during that first chapter i really did find that serenity prayer helped, being able to stop. ",833
"796","doc 1210","it was also during that period of time that being a writer professionally, or at least that is part of my job in public relations, that a paragraph came to my mind. that paragraph began the start of our young addicts and some of that writing. i think it was because in my mind i would always frame things like worst case scenarios: what would happen if i had to announce that he had overdosed and died? what would happen if we had to share things with the family? what would happen if—? i know that is a sad thing, but when you work in my field we deal a lot with crisis and being prepared with those statements. same kind of thing. i framed things in my mind in terms of how would i—",684
"797","doc 1212","rm: convey this message. so, this kind of paragraph came to mind for me around what was happening. at the time i didn’t really know that i was being told by whatever that i was getting a message to write and do this. interestingly, shortly thereafter, that’s when i ended up sending emails to the pioneer press and to renew magazine and basically saying, hey, nobody is telling the story of what it is like to be stuck in the muck.",431
"798","doc 1214","rm: as a parent. from this perspective. they said, “write about it.” and i started writing about it. nobody ever wants to be on this path. i wouldn’t wish it for anybody. i think only if you have been on this path can you appreciate what i’m about to say now. only if you are on this path can you appreciate the gifts you have gotten in any other way. the relationships that i have made, the self awareness and understanding, the life lessons, sense of gratitude, sense of—lots of things like that. i have looked back and i feel like i am richer because of it. i’m sure that is true of all kinds of scenarios with other diseases and other things. i feel like i grew through this process. i don’t look at anybody the same anymore. i teach downtown.",747
"799","doc 1216","rm: i teach public relations and communications. when i get to campus early, sometimes i will see homeless people. maybe they have stopped in the student center and they are sitting at the table, or i see somebody at the bus stop or i see a kid. i now think about them differently. where are they from? what was their childhood? what is happening in their life? what kind of help do they need? or maybe i run into a frazzled parent and i don’t know what is going on. i don’t judge them anymore because i’m like i wonder—something is happening. it is probably not about the interaction that we are having. ",605
"800","doc 1217","there’s also—i’ve noticed, and i’ve blogged about this one too—there is a silent language. i wish, and maybe through this project it will happen, more people will talk about what is going on. we were always pretty open. i wouldn’t just start telling the details. but if people asked me i didn’t shy away from what was going on. there is kinda this silent language and you will be at lunch with somebody and you will ask about their kids and you will get this, “yeah…” and they don’t answer the question. and you can let it pass, but now i’ll start being like “there was a time i used to answer that question in that way. it was because, and i’ll tell why,” and oh my gosh will they open up. they gave me a clue, i gave them a clue, and then they made a decision to either share or not share. like, “oh my gosh, that is happening in our family, or that happened in my family or that happened in my neighbor’s family. ",916
"801","doc 1218","overall—let's get to the stigma word. overall, we did not experience a lot of negativity in that realm. there were certainly some families that we would talk to that didn’t want to believe it kind of thing. or minimize it or change the subject. but, not any like, “oh, that’s the mckinney family,” or, “we don’t want to associate.” none of that. ",346
"802","doc 1219","there were people that, they would ask how are things going and they wanted to hear the “great!” or “guess what! things turned around! he’s better!” i think they would get tired of they are even shittier than the last time, and i would tell them and they would be sorry they had asked. i would get some of that. but not really any of the negative stigma persists. ",364
"803","doc 1221","rm: i think two things. with people that were in our lives at the time during ryan’s high school years, they witnessed how hard we were trying to get him help. how hard we were trying to figure out what was going on. i think they had more of a sense of appreciation. that didn’t seem to enter into it from people that didn’t know us. as i said, i think we are at a changing point now. maybe it is just the time that we came into this where there is a lot more of the, “yeah, i’ve been through it, i know someone’s been through it.” there is just a lot more, i think, acceptance. that doesn’t mean that it is better yet. it is no longer a surprise anymore for somebody to say they are dealing with addiction in their family. a few years ago i think that was still the thing. ",774
"804","doc 1222","again, i think how we talk about it matters, too. i think if we talk about our experience in honest terms then we send a really positive message and allow people to respond. if we use stigmatizing language, if we use stigmatizing negativity other people come back to that as well. or, if we don’t and they use that “they are just a useless junkie” i think we can role model or counter that. we may not be able to change them or their language or perceptions, but i think we are finding, maybe it is just a minnesota thing, we are finding that people here are embracing and being a community and talking about things. it is a much more open conversation today. ",660
"805","doc 1224","rm: overall, we worked with some really good professionals. they cared; they were good at what they did. they were what you would hope. i feel like there were enough unique things in our situation in terms of just how much in denial our son was, how much he could convince people that nothing was going on. sometimes we would get to a point with a particular professional where, “i don’t know what to do!” because he wasn’t following the model. ",445
"806","doc 1226","rm: so that would be difficult. again, one of the challenges, because he was over eighteen at this point, before we got him into any programs is that he wasn’t signing release forms. therefore there wasn’t a lot of access—that frustrated me as a parent to no end. a) we had information, b) we had insights, c) we needed to be part of the success; part of the process. sometimes i felt very shut out by that. they would say, “seems like things are going really well now.” and i would go, “really? because that’s not what i am experiencing!” it is a challenge of the system because when they are working one on one with a client they are that client’s advocate. they are not the parents’ advocate. ",696
"807","doc 1227","sometimes there is a divide between what is going on, and i felt like a lot of times they wanted to change us or make us change or have us accommodate things. it’s like, you know what? truly we’re not perfect, but up until that point of junior and senior high school there had been a good relationship and things had been going well. really where the communication disfunction happened was in the drug induced state. so, no, we were not at our best at all. that was not our main operating style. that would get kind of frustrating. ",532
"808","doc 1228","even in the al-anon world, many positive things to say about that but, okay, work on yourself. okay, cool. but i have a crisis or a chaos thing here. i have someone who needs help, i have someone that doesn’t realize they need help. they could die. cool, but i should make my list of amends and take care of my things so i can take care of myself, but what i really need is someone to get my kid in treatment and help my kid stay in treatment and help him be successful.",470
"809","doc 1230","rm: i felt like i wanted to share this experience because i knew we weren’t the only ones going through it. i have really found a lot of things elusive in terms of information. you google something and you get something that was completely irrelevant. all these places had bought up all the search terms and you look up ‘minnesota this’ and you get some place in california and you google non twelve-step and you get some place in florida that is a twelve-step. i did feel like i wanted to try to create something where people could find information and share perspectives. i don’t think there is one right way. i think that we need to know what our options are so that we can try different things. if this doesn’t work try this. if this doesn’t work try that. certainly for my son, it took different tries to find something for him. then there is the readiness side, too. it wasn’t that the approaches were bad, he just wasn’t ready.",934
"810","doc 1231","let me go back to professionals. there were two that stick out to me that were just kind of terrible. one, we had been talking with an intervention group and thinking that that might be a way to get my son to go to treatment. at the end of the day, in our gut we didn’t feel like that was going to be the right approach. in fact we thought that might create a greater wedge. we were getting hesitant about moving forward. at that point, the professional that we were talking with started attacking me and saying that i was in denial about my kid’s problem and that i was preventing him from getting better. it was—we walked out of that meeting and never looked back. i was irate. what they were trying to do, because then it was if you don’t want our intervention services then we need to get you into our family program because you need help. you need to heal your family. i said, “you know what? i’m going to al-anon, i’m seeing a therapist, and i’m really happy. and i’m doing my serenity summer, i’m really happy!” [laughs]",1027
"811","doc 1232","we had another one where, again, ryan didn’t want these traditional methods, he wasn’t interested in twelve-step. we thought you can’t force somebody into something. he had gone into this outpatient program which had a harm reduction philosophy. i didn’t entirely understand it and i think harm reduction is a tough concept for parents because we think and know they need to quit. at this point medication assisted [treatment] was not being introduced as a part of this harm reduction. it was more we will meet you where you are at. if you are using you can use and we won’t kick you out. he was taking advantage of this program. ",630
"812","doc 1233","we had had a ton of psychological evaluation that really gave a pretty clear picture of what we thought was going on in our son’s life. we gave it to the treatment program and they said they wouldn’t even read it or consider it. they said, “he doesn’t have any of those psychological problems.” and we said, “we think he might be having a dual occurring—and here’s why,” and she said, “i don’t put a lot of credit in that stuff.” i was irate that she would not even consider another professional. she said, “i can do my own evaluations.” you don’t have to agree with it, but why wouldn’t you at least acknowledge the work of a colleague? just to get another perspective on things. at that point it became a wedge between family and my son where i felt like it was them again us. that’s just not—i’m saying we want to work together. and crazy stuff too: “he doesn’t feel like you are supporting him. you should let him come back home.” we never said he couldn't come home but these are the conditions. “he says he wants to go back to school.” no shit he doesn’t want to go back to school! i finally said, “you pay his tuition? because we’re going to be flushing money down the toilet to pay tuition. he won’t go to class. you want him to go live at your house? okay fine, live at your house. you leave your wallet and purse out. you leave your son’s birthday money within grasp and you see what happens. leave your car keys out and see if the car is there.” those are terrible things to say about your own kid. ",1510
"813","doc 1235","rm: that’s the craziness. you are asking us to bring chaos back into our home. we have a younger kid. we can’t do this. there are some times—i understand the restraints of eighteen plus and privacy and releases, and part of our young addicts is that we are a community. we need to surround this young person with all kinds of things. it is not just treatment and recovery and relapse prevention. we need to surround them with love and we need to surround them with nutrition and we need to surround them with living and we need to surround them with lots of things. ",566
"814","doc 1237","rm: informally, it started with some writing that i did in 2011 for the pioneer press. that was a biweekly column. at that point i was posting as rm: real mom. i wanted to be completely honest, but at the same time protect identity. that was the best way to do it. not use any names but be completely open about everything else that was happening.

"815","doc 1238","at that same time i was interacting in an online parenting forum. there were several moms and dads and we were posting and supporting each other. the person who facilitated the forum was moving out of the country and she was going to shut it down. she said, “i’m shutting this down. i encourage you to exchange your contact information if you are comfortable.” a few of us did and one other mom and i in particular said, “we should start blogging or tweeting or doing something.” we started with a little bit of blogging and we came up with okay, these are our kids, these are our addicts. shortly thereafter she decided it wasn’t quite for her, and so i kept it up and started the tweeting and started doing more. it started out as an opportunity to take that pioneer press column and get it to a bigger audience.

"816","doc 1239","over the past two years, really, as ryan has been in recovery, i started to formalize it a little bit more in terms of, okay, i write about our experience. i have guest bloggers. started doing things in schools—conference, building resources, being more of a hub. ",264
"817","doc 1240","the reason that i continue to do it is a) our journey is not over. i think there will always be something there. more importantly, it’s about experience and letting people share their experience so others can take something from that. it’s about sharing resources. “hey here is something that worked for me.” or, “hey here is something i heard about. i never used it but maybe check it out.” and hope. i use that phrase a lot. when you are stuck in the muck you have hope, but you really have to continue to keep the hope alive. ",529
"818","doc 1241","i was talking to another mother yesterday. have you talked to gloria englund? i was talking to her yesterday and one of the things she said about grief was there are two places for it in this scenario. there is the grief when you realize your kid is going down this path and that the dreams and hopes that you had for this kid, that they had for themself, are no longer possible or are not current. and then of course there is the tragic grief when that kid passes away. i think i experienced a lot of that first grief. our whole familiy did. when the kid that we knew and loved was unhappy and in dire straits and struggling and not behaving. the behavior is a symptom.",670

"821","doc 1247","rm: our young addicts are a community of—and professionals. that is really important to me. it’s not just parents and it’s not just professionals. so, to the conversation we were having a few minutes ago, sometimes because of the constraints you can’t have that open conversation with the professional because they are working with your kid. but, you could have a conversation with another professional and get their weigh on it.",429

"834","doc 1275","i think that in the treatment programs those young people haven’t fully grown up. their brains aren’t fully developed. they don’t have the perspective on life that somebody older has. we need to see more things that begin to look at how do we help this person at this phase in their life and not throw them in with everybody else? you know what? while there are commonalities in addiction, they are not all the same. even differences in economic and cultural upbringing. i even remember ryan saying sometimes, he was staying in a homeless shelter and we would go pick him up and he would get angry because, “people give me such shit that you pick me up in this nice car and…”",675

"842","doc 1292","at that point he was so fragile and we were so concerned and the interventionist said you ought to set up the boundaries. we went the opposite direction and started saying, “do you want to stay here tonight? do you need a shower? what do you want for dinner?” he was staying home more and more often. it was a revolving door. things got to be pretty bad with the revolving door because we were back where we were in chaos. some money went missing again. it was, i think it was july 9th, he had come home, we were out, and our younger son texted us that he just came home and what should i do? we said, “let him in,” and he said, “i did and i don’t think anything is going to happen. he’ll probably shower and eat something and fall asleep.” ",741

"1209","doc 1783","a couple of general trends, if you would, were people that were coming to treatment back in the early mid-nineties still were what were thought of as single substance or primary single substance: they would just drink. or their primary thing was cannabis, or their primary thing was cocaine. today, that mono-drug user just doesn’t seem to exist anymore. today there will be a stated preference for something, but it’s not a drug of choice. it’s more of a preference on a continuum. they prefer a but they use b and or c and or d. it’s more of a question of what is available and what they can get.

"1211","doc 1785","one of the things you notice over time are trends and patterns that ebb and flow, come and go. alcohol still wears the crown, but then underneath that you see a lot of changes. where we see a lot of notable changes in particular is in age range. each substance and each combination has a different demographic. with pharmaceuticals or with heroin what used to be a forty or fifty year old age range back in the eighties now is twenty to twenty-four years old. the age of first treatment episode where the individual identifies heroin or a pharmaceutical opioid is about half what it was twenty, twenty-five years ago. the primary presenting client is much younger. depending on what part of the state you look at there are specific concentrations for heroin in particular. in and around reservations in particular. the disproportionality of american indians as compared to prevalence by population is vastly greater than it is for the general population.

"1212","doc 1787","rm: it has. if you look at pure, raw treatment numbers caucasian is the highest for just about everything because eighty-odd percent of minnesotans identify as white. in the state demographer’s statistics you will see that people that self-identify as american indian are 1.1 percent of the population in minnesota, yet when you break it down by drug of choice pharmaceutical drugs versus heroin versus methamphetamine or even general treatment numbers generally speaking when you control for incidents by thousand—in research epidemiology one of the ways we try to demonstrate the prevalence of something in a given population is we make a level playing field. incidents by hundred or incidents by thousand are just a general way of doing that. so for treatment admissions for all substance abuse american indians are about eight per thousand versus all other races combined which is a little bit about one per thousand. as you go into heroin or methamphetamine or opiates that goes anywhere from eight to about fifteen per thousand versus other races combined. there is a hugely disproportionate overrepresentation for opiates and methamphetamine for people who self identify as american indian versus other races in minnesota. i can send you those slides. you see that played out both as population demographics self identified as american indian and the geography of minnesota. some of those maps you see the darker areas are almost exlusively around reservations. the one exception being hennepin county, which is not immediately contiguous to the reservation, however there is a very large percentage of american indians in and around phillips and little earth and that area.

",458
"1225","doc 1809","part of the desire to change the name from state methadone authority to state opioid treatment authority was a reflection of the changes of both the drug of choice or the primary substance of abuse no longer being almost exclusively heroin and being the pharmaceutical pills as well as the treatment intervention not aimed solely at methadone but methadone and buprenorphine products and whatever the next intervention pharmaceutical happens to be. ",449
"1226","doc 1811","rm: there has been a change in the acuity of the patients as well—the clients if you would—as well as with the age demographics and geographic areas. it used to be that heroin was primarily found in large, major metropolitan areas. you’d see it in minneapolis, st. paul, duluth, and rochester. now the maps indicate that it is everywhere. it’s not just the big city drug anymore. ",380
"1227","doc 1812","along with that there have been responsive changes in the system. in the delivery of substance abuse treatment. if you go back the mentality—the zeitgeist—in the early mid-eighties was that everyone went to detox, twenty-eight day resident care, six months of a halfway home and then if that didn’t work it wasn’t because the system wasn’t responsive to their needs it was because they weren’t motivated or they hadn’t hit rock bottom yet.

"1229","doc 1816","rm: if you just searched ‘minnesota model’ and ‘hot seat’ you will find a few agencies today that believe in that kind of methodology. it is decreasing. there has been a real awakening in what in today’s world i think is referred to as cod or dual diagnosis and co-occurring disorder. that is the popular term. the work i do as adjunct faculty at the graduate school is they have both a degree or master’s confirmant in cod as well as a certification program in cod. there has been a real awakening to the idea that you aren’t just an addict or you don’t just have mental health issues. you can have both at the same time. often one is in play or interlaced with the other. part of that awakening is a change or an awareness that the clients coming in today are more acute than they used to be.

"1230","doc 1817","in minnesota we have what is called the sixth dimension model. it is a modification of the american society of addiction medicine’s patient placement criteria. you have these six different dimension with a zero to four of severity or acuity rating. people coming into the system today are simply more acute than they used to be. not only are they younger, but they are more severely affected and impacted at younger ages than they used to be. some of that can be because of the purity of the drug. some of it can be because of the social nature of heroin in particular. when you look at different drugs there is a different culture built around. heroin in particular you see as a community drug. people will individually shoot heroin, but they will also do it in groups in the same vein you see people use marijuana part of the culture of marijuana is you will fire one up and pass it around the room versus tobacco and cigarettes where you don’t see that. ",957
"1231","doc 1818","the system itself has become more aware and more responsive to the acuity of the individual clients coming in. a big piece of that acuity is not only the drug itself, but the behavioral correlates that come along with that. there is an increase in mental health symptomology. if you reference the dsm 5 you will see things like ‘anxiety disorder induced by opiate withdrawal.’ there is a period of time where you have mental health symptom constellations that are a product of the intoxication or the withdrawal of the drug. they often respond to medications in the same way. someone who comes into the emergency room or general medical care that looks like they have generalized anxiety disorder the gold standard in medicine for gad—generalized anxiety disorder—is to use an an anxiolytic medication like alprazolam or phenazepam to treat anxiety. if you are an addict in withdrawal and you show up with a symptom constellation that looks like that that is the medication you are going to receive with no ill intent by the practitioner. that’s just what they see. that’s what their training tells them to give, which the addict will then use to modulate their withdrawal. they start to feel normal again and the cycle continues.

"1232","doc 1819","with opioids you see an increase in a lot of secondary complications that come along with it too. the mental health stuff. you see a lot of additional use of potential addiction through the anxiolytic medications like alprazolam and phenazepam. you see a large incidence of blood borne pathogens with heroin addicts in particular because of route of administration with needles or behavior they may engage in as a product or byproduct of the addictive nature and addictive use of the drug. hepatitis and hiv and things like that. mary from raan [rural aids action network] can speak directly about that. she has a lot of statistics and numbers about that.

"1233","doc 1821","rm: i can send you some stuff on that. it is a standardized method of assessment that we use for substance abuse treatment in minnesota and have for a number of years now. it has six different dimentions that look at people more wholistically. it’s not just what is your drug of use, how often do you use it, when did you start using it. as an illustration dimension one is intoxication and withdrawal. eveyone is rated zero through four. zero is least impact and four is severe concern. with dimension one we look at intoxication withdrawal. we look at dimension two: biomedical. does the individual have a traumatic brain injury that would affect where they would go for treatment? also how treatment services would be delivered to them.

"1245","doc 1842","rm: there is a degree of aging out. back in the eighties when you looked at the average person that was on a methodone program back then had a lot of additional medical complications to them. that’s not tremendously different now. we still see a lot of people that have hepatitis or hiv or insilulary secondary problems, but there is a big difference between a fifty year old guy with a cirrhotic liver and hepatitis c and a twenty year old person that doesn’t have a cirrhotic liver and may have hepatitis in a system of health care and the ability to withstand that as a function of youth. forty years of shooting smack versus a year and a half of pharmaceutical opioids are two very different people. the medical compromising of the older person versus the younger person is that the older person is going to hit mortality sooner than the younger person just as a function of physical decay over decades of use versus months or a couple of years.

"1246","doc 1844","rm: the short answer is yes, we do. part of it depends on how you define success. within that you have people that embrace any of the continuum of a definition of harm reduction. there are people that will tell you that their flavor of harm reduction is that the individual continues to come back, and whether they have intermittent use or continued use and continue to come back for some form of service. the back of the na chip says, ‘keep coming back.’ as long as you keep coming back, as long as there is the opportunity for continued intervention that’s better than nothing.

"1251","doc 1850","then you have the data [drug addiction treatment act] 2000 act with buprenorphine which was a very volitional, intentional act to try to destigmatize the use of medication out of a physician’s office versus going to that clinic. prior to 2001 the food and drug administration, which still plays a role, had a much larger role in regulation of methadone programs. under those old rules and 21 cfr 291 505 you could never get anymore than a twenty-one day take home dose regardless of the amount of time you had been on the program.

"1252","doc 1851","the center for substance abuse treatment steps in as the new agency in 2001 with new regulations that are more laxed or more understanding. i think the best example of that is the idea that you could never have more than two weeks of take home medication because all you are going to do is sit around and be stoned anyway versus the idea of getting people to be more normal. there is an eight-point criteria now to get take home doses and among some of those eight-point criteria and among treatment plans today is going to school, going to work, and doing the stuff that ‘normal’ people do so that you don’t just go to the clinic everyday to dose. the idea is to get you to be less and less reliant on the clinic and things like that and more and more engaged in normal adl—activities and daily living stuff.

"1321","doc 1965","for him to engage in stuff with such ease it seems like, there was a lot of identity stuff that went on for him. where he wasn’t a star athlete or a star scholar. in his interviews he said, “basically i became one of those drug people who get things for you.” that was a power, there was an identity that he really relished that he was seen as the guy to go to. that was the value that he brought. at that age it makes sense. i’m not going to argue with his logic. it made sense for him to do what he did because it gave him an identity that he couldn’t achieve through other methods. really just absolutely inside out challenged that he could have done that. i was at the point, i’ve said this a lot and i’ll say it again, you get to the point where i would choose to have him die than to kill somebody. i choose to have him die than to harm somebody irreparably. than to have those parents standing in my driveway threatening me or screaming at me because my son drunk or high either oded with somebody or he drove over them drunk. i got to that point. i felt horrible feeling that and saying that.

"1322","doc 1966","it was interesting having other parents go, “oh yeah. totally identify with that. i don’t like it but i totally identify that feeling where your own child you’d be better off if they were dead and not harming.” i started to really wrestle with that kind of stuff. that identity of i’m the dad, he’s my child. when i went through divorce, identity is powerful stuff. my wife, my house, my children. i really struggled with it through addiction that one of my fellow parents is like, “she’s an adult i birthed a long time ago. i try not to refer to her as my daughter, as my kid anymore because it’s too hard.”",608
"1323","doc 1968","mo: no this was one of our friends of naranon. that i have to start to separate from this parental thought that this is a little kid that needs me. that will pin you and put you into such great sadness and such confusion. i remember what it’s like, my parents, i don’t need you to do those things anymore. i did actually. i didn’t think i did. it was important that i started to establish some of my own space. when he was sober, he was sober ninety days at hazelden not for twenty-eight. almost ninety days and then off to sober living. he was just sober; he wasn’t in any kind of recovery at all. sober’s tough and it’s so dangerous. the way i liken it is you’re just standing on the edge. you can step off, one bad thing can happen and you can step off or your close to the edge and ultimately there’s prelapse. you don’t just relapse. generally, people it’s planned. they just walk over to the edge and they just wait for the trigger to happen or that moment or that safe space and they’re going to use again. sober definitely wasn’t, i knew it was dangerous.

"1391","doc 2066","mo: well, we, what we realized was no matter how many, you know naloxone kits we handed out, no matter how many people knew how to use them, we were still losing people. we still lose people today. and it's just, we needed to have a support system. somewhere where addicts like myself and others would feel comfortable about telling their story, feel comfortable to be involved, to become their own advocates on this issue. so that way they feel empowered to not only, not only speak about the issue, but help their friends, their family members, in becoming sober. so we created natives against heroin as a healing circle. at first it was just a healing circle, where we would just sit around and talk. and it was just a support group. and then, after much of the issues started rising with the drugs. when they started stripping the doctors form giving the opiates away, you know so easily.  when that happened the drug dealers became a big thing. no longer were you able to go to your doctor as your drug dealer. you now had to go through the gangs. and the gangs were having wars in little earth. they were actually having big wars where they were shooting people left and right. we weren't dying anymore of opiates, we were dying from guns. so then, that's when we started natives against heroin to start doing patrols. so our addicts, the ones that were in recovery, started actually patrolling little earth. then we started walking around, talking to all the gangs and the drug dealers. and telling them, we have children here. we've already had children shot multiple times. we don't need no more, our children cannot be going through this, not our kids. we had multiple children that were shot and brought to the emergency room because of the drug war in our community. so we did, we started that patrol. from there became the marches. we started doing marches to shut down drug dealers. so, we started going up to drug dealer's houses that we knew. that we were tired of talking to, to tell them to quit.",2014

""you guys are shaming us."" all this stuff. and then, six months later he becomes one of our members. he quits dealing and he becomes one of our members. and then that's when we knew. we're gonna keep doing this. when we started, when we started going from different res's and different res's we were able to change drug dealers from dealing for their—'cuz a lot of them are dealing just for their use, 'cuz they're users—and we understand that. so once they become a part of our membership, then they create their own, instead of doing it on a drug base, you create your own chapter. and you have your own addicts and everyone that you used to deal with, deal to, have 'em come in, and you become their support to become sober.",1222

"1409","doc 2088","mo: yeah. the one that was helping me through all of it was retiring and i had, i didn't know what to do. at the time i was like, i freaked out. i was scared 'cuz i was... all the work that we've done, all the work that we still need to do, still needs to happen in the house. and when she said she was retiring i just, i knew somebody had to take that mantle. i knew somebody had to step up and do something. so that way our harm reduction services actually go through so that pharmaceutical companies actually have to pay for what they're causing. so i decided to run. and then, when i decided to run i didn't realize that i would become bare naked. that my story would come out. and i would have to, i would say i would have to deal with the trauma in a more public eye.... again. like usually when you deal with trauma, you can deal with it in a private setting. you know, where you're just with you and your therapist, or you and your healers and stuff. it's more private. but when you're running in public view, your traumas come out for everyone to see. and they wanna use those traumas to help push your agenda, right? but what they don't understand is that it's a bare naked feeling. you revealed everything about yourself to the world. and i wasn't ready for that. that was the hard part. i wasn't ready for that. i didn't know that that's what i was signing up for at the time. that i was, i really thought that i could run and not have to tell my story and not have to tell people that i was a user, that i was sexually abused, that i was you know beaten as a child, that i was homeless for four years... you know? i didn't know that i had to tell everybody that. and, when i was running it all had to come out.",1723

"1411","doc 2090","mo: it was extremely hard to deal with [laughs]. it was very... painful? because it was a public pain. and it... how i dealt with it was mostly... i tried to remember that all of who i am, those traumas are me. they made me who i am. and i, i needed to use that. i've been using it all this time to help my community. i've been using all my traumas all this time to make a different life for everyone in my community. and i just needed to remember that and continue to remember that whenever people would you know, at the doors some people would, you know like say: ""you don't have no business running."" you know, ""you have no business running. you're just ...all you are, you're just full of all this trauma. that's all you are. you're just one trauma"" [laughs]. but, the thing was, the thing was, i had to fight against that stigma.",834

"1424","doc 2104","mo: i didn't wanna. i fundraised right off of the doors. so when i would talk to people at the doors, they would give me money right at the door. i would ask them if they would vote for me, if they would support me. and then they said yes, and then i would ask them, ""well would you be able to you know contribute to my campaign. you know for regular costs of printing and everything."" and that was it. and that's how i raised ten thousand was just off from the doors, off from neighbors. that's what i wanted. i wanted to make sure my campaign was fully ran by the community. so, i did it. i made sure that the money that we got was only from the community. which i guess was my downfall. i should've accepted money from pacs and everybody else, but i wanted to make a statement.",780

"1427","doc 2108","mo: right now... i'm gonna go back to school. i still have a lot of contracts that i have to fulfill. so, and i still have natives against heroin that i'm turning into an org. so, there's still a lot of work that i'm doing. and then, i'm just gonna go back to school for a while. finish up my degree. and i don't think i'll run again. i don't know. maybe, maybe not. i know i'm, this coming next few months, i'm training other little earth residents to run.",457

"1432","doc 2114","mo: law enforcement is my degree.",33

"1434","doc 2116","mo: a lot of people don't. [both laughing]. a lot of people don't! i wanted to change the criminal justice system. so i started my degree back in, 2013? i went to college. i started it out but i never finished. i dropped out of college so that way i could you know raise my daughter. she was going through a lot of health problems at the time. so i stopped school to take care of her. and then, from there i went on working and then started on doing all of this community organizing stuff, so that just became a farther priority. but my degree, my major, has always been law enforcement. only because of the police brutality that was happening in my community, and to a lot of my family members. i wanted to change the criminal justice system from the inside. so i thought i would become a cop to do that. so i will go finish my law enforcement degree. then go to the u of m for criminal justice.",896
"1435","doc 2117","sp: right on. and so, do you think, like at some point working within the criminal justice system somehow other that a cop? or do you think it's really, or do you wanna be a ""peace officer""? i think that's what they're often...",227
"1436","doc 2118","mo: mhm. no, i don't wanna be a peace officer. i will do something different within the field. i'm, at first i wanted to be a ""peace officer"" and then reach detective. but then i was like, that's just... i wanna be there before the problems occur. i wanna be able to address it before everything gets to the point of, you know... i don't wanna be there afterwards. after all is said and done, and everyone is already hurt and families are already destroyed. i wanna be there to help fix families. i wanna be there to help address the traumas that our criminal justice system does to our families. 'cuz there's, not matter what, i get it people make mistakes. we're human beings. but i also understand that, we also have other human beings that are connected to us. if we throw someone in prison, when we throw them in prison like that, their children suffer, their families suffer. they are in prison just as much as their family member is in prison. and we need to be addressing, how is it that we keep... how do we minimize the trauma for the families that are going through this system? we do understand that he or she has a price to pay. we understand that. but we have to minimize the trauma. how can they still parent? we have to allow them to still be a parent. we have to allow them to still... if it's us providing rides for their kids to go here, to see their parents on a weekly basis. if it's doing live skypes so they can see their kid's dance recital. you know, like, if something we have to do something to minimize and allow them to still be parents while they're incarcerated.",1593
"1437","doc 2119","sp: i would agree with you a hundred percent.",45
"1438","doc 2120","mo: 'cuz they should be able, we could do skype videos, you know? like have some [laughs] ""it's my kid's first soccer game."" ""well guess what? you're gonna sit here and watch your kid's soccer game. like you're still in prison but, here's your kid's soccer game."" you know? you can still be a part of that, in some type of way. we need to be providing something to help minimize this, because we're just, we're creating a generational trauma that is continuing to play out with a lot of our communities.",503

"1440","doc 2123","sp: well that's fantastic.",26
"1441","doc 2124","mo: yes. it's not just the native community. ever since my campaign it's all over minneapolis. i wouldn't call myself a leader, i'm more so just an advocate. i just like to help people. it fills my soul. it's one of those things where you say like, if you don't like a job you're not gonna stay there very long, but this is one thing where helping people, it fulfills me. where i go home, and i feel like i've done good. i've done what i needed to do for the day. and then i can wake up the next day and do it again, and feel good about it. i've had plenty of jobs where... i worked in a homeless shelter. it was the hardest job i had. i told myself i'll never do it again. i worked in a youth homeless shelter for native kids. and, the shelter would take children—it would be child protection—would take children away from their parents. and they would put them into this, our shelter. and, having to see them, their little faces crying for their parents. all they want is love. and you can see it, and you can feel it. that's all they're yearning for, is their parents' love. i couldn't be a part of that. i couldn't be a part of holding them from their families. all i wanted was for them to have their parents. and when i had to see that, and deal with it every day, i told myself i needed to do something different. i can't be a part of this. i can't hurt these babies. they didn't deserve it. they didn't do nothing wrong for them to have to be sitting in a shelter, wondering what's gonna happen to them. they shouldn't be worried about what's happening to them. so that's, it just reminded me of boarding schools all over again.",1636
"1442","doc 2125","sp: i can understand why. i suspect that many people see you as a leader despite your protest that you're just an advocate [both laugh]. and especially for women, and for native women. you know, i think that for me, i think a lot about, well certainly harm reduction is something i believe in. i've worked in for over twenty years. but my focus, and my emphasis has always been around women. not to exclude men, but women, women identified, and trying to create positive change for the lives of women, and that are pregnant and parenting, and no access to resources, and desperate. so, i'm wondering...",602
"1443","doc 2126","mo: women that are incarcerated have harsher sentences than men.",64
"1444","doc 2128","mo: they get longer sentences. and it's, it pissed me off when i was in college. i argued with a lot of my instructors in college. i know i'm going back to go argue again [both laugh]. because it was, it's discriminatory. it's discrimination. and we have a protective class against discrimination against sex. but yet, our criminal justice system can blatantly and openly discriminate over and over and over again. and no judge, no one, gets held accountable. especially when these women have children, or they're giving birth in prison. a lot of children die from giving birth, from their mothers giving birth in prison. the babies, some of 'em don't even survive. and it's only because of the kind of treatment they get when they're giving birth. they're cuffed to a bed. how would you like it to give birth, being cuffed to a bed? that's...",843

"1446","doc 2130","mo: right? it's just... oh my god... like, the things that i've read. i tend to take up the harsh topics in everything i do. even in college i did it. i don't know why it is about me. i take up the topics that nobody wants to talk about. and i tend to write about 'em, and research 'em, and do what i can to figure out well how can we change it? and my instructors were always, me and my instructors were always at each other's necks [laughs]. and it was only because i was always wanting to change a system. like this can't be happening. like look at these numbers. and, my instructors are always, you know like... well we'll find out how they feel when they see me come back [laughs].",686

"1448","doc 2133","sp: i don't know, in my experience, you know when i would do some education in schools around harm reduction like in the '90s, nobody had ever really heard of it. and, it's minnesota so abstinence is expected. so it was a hard conversation to have, and it was like spending a lot of time explaining to people what harm reduction was. and it was more related to hiv and hep-c, rather than overdose. so i'm curious now, like, harm reduction seems to be fairly common-place throughout the country, and in minnesota! what is your experience like? you know like in school, or other community places? do people know and support harm reduction? do you spend a lot of time explaining to them why it matters? or what's that like?",720
"1449","doc 2134","mo: what i've noticed, harm reduction is much more accepted in the communities of color. in communities of color, it's way more accepted, more looked at like yes we need this. but when you look at the counterparts, like white society for instance. they still believe in abstinence. that's where the hardest part is. the older white folks. it's harder to explain to them. there are still some, you know cuz i, throughout my door knocking when people would ask me about my background in opiates and all of this. it was more so the older white men, that would have the hardest time to accept harm reduction. that i was giving people a way to just continue to use and use and use and use... and to keep the drug stuff going and going. no matter what we do, the drugs will always be there. and that is not because of communities of color. that is because of our country. our country is allowing the drugs to be there. they are allowing that to be shipped in. it's just communities of color, because they deal with a lot of trauma, they deal with a lot of poverty, and poverty creates trauma, that's why drugs are so susceptible in the communities of color. it is not their fault, why it's here. so, the more i tried to explain that to an older white man, for instance... i think it's because i'm a woman of color. that gives them sometimes the feeling of ""i don't need to listen to you,"" or ""you're not talking."" you know? being a woman, like you said, you automatically lose some type of respect from some male counterparts. there are a lot of males out there that will automatically lose respect for you just because you're a woman. being a woman of color you even lose more. so, in this state it's a lot more simpler and easier 'cuz if you go out to like georgia for instance.... georgia is so far away from harm reduction. they're still in the criminalization stage where they just wanna criminalize every.... but, i get it, they have a lot of overdoses and stuff going on over there too. but it's, it's gonna take them a while to learn that harm reduction actually helps reduce overdoses. harm reduction actually helps promote more sobriety, but that takes time to show them that. because harm reduction is so big in minnesota, we are the lab rats. we are the ones that will do the data, we'll be the ones to collect all this data, and then we'll start seeing the trickle effects in other states. but we have to be the first. so, right now we will make all the mistakes. but, it's okay to make mistakes, 'cuz we can learn from them. and, we're just fortunate that we have a lot of people in our state that believe in the same thing. that want to be the first to try this. so it will take some time. we'll see it throughout the country, but it'll take time. am i making sense?",2775

",906
"1567","doc 2387","early on in my childhood my dad became an alcoholic. i think a lot of it had to do with the trauma he experienced in world war ii and what he saw in world war ii. that’s probably not the only reason. he probably had some alcohol addiction in his family, too. it was very difficult growing up in a family, especially with six kids, with an alcoholic. my mother often put me in the position of being a parent. we would find my dad passed out on the floor. she would have me run up and get a doctor. i often found myself having to take care of her because she was always wimping out for things like that. i had a real strong relationship with my oldest sister until she got into junior high. then she became very distant from me. i always kind of feel like i raised myself. i grew up by raising myself. it has its good and bad traits about it.

"1568","doc 2388","when i went to high school i became very wild. i got suspended from school once. i drank, smoked pot and hash. then i went off to college. i wasn’t really a serious student until i was probably a junior. then i became very interested in history and geography. i got a double major. then a girlfriend and i went to europe, we hitch hiked around. it was so much fun. then i came back and didn’t really know what to do. first, i got a teaching degree and in student teaching discovered that i really didn’t like teaching kids, middle and high school. one of my professors taught an urban planning class. i took that and became enamored with it. the head of the department told me about an urban planning master’s program down in st. louis. i went down there. i didn’t know a soul, probably the best thing for me.",809
"1569","doc 2389","i was registering for classes and i met my husband dean. i was dating somebody else. we just became good friends, it was a two year graduate program, and we just became good friends. then the second year he asked if i would move in, just as friends. i did and i think there were only two women out of the program of eighty people. this was before women got into college and did things.",385
"1570","doc 2391","ap: that was in 1975. i graduated in ’77. we got married a week after; my mom planned the whole wedding. we had nothing to do with it. we all said we’d go where the first job was. that was when affirmative action was really big. being a white female, i didn’t have any problem getting a job. i wanted to go back to minnesota because i loved it. dean was from valparaiso, indiana. we both moved here. dean had a terrible time finding a job, being a white male. he eventually did, and i think we were married four years before we had spencer. i had a midwife and it was great. i’ll never go through childbirth again though without having drugs. [laughs] spencer was born, and i worked for the city of minnetonka. dean worked for the city of rosemount. we lived in south minneapolis. we decided we should probably move close to one of our jobs. we found our house out in minnetonka.

"1571","doc 2393","ap: no, it’s another house close by. we found a wonderful daycare, it was a family daycare. it was a little hobby farm and all the kids got to bottle feed the little lambs. it was wonderful. spencer, he had a wonderful childhood. we held him back, he was a summer baby. we put him through when he five, should he go to kindergarten or not? they recommended that he did, which was a mistake. he didn’t do well socially his first year of kindergarten. at the family daycare the family daycare mom, we became very close friends, our families; had a son who was about a year older than spencer. spencer was terribly bullied at that daycare. we ended up taking him out and switched him over to a different school so he wouldn’t have the stigma of being with the same kids for a repeated grade. spencer always kind of resented us for that. even though in later years he’ll admit how terrible the bullying was. i never knew about it and spencer would never say anything about it.

"1572","doc 2394","he had a wonderful elementary school. although he wasn’t the best student, he was always very smart. red hair shenanigans, always played sports. he loved t-ball and baseball. he was in little league. he and dean were in the y guide program. he always had a problem; he would never want to stay over at other people’s homes for the night with other kids. one time he spent the night with a good friend. he ended up walking home because he didn’t want to be apart from us. he was always very close to us. both of our jobs, being in the public employment, you had a lot of night meetings. you had to hold meetings when people were done with their jobs during the day. i was gone a lot, dean was gone a lot. in our parenting we would always make sure we’d always schedule our meetings so the other person could go and be there. we were gone and i always felt so guilty for that.

"1573","doc 2395","i love my job. i had a boss who was absolutely wonderful. he would push me so much to do as well as i could. that kind of overcame some of the guilt of mothering. growing up out in the suburbs you didn’t have a big network of working moms back then, like you do now. my network of working moms were people in the daycare, either work or in daycare. it still remains strong today. we still get together for daycare mom group meetings. i know your transcriber can’t see but i want to show you pictures. it’s just in the other room here. shelley and her cousins and my sisters put these boards together for the funeral. this was his childhood. there’re pictures of him as a baby with his cousins. i made all his halloween costumes, wrestling, swimming.",749
"1574","doc 2397","ap: he was a very sensitive, shy boy. he just loved doing things. i’m going to cry. i’m going to get the kleenex box. that’s okay. this is very good for me to talk about this. this was up until probably junior high. slip n’ slide, baseball. how could this kid become addicted to heroin? you look at these pictures. i kept thinking, “is it because i worked so much?” ",366
"1575","doc 2398","then back when he, i think he was entering seventh grade, the city manager left to become director of the league of cities for minnesota. a new city manager was hired where i worked. he just didn’t have the values that the previous manager had. i just thought, “i’m not willing to work this hard for somebody that doesn’t have the same values that i do.” i thought, “well i’ll take some time off. i’ll be able to spend time with spence.” i was really worried about him.",469
"1576","doc 2400","ap: he was twelve, thirteen. getting to the point where he could probably come home from school on his own.",107
"1577","doc 2402","ap: i was so worried about that. i took time off and shelley, his sister, and i drove him up to camp menogyn. he and another friend went there and shelly and i were going to camp and drive around lake superior. we ended up having car trouble and never made it. i did okay.",272
"1578","doc 2404","ap: at home. i was sort of rattling around the house. i thought, “i just am not being stimulated.” i was getting crabby. i went back to work; i did contract work then went back to work full-time. then he started middle school. ",227
"1579","doc 2406","ap: in middle school through high school pictures—it was called junior high back then—it was seventh, eighth, and ninth grade. in eighth grade he got caught in school. he had put some booze in a water bottle and he got caught, he and another friend. that was really his first foray that we knew, of him using substances. dean and i always drank in front of him. we didn’t drink a lot. ",385
"1580","doc 2408","ap: then we found a bottle of vodka that had been refilled with water. then at fifteen or sixteen we caught him with his good friend john, his parents are the ones coming from montana today. i think he’s in one of these pictures. ",230
"1581","doc 2410","ap: that’s dean and spence. they look so much alike. every summer we’d go up to ely to a camp called camp van vac. it was just kind of stone cabins. it did have electricity, cold running water, central bathrooms. we just loved it. ",231
"1582","doc 2411","i think he started smoking pot when he was fifteen. he got caught by the police, he and two other guys were parked in a car and the police came up to them, opened the car doors and smoke just billowed out. pot. the police, bless their hearts, kept them in the jail cell longer than they had to and then released them. ",318
"1583","doc 2413","ap: i think it was the orono or long lake police. they notify the schools right away. spencer was on the baseball team. he got kicked off the baseball team, which is what you do for somebody in trouble. it just irritated me. then he had to go to chemical dependency…",266
"1584","doc 2415","ap: being kicked off of the baseball team, it always impressed me that here kids in trouble could not participate in healthy activities.",136
"1585","doc 2417","ap: i don’t know if that view is still held today or not. i understand that he has to be accountable, but to punish him by taking him out? then he went to a chemical dependency class that the high school ran. it was very good. it was run by a wonderful counselor. i think he had to do that for six months. i noticed from the time he was fifteen, i think probably here, we went out to montana to visit our friends. i don’t think he smiled that whole year he was fifteen. we’d tell jokes, take him to counseling, took him to a therapist who thought he had add. he was on ritalin. that’s another thing i feel terribly guilty about. i think that was either eighth or ninth grade that started. high school was relatively benign. he had good buds; he did a lot of activities that we thought were healthy. he told us later that he was smoking pot the whole time he was in high school. ",878
"1586","doc 2418","then he went to college. he didn’t know where he wanted to go. i, of course, filled out his applications. he got accepted at the u [university of minnesota] and went there. he was very, very homesick. he lived down there. he would come home a lot and then the second year he asked if he could live on…i can just picture it, it’s right off here, the tall building, it was brand new when he moved in, student housing. he moved in with three other high school friends that were doing fairly well, but all they did was party. ",522
"1587","doc 2420","ap: it was off campus. what was the name of that? we tried and tried to keep him back in. we talked to the counselors. he’d go in. he was put on probation. we even had his pediatrician write him a note about his add. we were very into enabling, into doing everything we could to keep him in college. he, looking backwards, he was probably one who should have taken a year or two off before going to college to figure things out. we didn’t want him to; we thought college is the way to go.

"1588","doc 2422","ap: shelley was born in 1984.",29
"1589","doc 2424","ap: she was always a delightful, happy child until ninth grade. then she sunk into a horrible depression. a depression so bad she would drag her mattress into our room and sleep in our room with us. she could not get out of bed. she said, “it felt like it was enveloping me and taking me down.” she was so sad and so she went to heavy duty counseling. they put her on antidepressant meds. every one you can think of. ",417
"1590","doc 2426","ap: until we found something that worked. she gained a horrible amount of weight. she survived; she did very well in school. she wanted to go away to school. she wanted to go to depauw university outside of indianapolis which was smaller than her high school. she just fell in love with it. we wanted her to go to st. olaf because it was close. we were just so worried about her depression. she did well. we ended up saying, “okay, you can go to depauw.” ",455
"1591","doc 2427","she did well there the first year, but then she started cutting herself. i went down there. she ended up in the hospital. let me back up. after cutting herself we get a call that she was in the emergency room. she had taken a bottle and a half of tylenol, which is significant—liver issues. she was in the icu. they had washed her stomach out with charcoal. they thought it was a suicide attempt. it may have been. she said, “i can’t say for sure if it was a suicide attempt. there was a voice telling me to just keep taking these pills and that’s what i did.” that was very traumatic on us. ",592
"1592","doc 2428","spencer will always say, “you spent more time on her, trying to help her with her depression than you did me with trying to overcome addiction,” which wasn’t at all true. that’s his perception of it. he watched a lot of it because he was with us when that was happening. shelley got better. she ended up graduating from depauw. she had to go to summer school. she was upset because she couldn’t walk with her class—that was a big deal for small schools. she came back here and she decided she wanted to go back to school. she had a degree in anthropology, which is something you could really use in finding a job. that was sarcastic. she was really interested in theater. she went back to the u and got a degree in theater. ",724
"1593","doc 2430","ap: anthropology from depauw and then the u for theater. then she discovered that there weren’t a lot of jobs in theater. she went back to hamline [university] and she’s finished up all her coursework for her master’s in theater education. she’s got her teaching degree. this last half year she taught at the middle school in north minneapolis. i can’t think of the name of it right now. now she is has a very serious boyfriend, jeff.

"1594","doc 2431","her hair is green. i never know what color her hair is going to be. i had a horrible time; she has tattoos all over the place. here she is. you think my kid spencer has always been very conservative and worried what people thought of him. she’s out there. she’s always very responsible about drinking and using drugs and everything, very responsible. he’s off the deep end. one thing at least in dealing with addiction, it’s taught me to be very tolerant of shelley, very approving of what her choices are. not approving, accepting what her choices are in life. so spencer’s addiction, while he was in college he had a very bad case of mono. this is probably caused by all the partying.",686
"1595","doc 2433","ap: yes. his doctor, probably being well meaning at the time, he had a horrible sore throat, prescribed him tons of percocet.",125

"1597","doc 2437","ap: it was at the time he had his first girlfriend. he never dated at all in high school. he was too shy and immature. it was probably his first or second year. he met this girl cassie who was just absolutely wild. she had no place to go so she wondered if she could stay at our house. i said, “no, no, no.” and then, “yes.” her parents wouldn’t allow her back in their home.

"1598","doc 2439","ap: college, this was after he had dropped out. i said, “she can stay in a separate bedroom. i want no interaction between you two sexually, in my house. she has to actively look for a place to live.” she was an alcoholic and we didn’t know it. they would drink and drink. i ended up taking her down to hcmc emergency room, sitting with her when she had these horrible cases of anxiety.

"1599","doc 2440","her parents lived over in hopkins. her mom had nothing to do with her. her dad would come and just be disgusted and walk away. so me, the enabler, would sit with her. i just felt so bad for her. then those two ended up, spencer and cassie, moving to an apartment down near the u. she ended up going off the deep end in an alcoholic craze. the police found her banging on the doors of ridgedale at eight o’clock on a saturday morning.",433
"1600","doc 2442","ap: of the shopping mall. probably two weeks previous to that we were gone, spencer and cassie were at our house and she started attacking him. he called the police. she got charged with domestic abuse. after the shopping center thing, spencer was probably twenty one; we had no business saying this to him. we said, “that’s it. we will not tolerate her being around you.” that was the end of cassie and spencer together.",421
"1601","doc 2443","he was clearly abusing alcohol, looking backwards, with her. i’m assuming it probably ended up being pot. then he told me, a couple years ago, how they would get renewals of the percocet from the doctor’s prescriptions and take as many as they could. probably when he was twenty five or twenty six, he had his first bout with appendicitis. he ended up in the hospital. it was so inflamed they couldn’t operate. for pain control they give him percocet and oxycodone. sometime between his mono and his appendicitis i figure he probably got addicted to pain meds.

"1603","doc 2446","ap: which is spencer’s drug history.",36
"1604","doc 2448","ap: he entered the retreat. jamie came to us saying, “something’s wrong with spencer. he’s acting weird.” she thought he was addicted to pot, which he probably was. we called the retreat. we did an intervention, just ourselves with him and jamie and said, “you’ve got to enter treatment. this is unacceptable.”",310
"1605","doc 2450","ap: aidan is born. he was born in september 2008. this was in february 2009. he told us that he was only on pot. when i talked to the retreat, to mike kennedy, did you ever know him? he was a nurse anesthetist. he was shelley’s nurse anesthetist to the doctor when she was born. shelley’s doctor knew him really well. he became addicted to fentanyl and pain pills, which was very convenient being a nurse anesthetist. he would just open a vein in his leg when he was treating a patient and drain the medication into him. anyways, he ended up being spencer’s counselor. he told us, “make sure it’s only pot. if there’s any pain pills in him he’ll have to go to detox.” we had no idea about the percocet, we were very naïve. ",723
"1606","doc 2451","after three days when he was at the retreat he started going into withdrawal. they sent him to the mission to go into detox. he came back and he told us he had taken a couple suboxone and that’s what he had to detox from. we had no clue what that meant. he did the full thirty days there. they really wanted him to go live in a sober house. he refused to because he didn’t want to be apart from jamie and aidan. he did well. he did well for probably six to eight months. then jamie could tell that he was withdrawing again and something was wrong. right before christmas i remember her calling us to come over to their house because she couldn’t wake him up. we couldn’t wake him up either. we had no idea. he was probably overdosing. eventually he came to. then we brought him to fairview chemical dependency for an evaluation. of course he wouldn’t let us in. he told us, he just thought he should go to outpatient treatment. they recommended nystrom.

"1607","doc 2452","at the same time jamie had graduated the previous spring. that’s when the nurse’s freeze came on. there were no nursing jobs to be had whatsoever except in a nursing home. she wanted to be a hospital nurse. that was her dream. she applied out of state. the only two hospitals that were hiring then were ones connected with native american communities because they got grant money. one was in ellisville, montana the other was in casper, wyoming. she interviewed both; got both jobs but she preferred the ellisville, montana job. this was in december, january. spencer insisted that he move out there with her even though he obviously had an addiction going. he moved out there with her. he detoxed on his own, going out there. then he did pretty well for a year. he got a job as a landscaper. then he probably started heroin, i want to say out in montana. that was 2011. the fda changed the formula for…",903

"1700","doc 2644","in any other disease or disorder or mental illness, however you want to think about addiction, doing everything we can is completely and utterly acceptable and expected. for some reason when we get into twelve-step program and this whole codependency thing, i think a lot of it comes from al-anon and spouses of addicts—that whole movement. doing the care work of your beloved addict, you become part of the problem instead of looking at addiction as the problem, lack of resources, lack of treatment, lack of money, lack of knowledge about addiction is the problem. it’s not the mothers and fathers wanting to help their children live to the other side of addiction. that’s where i’m really, really thinking hard about this because it’s not working. yet, when i ask my daughter, she will say, “it had nothing to do with you, mom. thank you for not giving up on me, but you could not have stopped me.” that’s the in between space that we need to talk more about.

"1711","doc 2673","yes, i do. okay, my name is marvin seppala. i go by marv. my birthday is july 22nd, 1956. born in seattle, washington to finnish parents. i am 100% finnish. my mom immigrated from finland with her brother to tacoma, where a second-cousin sponsored him after world war ii. my dad, his parents were both born in finland and he grew up in northern minnesota in virginian after it got logged out. my grandfather was a lumberjack. he moved out to tacoma with the family to the other finnish community. oh, yeah. so ultimately, we moved back here and i grew up in stewartville, minnesota.  so, i would have been eight when we moved to minnesota, but we lived in eden prairie for just a few years. before the start of sixth grade i moved to stewartville. my dad was a chemical engineer at ibm and my mom was a housewife. sure. i am the oldest of five and i have three brothers and the last sibling is a sister. she is ten years younger than me. [laughter] yeah. that ten-year gap was big because it was at seventeen when i was kicked out of the house for my addiction. she was just seven years old, so we never really bonded very much.  you kind of jumped to it. [laughter] seventeen, being kicked out, it seems like an important place. yeah, just before the start of sixth grade. you know, it was funny because i think about it... seattle, san jose, bloomington, eden prairie... and then stewartville. for me, as a kid, at that age, i didn't notice the difference really, in terms of being in a big city and then being in a really small town. my focus, this was the fourth move already, and every four years which is kind of funny when i start college and medical school.... training is every four years! [laughter] which seemed kind of nice is some ways. so, what my difficulty was being a somewhat self-conscious, anxious kid and now i've got to make new friends and start a new class, and i don't know anybody.  yeah, it was really awkward. but also, in a small town, i think it may have been easier. i don't know that. i met people pretty readily, in class of course, in the old school [laughter]. everyone in sixth grade is there, so it worked out that way [laughter]. sixth grade was nothing like that. it was that summer though, after sixth grade, so twelve-years-old.... i'm just trying to get this right. yeah, so twelve years old, it must have been the start of seventh grade and i am at a farm with two friends, kim and rick, both guys, at rick's family farm, right outside of stewartville. i don't know how this idea comes up but all the older guys that we looked up to, like the athletes and the sports teams. you know everybody. so seventh grade we were in the high school. there was no junior high. it was seventh grade through twelfth. so sixth grade i was in grade school and seventh grade i'm with everybody. all the older guys are drinking and they're all the really popular guys and the guys on the athletic teams. my mother was a cross-country skier in finland growing up and was on the olympic team but broke a leg and never got to compete. her dad, my grandfather, was a world-champion cross country skier. so i grew up with athletics being a really big deal. so was academics. but in my mind as a kid, athletics was certainly more important. and the athletes are all doing something that we're not supposed to but it seems like fun so i am attracted to it. so the three of us are at the farm, we steal some whiskey out of the kitchen and we go out to the barn, which we had to clean [laughter]. it was a little dairy farm. and we drank. i can still remember it. at one point in my training, i was at the va hospital and the councilor there, this ex-chief-pedi-officer in the navy, six-five, big guy. chief pedi officers are known for being very deliberate, really strong minded. so he was this incredible guy, remarkably passionate about what he did for these veterans. he had them all describe their first drink. and they almost to a person, they could. it really captured them somehow. as if something really important had happened. that was me. i can't remember that.  so i'm not sure if i should do it really, but i'm all in. i remember i could just hardly understand why someone would swallow this stuff. it tasted so bad. it burnt my throat and then all of the sudden, feeling like i belong. like i was part of these other two guys who had grown up together and i no longer had these worries or fears about that or anything else really. it was like i was suddenly part of the world or something. it was like my whole life changed. it was really remarkable. and i knew i was going to do it again. that's for sure. i was going to do this again. i didn't get to for months, but it was like a goal. i wanted to feel that way again. so, ultimately, the following summer, i did again. then i started doing it more frequently that summer. i didn't get sick or anything. we just took a few sips each, you know, because we had to replace the bottle. [laughter] so it was mostly just this remarkable feeling. there was more to it. it felt like i was part of something for the first time, and that is a strange thing to describe. in the midst of my addiction, it seemed like it was almost a quest to feel that way. it was almost like this spiritual quest because it felt like that almost, at the onset. and almost every new drug i took was that same sensation of ""wow. this is what life should be like."" or something. it never would last. i never really could get back to it. there was a sense that i am missing something and i am looking for it, and seeking it, and never finding it. except for those first couple of times with each particular substance. other people have told me that as well over the years of my work. and even i've heard some speakers describe the same thing in regard to their substance use. it certainly was for me. it was just like, ""man. this is what i thought life would be like."" or something. yeah, twelve the first time. so a year later, drinking again with some friends and then an older brother of one of my friends that was a year ahead of me in school had just returned from the university of minnesota after his freshman year. he was a guy i really looked up to, both a athlete and a really good student. he was on the honor role and everything. also went to the same church as i did, and overall, just a really good guy. so, he comes back and tells the two of us that he is smoking pot at the university and describes the importance of it and how fun it was. and i remember saying, ""i would never do that."". that was my initial response. i am really young, and then, a week later, i'm doing that. [laughter] it's funny because i have certainly read about peer pressure and thought about peer pressure in regard to its influence on people. when i look back on my own life in regard to substance use, i was always pushing the envelope and seeking more substance use and i needed to find people who were doing the same, so i wouldn't stick out. there might have been some peer pressure to start something. once i got going, i didn't want people to know how often i was using, how much i was using, all of the different drugs i was using. i had to hang out with people who were doing the same so i wouldn't feel as bad. it was. it was. all of this shame and guilt about doing it at all. at least i wouldn't have to be around people who would elicit that in me. [laughter] yeah, they do. and i was probably one of those bad kids because i did try and convince my friends. you know, ""you gotta try this now! i smoked pot and it is so much fun. you have to do it too!"" it was only a couple of people, less than a handful of people that i would do that with. it was the late sixties, early seventies. it was one thing to do it quietly, it was another to get other people involved. there were a few friends that every time i tried something new, i would go tell them just how great this was too. you know, ""you gotta try this."" [laughter] so i was probably pressuring other people for sure. yeah, thirteen or fourteen and once i kind of broke through smoking pot when other drugs became available, i didn't have that same resistance or hesitance. i just tried it. so speed was available, and not that much else. there was lsd. sometimes. you know, there would always be someone in town, usually an older guy. and there was just a group of people who used drugs and a larger group who didn't in the high school. the people who did, they just got it from somebody, i don't know. there were dealers that some people knew. when i was younger, i didn't know who or what and they would just kind of share and sell to each other basically. by fifteen, i am using just about anything and almost everyday. so, it just really quickly went to daily. i would say it wasn't absolutely every day but pretty much every day. my parents really didn't notice initially. i don't know how that is. i did everything i could to avoid them knowing and to prevent them from knowing, that's for sure. i didn't want them to know and i lied a lot. when you are that age and you are staying out late with older people, you gotta have a reason to be out every night after school. and i was still on sports teams, so i was usually gone anyway for that and i wasn't missing most practices and i wasn't missing school at this point. but i came up with all of these other reasons and things that i would be doing later in the evening. early on that wasn't that hard because i wasn't staying out past curfew or anything. then i did later, as a junior or senior start to do that. and there wasn't much in the way of them controlling that. i just kept doing it. it was usually a combination of things. once in a while you would get caught and just drink or just smoke pot, but in general, it was a combination of substances and again, just kind of in small groups. and every now and then we would get up to rochester, of course a bigger town where more drugs are available and probably more dealers. but it was usually still within this same, well-known group that it occurred. and with that, i had summer jobs, but until i was over sixteen i really couldn't drive. so i couldn't really get a job. we had a minor allowance. i had to start finding a way to get drugs or get money, so illegal stuff fairly early on to do so. yeah, steal stuff or sell it. the first time we took the whiskey from the parents' supply in the kitchen. that next summer i had gotten a job loading trap at the local gun club. the guy who picked us up to go to the gun club had this really old rusted out station wagon and he always brought the booze out to the gun club. so he would carry in the cases of beer and cases of whiskey, whatever, into the gun club. it was part of the job. it didn't occur to me at the time because i was younger, it was like the seventh or eighth grade. at this later point when i started drinking, thirteen or fourteen, was when i realized that.... no, so this is what happened. i was hiking... this would be early spring, late winter. i am in boy scouts and there are three of us out on a hike. we're out on the root river and we've got one 22-calabur rifle, a single shot. once in a while we were shooting something. we're just hiking around the riverbed and it was a really unusual day. the river ice was breaking up. there were these giant chunks of ice floating down the river. this is the same rick that i drank with the first time. so he and i tell my brother brian, who is also with us, we give him the 22 and we hang out from this oak branch waiting for a big chunk to come off and we dropped on top of it. the two of us-- brian stayed on shore. brian then threw us a big stick so we could control it. [laughter] this is a big chunk of ice, probably not quite as wide as this room but pretty close. at least how i remembered it. we picked it because it was so big. the river of course was swelling because of the melt-off and i had never seen this before. i haven't seen it since. it was really a remarkable day. we're going down the stream, not fast, but we're moving decent. we realize that every time we move the ice chunk with our stick to try and control it, we just go slower than in the current. so we toss our stick, so we eliminate the only control we have for navigating this thing. we're going along... it was a long straight section where we started, so we're just thinking, ""this is great."" we come around a bend and there is this chunk of ice, a dam of ice chunks across the river. they look kind of smaller than ours. ours is just big so we thought that we'll just hit this and we'll go right through that dam. that was our discussion. it was limited to that. we're right in the middle of the river at this point, the river is wider than this room. we hit that dam of ice chunks and ours starts to go under. i can still remember these little ice chunks going out from under our feet as we're trying to run across them to get to shore. we went towards the shore that brian was on, i think it was just closer, it wasn't that far. maybe here to that wall, ten feet at most. all of the sudden it all breaks through, just as we're reaching a four foot bank of mud. luckily, there were tree roots in that bank of mud and both of us managed to grab those roots. we're soaking wet, we crawl up the mud, we get out, and it doesn't even occur to us that we almost died. we're just like, ""wow, that was exciting!"" [laughter]. the reason for this story is that we get up... we were meeting my mom and we were meeting her at low water bridge to start the hike at the gun club. that's a nice spot for pick up. we were just going to go down the river, but we're on the wrong side now. usually there is a place where we could cross near the gun club. it's maybe a third of a mile across a field from the gun club. it is usually really shallow. but because of the swelling it was much deeper. brian is up above his knees, we're all really cold. it is melting. it is not warm out. so we're probably close to hypothermia, soaking wet. it is getting towards late afternoon, so we're briskly getting up to the gun club. because i'm freezing and we're there early... my mom wasn't going to be there for some time. we didn't have cell phones or anything. we just counted on a specific time. i remembered that when i worked there, the back window by the backdoor, this tiny little window, little tiny back porch, a few steps up to this 3 x 5 back porch where the kitchen was, this window was unlocked. it was broken. i remembered that for some reason when i worked there. so i say, ""let's see if that thing opens."" we can go in and get heated up, we can warm up. so i try the window, which is up above and it was open. so i crawl through, open the door for those guys, we all go in and we turn the heat on and the ovens on. everything we could to get heat and warmed up. we took our clothes off and hung them over the deep fat fryer. i realized i can break into the gun club, but this is meaningless to me at that time besides that we got warmed up and my mom comes and we're all dry, basically. she didn't even notice. we don't tell her the story of course. why tell her this story? [laughter] i know, we did. [laughter] so at this later point, i had met this older guy. he was a year older than me, not that much older. he was more worldly, let's just put it that way. he had drank, more than i had, and he was on the varsity football team. he knew all these older guys. so, we're hanging around. i don't even remember how this all even started. but we're hanging around together. he lives in a trailer home, only with his mom. his mom works every day. so, it was just us. we're trying to figure out how we can get some alcohol and it suddenly strikes me that we can go out to the gun club and break in. which i've done before! and it doesn't even occur to me that this is really stupid and illegal, and i shouldn't do it. it was more just like, ""oh, we can get some alcohol."" my family had a canoe. so, we grab the canoe, bring it down to lake forest right down in stewartville, paddle up the river to behind the gun club. this is summer now. the same sort of spot where we were going to cross that day. we stopped there and got out. we worked our way up through some trees into this final open field to get to the back patio at the gun club with the broken window. it's open. it isn't locked. so, i do the same thing. i crawl in, i open the door, i let al in. we each grab a case of beer, close the door, race across the open field. it was easier for him than it was for me, running across this open field with a case of beer as this tiny kid. we hide in the trees and go down by the river where the canoe is and we each have a beer or two, i guess. then we decide we're going to save it all for that night because he's got a plan to get all of these older guys together and we'll drink beer. i think this is fantastic. so, we paddle back to town and we hide the beer back in the bushes by the football field and get the canoe back to my folks’ house. there's a little traveling carnival in town. this really funny little carnival. it was a hot and humid summer night and the carnival is in town, so we meet all of these older guys. he and i go and get the beer and they have cars. neither of us do. so they think this is wonderful, free beer. there’re two cases. so, they grab that and grab al and ditch me. because why would you want this little kid along anyway? so i am devastated and just go home. but it kind of cemented in me that i drink enough to have that same feeling again. it was like, why would you have to pay to feel like this? in a way... oh yeah. and it kind of remained that way. i did pay for drugs and alcohol when i had to, but as much as i could, i didn't. it became this really strange pattern. anyway. i was on the basketball team. it must have been in eighth grade and i was playing well enough that i could be on the junior varsity. practice was going really well, and i did a lot of basketball in the front yard. i was in a car accident. i was with a friend... it couldn't have been eighth grade, i would have had to have been older. i'm jumping around a bit… my friend was driving. he was older than me. wayne was older than me. we went to a party and there was a keg and sweet corn, which is not that uncommon. we had one beer each. so just one beer. it was his car. we had heard about another party where there were more kids our age that we knew. in particular, there were some girls that we knew. so, we decide, let's go there. wayne is driving on a country road that neither of us know. we don't really know where we are when trying to find this party. we come over a hill and it is dark. when we come back down there is a t in the road, right in front of us. he tried to make the corner. it was gravel roads. he didn't and we rolled through a really steep ditch. i broke my collarbone. and no seatbelts, so we bounced all over as we rolled and then we landed on the wheels. i didn't notice it initially, i just was shocked. and then all of the sudden i realized, ""man"", i didn't realize it was my collar bone, but it was really painful. so, we get back in the car. it was a really steep ditch, it had to be six to ten feet that we were down in this thing. he is rocking back and forth, rocking back and forth and then he just guns it and we somehow... he tried a couple times and we didn't get out... so suddenly he just really guns it and we fly up on the road, right over the road into the other ditch right on the other side. [laughter] this time, the car goes in and it is stuck. it is not coming out [laughter]. so, we walk to a farm house and we get a ride into town from the family who drop us off downtown in stewartville, but i am in need of medical care and there is nothing in stewartville. none of these older guys agree to bring me to the hospital. it's pretty late at night at this point... i've been drinking, even though i had just had the one beer… right. right, i didn't want to tell anybody. and finally, i am desperate, so i tell a police officer. he must have smelled beer. he is really strict and angry about it. he agrees to take me up to mayo, st. mary's hospital. he just dropped me off at the er. doesn't ever mention the beer or anything, but he just brings me there and drops me off. so i get the collarbone x-rayed and set, and then my parents get involved because i am at the hospital. i end up at home. the beer never gets mentioned by anybody. [laughter] but that fall, between the start of school and christmas that year, i was in six car accidents. i was driving in two of them. by the end of it, i was absolutely frightened to go in car, except for my father's. six. yeah. yeah. a couple of times. a couple completely unimpaired. it was awful. yeah, so my girlfriend at the time, he parents said that she could not date me. i was just a ""whatever"", i don't know, i was dangerous. and i couldn't even go in a car, i really couldn't. actually, wayne, the guy that was driving in that episode, he convinced me that we gotta go skiing. we were going to drive over to lake city to frontenac’s ski area and i just said, ""i can't do it."" i had been putting it off for a couple weeks because i just couldn't get in a car. i was too scared to get in a car. and finally, i said, ""okay, if i drive, i'll go."" and i drove like thirty miles per hour [laughter] even slowing down around corners and hills. he was like, ""we're never even going to get there."" he finally just got mad and said he had to drive because i was going so slow. so, he drove and i managed to somehow get there without being too freaked out by it. so then, that is right in the middle of getting high all the time, which kind of relieves some of that. at that age, all you can do is go get high in a car. that's what we did. we would just go drive around the country and stop some place and drink and get high. it was always in cars. well you would think so, but it was just that one four-month period. no more after that. even though i was way more intoxicated... yeah. that's my life basically. and ultimately, one christmas vacation my senior year, somebody i knew... i can't remember who. but they were dealing speed and he asked me if i wanted to help him out. so, i said, ""sure."" i had no money again, like usual. by doing so, if i sold it for this price, i would either get a little bit of money out of it and pay him this amount, or i could have some of the speed. so, i did both, kind of somehow. i paid him what i owed him. but i was doing speed consistently for christmas break, so for maybe two weeks. which i had never done before. i would do it once in a while, but... yeah. and i ran out the day before school started and i didn't think that was a problem. i didn't know there was such a thing as amphetamine withdrawal. so, i get to school the next day and i am crashing. that's what they call it, crashing. i had no energy, i actually pretty much passed out in my precalculus class with my favorite teacher. i'm on my desk and i am just asleep, and i hear a yardstick slam on the desk and i just kind of look up momentarily and i just went right back out. so, he got me to the school nurse, which they still had. she sent me to the local doctor, dr. risser, who immediately sent me up to st. mary's hospital again at mayo. and they think i've either got encephalitis or meningitis. no one asks me anything about drugs or alcohol. not a word. not a single question. yeah, they did a spinal tap. and i don't know what is going on. i probably would not have said anything if they had asked, but i didn't know that amphetamine withdrawal did this to people. so, i am just like, ""what the hell is going on with me?"" i thought it was the amphetamine, but i didn't know. so, i go through this whole thing. the spinal tap leaks, which was probably because i was so debilitated. it meant that i got these horrible headaches every time i sit up or stand up because it was dripping out, not a lot, but it was. when you get a spinal tap, if you lose a little bit of fluid, which because of the pressure differentiation, it causes really bad headaches. it stuck around for a while because of the leak. it should have gone away within a day or so. so, i can't sit up, i can't stand up, i gotta lay down or i'll get a terrible headache. and they sent me home because there was nothing wrong. they couldn't figure it out. now i'm fine, except for the headache, which they caused! right? [laughter] so, i go home... my mom would go out for whatever, go visit friends or go to the grocery store or something. i would call my friend dave and have him pick me up. i would lay in his old chevy and i would go out and get high with him and then try and get back before my mom got back and pretend that i had been there the whole time. this goes on for a little while, and then the headaches went away. i told my mother that the headaches went away and i told the school that i was still at home. then i just didn't go to school and it was great, until my folks figured it out and then i had to go to school.  they... my dad gave me his old volkswagen when he got a new car, and they found in it that fall, before this christmas break, some kind of a pipe and papers. so, they assumed i was smoking pot. i don't know what else they knew. no, i mean i got in some trouble for that, but not much. it was like, not that big of a deal. so, yeah, they had no clue the extent of it. but they were getting increasingly concerned, i know that much. it's a finnish family, so they're not talking a whole lot. and i want nothing to do with talking, with them about anything, but certainly not about this. so, i am playing this game and i go to school finally, but i'm still getting high every day. but i'm attending at least. i had a physics class and i really enjoyed that, too. the teacher asked me to go to the board to do these problems the day before we had a test. i was the only one in the class who knew how to do them. and i'm up there writing them out... they were easy to do because i had done my homework the night before. i had done some speed the night before, it was the first time since this happened. i am at home, i don't know why, but because for some reason, i did my homework. and i'm all prepared! i'm up at the board writing it all down the next day. that night i went out and got wasted smoking pot, no speed, i don't know if there was alcohol. i get to class the following day for the test, and the only thing that goes on my paper is my name. i cannot remember how to do the problems that i was up at the board doing the day before, because of the pot, you know. so, i am just ashamed of myself. my grades haven't really shifted much. school wasn't that difficult, i didn't study, but i was always able to maintain them [grades]. well, i couldn't. i couldn't even answer one question. i walked out of the class and i walked out of school and i was so ashamed. i decided i wasn't going back. i didn't think it through that way, what i thought was ""i'm going to go get high and i'm not going back."" yeah. i just left and it was over. i quit school that day without a declaration or anything. i just didn't go back. i told my parents i wasn't going to go back. i moved out of the house for a little bit, like two doors down at this older guy's basement. i had no money. not really. yeah, i think that was part of it. if i left, they couldn't do anything about it, right? so, i just left. and this family had very little money and they let me in. but i had no money and i'm just a freeloader, so that didn't last long. so, i moved back home, but i am now adamant that i'm not going to school. i think that's when they realize that this is really trouble.  but it still goes on for quite a while before anything happens. and i am just dawn to dusk now. until late at night, i am just getting high all the time and hanging out with people doing the same, like i said, i had to. but the shame and guilt is just massive. i can't stand myself. i don't know what's wrong. i don't know that it is the drugs and alcohol. in fact, i think that is the only relief i get. i really don't think that it is the problem. i think there is a big problem. i can't understand why i keep doing these things that i am so ashamed of, you know, stealing and lying. i've quit school, which i loved. i've been kicked out of sports by this point, which i really loved. and i don't know how to change any of this. i can't do anything about it, and that, i do not understand. i'm not really even able to have plans, i couldn't figure out how to do it. i didn't know. i didn't have a clue and i couldn't tell anybody. i didn't want anyone to know how awful i felt. and then i got home at four in the morning one night and my mother wakes me up with the local doctor, dr. riser. all i remember him saying is, ""yeah, he's on something."" and then i passed back out. and i ran home from a friend's house that night at like four in the morning because i had been drinking and smoking pot and i had done some speed and i was scared i would not fall asleep if i didn't run home. i drank a lot to be sure that i could pass out, which was kind of what i had become. that was my pattern, to try and pass out so i wouldn't lay there and think about myself, because it was so painful. so, i get home and i pass out. at six, they wake me up. i am barely conscious. i go back out and i don't know when, but i wake up and the local minister and my mom wake me up and they say, ""we're going to the hospital."" and i... i was just out of it. it doesn't even occur to me that this is unusual. i just put my clothes on, like, ""okay, we're going to the hospital."" i wasn't going to talk to them or ask them questions. [laughter] so i get in the car and we drive, stewartville is just south of rochester. we drive to rochester, thinking we're going to mayo, that's where we always get our healthcare, but we don't. we go pick my dad up at ibm. and then, we go north towards the twin cities. and that's just weird. well no, not really. i am in this debilitated state. just kind of intoxicated and wiped out. i learned later that the minister was right behind me in the car, thinking that if i jumped out, they would be able to grab me. which at the time, hadn't even crossed my mind. i'm not even thinking, let alone acting. so, we get to minneapolis/st. paul and i'm thinking, ""i wonder why we are going to a hospital in the twin cities."" those are the only thoughts i'm having. yeah, i was not thinking clearly or much. then we get passed the twin cities and that's when i got really frightened. in my understanding of what was going on with me, i just thought i was going crazy. that was my high school understanding of my behavior. i am just going crazy and that they finally figured it out. and now they are taking me to a sanitarium in the north woods. right, yeah. i don't know what it is. i've never been to one, but i am just assuming that must be what they do with people like me. but they kind of did! they brought me here! [laughter] not really, but you know. yeah, i had never heard of hazelden when we drove down the driveway and i saw the sign. i was like, ""what the hell is a hazelden?""  1974. yeah. right before easter. i am seventeen. yeah, they put me in a room with a counselor, who is the first person who i have ever met in my life that actually knows what is going on with me. it is just uncanny to me. i am shocked by this. he knew addiction, right? and i didn't. so, i am just wondering who told him this, because i never tell my parents any of this, they couldn't have told him this. no one could have told them this, i know that much. but he knows me somehow. he knows what i have been going through and what i have been doing, in this really unusual way. and he is really pleasant and likable. and he kind of knows me. so, i tell him some things that i have never told anyone. not much, but at least a little bit that i am clearly an addict in his mind. and he said, ""okay."" and we finished the interview and we go out to meet my parents and there are a bunch of other people and they say that i've got to sign these papers, so i can stay and get treatment for chemical dependency, which was the terminology of the day. and i say, because i am not staying here because i realize i am not going to do this, i probably thinking that i wouldn't get high today, i think i was. but it was mostly like, i do not want to stop getting high. i certainly don't want to stay here. i have never even heard of this. and it's a threat in a way. in a big way. so, i refuse. and this is when my bluff was called because i don't think they could have done this, but my dad says, ""if you don't sign the papers, we're all going to meet in court and you will be forced in here."" i don't believe that it could have happened, cause when i got into training later, that wasn't even possible in the eighties. no. no, so i'm thinking when he said that, the last thing i want is to be in any legal situation, in court. you've got to be kidding! i'm a drug addict! right. i can't admit to this. so, i can't go to court. so, i say ""okay."" and i sign the papers and i stay. and i am put on the men's unit, in the original farm house that hazelden started in, in 1949. yeah. that was a unit. this building wasn't here, but the parts that were left of the other buildings were built in 1969. so, i am here in 1974, but they were still using the original farm house as a men's unit. that's where they put me. and i find out later that, that unit, called ""the old lodge"" was for people who had multiple treatments and really hardcore addicts. and they put me there because they didn't know what to do with a seventeen-year-old. five years later, i find out i was the first adolescent to ever be treated here. and that's where they put me. so, i am with all of these older guys, i am the youngest by a long shot. and i argue that i don't belong there at all.  yeah, two weeks. it wasn't a long time. i was here for four weeks, but the first two i argued. you know, ""i don't have this chemical dependency."" i still have the big book of alcoholics anonymous that they gave me, and the twelve by twelve, the twelve steps and twelve traditions. in the margin of the first step in the twelve steps and twelve traditions, i have these little cryptic notes about why i don't belong here, why i'm not an alcoholic. yeah. [laughter] it is. so, every day we would have to fill out something called a significant events sheet, just something we learned today or something we had experienced today. and every day, mine was why i don't belong here. i am making my argument day in and day out, based on the books and my experience and what people say. and i am fairly bright guy, and i am writing this up every day. and every morning, there was an intercom system that would say, ""marvin seppala, please come to the unit office."" [laughter] and it's my councilor, who sits me down to talk over my argument with me. it was never a bullying thing or us butting heads, he is just suggesting that my argument is not right. and he is doing it in a way that makes sense and i just don't care and i don't belong here anyways, so i'm not going to listen. this is the wonderful thing about group therapy for addiction, actually, is that in the midst of this resistance on my part that i might be an addict, that i can't even see, i can absolutely see it in everyone else in the group. i mean they are describing it. even if they believe it or not, i can see it. i mean, they have given all of these examples, you know? they've described their life and they should be here because of what they have been doing. and they're a lot older, but they have lost their jobs, they have lost families, and all of these things. i can see it in them. and then it finally starts to dawn on me that all of these examples that i am using about them are the same examples in my life, you know. whether they have pointed it out or my councilors have pointed it out, or that i have thought it through, which was not much. it is exactly the same. it finally occurred to me. i go to my councilor and tell him that i finally believe that i have this chemical dependency, whatever that is, and that i have to do something about it, and he kicked me out of his office. he said, ""you finally realized the only way out of here."" [laughter] which truly was not the case. oh, yeah. yeah, it was like that one day and then the next day it was like, ""wait a minute."" so, i talked to my peers and they were like, ""well it does seem like you kind of changed your tune about this."" so, they just took me in, and they had all along. which was the most amazing thing about being here, is that they accepted me, which wasn't happening much in my life. they understood what i was going through, which i wasn't telling anybody. not even my closest friends understood me. and they valued what i said, which wasn't happening with anyone i knew. and they validated my experience, which i couldn't even understand because i didn't know what i was doing or why. they understood that and validated that for me. they cared about me. that is what got my attention. in addition to that, the other councilor on the unit was ed jergins. he was this really big, bald, scandinavian. and my dad and my grandfather are both bald scandinavians, so i wanted nothing to do with ed. he scared me. my father and my grandfather were pretty mean, stoic, finns, right? so, i assume he is exactly the same. he is bigger than those two. so, i stay away from him. then, i'm in group, and this was before that i even figured out that i had this. ed is sitting there and his eyes are closed and i assume this old guy is sleeping. he was all drooped. he is supposed to be the councilor and he looks like he is fast asleep. this guy is talking about his marriage and how he wants to get a divorce, and all of the sudden, ed starts talking from this position. he raises his head and starts to open his eyes and he has heard every single bit of this. he wasn't sleeping at all. and he expresses this most incredible statement about this guy. just this really supportive statement and then talks to the whole group in this incredibly loving manner and then he starts talking about love, which i have never heard a male talk about in my life. and that got my attention. it was unbelievable. then after witnessing him do this a few times, and i realize that he talks about spirituality and love all the time, and that, i wanted that. i didn't want to get sober, but i wanted that. then i wanted that and i wanted to get sober. and i was also starting to experience whatever that was from those guys who were really serious about getting sober too, at least the small group of guys i would stay up at night with and talk about things with. which was just amazing. we talk about life, really, for the first time in my life. i had a few friends that i could do that with on occasion, but it almost wasn't even real. it was during this period in my life where i was just getting high all the time, so i'm just a mess anyways. i don't know what i was saying or thinking. sometimes i felt like there was really a bond there with ed and with this group. so, i really decided that i've got to do something. but that wasn't enough. i was scared to leave, because four weeks really isn't enough. it goes by quick. and it was four weeks, whether you needed it or not. it was twenty-eight days back then, and that was it. there was no follow up of any kind for a seventeen-year-old in rochester, minnesota. they told me to go to aa. this is the only thing, this is it. there wasn't anything else. there really wasn't anything else in 1974. so, they told me to go to aa, and they would have anyway, but that was the only thing. and there is no aa in stewartville. they get me back into high school and back into my house with my family. i wasn't really out of the house, that was part of the deal, i would live at home. i went back to school and they told me not to hang out with my old friends because they are all using. so, this is a long time in the early part of my life... good deal, okay. so, i go to school and it's a small town and a small school. one hundred in my graduating class. the people who i am not supposed to hang out with, i just stay away from. i am trying to do it. and the people who don't use drugs, especially, want nothing to do with me. and there were all of these rumors about where i had gone and what i had done. just wild rumors. people had told their kids to stay away from me. you know, it was a small town. so, i am kind of ostracized. yeah, i was alone. and it hit me rather quickly. i was already sensitive to such things anyway, and i never really felt like i had belonged that much. i had some friends that were kind of close, but very few and they were all using, so i couldn't hang out with them anyway. on the weekend before i left, that prior week before i left treatment, i really worried about going home. i don't know that i am ready. i am just really scared but i just really want to leave. both are going through my head. and i see an ad for a marshall tucker band concert in the twin cities. so, i decide, that is a great idea, which is really the last thing i should be doing because i had never gone to a concert without being wasted. somehow, i don't know how it happened, i think it was after i got home, i convinced my best friend using dave, that we should go see marshall tucker. and this is after these few days of trying to be alone, i decide i am going to go to something with dave and go see marshall tucker. so, we get tickets. as we are driving to minneapolis/st paul, he is driving, and smoking pot and drinking. and i am sitting there and telling him all about treatment and why i can never use again. i am like lecturing the whole way to minneapolis/st. paul and i tried also to convince him, because he is my best friend who is doing exactly what i do, that he has to stop as well, right? so, he doesn't buy that at all. he doesn't argue with me because most of what i am saying seems to make sense to him, just not for him. it does for me but not for him. so, we get to the concert, we meet some other people there. and there's pot being passed up and down the row and a joint comes by and i took it and smoked it. i took some, and then more, and then had some beer, and i don't know what else. i was just right back to where i was, just like that. not any thought about it. didn't even feel bad about it until later. when we get in the car and we're going back, i finally realize what i have done. i think i was trying to convince myself in telling dave not to let anybody know that this has happened. that was how i was all along anyway. i tried so hard to not let anyone know about this, so i could live this double life of getting good grades, at least when i was in school, until i quit, and getting still high. so, i'm telling him that he can't tell anybody. and i am kind of thinking that i won't keep doing this. but it was over. i was right back at it the next day with him. and everything i had told him on the way up was like a distant memory. i was just off and running. i got to go through the graduation ceremony with my class but i didn't get a diploma. i did go to school until graduation. i showed up. they even let me on the track team and i was pretending to.... i was smoking cigarettes and pot and drinking. i was a mess. they really figured it out and they disowned me and kicked me out. they told me they wouldn't pay for my education. just a few weeks after the graduation ceremony. so, in june. they got me a job with our next-door neighbor who was a contractor and i quit going. i never quit a job and i never got fired, i just never showed up. so, i had some other job after they booted me out at crenlo (spelling?) that built tractor cabs in rochester. when they kicked me out, i took my volkswagen, threw my stuff in it and moved to rochester. you can call that a move when you drive eleven miles without a place to land and just bum from friend to friend and live out of the car. i got this job at crenlo and then i quit going there. every time i would just some money and get high and not go back. i had no thoughts about a future, really. i just assumed i was going to die really young. i didn't think i would survive. not graduating from high school was kind of meaningless, in spite of the fact that i had been to treatment. that was the only thing-- like i said, i hated lying in bed without being able to fall asleep. well, it was even worse now, because i knew there was another way for me. morning and evening were really bad. i failed to mention that my girlfriend at the time, linda, came to treatment and visited me. and so did wayne, the guy in that car accident. they were the only two people. she was the only girl who came to visit, besides my family. and she and i were dating afterwards as well. she didn't know what to make of all of this. she thought i shouldn't use because of what i had been told, but didn't know anything about it either, except what i told her, basically. which when i was in treatment, was pretty accurate. so, i'm kind of living with her more than the other people at the time. my dad was at ibm, so i knew they wouldn't give me a job. mayo and ibm were the two primary employers. so, i go to mayo and i apply to be a janitor and they sent me away. they didn't have a job. i lied and said i graduated from high school. two weeks later, they called my mom and got a hold of linda who found me, and they said to go back in for an interview. they sent me over to a cardiovascular research lab where i am hired by david donald, who is this world-famous physiologist, as a lab technician. the way i look at this, i said i was attracted to ed and his discussion of love and spirituality, and the same discussions i had with people in treatment. i look at it as even before i began to care for myself, i was being cared for in really miraculous ways. i get into treatment when i was seventeen, when i shouldn't even be there. then, i get this job. i stayed sober for five days after treatment. that was it. i get this job and i stayed sober for two weeks. and my intent was just to stay sober. i tried as hard as i could and it lasted two weeks. on the first day on the job, it was an animal surgery lab, so we were studying a lot about hypertension and its causes and cardiac function and stuff. people from all over the world came to work under dr. donald and dr. shepard, who were the two leaders of the lab that i was assigned to. dr. donald is this eccentric old physiologist. he was trained as a veterinarian, but he became a physiologist and helped invent the heart-lung machine. john shepard was the president of the american heart association at the time and he was on the board of governors and the board of trustees at the mayo clinic. he was really one of the top administrators, the top docs in the whole place, and famous world-wide for research. so, suddenly, there is this drug addict working in their lab. on the first day that i was there... at this time i had turned eighteen. at the end of the day when they were orienting me to the job, it wasn't them, it was the other technicians, one of the technicians said, ""and there's the drug cabinet and you have to make sure that it is locked at the end of the day."" [laughter]  yeah, it was one of my jobs. yeah, and i'm thinking, there's no one that is going to pay more attention to that cabinet. so, i last two weeks and we were studying cocaine. i was weighing out cocaine for experiments. cocaine is a vasoconstrictor and it does it in a very specific manner. we were studying how veins and arteries constricted and cocaine helped us to understand that process, physiologically to figure it out. so, i took some. then i just took more and more, and over a few-weeks-period, i am just addicted to cocaine, in a way that i have never been addicted to anything. i am using a lot of it because i can just grab it out of the cupboard. it's right back to something that isn't being paid for. no one is monitoring it. i am the only one monitoring it. there is no monitoring of any kind. no. i have no idea. dr. shepard was out of the country when dr. donald hired me. so, he hired me. i did, i applied to be a janitor. so, actually, the day i started is when they told me about the drug cabinet. the next day, second day at work, i realize that i have got to tell them that i haven't graduated from high school. i didn't tell dr. donald, i went to the hr department and said, ""i haven't graduated from high school."" i didn't say that i lied, but i did. i made up another lie about why i didn't, this big family problem of some sort of why i missed half of my senior year. i don't mention that i went to addiction treatment or anything. they still give me the job. they didn't even bock. they we're just like, ""it's okay."" i don't have a clue how this happened. i knew no one who worked at mayo, no one in my family. i can only say again that i think i was being taken care of. so, i just plummet with my addiction and i miss a week of work. which doesn't seem like a lot, but i knew they warned me that i had a three-month probationary period. they could fire me or i could just leave, no questions asked. which i kind of liked, because that is how i left jobs anyways. i didn't know that i was going to like this job. it turns out from the first moment i walked into that lab, i loved this job. it was like unbelievable to me. i was stimulated in a way that i hadn't ever been in my whole life. well, yeah. i had to assist in surgery on animals, mostly dogs but sometimes cats. i would stand right across from the doctor or some fellows from all over the world. i was either assisting a fellow or dr. donald. one or the other. and they would tell me about the experiments and they would tell me what we were doing and why. it was just fascinating to me. i wanted to learn about it. physiology, i found really interesting. it explains things, right? i just found it incredible and i really liked these people too. they cared about me. it was somewhat similar to my experience in treatment, but remarkably, there wasn't really anything at an interpersonal level, but it was in way because it was more about knowledge. but they also cared about me in other ways, like how come i'm not seeking college? and what do you think about going on to school someday? even at the very beginning. dr. donald in the interview asked me how long i would commit to the lab. i remember this question because that prior summer, i had gone to a recruiting thing in the twin cities with a friend to join the army. i was so desperate. the vietnam war was over, but it was still a mess. they put us up in a hotel and of course we just drank and goofed off. i had a physical the next day and in the physical, my hearing was inadequate. i had hearing loss that i didn't know about until that moment. so, they told me that i would have to sign a release if i wanted to be in the army because they didn't want to cover my hearing. so, i just couldn't imagine that. for some reason, that stopped me. i didn't want to sign this release. but dave went into the army. my best friend. so, i tell dr. donald that i just recently looked into going into the army for two years, so i'll stay two years. that was as far as i could think about my life. you've gotta be kidding me, like how long am i going to stay here? two years. i told him the story even, i just looked into going into the army but i couldn't because i have a hearing loss and i couldn't do it without a release and i didn't think that was wise. so, it turns out that he was in the royal airforce. he didn't tell me that then, i learned it later. way later, at that talk that you said you were watching, after i gave that talk and i walked behind the stage, and a woman from mayo's development department, a young woman, came up to me. i had just seen saturday night for the second time ever. and she tells me that my father and i have just bought dr. donald's old house, that he had died and had donated his house to oxbow park in biren, minnesota, just outside of rochester, because it was right adjacent from the park. he is a really eccentric guy. he just lived out in the woods and he was really odd that way. she said that we're going to turn it into a halfway house. she said because my father is in recovery and he wants to do that and i am going to help him with it because it is really important to me as well. and dr. donald was in recovery from alcoholism. well, he wasn't in recovery when i met him because on rare occasion, he had a terrible tremor in the morning doing surgery. i noticed it just a few times, but somehow, we connected. most of these fellows came there to work under him and john shepard, but none of them could really get along with him. and i got along with him fantastic. somehow, he hires me. i have no clue. i always tell people that i think he was playing a joke on john shepard because he was out of the country. i never saw him out of three-piece suit. he's like mr. clean. dr. donald wore a white lab coat and had white athletic tape around his shoes holding them together. he is just this eccentric, brilliant guy. so, i always thought, ""what the hell, he just hired me so he could give shepard a hard time with this hippy drug-addict kid."", that he didn't know was a drug addict at the time. i had long hair, i didn't look like anyone else in the lab. [laughter] and there i was. i miss a week of work and i am so scared to lose the job. i am getting desperate. i had a big supply that i grabbed. so, i was gone but i still had a supply. my folks had disowned me. i didn't get back into the house for two years.yeah. after a while, it was both parties’ kind of contributing. like, i wasn't going to go back there either. there was no invitation either. yeah, it was. it was also probably good for my siblings because i was stealing from them too. i was just a disaster. and i was certainly not being the role model of the kind that they needed. i never talked to my father, but in this desperation, i called him, which still kind of surprises me when i say it even. i tell him exactly what is going on. i am stealing cocaine from the mayo clinic, i am scared i am going to lose this great job and i don't want to lose it, and i don't know what to do. he had, in the meantime since i had last seen him when he kicked me out, helped start this adolescent counseling center in rochester and he was on the board of it. it was for kids with drug and alcohol problems. it was call sunrise. he says, ""i'll meet you tonight and we'll talk about this."" i tried to put it off because i didn't want to talk to him. i would call, but that was as far as i was going to go. and i am thinking, if i meet him tonight, then... i can't use. so, i don't want to meet him. somehow, i agreed. we meet and then he brings me to sunrise and he says that i can talk to somebody there about this. and he knows that he is not the right person, too. i meet jane, a counselor, who talks to me and i go back the next night and i don't do any cocaine. and i go back the next night, and i realize that this place just opened and that she was a social worker. i learned that later when she worked at hazelden and so did i. [laughter] but i realized that i know more about she does about addiction. more than anyone there does, just from my one month of treatment, i know way more than they know. in treatment, they told me the only thing that is going to work is going to aa and i have not done that. so, i go there one night that first week and i tell them that this is not going to work for me. i didn't tell them that i think i know more about it than they do. i felt like i did. i think i actually did, honestly. i am going to go to aa like they told me to when i was in treatment. ",56101
"1712","doc 2674","[end of part i, beginning of part ii]",37
"1713","doc 2675","ms: so, i say that i am going to go to aa. and i am sure they are thinking that this guy is not going to aa, right? they think that i am just going to go get high again and then he is gone. and i didn't go back, so they never found out actually, until i met her much later. ",274
"1714","doc 2677","ms: i did. i went to an aa meeting that sunday morning in this club house, the only one that i was aware of at the time in rochester. i don't think there was another one. it was on third avenue. there were three guys there over seventy. ",237
"1715","doc 2679","ms: that was the group i walked into. yeah, and i don't know what they said, i cannot remember. but i went back the next sunday.",128
"1716","doc 2681","ms: that's all that was recommended. once a week. that’s what people did back then. ",84
"1717","doc 2683","ms: 1974... no, 1975... ",24
"1718","doc 2685","ms: no, it was '74 still. ",26
"1719","doc 2687","ms: and people went to one aa meeting a week. that is what they did and that is what they told me. come on back next week. that is how you went to aa then. ",156
"1720","doc 2689","ms: that was reinforced over time too. if things are really, really bad, maybe you go to another one. maybe you call your sponsor and talk to people. but you couldn't really go to another one. ",193
"1721","doc 2691","ms: because i moved around with school, you know, so all the sudden i was in places where people went a lot. i didn't know about that transition. ",146
"1722","doc 2693","ms: so, i go back and these guys... i mean, i felt really connected with these guys. it was that same description in treatment. they understood me, they accepted me, they validated me, they valued what i had to say. i hardly talked, but they listened. they supported me and cared for me in ways that i was completely lacking. i hadn't had experience with it, so i went back. and whatever i wasn't getting at sunrise, i got at aa that morning. i know i got it. i got there out of pure desperation. i called my dad, i went to this sunrise place. i walk into aa, which i was supposed to do after treatment months before. ",618
"1723","doc 2695","ms: right. right back to the home where everything went on and school where everything went on. so, aa was like an oasis or something for me. these people really understood me and really cared for me. the meeting grew rather quickly, so it came to be men and women. there were several women in this meeting. it never got big, twelve or fourteen people maybe. but there was a police officer, a real-estate agent, and a teacher. a couple of docs started showing up, a nurse was there. there was nobody my age. nobody even close. so, i was going to aa, staying sober, working in the lab, and then trying to figure out what to do with myself. i was living with linda by this time. i learned how to fly-fish with a guy who worked in a different lab. i always wanted to fly-fish for some reason. i was doing that a lot in the spring and summer, because i could. i did it by myself because i had no other friends my age, really. there were two other guys, one worked in the lab and one worked with the animals in the kennels and stuff that were close to my age. one was about my age and the other was a little bit older. so, they kind of became friends, but beyond that, i was mostly by myself and with linda, trying to stay sober, going fishing or whatever. and the meeting grew and because i was so young, there was a lot of parenting in addition to everything else that goes on in aa. ",1381
"1724","doc 2697","ms: yeah, just because... because, i was a kid. ",48
"1725","doc 2699","ms: yeah, it was. it was great. i know in a lot of treatment now, it is important to separate adolescents from adults, but there's something to it. i really got a lot out of it. so, i am going weekly and i am going on six months. i am feeling better than i have in my life. my job is great. i am just having a ball at work, in a lot of ways. i am getting close to a couple of these fellows and i really enjoy my work and i really got it down. i am able to learn some stuff too. one thing that dr. donald did, two things: at the end of an experiment, after animal surgery, you know it is just a mess. so, my job is to clean it all up, right? and wash all of the instruments and prepare for the next day, for the next surgery. but, if he did the experiment or if it was in his lab, he stayed and did all of that with me or with the other technician. if he stayed, the fellows stayed. so, it was this whole group of people gets done really quick and everybody goes to their offices except us and we stay in the lab to go do other things, because there is a lot to do. and when he didn't stay, the fellows all disappeared too. there were no rules about this of any kind, but it was absolute. if he wasn't there, they didn't stay. he was remarkable that way. and then we had a monday morning lab meeting, every monday morning. and they would present their research and they would present their speeches they were about to give at conferences. they would just talk, have these remarkable discussions about physiology and about what they were doing and ideas. what else we can do? how can we solve this problem? for me, it was just fantastic. it was just fascinating. in one of the early meetings that i attended, dr. donald presented a talk he was about to give at a major medical conference. it was something about cardiac physiology. so, he presents the whole thing and usually when they presented, then everyone there, the six or seven people in the room, would start asking questions and commenting about the topic. he immediately stopped and then said, ""marvin, what did you get out of my talk?"" and i'm like, ""what?"" i'm still... i have no self-confidence, i am really shy. i don't want to answer this question. but i do, i tell him what i got out of the talk, you know? i am wondering, why would he ask me? in the process of asking me, he engaged me. you know? i am a part of this team, which was amazing. i felt that, too. and after i said my answer, he said, ""that's good, i'm glad because i am going to be talking to a group of physicians that are not physiologists and i gotta be sure that i can explain it in a way that they will understand. and if you do, they will!"" [laughter] and i'm like, ""wow. this is incredible."" i was valued in a way that i didn't expect. it was just an amazing experience. ",2806
"1726","doc 2700","so, i am being influenced by science in the lab, but also by people and caring. and in aa i am being influenced by the twelve steps and love and spirituality, i think. my life grows in all of those spheres. i am six months in and, like i said, i am feeling better than i ever have in my life. i miss a sunday morning. i just don't go. i didn't consciously decide not to go, i don't even know why i didn't go. i was just feeling so good i didn't go, thinking that i didn't really have to. sunday, i miss. monday, i open the cabinet, grab some cocaine and walk to the bathroom. and it wasn't even on my mind. there was no deliberate plan of any kind. what i didn't recognize in that moment, is that those three guys at the first meeting, had died in that six-month period. they were like these angels. they just disappeared. they died. and i didn't even think of it, it didn't even occur to me that this was an issue or a problem for me. i was so self-focused, so self.... i didn't go to funerals, i didn't even think of them, i didn't do anything because i didn't think it bothered me a bit. ",1091
"1727","doc 2702","ms: yeah. and there i was using. i didn't think that had anything to do with it. it took me years to figure out... which is weird to say that. ",143
"1728","doc 2704","ms: [laughter] yeah, maybe that has something to do with it. so, i had been meaning to ask this guy john to be my sponsor. and the reason i hadn't is because i hadn't done anything besides just show up at the meeting. i didn't read about it, i didn't socialize with anyone, i didn't do any of the steps. ",304
"1729","doc 2706","ms: no, luckily. john was like thirty-five, i guess. he had five years sober and i always liked what he said. i just liked listening to him. he kind of talked from a similar spiritual perspective that i thought of. and so, i did the cocaine and i walked back into the lab and... this is the worst day of my life. six-months and i am no longer sober, and to me, i tried treatment and that didn't work, my own efforts got me two weeks, and aa got me six. that doesn't work either. and they didn't tell me anything else that i could do. there is nothing else that works. there is nothing else. i don't know of anything else. i was never exposed to anything else. i think that i am hopeless. i did as much as cocaine as i possibly could, more than any other day in my life. i didn't even notice it because the pain was so bad of losing that, of what i had. so, i call john from the lab and he worked just a few blocks away in downtown rochester. i didn't know that, but he said that he was just three blocks away from me. he said, ""come on over to my office."" i lied and said, ""i can't, i have to stay and work until 5. so, i am doing as much cocaine as i can and this doesn't work. the pain doesn't go away. so, i go to his office at five o'clock. he has to coach his son's pee-wee football team out in biren, so he asked me to follow him. so, we talked just really briefly and i just sit on the sideline and watch him coach football. then we go to his house. i tell him what i just told you. i went to treatment, that didn't work. aa doesn't work either. and thank god, john says, ""you know marv, aa works fine, you just haven't started."" and he said, ""you come to the meetings, but you're not working the steps, you're not reading the books, you're not talking to anybody, you're not sharing yourself with anybody. you need to start doing that. aa works fine. i'm proof."" ",1871
"1730","doc 2707","so, i said, ""okay."" and i did exactly what he said. i mean, when i say exactly, he gave me this worksheet. he went to hazelden, too.  which was also partially why i was attracted to him as a sponsor. this sheet was a ten-step inventory sheet. so, it had thirty-one days across the top and all of these columns and rows that had on one side, a list of liabilities, and the other side, a list of assets. the liabilities were like laziness, dishonesty.... they were listed there, like twenty or twenty-five adjectives. and then the assets were their opposites, basically. he said, ""fill this out every night."" in addition to everything else that he told me to do. and i filled it out every night for five years, because i was so scared that i would relapse. and then it got so wrote i had to change it around. but, early on, in those first months, i had a black and white description of my behavior to look at. i was putting a ""x"" by dishonesty every single day, day in and day out. and lazy, and other things. i could see it. i didn't have a sense of my own behavior and that gave it to me. ",1089
"1731","doc 2709","ms: everything. i just couldn't be honest. i was so dishonest for so long that it was almost a ritual. most of the time it didn't even make sense to be dishonest anymore, but i did. so, john, he kept telling me, ""you know marv, this is an honesty program."" and that's all he would say. it wasn't done in a confrontative way, it was just, ""marv, this is an honesty program."" and i would think, ""well, why would you tell me that?"" [laughter] and he kept doing it. and finally, i realized, because i am looking this end, hearing this question, that i am always dishonest. it's time to do something about it. he was an ideal person for me. he never confronted me. i would tell him something going on in my life, like i'm having trouble with my girlfriend linda, or whatever. and he would just tell me some story from his life. it would always have some connection to what i was talking about. but he wasn't analytical. you hear that a lot of people in aa are always just really, ""go work step two."" or something, or go do that. it was never like that with john, it was just like, ""well, this is what i did."" [laughter]",1114
"1732","doc 2711","ms: and i think for an adolescent, if he would have been telling me what to do, i don't know what i would have done. he had kids just a little younger than me. he had a daughter that was maybe two years younger than me-- the oldest. and then maybe two sons after her. i don't know what he was like at home really, but i wasn't that much different that his own kids. ",366
"1733","doc 2713","ms: i don't even remember. a long time.",39
"1734","doc 2715","ms: so, i stayed in the lab and then these docs kept asking me what i was going to do with my life, suggesting that i go to school. especially the fellows would talk like that with me. i got this envelope in the inner-clinic mail, you know? those yellow envelopes. it was addressed to dr. marvin seppala. i still have it actually. someone just made a mistake and put that on there. and i had already been thinking that i liked what these guys do, and so i started thinking that i wanted to be a doctor like them. so, i go to john one day and i tell him, ""you know, john. i gotta go to college because i want to be a doctor."" and this is within my first year of recovery. most recommendations are don't do anything big in your first year. but i'm not paying attention to that, i really think that i should go to college. i've wanted to go to college in some points in my life but i didn't think it was possible. during my use i had just given up on it. it was not going to happen. now, it was like, maybe i could go to college. and if john were to have doubted me in any way though, or doubted my ability to do it, i would have just crumbled. and he knew me as a high school drop-out. that was it. high school drop-out, works at mayo, comes to aa, that's it.",1257
"1735","doc 2716","so, i don't know what he was thinking when i say that i decide that i want to be a doctor. but he said, ""you know marv, if it is god's will, it will happen."" that's how he answered me. those are his exact words. and i thought, wow, i guess that it is true. if it is god's will, it will happen. so, i just hung on to it. i started looking into schools and trying to figure out where i wanted to and how i was going to do it. my parents, i didn't even ask for money. i hadn't even seen them. i had talked to my dad that one time and that was it. and i assumed they wouldn't help because they said they wouldn't help. and my younger brother was off at college at the university of minnesota and we didn't really have a lot of money, so i kind of thought that there was no use even going down that path. i hadn't had any contact with them. i assumed they would stick with what they said. ",884
"1736","doc 2717","so, my kids are in their thirties now, and they both applied to multiple schools, right? like eight schools or something. and i decided in the end... i talked to one of the fellows a little bit about applying to college, but i didn't really talk much about it. i just decided that i was just going to do it on my own for some reason. just stupidly, you know? so, i apply to one school. i apply to st. olaf and i decide if i get in, i get in and if i don't, i don't. and i got in. so, on my one-year anniversary from that six-month relapse, i walk into my first classes. the neat thing is that i was in this dorm with all of these guys and they are all coming to college like it is some free-for-all, and i'm trying to stay sober.",729
"1737","doc 2718","so, i go back to rochester on a lot of weekends because i want to go to aa on sunday morning, which i don't tell them, but i might have told some of them. i went to an aa meeting in town, in northfield, too. i was still dating linda. and those guys, like one time, i was studying in the library all evening, which i did a lot of because my memory was just kind of shot. by the end of the first semester though, it was beginning to be quite good. it took a lot of effort. and i walked back to the dorm and in the entry was a big lobby and they were having a christmas party. i start for the punch because it is supposed to be a dry campus. that's laughable. it wasn't a dry campus at all. there were drugs and alcohol everywhere. but five guys come out of all corners of the room as i am walking towards the punch and grab me, ""marv! marv! we spiked the punch! we spiked the punch! stay away from it!"" ",901
"1738","doc 2719","one time, the second semester, i was somehow... i don't know what was going on, i can't explain it, i don't remember what was happening. but i am in the room known for people who smoke pot all the time, right? and there are about six guys and they are handing a joint around. and i am sitting in there and i am not thinking about using or planning on using, but i am there, which makes no sense of all. so, i must in some way be thinking about using. my next-door neighbor in the dorm, jack, suddenly shows up in the door and says, ""marv, come here. i've gotta talk to you about something."" and he gets me out of there. jack and five or six of these guys and i still get together. [laughter] and he got me out of there, somehow. and i had told these guys my story. ",765
"1739","doc 2721","ms: well they just said, that makes sense marv, you shouldn't do that. that was their response! you just shouldn't do that! it was true. so, they were just really practical. and they had no experience with addiction of any kind. so, that's how that all went. linda and i had decided to get married after freshman year, just stupidly. we're twenty-years-old, we get married. neither of us have money. she was working but she wasn't in school. she was taking some classes at the junior college in rochester at the time. we decided that we would go to school together. [laughter] which sounds just crazy, and it was. but we go off to drake university in iowa and went there and it all went well. neither of us get any help from our parents. her folks really can't help her out, so we're just getting grants and loans and i'm doing work study and she is doing some work study, which was just basically just a job at the school. and we were able to make ends meet. we both went to school and then i graduated a year before she did and got into mayo. dr. shepard, while i was in college was named dean of education of the mayo clinic. when i applied to medical school, well, the dean of the medical school opens a letter from his boss... [laughter] i had done my part in college. ",1274
"1740","doc 2722","after that first semester was rough, i got mostly b's and then it was almost all a's. ",86
"1741","doc 2724","ms: yeah, i started medical school a year before she graduated, so she was still at drake and i had an affair with a classmate. we almost divorced. it was just horrible. i mean... it hurt both of us equally. it was just awful. somehow, we stayed together, and we've been married forty-one years. ",296
"1742","doc 2726","ms: i know! and we love each other! ",36
"1743","doc 2730","ms: it's true. but it's just getting better. ",45
"1744","doc 2732","ms: so, i don't know, it's almost 5:30pm. we should probably meet again. ",73
"1745","doc 2734","ms: yeah, cause that's the trouble talking about my story. ",59
"1746","doc 2742","bloomington, minnesota",22
"1747","doc 2746","ys: yes, that's correct. ",25
"1748","doc 2748","ys: yes, i have agreed to be interviewed. my name is yussuf shafie. i am the ceo and the director of alliance wellness center. ",127
"1749","doc 2750","ys: i am an immigrant. i came from somalia with my family here back in 2001. i came in with my brothers, sisters, mom, and dad. grew up in burnsville, minnesota. believe it or not when i came here i didn't even know how to speak english. i've come a long way. education was very important in my family. my mom made sure we all studied and went to college. i graduated from burnsville high school back in 2006. although i had been passionate about social work and mental health and addiction since i was a little kid, i don't know why. in our community there are people that have addiction or mental health issues and are stigmatized. i wanted to create awareness and educate folks. in order for me to do that i had to go to school. i went to inver hills community college for my associate's degree because i'm cheap [laughs] and it went really well. my first semester actually was horrible. i didn't do so well. i failed all of my classes. i was young, playing basketball, chasing girls. an immature eighteen-year old. i didn't do well. it messed up my confidence a bit, which was good. i think it's the best thing that's happened to me. ",1138
"1750","doc 2751","so that happened. i got a letter from financial aid saying they were going to take my financial aid away if i didn't get my grades up next semester. i thought about all the hard work that my mom has done for us and my family and how hard we worked. my second semester i worked really hard. i got my act together and got all as and bs, and i graduated in 2009. i went to metro state for my bachelor's in social work. ",416
"1751","doc 2753","ys: i was about ten, eleven years old. ",39
"1752","doc 2755","ys: it was kind of a blur. i was young and i don't remember much. it was a good life. we didn't have much, but we had enough. i've learned that we have a lot of privileges here in the us. health care, education, safety. it depends on where you're from. there are parts that are really great in somalia and there are parts that are—even before the civil war—there were a lot of great things. ",391
"1753","doc 2757","ys: actually i was born in kenya, but i was raised here in the us. i was born and raised in kenya, and then my mom and dad are from somalia so it was like a next door neighbor. when the civil war broke down all the people went to the neighboring countries. i speak swahili as well. i speak somali and swahili even though my swahili is only eighty percent now, or seventy percent. i'm kind of losing it. so yeah i was born and raised in kenya but my parents are somali. my mom traveled between somalia and kenya. it's like here to wisconsin kind of a thing. a little bigger, but you get the picture. people drove back and forth, and my mom was a businesswoman. ",660
"1754","doc 2759","ys: she ran a trucking business, which is not common for women to run that kind of business back home, but she was a hustler and that's where i get this working for myself. i've never believed in working for someone, or i've always been a risk taker and things like that, and that's where i get that from. that's a little bit about my childhood. came to the states, worked really hard, learned english in esl. i did go through a lot. ",434
"1755","doc 2761","ys: middle school and high school. ",35
"1756","doc 2763","ys: i got my bachelor's from metro state back in 2012, and then i decided if i wanted to do something i should go get my master's. i decided to go to the u [university of minnesota] and get my master's. when i was going to grad school my sister called me one day and she said, ""hey, we should open a somali restaurant in burnsville,"" and i'm like, ""you're crazy."" i hung up the phone. she called me back three times and i knew she was serious. in 2013 we started the restaurant and it did really well. it took off. we had a star tribune article, and some big publications in minneapolis st. paul magazine, and the dakota tribune, which was a big article in dakota county. we did really well, and that's how i got the money to start what i was passionate about with alliance. i did that for about two and a half years, and i thought, ""i don't want to do this."" i'm passionate about mental health and chemical dependency. ",920
"1757","doc 2764","back in 2015 when i graduated from grad school i worked in minneapolis public schools [mps] for about a year in cuhc [community university health care center] clinic for about a year in minneapolis where i learned a lot about addiction and mental health. it's an fqh, federally qualified health care center. it's owned by the university of minnesota technically. ",363
"1758","doc 2766","ys: yes. my msw [master’s in social work], lgsw [licensed graduate social worker]. i did my internship at cuhc, so i did a social work triage position for about eight hundred hours or whatever the internship was. after that they hired me as a mental health practitioner, so i was working there for about a year. i was in the process of starting alliance as well. kind of a lot going on at the same time. ",404
"1759","doc 2768","ys: it is. my sister manages it. it's about ten, fifteen minutes from here right in burnsville. if you look up african restaurant it will come up. i did that, and that's where i learned the business aspect of things. i'm a social worker, i can't do math. [laughs] but i learned all about managing budgets and things like that. i learned a lot from the restaurant and starting and being patient and things like that. ",416
"1760","doc 2770","ys: they are. they really are. food brings people together. i did that, graduated, and started alliance. i've been in business for about two and a half years now and we're doing really well. things are going really well for us. we have a day group, alliance wellness, that works with the east african population that is culturally specific. we have twelve beds where we lodge them, so they go into treatment and then they go to the house too. ",443
"1761","doc 2772","ys: a couple houses, yes. ",26
"1762","doc 2774","ys: of course. i think in our culture people are always skeptical about alcohol and drugs and any addiction. i think in our culture we have black and white thinking, which is never a good thing. either you're crazy or you're not. either you're a drunk or you're not. either you're a good person or you're a bad person. there's no in between. that's my biggest frustration. the religious aspect doesn't help. because you're a muslim you're not supposed to drink alcohol; it's forbidden. and i'm like why do we have fifteen clients in a group right now that are talking about alcoholism and addiction? and they're muslim. it's like the elephant in the room. the worst thing you could do is drink. it's like being the priest's daughter and getting pregnant. it's like the worst thing. ",782
"1763","doc 2776","ys: no, you're not. it's horrible. people are shunned, and it's pretty bad. especially for women. you're a woman, you're a person of color, you're a muslim, and you're an addict. it's like it's the worst thing. you're down on the bottom. i think education and awareness are the most important. these things are not going to go away. ",333
"1764","doc 2777","when you move to a culture—america is giving a lot of immigrants a lot of opportunities, but also you pick up the bad habits to some extents. ",142
"1765","doc 2779","ys: kids having sex before marriage, kids partying. back home it's more family oriented. you respect the elders and things. kids are just not that bright to be honest. with cell phone technology and things it makes things a lot easier. the stigma piece—i think people are just not educated and so they tend to judge and be judgmental. i think people don't even know what to do as well. they don't know how to deal with addiction—the families. and the clients, too. all this happens, you're in detox, you're miserable. and pride. we're very prideful people. like, ""do i want to get help? now yussuf will know my problem now. and he might know my mom or my dad."" ",661
"1766","doc 2781","ys: oh yeah. there are people that want to come help here. people might say, ""well, you're a somali. what's the big deal?"" yeah, but sometimes it might not be a good fit. just because you're somali doesn't mean they'd be a good fit. i always make that comment when i do conferences or talk to people. the assumption is that if you're from the same culture—",356
"1767","doc 2783","ys: i think education across the board is important. i'm a big advocate for that. ",82
"1768","doc 2785","ys: well, i know twenty people i can tell you about. a lot of them don't get support. in a western, white, american culture it's easier for someone to support you, or to come to aa with you and things like that. it's a little more socially acceptable. if your son or daughter is using you could kind of assist them and get them help. ",334
"1769","doc 2787","ys: for us, no. you're not helping at all. she doesn't even speak english. how's she going to help you get into treatment? or she doesn't understand it. ",153
"1770","doc 2789","ys: yeah. ""why don't you stop?"" and they always tell me that. ""if amy just stops drinking, she's really a good person."" well, yeah, but why is she drinking in the first place? let's find the underlying issue. amy didn't just pick up prescription pills. maybe she had a back pain issue and the vicodin wasn't enough so now she's buying street drugs. because there's always an underlying cause. there's always pain under that addiction. i think people don't understand that and it's hard for them to fathom. ",506
"1771","doc 2791","ys: oh yeah, huge. mental illness is more accepted than addiction. the interesting thing is that ninety percent of my clients are concurrent. a lot of them have mental health issues. they self-medicate themselves to cope with their mental illness. the addiction starts because the mental illness is not met. mental health issues are not being treated so they self-medicate by using drugs and alcohol. ",401
"1772","doc 2793","ys: no, it doesn't matter. to some extent if you have mental health issues you are the crazy one and it's not acceptable. they will kind of feel bad for you. rather than if you have severe mental health issue and then you come home drunk or high now it's a problem. in the reality you're treating your mental illness and that's what the issue is. oftentimes we find that when we treat the mental health issue and get you get people stable on medication and they see the psychiatrist things are a lot easier to deal with. the addiction can be treated because you're stable. if the mental illness is like up and down and you're not medicated or you're not seeing a psychiatrist and you're not stable then it's not going to work. you cannot treat your addiction. we try to tackle both. ",783
"1773","doc 2795","ys: yeah, supportive housing. ",30
"1774","doc 2797","ys: yeah, of course. language is really important. ",51
"1775","doc 2799","ys: it's really good. some do well and some don't do well. we teach them some life skills. they all have some chores. they all have to go to aa. they have to learn how to make appointments for themselves. they learn life skills. some of them might not get along. they fight about pickles and ketchup, who knows. there's always something. a lot of them are homeless, so in the winter we are more busy. so right now we have twelve beds and we're full. in the summers it's a little bit slower because people tend to go outside and have a good time. ",546
"1776","doc 2801","ys: that's one of the daily commands. we apply for grh [group residential housing] or apply for some type of long-term housing for them. so that way by the time they graduate here they can find something. ",205
"1777","doc 2803","ys: where do you want me to start? [laughs] ",44
"1778","doc 2805","ys: that's true, it is. we have a couple clients that have graduated, a couple that show up at least once a month out of gratitude, thankful, have two jobs. this guy came from jail. he had like four dwis. chronic alcoholic. everybody disowned him in his family. his wife, his three kids. now he's back with his wife and kids and working two jobs. it took six months of hard work with him. he did some outpatient too and is doing aa. ",433
"1779","doc 2806","people lose hope when they are at rock bottom. sometimes when you lose hope people are incapable of doing anything. hope is a big thing. i think a lot of people are like, ""shit, what do i have to lose?"" i'm in jail for a year now, i have four dwis, my wife left me, my three beautiful daughters left me. my mom won't even talk to me. what do i have to lose? they throw in the towel. i think when you give people hope—it makes a big difference when you give people three meals a day and a place to stay. it makes a huge difference. you educate them and you give them opportunities and you believe in them. i think you see a difference in people. ",645
"1780","doc 2808","ys: actually i don't to be honest, which is actually kind of interesting because i would say sixty percent of my staff are in recovery. that is always good because we need people with that experience. personally i don't. nobody in my family has addiction. i do have highly addictive behaviors as some of us do. i don't have any addiction issues. i've always been passionate about it. i've always understood it, and i was always curious. i'm very passionate about helping people that are underserved. i thought that my community needs me, and why not do my own thing. it took me a lot of years to think about this and to plan and go through all the dhs and all the stuff. it's not easy. it's a lot of work. ",706
"1781","doc 2810","ys: in the day group we have about twelve to fifteen. we also have the evening group that is mostly white or black—it's not culturally specific. then we have a sunday group. in total i would say we have about thirty to thirty-five. ",232
"1782","doc 2814","ys: it is so up and down. winter is a little more busy. people are more depressed. summer is down. the numbers are more like fifteen to twenty. ",144
"1783","doc 2816","ys: yeah. that's how it is for the big people with the clients too. ",68
"1784","doc 2820","ys: we have many models. i think the most important thing is to meet people where they're at. that's the first important thing. we need to figure out if they have toothpaste. let's go to wal-mart and get them some toothpaste. let's not worry about the alcoholism or the opioid addiction right now. he needs a towel and some toothpaste and we'll start with that. let him get some sleep tonight and make sure he brushes his teeth. dignity is very important. he showers and tomorrow morning he comes and we will treat the mental health issue, the addiction issue. meeting people where they're at—i'm a big fan of that. ",616
"1785","doc 2822","ys: oh yeah. harm reduction is so important. that's my frustration sometimes. you have to understand the client and where they're at. a lot of people don't understand. there are big companies out there that have their own policy. ""our policy is we cannot buy a client toothpaste."" well, yeah, that doesn't help anyone if he can't brush his teeth. he's probably afraid to talk to you. do you see what i mean? i think motivation is a big thing that we use here. emdr [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing] is something we use, cbt, and dbt is big. i think the most important thing is just treat people like human beings. that's the most important thing. i think a lot of people struggle with that. ",705
"1786","doc 2824","ys: yes, we invite people. i have been trying to establish a muslim twelve-step based—there's a lot of need for that. i wear so many hats and i've got so much stuff to do. i just need to find the right person to help me with that. it's just really important. ",259
"1787","doc 2826","ys: yeah, the higher power, god—i don't know how it would look. i actually should sit down and think about it. ",111
"1788","doc 2828","ys: yeah i know they did something in new york, but i don't know. i want to do more research and figure it out about na or aa for a twelve-step model, but i think there's a need for that. again, the same token, the whole ""let's hold hands and sing kumbaya"" is all a western, american cultural thing. we have to find a way. in fact, i had a client that has graduated and is doing really well that talked to me about wanting to start a support group. that's his thing. he's a big fan of that. so, i've got to support him in doing that. i got him a space he could do. we maybe do a weekly meeting or something. ",608
"1789","doc 2830","ys: i'm just a small, tiny guy. i think we need more counselors, number one. ladcs [licensed alcohol and drug counselor] in general because there's not many in the field. also, people who are culturally competent are very important. culturally competent is kind of a broad word, but people that are sensitive to other people and other cultures are really important. i think also it's important with policy. they keep cutting budgets and all these things. it's just going to keep getting worse. it's not going to get better. whoever is in charge, the big boss, and they read this book we need more funding. i had a professor that used to say, ""funding drives practice."" which is true. you have to make sure the bills are paid. ",726
"1790","doc 2832","ys: it costs so much money, amy, to put you in jail and prison than it would cost me—like ten dollars a day. that's just hypothetically speaking, but it's a hundred dollars in the county jail a day. with these ten dollars you get three meals a day and treatment. you're learning about how your mind thinks. you're not just sitting in the cell for twenty-three hours. that's not going to do any good. for you and for me because i'm a taxpayer too. ",447
"1791","doc 2834","what can you tell me about your clientele and opioids?",54
"1792","doc 2835","ys: we have been seeing a lot of that recently. ",48
"1793","doc 2837","ys: heroin, prescription pills, benzos. i think a lot of them especially in the somali community there are a couple cases. we had one guy that od'd and passed away. i have clients that say—we talk about it in group. a lot of the guys are more alcohol than opioids and they call it the rock. ",291
"1794","doc 2839","ys: yeah, like rocks. it's a street name i think. what they do is basically they're saying, ""i'm an alcoholic, but alcohol will not kill me."" so they're discriminating against each other. it's very interesting. ",211
"1795","doc 2841","ys: i'm like really? i tend to challenge them. ",47
"1796","doc 2843","ys: i don't see much meth. somali women i see it. ",50
"1797","doc 2845","ys: child protection cases, yes. we see a lot of alcohol. opioids have increased. our numbers have been increasing. a lot of them it starts with a car accident and back pain, or an accident in football, baseball, or basketball. you have to be mindful of this. my mom had back surgery and he gave her a prescription for ninety pills of oxycontin. i was like, “dude what the hell are you doing?” my ladc—that kind of thing. i'm not ladc but my treatment director in me was like, ""that's a lot of pills."" and that stuff is highly addictive. we have to make the doctors responsible. ",579
"1798","doc 2847","ys: how does he feel about suboxone or methadone?",49
"1799","doc 2849","ys: i love it. i'm a big fan of all avenues of recovery. what works for you might not work for me. i've challenged people that say, ""well..."" whatever works for you i'm a big fan of that. ",188
"1800","doc 2851","ys: yes, if you do it right. ",29
"1801","doc 2853","ys: yeah, or we have people that have [unclear]. i was looking into establishing one actually. ",95
"1802","doc 2855","ys: yeah, what was his name?",28
"1803","doc 2857","ys: yeah, suboxone is really good. i know. ",43
"1804","doc 2859","ys: i think my biggest challenge is housing. i want to house people and it's important—because what happens sometimes to be honest is we find someone, treat them for ninety days and they do well, and then after that we have to, not kick them out, but insurance will only pay for so many days. we have to form them back into the community. apartments are usually good because they have [unclear] or they didn't pay their rent. a lot of them don't have a job. if we can get them into the grh. i need some type of long-term housing. even if they can get a place to sit for another four, five months until they figure things out. what happens is they go back to the streets, they relapse, they come back to treatment. resources are not there and it's a waste of money if you ask me. you give people three months and a place to stay they will likely get a job, or at least a place to take their meds. so housing is my biggest challenge. if i could find a place to house people i think it would be good. i think that's one of my goals is to find long-term housing for people. ",1070
"1805","doc 2861","ys: getting a contract with the county. or figuring something out. ",67
"1806","doc 2863","ys: yeah. or anybody. it takes so long for us to get someone discharged because they can't find a place to live. i have a couple guys right now that are ready to graduate and we don't know what to do with them. we give them an extension for thirty days. sometimes i honestly do a free service for them because they have nowhere to go honestly. ",344
"1807","doc 2865","ys: oh yeah. obviously when someone is using they steal, cheat, and lie. it's not the person so much as the addiction. a lot of families don't understand that. they say, ""oh, amy, she's an asshole. she stole a hundred bucks from me!"" well, yeah, you left a hundred bucks on the counter and she's an addict. what are you going to do? the families don't understand that. we have to educate the family. don't leave the hundred bucks. ",431
"1808","doc 2867","ys: i do. they don't come. i don't blame them. one is transportation. i think a lot of immigrant families are working two jobs and trying to support them, so time is of the essence. i think they're also skeptical about me to do their dirty laundry. because of pride and ego. ",275
"1809","doc 2869","ys: no, honestly i think a lot of them are skeptical about me and i don't blame them. if i was a somali guy who was an alcoholic i probably wouldn't go see yussuf too. to be honest. ",182
"1810","doc 2871","ys: because of the stigma. it's a small world. everybody knows everybody. it's a small community. i think pride and ego are a big thing, too. i think a lot of people are skeptical sometimes. i think an important thing for a lot of families is they don't understand it. they have no clue. they love their kid and will do anything for them, but the kid or whatever, the person, the client, has cheated on them, or yelled, or lied, and they've bailed them out twenty-five times. ""we are just tired. stop it. shut up. leave us alone.""",530
"1811","doc 2873","ys: absolutely. but if you don't have a lot of resources and i bailed you out with the three thousand dollars i had in my savings it's not going to look good if you go back using again. i had a client that was telling me that thirty-three thousand dollars her dad wrote a check to hazelden for a month or whatever for the treatment. the day after she came out she relapsed. she said, ""my dad was pissed."" i said, ""i would be pissed, too."" but things like that. addiction is a disease and we have to figure out a way to treat it. i think a lot of people don't understand that. ",576
"1812","doc 2875","ys: if you're a diabetic and you see a doctor you take your insulin. and it's like, ""oh, you're a diabetic. i'm sorry. make sure you take your blood sugar."" whatever. make sure you eat. addiction is kind of the same idea but nobody feels bad for you. those comments on facebook—my blood pressure goes up. i get into fights with people on facebook all the time.",360
"1813","doc 2877","ys: just my personal one. people are idiots and i educate them. some times i say, ""enough is enough,"" and i just start. i'm like, well that worked for you, and you got lucky maybe and good for you. and others are like, ""boo hoo. feel sorry for me."" and maybe by the grace of god you did well, but it doesn't mean that you can look down on people that are struggling. you struggle for five years before you get out, or whatever. i think it's important that we do that. education is very important. ",497
"1814","doc 2881","ys: no, it's okay. i know that a lot of people like me. i think a lot of people respect what i do. i've been recognized. i think if you just google it you'll find a lot of articles and stuff. some people are skeptical about me still and you'll have people who doubt you, and that's okay. you can have it both ways. i graduated from the u as i told you, and the university of minnesota did a story about patty [shandy], one of my former professors. [takes out the article]",471
"1815","doc 2883","ys: yeah, she's great. she is well known for trauma care. ",58
"1816","doc 2885","ys: oh yeah. we do a lot of emdr. i think a lot of people, over ninety percent of somali people are victims of torture. it's a high number. because of the civil war. have you seen the movie hotel rwanda? the hutus and tutsis. it's kind of the same thing. ",255
"1817","doc 2887","ys: same thing. same thing. ",28

"1821","doc 2895","ys: we have an licsw [licensed independent clinical social worker] that we contract out. the war inside, sorry. treating somali's mentally ill. it's like a nine minute thing. abdulrahman ali. actually we have skyped him many times. ",232

"1823","doc 2903","ys: in minneapolis. they do things different. they might not welcome you. ",74
"1824","doc 2905","ys: south east homes.",21
"1825","doc 2909","ys: i don't know, maybe you should call them and find out. the lady that owns it is very different. she doesn't believe in networking and stuff like that. she sees me as a threat. there's not enough clients for all of us. that kind of thing. ",242
"1826","doc 2911","ys: no. and there are like three or four after me that have established and helped. ",84
"1827","doc 2913","ys: four or five outpatient. maybe one other one inpatient. so there's enough clients for all of us. ",101
"1828","doc 2915","ys: i've helped the [unclear] open one with the wilder foundation. clues [comunidades latinas unidas en servicio] is doing the hispanic community. the hmong community? i don't know much. ",187
"1829","doc 2917","ys: okay, that's good to know. ",31
"1830","doc 2919","ys: it's still different. you don't—here you just have your own forty minutes and then you have to bill for services. you get thirty minutes session and boom you're out. we do way more than that. we have to educate families. i feel like it's not fair sometimes with insurance companies or the state. they just want you to check your damn boxes and bill for it. but we might spend an hour and a half explaining something to a family but you can only bill for thirty minutes. ",474
"1831","doc 2921","ys: absolutely. that's a nice way to say it. you should run for office. ",72
"1832","doc 2923","ys: let me know. i'll support you. ",35

"1840","doc 2940","ksf: that’s a hard question to answer. he has his phd in political science but he was at the university of chicago and he never really considered himself a political scientist. he worked in city management and things like that. he kind of worked in political science but was really interested in problem solving and decision making kinds of things. eventually in his long life, he lived to be eighty-six, he taught first in a graduate school of industrial education at carnegie mellon in pittsburgh where i moved when i was seven. then he had an appointment jointly in psychology because he was doing cognitive psychology and computer science. he did a lot of work with the early creation of artificial intelligence. you can look him up his name is herbert simon. ",764
"1841","doc 2941","he played a really big part in my life because my mom, and this is relevant, was really wanting a boy. she was the oldest of two girls and was very close with her younger sister. she’d grown up in the bay area. she wanted a boy she had decided. i wasn’t a boy. she was quite disappointed actually which i learned because there was a letter in my baby book which she had written to my great aunt, her aunt, it said that. after her initial disappointment with not having a boy...then my next sibling is a brother named peter. exactly two years younger and then exactly two years after that my sister barbara was born. it was always clear to me that peter was favored because he was the boy my mom wanted. my sister was favored because she had red hair like my mom. beautiful, beautiful bright orange hair, which of course she hated. my mom loved it because it was kind of like her hair. i was close to my dad. i always had quite a troubled relationship with my mother. she was extraordinarily critical and she was a mom who liked things to go the way she wanted them to go. she was a very positive woman, very creative, very talented. she did a lot of sewing and tailoring and was highly accomplished in what she did. she did not work when i was growing up. in those days people didn’t. did i say i was born in 1942?",1314

"1913","doc 3055","it was interesting because rachel and i had had a kind of tumultuous life together. when she was really little she had certain ways of communicating that she always wanted to correct what i was saying. she had these overtones of my mother’s control and my brother’s stuff. it just drove me wild that i can’t even give you an example. rephrasing what i had just said. it just drove me wild. i was in my shrieking mode at that point. we had a hard time when she was really little at some point, and david also pushed a lot of let’s do some psychological tests on rachel to make sure. i didn’t think they were psychological problems. at one point we went to see a therapist at hcmc and the therapist did a workshop test. we were in separate rooms totally separately talking about what we were seeing in this particular blot and they were almost identical stories. the therapist could hardly stand it. it was so spooky. did you talk to rachel about this? have you ever seen this before? it was my moment of realizing how much rachel and i see things similarly. how alike we are in many ways. some of our abrasion had to do with that. it helped me appreciate how close we could be if we made an effort. we spent a lot of time working on getting along. at one point i had to set a boundary for myself when we were seeing somebody.

"1914","doc 3056","she had run away once and we were seeing somebody over at this place, the bridge. we were seeing a therapist there. rachel said something and i said, “i can’t see you for a while.” it was about being super critical of me. “i can’t see you for a while.” we had said we’d take her to work. i said, “i have to stop this now.” “can’t you just take me to work?” “nope. i can’t.” she was living part time with her dad. i said, “i can’t see you for a while.” that started right then and there. i just wept for hours. i remember i had an al-anon meeting that night. i didn’t see her for a week. i kept a journal of all the things i was thinking about. i invited her to go to a movie for me and out for chocolate afterwards. while we were having our cocoa she started in on her criticism. i said, “i’m going to take you back to your dad’s now.” it didn’t take too long for me to establish that if she was going to be critical of me i wasn’t going to be with her. we could spend really good time together. whatever she thought about me i wasn’t going to make her not think it but i didn’t want to hear it. we worked on our relationship.

"1931","doc 3092","so i stayed at eden house for eighteen years. seventeen or eighteen years, and i always argue when i left. i finally felt i had done everything i could do in drug abuse. i was very well recognized in minnesota, and sat on a number of commissions and led a number of different initiatives, and i thought, ""i want to do something different."" i really wanted to work with people with hiv. it was late eighties. we were just coming to terms with what hiv was, and the link between hiv and substance abuse especially injecting drug use was quite [unclear]. and i thought, ""well, what am i going to do? i'm not a direct service provider, i'm not very good.""",651

"1933","doc 3096","lt: right, it just wasn't my thing. in 1977, eden house went through some real turmoil. there were three of us who had founded the organization, and i was the program administrator, and my husband and chuck beady, who was the other founder, were the co-directors. they had a split. the whole thing started to come apart at the seams. the board chair at the time was a graduate of the university of minnesota program in hospital and health care administration. basically, my husband said, ""i don't want to run it. i only want to work with people. i don't want to be in charge of pushing paper. i just want to work in the program."" the board said, ""who wants to run it?"" and i raised my hand, and the board chair said, ""you need some learning."" [laughs] i went back and got my graduate and undergraduate degree at the u. i went through the programs in hospital and health care administration, and at the time it was in the school of public health. then it wound up over at the carlson school [of management], and now it's back in public health i think. i got my undergraduate degree in a self-designed program through what was then university without walls. it's now a program in independent learning and also in hospital and health care administration. ",1252

"1935","doc 3098","myself and my business partner did lots of training in vulnerable adults, federal confidentiality. this is before i started aids work. i had this consulting firm, and i was very successful, but it was very isolating because my business partner worked half time as a clinical director of wayside house. she wasn't really in the office that much. it just felt really, i was still young, and it felt really kind of lonely. i thought, ""i've got to get a real job."" plus, at the time health insurance was becoming an issue. my husband had left eden house after i did, about two years after i did. ",592
"1936","doc 3100","lt: i was there from 1970 until '87. or '71 to '87. so a long time. by then it had expanded. it had a residential component, and then an outpatient component. we also had other things. we had a coffee house for a while. we had a program for native youth that were inhalant abusers at phillips junior high. we had some programs at the women's prison in shakopee, and the men's prison up in stillwater. we were doing lots of stuff. at this point, eden house had really four divisions. substance use, which is the old eden house, which is inpatient, outpatient program, and they have about five hundred units and supportive housing. and a corrections programs. that's where the r.s.—it's now r.s. eden. they merged with a st. paul corrections program called reentry services. the r.s. was for the reentry services. i know, and i hate their logo. [laughs] and everyone thinks i have so much power because i was a founder and all this. i'm like i can't get dan to change anything. it's amazing. he and i are very, very close, and he's a wonderful person. i don't work for him, and the final thing they have is a lab, so they do a ton of ua [urine analysis] testing. ",1161
"1937","doc 3101","i work in the substance use division for the individual who runs the substance use programs as a consultant. i basically told him, ""i like to think of you as the executive director,"" because he's—the administrative offices for r.s. eden are on the north side, and he's over on portland on the south side kind of by himself. i said, ""and you need an assistant."" and i had a lot of executive assistants. i know what they do. so, that's what i do. i write policy manuals, i develop training, i do client handbooks. i do all the stuff that he doesn't have anybody to do. so, right now i'm doing the prea—prison rape elimination act policies for them because i can read through all this bullshit. ",692
"1938","doc 3102","i did the consulting work for a couple years. and like i said it was kind of isolating, so i thought i wanted a real job, but i didn't want to be in direct service, and the only thing—because minnesota is a low-incidence of hiv state—there aren't a million programs. and the only thing that i would like to do is run the minnesota aids project, but somebody's doing that. and guess what? right when i thought that, literally, he quit and went to washington. so, i thought, ""wow, i'm going to apply for that job!"" so i applied for the job, and in all honesty i think they were really intrigued with me because of all of the things i had done, and the fact that at the time i had also, through my consulting work, was the associative administrator of an agency called the institute on black chemical abuse, which later became the african american family services; now it's gone, but it was an organization founded by peter bell, who is a local, well known individual. peter was a rarity: african american republican. during the tail end of the reagan and bush administration, bush won, and they sent peter all over the world, literally, as a spokesperson on chem dep. and there was nobody left to run the shop. so i was kind of the invisible, behind the scenes person that peter hired, because i knew him for years. ",1314
"1939","doc 3103","i think the map board—minnesota aids project board—i kind of think they thought i was black, you know. and that's my theory. anyways, i did make the first cut. i never thought i'd get the job because i thought they would only want to hire a gay man, or someone who had a direct connection to hiv, and i had no one in my family, and really immediate friends other than my neighbor who i knew was living with hiv. i was kind of shocked that they interviewed me. it was very formal; very different back in those days because hiv was so new. to cut to the chase i got the job. i was stunned. ",588
"1940","doc 3104","i mean, how different it was back then. when i got the job they immediately dragged me over to the health department to have me meet with the commissioner of health. i mean, now, i don't know if linda, who is the new ed could even get a meeting with the commissioner of health, but i was like on day one. i mean articles in the paper about me, interviews about me, which is where i developed my favorite line, which was—you mentioned you have a daughter? when a reporter said to me from the st. paul pioneer press ""you mentioned you have a daughter, and i'm just wondering could you describe your family structure?"" which was an indirect way of everyone trying to find out whether or not i was a lesbian. my standard comeback to that question, which i have freely given to anyone else to use was, ""never have so many people been interested in who i sleep with since my mother in 1968."" i constantly, everyone always asked. the response—people were for years—the inside joke was, ""well have you ever seen her 'husband'? did you know his 'name' is pat?"" which was back and forth from the saturday night live thing. and my husband is very antisocial, and so the last thing he would ever do would be go to a map thing. and, at the time he had left eden, and he started a gun store. so, i don't think firearms and map were—",1318
"1941","doc 3105","so, it was an odd sort of time, but it was wonderful. it was a real bonding time. i think the people that were at map in the early days have stayed very close. i mean for a long time i felt a bit like an outsider. i started in 1990, and map had started—had been founded in '83, really got going in '87—‘83. ",307
"1942","doc 3107","i was talking about how the people at map in the early days really bonded, although i did feel a bit like an outsider starting a few years after others, but quickly got to be kind of accepted. part of the inside crowd, if you will. but they remained for a long time, and probably still does, an element of people who—it's the same in any field of the public professions—people who feel like they are doing god's work, and they kind of look down their noses at so-called bureaucrats who sit in the office and push paper. and i was kind of a cool executive director because i knew the streets, and i knew kind of both sides. i think i had a little more cache with the staff. ",673
"1943","doc 3108","but when i started map was doing—at the time it was called the ivda: intravenous drug abuse. then that got changed to ivdu because you didn't want to make a judgment that people that were using drugs were abusers, so then it got changed to ivdu: intravenous drug users outreach. then it got shortened to idu: injecting drug use because not everyone was injecting intravenously, especially in the gay/bi community you had a lot of transgenders that were using hormones intramuscularly. personally, i found the distinctions to be absolutely beyond distracting, so inside the walls of my office i referred to it as the iud program. it just was irritating me. and you couldn't use words like i was used to at eden house like junkie, or dope fiend, or anything because those were too judgmental. early on that whole harm reduction meet people where they're at began to permeate the world, which i always thought was another stupid thing. ",933
"1944","doc 3110","lt: because it's like where are they at? they're over on hennepin avenue or nicollet [avenue]. i took it literally as people where they're at. ",143
"1945","doc 3112","lt: i understand, i understand that. but as we talk about the needle exchange, i think there was a real difference between my approach and the approach of solely harm reduction because i felt that at the time, and i'm not in the field now, so i can't speak to today. ",267
"1946","doc 3114","lt: right, but at the time there were people that were self-described harm reduction folks offered little other than clean needles to people. i wanted to offer people clean needles, and an opportunity to talk about a future. i mean it wasn't a pray before you eat salvation army approach, but i wanted people to know there was a way out of this lifestyle, and the choices that they were making. so, i wanted a more comprehensive approach than solely, ""hey, ain't i cool because i talk your language, and i know what it means to fix,"" you know. i can say all the cool things that you can say. ",592
"1947","doc 3115","i also frankly felt that some of the people that were doing the work were putting themselves at risk. sue [purchase], who at the time was with women with a point, i don't know that sue was doing it, but her partner whose name i can't remember, i don't know if she mentioned that when you met, but her partner thought it was really cool because people would call her to exchange needles. she would drive over to somebody's house and leave her kids in the car and go upstairs and exchange needles. and i'm thinking, ""well that's great. so there's a bad drug deal that's going on upstairs, and you ain't never coming out?"" i just thought this was really not good. ",661
"1948","doc 3116","but, at the time we hadn't started needle exchange. it was just starting. the first one, which i'm sure you know, out in the seattle area, tacoma, that dave purchase started, was getting some traction. there was no internet, so we didn't read about things on the internet. i was active in washington. i was on the public policy committee for a national advocacy group, aids action counsel. i don't know what it's called now. it's still there, but it's not aids action counsel anymore. they had a policy committee, and i was the only non-coastal person that was active, and that was part of this. it was hearing from people from other parts of the country how their aids organizations were wanting to start needle exchange. ",723
"1949","doc 3117","at the time i had hired a guy at map, bob tracy, to do our public policy work. i had reached far into my past, and hired the person who worked with me at pharm house back in 1970, and he had been a chem dep instructor here in minnesota, but he had moved to san francisco, and gotten a degree. it's a doctorate degree in human sexuality with a specialty in hiv and gay me. he was himself a former injecting drug user. he had the perfect background. his name was dan ford. dan had been the director of education for the cascade aids project. he had worked for a street program in san francisco with homeless, gay youth. he had all the perfect qualities. i called him up, and brought him back to minnesota, which was a wonderful thing. sadly, he passed away this past october, but he would have been a wonderful person to talk to. ",828
"1950","doc 3118","so, my policy person and dan and i started talking about doing a needle exchange, but i wanted to do a legitimate needle exchange. i was brash enough to think i was going to get the county, or somebody in the government, to fund this. at the time the only publicly funded program was in connecticut, and it was supported primarily because it had a very complex research component that yale was doing. i think it was yale. it might have been harvard. where they would actually barcode the needles. when they would come back into the exchange they could trace, ""well this one was distributed at location twenty-two and it came back to location five."" and then they would analyze the residue blood in the needles to see whether there was mixed blood. to see whether or not the needle had been shared. it was a very costly kind of research program. i wasn't interested in doing something that complex because frankly minneapolis/st. paul did not have heavily concentrated injection areas as other communities did, and i felt we needed a mobile program. ",1049
"1951","doc 3119","so, i began working with the county and talking to them about needle exchange—with the hennepin county public health department, city of minneapolis public health department, state health department, and i talked to the governor, attorney general because i didn't want to have it be illegal, or that the workers would be arrested. eventually we carved out kind of an interesting piece. this was going on for a couple of years. it took about two years' planning. the piece it carved out was that there was language prohibiting the distribution of syringes except for under certain circumstances, one of which was research. it was an archaic law, and i don't know why they put research in there, but thank goodness they did. at the time the mayor of minneapolis and the city attorney carved this out and said it would be okay. ",825
"1952","doc 3120","in the meantime behind the scenes we had women with a point going on kind of underground, and then there was this other guy who came to town. i don't know if they talked about him, but some character names mike scavuza who was from out east, and he wanted to do needle exchange because we were a bunch of straight—not in sexuality, but straight in terms of drug use—and we didn't understand what it really meant. i just thought he was a punk, and he was going to disrupt this whole, very carefully constructed house of cards i was putting together to get funding for needle exchange. the county commissioners at the time—one of whom is still on the board, peter mclaughlin—were supportive. so, i had the support of them, and amazingly right when i needed it most into town arrived dr. alan lifson. alan is a physician, and a master's in public health, hiv specialist, came out of san francisco, and knew all about injecting drug use. i needed that person with the right alphabet of letters, and alan quickly supported what we were doing. he's at the u. he's continued to work a lot in hiv, particularly internationally. he was very helpful in the beginning. ",1158
"1953","doc 3121","eventually the county gave us money. i went over to eden house, and talked to some of the clients i had known because some of these substance abuse programs kind of recycle in and out, in and out. so people i knew as clients in the seventies came back in the eighties came back in the nineties, and their kids were there or they worked there. i had them tell me—find out from them—where good places would be to have a mobile van. we needed lots of stuff. we had to get a van. someone from the health department helped us obtain a used ambulance, and we had it retrofitted to include space to bring people into the van, do some basic education, exchange needles, have a save sharps away. then there was a whole issue of insurance. nobody had ever insured a syringe exchange program. the insurance agent at map, vicky freyer, god bless her soul, managed to talk an insurance company into insuring us. because i'm thinking all the osha [occupational safety and health administration] issues, and you know liability issues of someone giving a needle to od's, and whatever happens. ",1077
"1954","doc 3122","so we talked through all of this. my board at map was a challenge because there were many people that felt like there was, if you will, the innocent people that got hiv. in the mainstream the innocent people were, you know, the people that got it because they were dentists, the hemophiliacs, or whatever. but there also were a subset of gay men who felt that, well, back in the seventies and eighties we had no idea what this was. but now, you know, we've got these junkies everybody knows. so we don't care about them, you know. so there were people on the board and supporters of map that left over the issue of doing syringe exchange. there were some of the staff that were afraid that we were going to have dangerous people come around. there were other staff that were thrilled. very excited about this because up until then basically our outreach was setting up a card table on the corner of franklin [avenue] and nicollet [avenue], or going to one of the catholic charity's branch programs. ",999
"1955","doc 3124","lt: yes, yes. with rapid testing later it became part of the activity. but in the early days, no, we would refer people to the red door. but, yes, absolutely. all of the syringe exchange packets that we would put together included alcohol wipes, a cotton, a cooker, a tie off, and condoms, and mint, or some kind of candy. yes, safer sex was a really big part of it.",366
"1956","doc 3125","so everything seemed to be moving along quite well. and then we hit the road block. the road block was that a couple of the commissioners wanted to treat getting the support for needle exchange like running a political campaign. and that if we were going to go into a neighborhood with this mobile van we had to get the approval of the neighbors. and we should do that by going on a door knocking campaign. as in knock, knock, knock, ""hi, i'm just here to tell you we want to park this out here. there will be a lot of kind of nefarious looking characters, perhaps. don't worry. it's fine. we've got you covered."" i thought, ""this is the stupidest thing."" so, finally the door knocking campaign morphed into, ""well, you have to get the neighborhood association approval."" ",772
"1957","doc 3126","at the time there was quite a concentration of iv use in the whittier neighborhood. the whittier business association took off with a vengeance against me. to this day my gas station guy calls me, ""hey, it's the needle lady."" talk radio just tore us apart. ",257
"1958","doc 3128","lt: this was about '94 i want to say. '93, '94. i had started taking the money from the county and had hired staff, bought needles, and all this kind of stuff. and one of the whittier guys took a van and painted all over it, ""this is your needle exchange van. come in here. we'll kill you."" i mean stupid—it was quite ugly. we had neighbors that were in whittier that really didn't want anything to do with us. i was fighting some of the folks up on the north side that didn't want anything up on the north side because just you white people coming up here to enable and prolong. you want us addicted to drugs. that whole line. so, i really was getting it from all sides on needle exchange. ",691
"1959","doc 3129","finally, i just said, ""fuck you."" and gave the money back to the county. i said, ""we'll do it on our own."" i mean at the time there was a federal prohibition on using any federal money, but there was no prohibition on using local money. so this was county dollars. and it was good money. it was one hundred thousand dollars a year, which even today it's good money. back then it was a fortune. i said, ""okay, never mind."" i gave it back, and said we'll do it on our own and fundraise. i don't know if map now gets any money for needle exchange or not, i don't really know. but when i was there, and i was at map from june of '90 through april of 2010 or '11, i never remember which. i always have to look at when i got my dog. i think it was '10. twenty-one years almost. yeah. anyways, it was a long time i was there. it was a wonderful experience. ",850
"1960","doc 3130","so we hired folks to come and be in the van and drive around. we had certain set spots that we would go to. they new the other people like sue, and others that did syringe exchange. and i think they got along pretty well. i think at that time sue might have already started access works, i don't remember when that started, which was a storefront exchange program. our mobile van i think was really effective because we could move as the population moved. for example, up on the north side for a while we were parked outside lee's liquor bar up on glenwood [avenue], and then we moved over to mervin's drug store up on broadway [street]. so we could move the van around. we had a good relationship with the police because i was worried. ",737
"1961","doc 3132","lt: it was out monday through friday. i don't remember how many actual hours. ",78
"1962","doc 3134","lt: it would usually not be late at night because of the safety concerns. and obviously not too early in the daytime because nobody's up. so i would say probably, gosh, i really don't remember so i don't want to make a mistake. but i want to digress to one fascinating story was that in 1993, dan ford and i from map, dan and i went to the international aids conference in berlin. we stopped in amsterdam because they had a very robust needle exchange program. we met with the drug czar, or i don't know what his official title was, but a government person in amsterdam. and back in those days everybody and their mother was going to amsterdam to find out how to do a needle exchange program. and he said something to me that stuck with me to this day. that was, ""i can't believe how stupid you americans are."" he said, ""you are treating this problem of addiction like you're ordering off a chinese menu. i'll have one from column a, and nothing else."" he said, ""you can't just have a needle exchange program absent a comprehensive approach to addiction. you can't just come here and copy this, and think it's going to make a difference because it won't."" of course we didn't really care. ",1189
"1963","doc 3135","i mean in america everything is so siloed. i mean addiction people hated needle exchange. harm reduction. because it was enabling, and it caused all kind of bad stuff. so, i didn't know how we could integrate the two, even though i came out of substance abuse, and people knew what i was doing. i mean i was getting a lot of calls from friends of mine in substance abuse that were chem dep back in those days like, ""what the hell are you doing?""",445
"1964","doc 3137","lt: i would give them the shtick about, look, it's a journey. addiction is a journey. people are going to stop at some point. they are going to stop because they are in the joint, or they die, or they just suddenly wake up and say, ""i don't want to do it again,"" or, in very rare cases, treatment works. so in all those cases where people stop using i don't want them to be hiv positive. i would say, ""it's that simple,"" you know. i don't want them to end their addiction and then die because there were no long-term survivors from the hiv. and that seemed to resonate with people, that there was a way out of addiction, and that maybe this would keep them from having that terrible plague. ",691
"1965","doc 3138","and so that seemed to alleviate some of the concerns that people had. that was how we managed to kind of get it going. it morphed a lot over the years. we had a lot of different staff. it's hard work. it's really hard work in the needle exchange. there's a lot of turnover because you tended to have either people who were in recovery themselves. because it's not good work for people not in recovery. and it takes a certain type of person in recovery to not all of a sudden to be running into all their old friends, or to suddenly want to go back to that life. so it really was kind of dicey. we lost some people who did return to that life. and then we had other people who were like do-gooders, you know. we called them the 'cupcakes' who wanted to help other people, you know, and had no idea what they were getting into. i was always struck—there was a story, i think, i can't if it was new york, west coast, east coast—but there was some male researcher who was doing research on needle exchange, phd, and he got hooked and died of an overdose. i was always struck by ""i don't want that on my watch."" you know, somebody that i brought in that had never seen this life before suddenly became part of the hair club for men, you know, they're going to try it themselves. it's such a good product. ",1300
"1966","doc 3142","lt: i would say pretty much from the beginning. i was always concerned about the staff. much more than the outreach staff that worked gay bars, you know. the issues i dealt with outreach staff—usually young, gay men—who went and did education at that bars, or a public sex spot. what's the worst thing that's going to happen? they're going to engage in sex? you know. and whether they use a condom or not that's their choice, but they understand. but addiction was something that was much more seductive. ",505
"1967","doc 3143","but there was always a split i think in the local needle exchange world between map and the access works type programs that felt they were much closer to the street, if you will, than map was. i think at some point when sue left access works, i don't remember what year that was, and a staff person from map went and was hired as the ed, and eventually the place was in turmoil. i don't know enough about what happened internally, but it was going to fold. so, there was the question of could it merge with map, and eventually we did take over. we didn't change the name. we didn't call it the access works map program. the map program was called mainline, and is still called mainline, which is kind of a play on words because obviously people mainline the heroin, or opiates, or other drugs, but there was a local individual who i think died around '96 or so, a real advocate for needle exchange, named bill main. bill had contracted hiv by getting a needle from a sharp supply container in a hospital or clinic or somewhere. even though he didn't like map, he didn't like me, he thought i was too distant from the real life, i wasn't a junkie like he was, i was just a straight woman, you know, i wanted to name the program—i'm very big on history. it's my big—i'm a total history nut. so, i wanted to call it mainline, and it still is called mainline. most people have no idea, unfortunately, that it's named after bill main. ",1430
"1968","doc 3144","so that was part of the story, but the other part of the story that i want to share with you was how we legalized needles in minnesota because prior to 1998, i believe, possession of syringes was illegal in minnesota, and purchasing syringes was illegal in minnesota. so you had all kinds of junkies who wanted to buy needles who had great stories they could tell. go in the drug store, ""my aunt is here, she's diabetic, she just arrived in town."" my favorite was, ""i'm doing some repair on the coffee table and the veneer came off. i want to shoot some glue under the veneer."" the one i heard from my husband that nobody else has ever confirmed, but i love it so i always told it, was at—because he liked to fish—they could use the syringe to inject the worm, so it would get air so it would float off the bottom. right! what a tip! you heard it here first. people loved that kind of thing. i thought, ""let's find out how to make purchasing needles legal in minnesota. we can do it."" and we did. ",997
"1969","doc 3145","by that time bob tracy, who did all the policy work for map, was very well known at the capitol. he more than most other people had a way of endearing himself to even his worst enemies. very smart. he works with minnesota council on foundations now. bob tracy. and bob knew how to get an idea into a law, and that ain't easy because besides all the sponsors, and getting it through the whole eighty-five thousand committees, and doing the financial note on it, and all the mark-ups, et cetera, et cetera. bob shepherded through this idea that we would get legal syringes, and it was quite an exciting time. it had gone through a number of hearings. we had one more committee that we had to get through. there was just total opposition. the committee was very divided; especially the rural dflers were not in support. ",817
"1970","doc 3146","we had created through map a very robust network of advocates throughout the states. one of the advocates that we had was an individual living with hiv from northern minnesota who had contracted hiv when he worked on an oil rig, and apparently injecting dope is kind of a past time on oil rigs, i didn't know this. so you can't go to the drug store, so there's a lot of needles sharing, so that's how he had become hiv positive, come back. he's got a wife and kids, and you know, and the house with the picket fence. he met with his representative from northern minnesota, and she changed her vote. and we won by one vote. i always like to tell that story because it is the power of one. it really was the power of this one guy. so following that, and to this day it is legal in minnesota to purchase and possess up to ten sterile, clean syringes. and as i told people if they are dirty, i mean if you have used them and there's dope in them then it's paraphernalia. all bets are off and i'm not coming to your defense. ",1020
"1971","doc 3147","then the world started to change a lot. this legislation was in '98. we ran into problems with the health department because i think the legislation had something about disposal of the syringes. well then every diabetic in the state of minnesota had up until then was having to pay, and now they're mad because if you're a dope fiend you get to throw away your needles for free and i've got to pay to have sterile sanitation. so we are just going to bring them to map. and it was like, i'm not going to pay for every syringe. so we got into big arguments with the health department. i don't remember how it got resolved, but basically it's resolved. so, yeah, that was '98.",673
"1972","doc 3148","i think from that point forward, once it became where you could legally purchase syringes—i didn't change my opinion that needle exchange where you get free needles—i still think that's a good idea, but for god's sakes if you can walk into a drug store, walgreens, and buy needles i don't need to have my van out there twenty-four hours a day. i mean come on now. i know you want to save all your money for dope, but you could do like three bucks for a ten pack of syringes. i had some strong judgments about that. i mean every—",528
"1973","doc 3150","lt: well, no, i never wanted to end it. and what happened with the van, i don't really know. the van was still going when i left map. it is not going now, and they're needle exchange now is out of a church. yosemite church? and it's, i think, open three days a week a couple hours a day. so, that's one place people can go. i think pillsbury has some transgender clinic, shock clinic. and i don't know, i think there are some free lancers here in town. [unclear] and, i think because they're legal there's less pressure to have eighty-five thousand needle exchanges. ",567
"1974","doc 3151","and minneapolis never was, as i stated earlier, never had a huge concentration like new york, or new haven, or seattle, or san francisco. we don't have the tenderloin district. and it's a pretty mobile population. in fact, we found that a lot of the exchangers we had were secondary exchangers that were coming in from waseca, waconia, coloquet. and one guy would get all the dirty needles and bring in liter bottles, or two liter bottles of diet coke, filled with needles because he collected them from the last month from wherever, whatever period of time. not necessarily a month. he'd pull up over at map. and i had a corner office that had windows by the parking lot, which the smokers used to hate because i'd tap my watch while they were out there smoking. anyways, i would see people pull up because one of the sites we used was the map parking lot. i would see these pick up trucks pull up, quite rural looking, and some obviously non-metro looking kind of person (she said very judgmentally) [narrator says this about herself] would get out of the car, or the truck, and they would have bottles full of needles. ",1122
"1975","doc 3153","lt: yes, we would pay to dispose of them. i know that one of the workers told me that when he was parked up by louie's liquor bar it was very common to get businessmen from downtown that would come with a briefcase full of needles. and many of them would, i mean the way i told the story which was i'm sure embellished—well i know it was embellished—was that these were businessmen and it was lunchtime and they told their secretary, ""i just have to go drop off some dry cleaning,"" and went over to louie's liquor bar driving in their beamer and open their briefcase and they'd have a baggie full of needles. and i know they are down there and going home at night and there's nobody in their family who has a clue what they're doing. ",734
"1976","doc 3154","i think all of us that worked in hiv—if you had half a brain—and there were a lot of people who worked in hiv that did not have half a brain, but if you did have half a brain, i think you felt some compassion, some even guilt at times that you were enabling. that here was this guy that was shooting up. when you're not open is he risking sharing needles with others, and then sexually exposing his partner? so there was a lot of, at times, angst about the whole game of addiction. ",482
"1977","doc 3155","and then i think some of my hesitancy around the harm reduction piece because i get the 'meet people where you're at,' but i want to show people that there's also another way. and treatment by any shot is not a miracle. and treatment doesn't work very often. i mean i'm the first person to acknowledge that, but it shows you that there is another way, and you never know when you're going to wake up. i always remember there was a client in eden house one time. it was when eden house started. it was a really tough program along the synanon model where you'd shave people's heads, and there were costumes, and you'd put people on so-called trips, and different things. it was pretty harsh. and we were getting guys out of the joint right and left. i mean very serious offenders. i remember one guy came to eden house, and he said in his intake group, ""i don't care what you do to me. you can shave my head, make me wash dishes, make me peel potatoes, you can make me edge the lawn with a spoon, and i'll scrub the bathroom floor with my tongue if you want. i'm never using drugs again."" and he never did. and he was really only sort of half-heartedly in groups, but he went out, he was done with eden house, and he got a job with the city of minneapolis. retired. and to my knowledge, i mean i don't know if he drank, but he never became a junkie again. but that's a very rare case. ",1384
"1978","doc 3156","treatment is kind of like a wash, rinse, repeat sort of episode, but it does work. whether it's a hundred percent sobriety, or eighty-five percent sobriety, or if it's even, and i get that now we're going down the harm reduction road, but there's some point at which at least let people know there's an option. and hopefully the only option that they're option is not methadone or suboxone. those to me are temporary kinds of options. i'm not a big proponent. i mean i know i have some friends who have been on methadone for thirty years on a very low dose, but i wish they weren't. that's where i sort of parted ways with the whole—plus there was this whole attitude of the folks that worked street outreach that, ""we're so cool. we're the cool kids."" after a while that just sort of wears on you. you know? only because i've been around the block for so long, and i've seen this movie. i lived through the returning vietnam vets, opiate addiction, the crack problem. this sudden, ""oh my god, people are using opiates. wow. how'd that happen?""",1044
"1979","doc 3158","lt: that's kind of my story with that. when i left map, i mean honestly the reason that i left map was i had never taken a vacation at home. my husband and i always went somewhere on a cruise—a blue's music cruise. only blue's. the whole ship! it was fabulous. we had a policy at map with vacation the use it or lose it. it didn't roll over year to year. so everybody in december was gone. and i was never gone in december because somebody had to hold the ship down. and december—that's why i think i left in '11. it doesn't matter. whatever. one year i said, ""i'm taking the last two weeks of december off. and there's no cruise so i'm staying home."" i stayed home, and i was stunned by how disabled my husband was. he had had a number of strokes, and in 2009 he had a major stroke in april. i had stayed home for a couple of weeks. i had obviously seen these changes in him, but then i didn't really ever take the time to observe it. and during those two weeks that i was home it suddenly occurred to me that my tombstone was going to read, ""she cared more about map than she did her husband."" and so i thought, ""this is not good. this man really needs a lot of help."" and to this day he does. and so i left whenever it was that i left. ",1239
"1980","doc 3159","but i was only home for a short time before i thought, ""this sucks."" and i had been a consultant, a 1099 person before, and so i talked to dan over at eden house, and i said, ""let me do the aids education with the clients because you guys are doing needles. they're bad stay away. let me teach people, because you know they're going to fuck up when they leave here. you don't want them to come back."" so i started doing aids education with the clients. i was referred to as the butt-fucking lady with the clients. yes. because most addicts that come in from the streets and you talk about anal intercourse they don't know what you're talking about. ",649
"1981","doc 3160","so i started off doing aids education with the clients, and then slowly started doing some other grant writing for them, and now as i said, i work a set number of hours, usually fifteen, twenty hours a week. i get paid to do all their policies and stuff. they have the stupidest aids policy ever, but their hr department developed it because they were in a lab there are a lot of osha issues. but there're eighty million needle sticks or paper cuts, and all kinds of crap. i mean when i worked at map i referred to it as the ‘what if’ questions. ""how do you get hiv?"" you can talk all you want about sexual harassment and sharing needles, but inevitably people would always be like, ""what if? what if a guy with aids worked in my office? what if he touched a piece of paper and got a paper cut? what if i touched that piece of paper?"" my favorite was—this was true—was somebody asked the question, ""what if i was in a swimming pool? what if there was a guy in the pool that had the aids? and what if someone threw a cat in the pool, and cats hate water. what if that cat scratched that guy? and what if i tried to get the cat out of the water and the cat scratched me?"" i said, ""well, probably what if a truck right now driving down park avenue filled with cattle fell over and a cow fell through the roof and hit you in the head?"" it would be the same level of risk! you know.",1377
"1982","doc 3162","lt: it still is a crazy time. i think it really is. i think people are a little bit better because i think where it got screwed up was with the surgeon general's thing in '88 when everett koop sent out that thing about bodily fluids, and it was trying to get passed the 'bodily fluids.' and here in minnesota in the early nineties, and i don't know if you are aware, we had a couple of doctors who were hiv positive, and one of them, he's dead now, dr. [unclear] benson, he and his partner, business partner who also had hiv, but let's not draw any conclusions, had a small family practice clinic. dr. benson delivered one of his patient's babies, and his dad used a brand new technique of video taping the birth of his child. he and his wife had been quite concerned because he and his wife had noticed that dr. benson had been losing a lot of weight, but dr. benson had told them whatever he told them. but when they took the videotape, dr. benson was not wearing gloves, and his arms and hands were covered with open sores. yes. that video tape blocking the child birth portion of these hands was shown endlessly, and it resulted in a tremendous move to test physicians, nurses, and it was like where are you going to stop? daycare workers? teachers? i was the only voice, honest to god, the only voice on this statewide committee that opposed it. i remember saying to them—one of the reasons you had to know if your doctor had hiv even if they were using universal precautions that was offered was, well you know one of the ways hiv manifests itself is dementia. aids related dementia. so you could have a doctor with hiv; you could have aids related dementia. you can have any freaking doctor with dementia. are you going to start testing every doctor over the age of fifty for early onset? to which there was no answer. ",1826
"1983","doc 3163","we still have now pretty strict laws in minnesota about physicians and nurses in particular. if you are hiv positive you have to self-report to the licensing board. there has to be someone in your practice that monitors you. there are certain—i don't know if there are certain things anymore, again i'm not current with it, but there were certain procedures that you could not be involved in. ",393

"1985","doc 3166","lt: but for me it was nothing different than the early days of trying to work with junkies because like why would you want to do that? who cares about them? let them die. and to some extent i think that still is true. i think there is more support and empathy now for people living with hiv than there is even for people who have addiction problems. although people in recovery have been lionized. that's the other part i hate about addiction is you get all of these clowns that get out of treatment and they're out of treatment like one second and they're an expert. and that irritates me more than almost anything else. i've spent my lifetime understanding the dynamics of addiction.",685
"1986","doc 3167","i personally don't buy into the disease model of addiction. i think it's a learned behavior. there may be a genetic component. i certainly believe that. but, i think it's a learned behavior to cope with mental health challenges, or environmental challenges you have be they abuse, neglect, violence, trauma of growing up in a dangerous environment. but people use as a means of escape. and they start using as young people, and when they suddenly get to be twenty, twenty-one they are like a ten-year-old. and now they're forty and they are still like a ten-year-old. and i think they need to learn how to grow up. ",615
"1987","doc 3168","i think within treatment these days the approach is that we've got to change your feelings, make you more empathetic. i think that's bullshit. most of these addicts are pretty hardcore, and the best way to change is you change your behavior. act as if you care about somebody. we know you really don't care about your roommate, and you think he's a loser. just pretend like you do. and if you practice long enough it will become internalized, and you will slowly notice your attitude's changing. so, first your behavior, and then you attitudes, and eventually you really get emotional feelings out of that. that was the essence of eden house. it no longer is, which is sad. i feel—",681
"1988","doc 3170","lt: it's much more of an aa model, and they have to abide by all the asam standards. what is it? american society of addiction medicine. it has to be in effective behavioral intervention as approved by asam. it has to be trauma informed. i mean it's all these buzz words, and it's like, ""jeez louise. you've got a bunch of emotional babies here that they don't know how to be an adult. they've never been an adult. they've never been raised responsible. let's just start getting them—"" we had an early client at eden house and he was a hispanic guy. he always used to say—the saying in eden house was, ""it's not you man, it's your behavior."" and used to say, ""it's not jew, man. it's your behavior."" and i always loved that being jewish. ",738
"1989","doc 3171","that really is a [unclear] behavior. i'm not attacking you, i care about you. but the behavior that you're exhibiting of stealing money, of hurting other people, whatever it is to keep your addiction alive. i don't like that, and i think that sucks. and i want you to change that. and i want you to do it because i care about you. and, you know, ""well, nobody's ever cared about me."" so, i think there's a different approach, and they try to blend it still somewhat at eden, but it's very hard. ",495
"1990","doc 3173","lt: right, well everybody who works there has to be an ladc, a licensed alcohol and drug abuse counselor. and most people in recovery don't have the ability or the background to go to school and become an ladc. so, you have a lot of particularly young women, young men, who want to be a social worker, and then become an ladc. i actually feel a little bit bad that during my brief stint between the eden house and map when i was a consultant that i was the one who drew up the guidelines that became the licensing of alcohol and drug abuse counselors. at the time it was credential through the health department and i created that. i created it for the state. i brought together—",679

"2053","doc 3300","at: some from morocco probably also. ",37
"2054","doc 3304","at: yes. it very quickly became evident that it’s useless to pursue the users. you have to find out who the distributors are, the dealers. the police efforts were concentrated on that. a lot of people got caught up in the net but the focus was where is it coming from and how do we cut this off? ",296
"2055","doc 3306","at: as i remember it, it was separately but there were attempts with communication and cooperation. politically at that time, it was so open and so visible and so in everybody’s faces. it could not be ignored. it could not be denied. it was there. it was part of our society. almost everybody knew a family whose kid had got caught up in that. it was just devastating. society had to deal with it. they came to this understanding; we can’t just deal with it by repressing it. we have to also do prevention. we have to do treatment. the four pillars that we say, i can’t think of what they are exactly. it’s a more differentiated approach and not just forbidding it. you can’t forbid something, prohibit something that so many people are doing anyways regardless of it being prohibited. it’s not going to go away just by outlawing it. a more permissive attitude sort of came forth then. they started leaving this expectation that people who were on drugs were just going to stop using them and become abstinence and be detoxed and then be okay. it hardly ever works that way. occasionally somebody does and that’s good. mostly not. ",1131
"2056","doc 3308","at: i’d say generally psychiatrists don’t want to or need to treat people with this kind of addiction. oftentimes because it’s viewed as something very strenuous you’re going to wind up with your bills not getting paid, stuff like that. the patients are going to be lying to you all the time. this also stems from the attitude, “i’m the doctor. i’m going to counsel you on what you need to do to overcome your problems.” especially in addiction you can’t do that. you have to find out where that person is at that moment and take it from there. you can’t superimpose this expectation of yours which doesn’t fit the frame of reference of the patient. you have to very carefully feel out the frame of reference of this person. including his substance abuse or her substance abuse and where they’re standing and why they have come to you. what they actually want from you. without saying, “this is what i want from you. this is what you have to do.” they’re coming to you with an expectation that you’re going to help them in a certain way. you have to find out what that is. it might not be realistic but it usually is not realistic in a way that they are expecting me to do much more for them. ultimately them achieving much more than they are actually able to do at that moment. ",1279
"2057","doc 3309","oftentimes my first job is to just find out where they are, give them the feeling that they’re being listened to and understood, and then start toning down their expectations. “listen. you can’t just stop taking that. you can’t just detox and everything will be okay. let’s try methadone or dolophine or oral morphine, the slow release type. you have to be open to various options and approaches.” oftentimes you need to accept the fact that in the background they’re using other substances. each case is its own individual case. of course there are certain patterns that the addict does this and that. it’s very personal. ",623
"2058","doc 3311","at: i started to. it’s been a long road. i’ve been in this business now for almost thirty years. ",97
"2059","doc 3313","at: it has a lot to do with my own personal experience too. a lot of personal stuff and realizing how vulnerable i am. this is not something that is just a bad life choice. this is something that can happen to you. i mentioned in one of the letters that i had my own brush with morphine. this is something that took me completely by surprise. this was shortly before i opened my practice. my friend, the anesthesiologist, had just gotten some practice permit. he said, “let’s see what this whole thing is about this flash.”",523
"2060","doc 3315","at: the flash, the rush, when you inject an opiate. he had morphine ampules and we shot intravenously ten milligrams. it was at first, “this is kind of relaxing and nice.” but actually a little bit too much because i kind of was woozy and drowsy. i tried it again but with only five milligrams, a very small amount comparatively. that was, “oh my god.” all my troubles with attention deficit disorder, my problems with concentration, my problems with the strenuous—with keeping up a conversation with anybody and staying focused on the subject and not drifting away mentally and my ability to read and retain stuff was just better. i went to twice a week. it was helpful. ",672
"2061","doc 3316","it was that point where i started feeling discouraged and craving. i got addicted. i detoxed three or four times. if you’re taking something you’ve just really got to stay away from it because then my disdain for being dependent on something like that and my willingness to compromise. i’m clean but i’d still call myself an addict. i have vast amounts of oral morphine in my practice because i have to distribute it. i never ever, ever keep injectable morphine in my practice. i know that it’s too tempting. i could go buy it any time from the pharmacy.",554
"2062","doc 3318","at: but i don’t do that. it’s just i know i cannot fool myself into thinking, once it will be okay. they come in packs of ten and i won’t be able to not use up the entire pack of ten. you can also buy them in boxes of one hundred ampules. they have ten milligram and twenty milligram ampules. it’s a really easy split. i just keep it at a distance. ",349
"2063","doc 3320","at: this was a very, very profoundly humiliating experience. ",61
"2064","doc 3322","at: i never thought that could happen to me. it never did with any other substance. i can smoke a joint tomorrow and then not think about it for a year. i like a glass of wine but i don’t crave it. i could easily go days or weeks without it. i had cocaine, i didn’t like the effect because it made me all tight and nervous and crabby. i talked a mile a minute but i didn’t like the way i was physically feeling when i was on it. i avoid it. ",441
"2065","doc 3324","at: altogether like ten years. ",31
"2066","doc 3326","at: not well. susan started to notice. she could tell that i was using. sometimes she thought i was using and wasn’t. she was never sure. i lied about it or denied it or denied it when i actually wasn’t doing but she didn’t believe me. stuff like that. it was a difficult thing. like thilo beck said, i’m a doctor. i can buy the clean stuff and inject it cleanly. i might have injected two or three thousand times but you can’t see anything on my veins.",453
"2067","doc 3328","at: i’m a doctor. i know how to do it. i know i need to stay away from that. ",77
"2068","doc 3330","at: no, i never wanted that stuff. i just stopped.",50
"2069","doc 3332","at: yes. i’d be using it for two weeks and working and performing just fine. once or twice one of my addict patients suspected me because they just knew. ",154
"2070","doc 3334","at: i talked my way out of it. “i’m so kaput today because i didn’t sleep last night.” or something like that. then i was off of it and clean. they weren’t sure anymore. ",170
"2071","doc 3336","at: i was not in control. i was actually being controlled by the substance. ",76
"2072","doc 3338","at: i know how powerful that can be.",36
"2073","doc 3340","at: i know how you can be thinking rationally and you’ll be doing something completely contrary. knowing as i’m doing it that i don’t want to do it but i’m doing it anyways. here it is. “oh my god that feels good. why did i do that? what an asshole now i did it again.” ",270
"2074","doc 3342","at: the other part is like somebody else is holding the steering wheel and driving you. it’s a profound thing and i think it’s kind of unique for the opiates. they have such an intricate way of interacting with the receptors in your brain and so specific in the way they interact with your brain. they quickly are after a relatively short time can change the way that your brain is functioning and the way of steering your thoughts and your behavior. ",451
"2075","doc 3344","at: yes, but i am very respectful of it. i will never have that in my practice or close to me because i couldn’t resist. ",121
"2076","doc 3346","at: he didn’t get into that. maybe he was less vulnerable than me. maybe he never had attention deficit disorder or something like that. i never identified with my patients. i started to understand them better but i never felt, “you’re the same as me.” it’s not like i chummed up to them. ",289
"2077","doc 3348","at: i was pretty understanding before but you can’t really know what it is. it’s not something that you should have to know. you shouldn’t have to have that experience. the price is just way too high. in that sense it’s very humiliating. i never feel ever even this much superiority over my patients. i know why they lie. i know that works. i know how much they hate themselves for lying. the whole shame thing and everything is just mind blowing. ",448
"2078","doc 3350","at: hard to say what has changed around me or what i have changed myself. i used to work a lot more, see patients five or five and a half days a week. i was insane. a few years back really started to realize how morphine was helping me to work more. ",250
"2079","doc 3352","at: a couple years was the last time i used it. there were gaps. ",65
"2080","doc 3354","at: i was very worried about myself. ",37
"2081","doc 3356","at: i took methadone or oral morphine just to bridge over a certain gap of time before i knew i could take two or three weeks off to detox. ",140
"2082","doc 3358","at: it would take me four or five days to get over the worst but then you’re shaking depending on how long you’ve used. you’re going to have post-acute withdrawal symptoms for up to a year or two. ",197
"2083","doc 3360","at: i reduced the number of addict patients i treat. most of the patients that are being treated by me i’ve been treating for years. i haven’t taken on many new ones. ",167
"2084","doc 3362","at: beck mentioned, i can confirm that. most people i see are…",62
"2085","doc 3364","at: i can’t remember the last time i’ve seen a teenaged user.",61
"2086","doc 3366","at: i had sixteen, seventeen year olds. my youngest patients were sixteen and already heavy heroin users. it was a long battle on methadone and this and that. there’s still cocaine there. what are we going to do? we’ll prescribe methylphenidate, ritalin.",254
"2087","doc 3368","at: sort of. it’s a stimulant. it’s not like they’d totally not crave it. in some way or another it helps them maintain a certain stability. i’ll go along with it. as long as it works it works. the pragmatic approach. it’s a difficult thing when you treat addicts. it’s not a quick thing. you’re in for a long haul always. ",323
"2088","doc 3370","at: to a degree. i work together with pharmacies. i work with federal practitioners. i actually am one of the very, very few, i don’t know another psychiatrist except for arud in zurich which is a huge practice there, i take blood and there’s a central lab in baden that i bring it over to and do lab work there. i do maintain a very, very small amount of physical contact with my patients. i measure their blood pressure or listen to their heart. where was i going? ",467
"2089","doc 3372","at: it’s rare that i get somebody below twenty for anything anymore which is okay. i’m older myself. i think it might have to do with the fact that when i started my practice i was much younger and probably projected a much more dynamic, youngish me which younger patients could identify with more. ",299
"2090","doc 3374","at: i’d say about a fifth of them just hear about me and call me up. the rest, half of the rest get referred by practitioners and the other half by the psychiatric institute. most of my patients are not addicts. ",212
"2091","doc 3376","at: it’s hard to say. i purposely sort of withdrew a little bit from that because it’s really taxing. in private practice if you don’t have an infrastructure and a lot of personnel and social workers and stuff like that to help additionally it’s a lot of work.",260
"2092","doc 3378","at: the different aspects.",26
"2093","doc 3380","at: their whole living situation, who they’re living with, their economic situation, their job. all this stuff. how are they buying food? who’s paying for it? where’s it coming from? do they have social services of the municipality there to help them?",251
"2094","doc 3382","at: the whole thing. all that. which i don’t do myself but i have to be in phone contact with the social services of the municipality or their primary care physician or with their employer or with their landlord or whatever. ",225
"2095","doc 3384","at: not as much. it’s a lot of work and a lot of work that i can’t charge for. ",79
"2096","doc 3386","at: i have a petition for work in absence of the patient but you can’t overdo it. the insurance will just refuse to pay it. ",124
"2097","doc 3388","at: i think education of health professionals needs to start early and with a bigger emphasis on it. it’s a huge part of our society, of the health system, of what we have to deal with, it’s underrepresented. ",209
"2098","doc 3390","at: yes. the whole understanding of addiction, like tobacco addiction is completely under dealt with. it’s addiction that’s about as bad as heroin addiction. people who are hooked on cigarettes have a hard time stopping.",220
"2099","doc 3392","at: they talk about the amount of deaths from heroin, there’s ten times as much death from tobacco.",99
"2100","doc 3394","at: it’s legal. you can buy it every place. you go outside and smoke. alcohol is more noticed but still that’s very accepted. it takes a long time for acquaintances or relatives of an addict to admit that the one close to them is having a problem with alcohol. it will be overlooked and denied and sort of rationalized. then for the person who is consuming it themselves, they accept that themselves because it’s part of society. almost everybody drinks. ninety-five percent of the drinkers can handle that and five percent consume seventy-five percent of what’s consumed. ",573
"2101","doc 3396","at: i think that’s probably universal.",38
"2102","doc 3398","at: more education, more knowledge about it, more understanding, and you need a lot of experience. ",99
"2103","doc 3400","at: more than they used to but i’m not sure how useful that is because the educational system is dealing with kids. there’s a degree you can educate them about addiction and substances and stuff like that. it’s something that, “okay i see my parents drinking wine. i’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about.” ",314
"2104","doc 3402","at: i think in higher levels of public education you could probably introduce this topic. for teenagers, make them aware that this is something that you have to be aware of and careful of. they need to know some facts about drugs that can easily become available at a party or on the street, heroin or cocaine, before they try it. so that they have an idea of what they might be risking and getting into just by touching the stuff. ",432
"2105","doc 3404","at: i’m just not sure. ",23
"2106","doc 3406","at: no. it should be more legal. when i talk about legalization often people think about it as this black and white thing. tobacco is regulated legally, so is alcohol. there’re rules and you can get in trouble.",210
"2107","doc 3408","at: it’s a question of how we regulate it legally not whether it’s just illegal or legal. i think you have to take into account the different risks of these different substances. opiates is kind of in a way different from the other things. cocaine is different but it also has similarities with other stimulants and stuff. opiates are very distinct idiosyncratic effect. alcohol is just a cell poison. you bathe yourself in it and they sort go “ugh” and release their dopamine. opiate, that docks onto a very specific point and tricks the nerves into thinking something else. ",576
"2108","doc 3410","at: if you use too much of it you’ll stop breathing. ",53
"2109","doc 3412","at: not that i can think of at the moment. i’ve been babbling away. ",68
"2110","doc 3414","at: make it available i think. public acceptance that this is an aspect that should not be so stigmatized that needs to be accepted as something that you can become addicted just the same way as you can suffer from high blood pressure. if you have high blood pressure you always have to take a medication that keeps it in the low range. countless other, like diabetes. okay there might be some different ways of looking at it and understanding it but in certain aspects why should you think of it differently? it’s a health problem. ",533
"2111","doc 3416","at: the only thing that makes heroin so dangerous is it enters your brain about ten times more easily than morphine. if you inject it this huge wall of heroin is immediately entering your brain. the sharp rise in the concentration might be a temporal overdose. your brain doesn’t have enough time to adjust to this amount of effect. your breathing just shuts down, your heart stops. that’s an overdose. apart from that it’s not particularly dangerous. if you take an amount of heroin that you can tolerate your health isn’t going to be impaired. you’re just going to be dependent on it.",586
"2112","doc 3418","at: it can be a problem. i like being able to move freely. i want to go to the states for a few weeks and not have to worry about having something with me that maintains me. these are the motivational factors that beck was talking about. i have lots of reasons that i don’t want to.",282
"2113","doc 3420","at: the whole politics towards this needs to change. it’s just so tiresome because there are experts who have a lot of knowledge and experience about it but their hands are tied by the greater way that it’s being seen by society and by the health department and by the politics. ",279
"2114","doc 3422","at: how flexible are you as a therapist? how flexible can you use substitution agents or other treatment modalities that you can offer? talk therapy, group therapy, institutionalization, whatever works or is desired or is acceptable or makes sense. this whole thing about, “you have to not take it and you’re only a wonderful person if you’re not addicted or dependent on anything at all.” it doesn’t work that way, it can’t. you can argue, “you made a bad decision.” it’s not like that. you have peer pressure; you have all sorts of things coming into play. you have a teenager who’s heard all this stuff and they think, “yeah, yeah that’s what all the adults are saying. here my friend is offering me something and he’s taking it. he looks okay. i’m going to see what it’s like myself.” you can’t just say this is a bad decision. it’s the way things go. ",856
"2115","doc 3424","at: yes. this needs to be very readily available.",49
"2116","doc 3426","at: and easily available. somebody at ten o’clock in the morning could be like, “god i can’t continue this way.” and at one in the afternoon walks into a place like arud it’s good that something happens right then. ",215

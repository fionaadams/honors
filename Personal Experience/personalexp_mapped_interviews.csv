"1","Anderson_Greg","Greg Anderson Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Greg Anderson-GA Amy Sullivan-AS GA:  My name is Greg Anderson.  I am the Social Service Supervisor for St. Louis County Public Health Human Services in the area of Chemical Dependency Services. 8 I have been employed with St. Louis County for twenty-four plus years. 14 I have a bachelor's degree in sociology from Minnesota State Mankato.  I have a master's degree in social work from the University of Minnesota Duluth. 19 I was born in extreme southeastern Minnesota. 14 I grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota, which is forty miles south of Winona. 8, 20 Went to high school, graduated from there. 7 I already described my college life. 7, 10, 14 I was born in June of 1956. 14 AS: Do you give me permission to record this interview?  AS: I just have to say that.  GA: Cover the bases.  In case my attorney calls sometime. 16, 17 AS: So you grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota and then went to Mankato. 8, 20 GA: Two years in Winona first, then transferred to Mankato State. 5, 14, 17 AS: Oh, okay.  So does your family have a history of college education? 7, 12, 14, 15 GA: Neither my mother or father does. 16 My sister had degrees in both sociology and nursing. 20 AS: Did your parents encourage you to go to college? 7, 20 GA: Absolutely.  Growing up in the sixties, early seventies in a small, rural town basically there wasn't a lot of industry. 19 The primary business or industry was farming. 8, 19 I was not in a position to really take on the doo-doo. 18 Allergies and other things.  I wasn't in a position to carry on with the family farm, so it was real clear. 8, 12 My sister was eight years older than I. 14, 20 She had gone and went to nursing school at Mankato State University. 7 Needed to move on, and I was more of a person-oriented person. 15 If I could have handled calculus I would have been a meteorologist.  Then I went to look at mass communication journalism, news broadcasting. 15, 16 Spent some time there.  Realized I couldn't handle the egos that were present in that area of work, so I slipped into sociology. 5, 8, 10 Got my BA degree and spent three summers as the summer rec program director for the Mable and Canton communities. 7, 18, 19 Had this strong love—my first love outside of family is baseball. 12, 14 I spend a lot of time following that when I'm not working. 10 That's kind of that.  That got me to the Twin Cities.  From 1978 to 1987 when I got married and moved up here I worked in nursing homes. 7, 15 I was a short-time activity assistant, activity director, and then spent probably eight years as a social service director. 14, 18, 19 Basically coordinated admissions, discharged planning, addressing psychosocial needs of nursing home residents while in the nursing home. 5, 9, 19 Did that, then met my wife and moved up here. 7, 15, 20 Realized I didn't have a lot of job opportunities with just a sociology degree, so I was one of the first graduating class members of—the advanced generalist program—MSW program—at the University of Minnesota Duluth. 7, 11, 14, 19 UMD had basically discontinued their MSW program, and this was the start up of a new program going more into advanced generalist or generalist practice of doing standard basic social work with advanced education. 14, 15, 16, 19 It was a really enlightening experience for me, and it was really unique because in school for the two years in our class of about twenty something individuals I was basically the only one that had worked in gerontology. 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 Everybody else was Children/Family Services. 5 There were two or three individuals that were dealing with chemical dependency, substance use disorder type things. 6, 13 My interest at the time continued to be geriatric, elderly, assisting and supporting individuals going through the aging process. 13, 17 Being able to assist and support them and the families. 17 The aging process is an evolving process of grieving because as we age we transition. 17 When we transition we lose certain skills and/or certain access or stages of life, and we have to be able to deal with that and then go into the next phase of life. 9, 10, 17 As one gets older, as I currently am, even having more realization and understanding what I witnessed and experienced in the early years. 14, 17, 18, 20 Got through school at UMD. 7 Had done an internship here at Children and Family Service, which at that time was St. Louis County Social Services. 5 I was able to do an internship at the county nursing home. 19 Finished that.  Was later hired as a child protection worker. 5, 14, 19 Commuted for over a year and a half to Hibbing, Minnesota. 14 So it was a hundred and forty-four mile trip each day to work. 16 After about eighteen months of doing that our first child was born and I had the opportunity to work for the state of Minnesota at the Minnesota Veteran's Home in Silver Bay that had just opened. 11, 14, 16, 19 I spent a year there working on admission coordination. 14 It wasn't a lot in relationship to discharge [unclear]. 19 Basically it was kind of a last phase of life for veterans and veterans' spouses, and in the meantime the program was also looking at adding an Alzheimer's or dementia unit to the program. 6, 10, 12, 13, 19 I was there for a year. 14 We were starting to train staff as we looked at opening the additional forty beds in the unit for an Alzheimer's group, but then I was able to return to Duluth and get a job at Chris Jenson County Nursing Home as a discharge planner as Chris Jensen was adding a new role in a rehab unit. 10, 11, 16, 19 With my internship and experience I had established nice relationships in the nursing home, and so they were very happy to bring me on board. 18, 19 I spent two and a half years at the nursing home. 14 Came to the realization—I loved the work—but Duluth and St. Louis County Social Services was going to be my employer probably for the rest of my professional career. 14, 15, 19 I needed to come down to the government service center and get myself established here. 12, 14, 19 I came down in 1995.  Spent four plus years as a contract manager. 14, 19 Basically working on purchase of service contracts for various units and divisions anywhere from children family service group homes, home care agencies, board and lodge programs, assisted living programs, chemical dependency treatment programs, mental health centers. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 I had a very wide variety of experiences within those service areas. 8, 18, 19, 20 I did that until April of 2000.  In April of 2000 I decided I needed a change. 14 I needed to have more experience, so I became an adult foster care licenser. 13, 18, 19 I was an adult foster care licenser for over two and a half years, and then based on some encouragement I had received from one or two supervisors within the department we were going through a succession plan, we had an iconic adult service supervisor who had been managing both mental health and chemical dependency services for fifteen to twenty years—she was very iconic within the human services community here in Duluth and St. Louis County. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 She was looking at retirement. 12 I filled a position that had been vacant for two years, so I took on chemical dependency adult protection common entry point, and represented pay services, and my responsibilities have kind of evolved and switched, and so since January of 2003 I have been supervising chemical dependency services. 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19 For the first twelve years I was just supervising services in south St. Louis County, and we ended up doing some restructuring at that time. 14, 16, 19 I took on supervision for all of St. Louis County—both north and south. 16 Got Rule 25 assessors in three different offices.  We also have a special project, which has been generated through the county board's commitment to support and try to find resolutions to the opioid epidemic. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 I have been directing and overseeing substance abuse prevention, intervention initiatives since probably April of 2014. 6, 10, 13, 18, 19 AS: How have you observed the opioid crisis? 13, 14 You've been dealing with substance abuse professionally since when did you say? 6, 13 AS: You have a decade plus experience seeing what's happening in your community. 6, 14, 15, 18, 19 What have you witnessed?  Coming in in 2003 the primary substance of choice was alcohol. 6, 19 Alcohol is still seen as number one. 6 There have been a few cycles and trends that have changed. 13 We get into the later 2000s, maybe starting 2006, 2007 we had an incredible upswing in methamphetamine. 5, 6, 8 We were basically dealing with that on two different fronts. 19 Not only the effect it was having on the individuals and family through the use, but also the public health crisis we were dealing with through the manufacturing. 6, 12, 13, 19 A lot of money, a lot of resources were put into that. 8, 10 We actually worked through a collaboration through Children and Family Services unit and through our Financial Assistance unit we were working on setting up a shared family program where basically mothers and/or parents dealing with substance use would be placed into an adult foster home, or actually it would end up being a dually licensed foster home where a parent and child could be placed together to assist and support during the initial phases of the recovery process. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 A lot of barriers in place from a state perspective in regards to funding.  Funding for adults, for residential services through what is called the Group State Residential Housing Program has significant effects on the Minnesota Family Investment Program, MFIP. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 So using 1) has impacts on others, and I can't get into great detail right now because my memory's kind of faded. 6, 12, 20 We operated it for about two to three years, but there were continuing barriers in regards to getting the appropriate level of funding and getting families to accept what was needing to be done from a financial assistance standpoint. 12, 13, 14, 17 AS: So you were trying to put parents in recovery with their children in order so that their children didn't have to be away from them, but they were being supervised by some other caregiver or adult. 5, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 Monitoring, mentoring, those types of— AS: And you weren't able to coordinate the different funding streams in order to make it work the way you imagined it? 12, 18 GA: It got to be very frustrating.  We had actually before I had come into this position there had been ongoing discussions in the past regarding trying to do this for parents dealing with mental illness. 7, 12, 20 This was a continuation.  There were some barriers in regards to the funding streams.  The state has worked very hard in trying to get things in place in relationship to the efforts to reduce homelessness and provide permanent support of housing services. 5, 6, 9, 14, 19 I'm not sure if some of those things may have now changed. 12, 13 We haven't really taken a look at that. 18 In recent times we've been looking at other projects in relationship to harm reduction for chronic inebriates who face long-term homelessness. 5, 6, 14, 17, 19 We have a program called the San Marco, which was basically a project that has been modeled in several other communities not only within the state of Minnesota, but also throughout the country. 5, 19 Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment and Center City Housing were key players in that. 6, 12, 15 St. Louis County Public Health and Human Services provided a supportive role in the development. 10, 12, 19 We worked with assistance in utilizing a group residential housing financial assistance benefit to provide funding for those individuals meeting those characteristics. 6, 9, 13, 15, 18 As a matter of fact we're having a ten-year anniversary of it's opening on June 22nd. 10, 14 Alcohol consumption is not a— AS: Do they call those a wet house? 6, 13 That might be extreme.  GA: That's a common term. 17 We've kind of shifted from a wet house to a supportive housing for chronic inebriates. 6, 8, 13, 19 That's just another example of what the collaboration and commitment of a community can do to address it. 5, 12, 19 I wish I still had a DVD—a DVD was made I think two years after the opening—and it's called ""There Are No Losers,"" and it's a very telling story. 10, 14, 15 They bring tears to some.  I'll have to see if I can find it in my office. 6 Law enforcement was real, I don't want to say cynical, but they had some real concerns about putting this together, and basically the end of the DVD is a very moving statement by our then police chief in regards to the program and what it has done not only for the individuals residing there, but for the positive impact on the city and community. 8, 12, 13, 19 AS: That is a harm reduction model. 5, 14 When you walk out of our office, our building, if you look one block over and up San Marco is there. 16, 19 It is 230 West 3rd Street.  It actually has seventy units. 7, 19 Thirty is the board and watch component for the inebriates, and we have forty single room SRO units for individuals. 8, 13, 14, 17, 19 Basically the SRO is geared—we have our Human Development Center which is a community mental health center—they provide supportive services for individuals in the SRO in the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment provides the services for the individuals in the board watch. 5, 12, 13, 17, 19 AS: To get back to meth—you saw that was a crisis, you tried to do a housing situation, then— GA: 6 There were a lot of resources being allocated for this.  There were enhanced services for Children or Family Services to provide support, direction, and intervention for those families afflicted with the issue. 5, 13, 17, 18, 19 Things kind of, well at least from our standpoint, things fell to the wayside for a period of time, and I think the biggest thing was from a law enforcement standpoint being able to focus and reduce, and not ever totally eliminate, but greatly reduce the labs in the community. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 AS: Were they in houses in Duluth? 6, 9, 13 They were in Duluth, rural Duluth— AS: I've heard of them in rural areas, but you actually had them here in the city? 7, 8, 9, 20 I can think of at least three or four instances of those being in homes in Duluth.  Basically it wasn't necessarily in lower income areas that this was occurring. 8, 10, 20 It had no boundaries in relationship to income. 19 AS: Yeah, that myth is being busted right now. 12 GA: It's really coming back. 18 Meth is also very, very prevalent. 10 But, things really slowed down probably, and I'm guessing, 2010, 2011. 10, 18 We're just kind of going along. 17 We were dealing with issues, but things were really coming to light, things were really becoming noticeable in 2011, 2012. 12, 13, 18 In late 2012 the then commissioner of the Department of Human Services came up to Duluth with community leaders, I believe our police chief was a part of this panel and presentation, but I want to say it was Lucinda Jesson who was the Department of Human Services Commissioner at that time. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19 Long story short she came in and she was discussing the state's direction to put together and implement a substance use state plan to address substance use. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 18 AS: She came up from St. Paul?  GA: She came up from St. Paul.  I believe there may have been—I think the Minnesota Department of Health and I think another state department was there along with our Chief of Police at the time Gordon Ramsey. 9, 12, 17, 19 We were excited that this was taking place. 11 I attended the session along with our adult service division director Mark Nelson. 6, 18, 19 At the time our north St. Louis County MCD supervisor Mike [unclear], and we also had in attendance a professor from the University of Duluth's school of pharmacy Mark Sneiderhan, and the CEO of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment Gary Olson, Dr. Faris Keeling, and Dr. Beth Bilden from Essentia—at that point it was St. Mary's Duluth clinic. 5, 7, 12, 16 We had some other treatment providers there, but this group started talking after the session, and that discussion led to a series of meetings, which basically was the first step for the development of our Opioid Abuse Response Strategies work group. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 That's an overview.  AS: You had seen the impact in St. Louis County in 2012 was still there, right? 6, 12 At that point in time the primary concern was focused on prescription opioids. 6, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 As conversations came about reviews, discussions, as time went on basically there came to be greater monitoring and control of prescription medications. 10, 14, 18, 19, 20 When those were no longer easily accessed, the entrepreneurship of others reflecting back on supply and demand basically said they can't have prescription medications, but we have something that will fit their need and we will be able to provide it at a price that will be good for us and affordable for them. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 That started to swing or shift into heroin. 8, 16 The second page of this references an appearance of two OARS [Opioid Abuse Response Strategies] members, which was basically myself and our first Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative team member [Marsha Gertel]. 6, 13, 14, 19 We were interviewed on Almanac North.  Almanac North is a spin-off of Almanac on Channel 2 in the Twin Cities.  Basically those questions were posed to us and we kind of went through them.  There had been a major heroin bust I think the day before—the date we were on Almanac North was Good Friday of 2014. 13, 16 There was a major heroin bust either Wednesday or Thursday of that week, and based on that Channel 8 had called Dana Kazel, the communication manager, and was wanting to get some response from St. Louis County in relationship to this. 13, 15, 16, 19 Through that our department was contacted. 9, 12, 19 Our Adult Service Division director was unable to attend, so basically it went to myself and [Marsha Gertel] and we did the interview with two hosts of the program. 18, 19 The OARS group basically ended up having discussions and leading up to a proposal put together through our then—I think it was late 2000s—our Public Health department and Social Service department merged into Public Health and Human Services. 8, 9, 12, 19 Our Public Health and Human Services department proposed to the county commissioner's developing our Substance Use Prevention Intervention Initiative. 8, 9, 12, 14, 19 Through a unanimous vote in January 2014 they basically approved the allocation of four FTE's to provide prevention/intervention services throughout St. 10, 19 Louis County to address issues relating to substance abuse. 5, 6, 12, 13 That's our latest draft of our pamphlet or brochure. 5 As you can tell—yeah.  [shows the pamphlet] 17 So, that basically gives you the description of what we do in relationship to assisting and supporting individuals, families, and communities throughout St. Louis County. 13, 17, 19 We will do things from public education, trainings, we'll do consultations within a department and family members or others that are calling and concerned and wanting direction or ideas. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 AS: So people can reach OARS? 9 GA: We're basically an extension of OARS. 19 It was through OARS that this program was founded.  OARS came first. 14 AS: That's interesting because what I take from that is that opioid crisis led to thinking about substance abuse prevention and intervention more broadly. 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19 Is that true? 5 GA: I think that's very fair. 9 That's basically what we are looking at. 19 AS: You didn't necessarily have coordinated services here, but you decided to expand this to include all substance use rather than just opioids. 6, 13, 14, 19 We are doing a lot of our focus on the opioid piece. 13 We do what is called expedited Rule 25 assessments for Children and Family Services. 5, 12, 13 We have an incredibly high rate of out of home placement. 5, 7, 12, 18 Kids in foster care or other licensed facilities and programs related to parental substance use. 6, 13, 19, 20 We have a parent or parents that come in who are at risk of losing their children. 5, 14, 20 They are in borderline crisis or in crisis.  If they are willing and wanting we'll do the assessment, oftentimes right then if one of our workers is available, either [Matt Johnson] or [Marsha Gertel]. 12, 13, 19 We also have a social worker in north St. Louis County. 19 He's based in Hibbing, but we'll be able to go and if not exactly that day then the next day. 13, 16 It happens very quickly. 15 Let me see if I can find [rustling through papers]. 6 Minnesota Department of Health has put together some annual—I can probably forward you through the Minnesota Department of Health—it's basically data, statistics on overdoses in Minnesota. 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 It does a county breakdown. 19 I have basically broken things down for St. Louis County through 2015. 8, 19 The 2016 statistics should be coming out at any point, but we are up to through 2015 right now. 12 You can take a look at the overdoses related to opioids. 6, 13 This is based on admissions to licensed chemical dependency treatment programs. 12, 13, 14 It's not necessarily dealing with individuals, but admissions. 13 AS: Because some people might go in three times in a year. 9, 14 GA: Yeah, as you well know from personal experience. 12, 18 AS: Can you talk to me about the climate of collaboration and cooperation that you think Duluth has, and is doing a good job? 10, 11 Why do you think that is?  What are the factors? 17 GA: I don't know if it is something in the drinking water. 5, 11, 12, 16 I mean it's something that I witnessed when I first came to the community in 1987, and there is just something here that is just part of the culture and the value of being able to work together and support each other even though we may not agree on other various items or values in life. 8, 9, 10, 14, 19 When we have a common purpose or see a problem that needs to be solved we can push our differences aside to work jointly and in a collaborative fashion. 6, 9, 12 We submitted a grant proposal to the Department of Human Services for approximately 1.3 million dollars for the state targeted response to the opioid crisis. 9, 12, 13, 14 The state of Minnesota received 5.3 million dollars for 2017 and 2018 through legislation that was pushed and supported very hard by Senator [Amy] Klobuchar to address the opioid crisis for rural communities. 5, 9, 13, 14, 19 AS: Did you say the state got five million?  AS: That was for rural?  I'll see if I can send you a PowerPoint and some handouts that will give you even more information. 6 AS: So you just turned that in?  GA: We submitted that on April 28th [2017].  St. Louis County Public Health Human Service submitted a proposal as the lead partner in a consortium with Duluth Police Department, Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force, Rural AIDS Action Network, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, University of Minnesota Duluth School of Pharmacy, six judicial district drug courts, and Carleton County Public Health and Human Service. 5, 6, 9, 12, 14 AS: So it's for St. Louis and Carleton County?  GA: Carleton County will receive no financial benefit from the application, but the things that we're doing will allow Carleton County residents access to particular things in relationship to drug court and probably the star component in this proposal is the development of a medically monitored opioid withdrawal program through Duluth Detox. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Basically it's a six-bed expansion of the Duluth Detox program, which is managed by the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, who collaborated and helped facilitate the San Marco program. 12 Basically this will be for individuals to go through medical withdrawal with nurses and doctors monitoring. 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18 There will be medication that they need. 14 The Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment also has the Clear Path program, which is a medication assisted treatment program, which utilizes both methadone and Suboxone. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 We went through a significant borderline crisis situation back in I want to say 2013. 9, 11 We had a methadone program, and I don't want to get sued for what I'm about to say, but we had a methadone program called Lake Superior Treatment Center. 12 Basically they were going through significant concerns and issues in relationship to meeting licensing. 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 State Rule 31 licensing requirements. 12 I want to say it was either in 2012 or 2013 their license was revoked, which put the state of Minnesota in a crisis situation because they were one of five or six programs under the same company based out of state. 13, 14 In the state of Minnesota when a license is revoked it is revoked for all programs under the parent company. 13, 14, 20 If they would have closed Lake Superior Treatment Center they would have ended up closing I think three or four programs in the Twin Cities, one in St. Cloud, and one in Rochester. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14 [section omitted]  AS: But the other place was a licensing issue about the way they were monitoring the methadone? 6, 8, 13, 18 GA: Yeah, there was a long list, but things are set up where if a provider appeals the revocation they can maintain operation through the appeal process. 17 The appeal process went through about a two plus year time period. 14, 17, 18 During the initial onset of this we were meeting with the Department of Human Services state contingency plans if something ended up playing out and the program was closed. 5, 9, 10, 12, 18 As a result through collaboration with the OARS group St. Louis County put out an ROP for a community based treatment program. 6, 12, 13, 19 We received a number of proposals.  We ended up doing personal or presentations by three finals in the area and we basically ended up reviewing and choosing the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment. 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 19 Gary Olson, the CEO, had been talking about putting something together four or five years prior to this piece, so this raised the level of need. 8, 14 Gary and the Center are just so reflective of the collaboration and the efforts to do things.  It's a non-profit. 15 He's the chief executive officer that's been working and dealing with this stuff for thirty plus years. 8, 14 AS: You picked someone that also reflects the community itself. 19 GA: Yes.  Focusing on community needs. 6, 19 Gary is very adamant about this being a public health issue because it has such an impact on individuals' families in the overall community. 13, 17, 19 It's very reflective of what we are trying to do as the OARS group.  AS: Is he on OARS?  AS: You keep all the people who've got their hands in this issue around the table? 9, 13, 17 We meet every two months. 11, 16, 18 Our next meeting is June 15th. 18 If your calendar allows you can certainly—I can send you an appointment. 8, 10, 12, 17 We meet on the second floor. 14, 18 It's a really exciting time. 18 Based on what was sent out in relationship to the grant proposal we might be hearing tomorrow on whether or not—they were talking twenty-one days. 5, 9, 16, 19 It's such a tight timeline. 9 The state submitted their plan in January, and basically these programs are supposed to be running by July 1st. 8, 19 Basically the awards have to be done and then the contract and negotiation piece between the awardees and DHS. 19 They basically have the contract signed and get things in place on July 1st. 11, 19 It's been a real interesting process. 17 AS: You were saying one of the things it includes is six more beds, managed detox. 19 What are some of the other parts that you think are special or particular? 9 GA: A rapid response for overdose victims. 13 We're collaborating with Duluth police, the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force. 8 Jeff  Kazel can give you a lot more detail with that.  What we are doing through this particular piece we are looking at an expansion of Narcan or naloxone access. 9 Being able to provide naloxone or Narcan and training to use that substance. 6, 13 The target is all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. 8, 12, 13 I think sometimes I get lost in the details—I'm not sure if that's also going to possibly include other emergency responders, but definitely all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 We're going to be partnering through our substance use prevention intervention initiative our social workers to provide rapid response in regard to follow up support. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 We're going to try to get out and see the individual in one or two days. 6, 16 If it's a Friday evening we probably wouldn't be able to do anything until Monday. 16 Being able to get out to the individual, provide them a Rule 25 assessment, which is the first step in access in treatment, and provide other alternatives or supports that may be applicable or necessary. 9, 12, 13, 14 Trying to establish that contact as early on as possible to get things in place to provide support.  AS: It's filling a gap where there haven't been enough resources or enough people to treat this quickly. 5, 9 GA: We're hoping that this will be a nice fit in regards to the detox expansion. 15, 18, 19 The thing is we all know the need is going to exceed the supply, but Duluth Detox will be able to bring individuals in and provide a place for them to stay so they can get in the program. 12, 13 Gary Olson and Duluth Detox is going to be working with north St. Louis County Range Detox in Virginia [Minnesota] being able to go into Range Detox and staying at Range Detox until they are going to be able to be brought out to the Duluth Detox program. 7 We'll be working on other ways, too. 18 If possible openings are available. 10 There have been discussions about transportation to and from Ely and bringing people down. 9, 17 The thing that gets lost with St. Louis County is geographically it is bigger than three states within the mainland. 11 We've got a large geographical area. 8 Another thing too, which we're reminded on a regular basis too, is that St. Louis County is so massive we're dealing with services and issues related to both urban and rural settings. 12, 13, 19 We need to be able to understand and put things in place to address things for both areas. 5, 8, 17, 18, 20 It helps me having grown up on a small farm to be able to better connect and understand some of those things. 8, 10, 17, 18 There are always discussions about, ""This happens here. 15, 18 That happens there."" 15 Well, you've got an apple and you've got an orange. 7 We can't make orange juice with an apple. 7 We can't make apple pie with an orange. 7 Although we can have apple juice and orange juice. 7 May not have been a great metaphor. 20 AS: In an ideal world, from where you stand today, how do you think this crisis can be solved? 16 From your vantage point as being someone who is figuring out where the money is coming from and going. 8, 10 Do you see this being solved anytime soon? 6 GA: It needs to be a community effort, and that's why we've got who we've got in the OARS group. 19 It's been so well documented throughout the past four or five years from law enforcement and judicial legal system we can't arrest ourselves out of this problem. 8, 12, 13, 14 We need to address this from both a prevention and intervention standpoint. 5, 10, 13, 19 We need to provide the support and services for those individuals dealing with the addiction, and we need to be able to outreach and provide education and support for the community so they have a better understanding of what addiction is, what the substances, the drugs, can do to an individual, and in the process also communicate the fact that individuals are not dealing with this by choice. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 They are dealing with this because they are afflicted with a disease.  One of the key points we are trying to work on on a constant basis is the stigma. 9, 15 We need to be able to remove the stigma associated with chemical dependency and addiction. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 There is a similar effort that needs to be done in regards to mental health. 12, 19 With the stigma it is very hard for an individual to come up and say, ""I'm addicted to heroin. 9, 12, 14, 16 I need help,"" because there are so many signs and reactions from people like, ""Oh, get out of here. 9, 11 You're not worth anything.  You're doing this because you want to.  You're making bad choices because you want to. 6, 10, 14 Just get out of here.  I don't have time to help you.""  That type of thing.  I think there has been some progress made.  Just through discussions and experiences, and fortunately I don't have first-hand experience with this. 14, 18 I've been blessed so far with my own family. 12 In listening to others they've seen what's going on with others, their spouse, their child, or their sibling, and they see and understand the fact that they're not doing this by choice. 6, 13, 14, 17, 18 Through that—that just amplifies the importance of the support groups such as Nar-Anon that Verne Wagner is so involved with because it's through those mutual experiences that people share. 9, 12, 18 It ends up being a snowball that we like to have because good things are going to grow through the passing of this information and communication. 10, 12 We need to address things both from prevention and intervention and prevention. 5, 10, 19 We're not going to solve a lot just by addressing one thing. 5 We are reactive instead of proactive and we have to be both.  AS: How did you come by your education around chemical dependency? 13, 14, 15 Did you go to school for it? 7 Have you learned on the job? 10, 11 GA: I've basically learned on the job. 10, 11, 19 Through life experience, too. 10, 18 In my younger days when I was down in the Twin Cities and the more social active lifestyle I was in relationships with individuals that started out great and then all of a sudden it was like A, B, C, and D. 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 This isn't good. 10 Ended up leaving a relationship and getting into another relationship and all of a sudden the same thing starts happening. 15, 19 And it's like, wow. 17 The interesting piece—I established a good friendship with one particular individual in grad school who was a part of the CD [chemical dependency] group in a veteran's hospital. 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 20 Listening to his stories on individuals and the dynamics that were tied in relationship to addiction. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 Hearing that kind of explained my earlier life experiences. 10, 15, 18 Basically through the work.  It doesn't matter if you're doing child protection or working with the elderly: 14 chemical dependency and addiction is going to be part of your work. 9, 12, 13, 14 One of the things we are working on from a department standpoint through our Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative is attempting to put substance use disorder training as a core training function for new social workers, new employees coming into the department. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 We're not there yet, but we're getting much closer. 9, 10 We have a wonderful training department within St. Louis County. 9, 12, 18, 19 We've done a lot of work with them basically getting quarterly trainings set up. 19 Parental substance use disorder, the ABC's of addiction. 6, 12, 13, 14 We do SBIR [Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral] training—which is brief intervention and referral to treatment—which is a screening piece that can be done by anybody. 12, 13, 19 You don't need a Ph.D. or a master's.  You don't need a college education to be able to do this. 7, 14, 15 Basically it's being able to ask some open ended questions and allow an individual to share and be able to listen to their own situation and develop their own enlightenment to the risks that are involved. 10, 12 Where the individual is at it can be as easy as saying, well, you need to get someone to drive you home at night. 5 Or, I have some phone numbers for you to call. 8, 16 I think it would be really good for you to get an assessment to see possibly if you might be eligible or if chemical dependency treatment might be a good direction for you to go. 6, 10, 12, 13, 18 AS: Do you see it as an education not just for professionals, but for everyone? 6, 14, 15 We seem to be sorely lacking public education around substance use. 6, 13, 14, 15, 19 It reminds me of sex education and how political it gets, and what a disservice we are doing to young, growing sexual beings. 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 GA: It's a tough and very uncomfortable conversation, which is conflicting with values that have been installed with us.  AS: It's as if we don't have any trust in people to make decisions for their own health. 9, 14, 19 GA: Absolutely.  Part of our program, what I'll call the 'sappy program' is we're trying to get, and we still have to do some work on this, basically being able to—we've had some experiences with school districts throughout St. Louis County. 7, 18, 19 We've worked on trying to provide some support, SBIR training, to employment agencies. 12 AS: SBIR?  GA: Screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment. 12, 13, 19 Referral to treatment isn't necessarily going to chemical dependency treatment, but it's referring services. 12, 13, 19 You can find a lot of information on SBIR.  It was a best practice established in ERs, not necessarily for substance abuse. 6, 13 It can be a very useful tool. 6, 13, 18 It's something we encourage.  We've done SBIR training now for over two years now within St. Louis County for social workers, probation officers, public health nurses. 8, 12, 14, 19 AS: People who have contact with other human beings and trying to help. 19 GA: Trying to expand a professional or personal toolbox.  AS: Thank you.  This has been really good. 10, 18 I really appreciate the heart you seem to have for this. 6, 9, 10, 18 I don't think people in these buildings with state jobs or county jobs get a lot of credit for the heart that they do have. 5, 9, 11, 19 Even though you're writing grants and doing all this stuff you have your heart in it. 9 GA: It's contagious.  Basically the energy and the commitment of the others that I work with have and display regarding this. 12 You can take some credit for that too with this interview. 5 I've been in situations where you're talking to someone but you're really not sure the purpose and intent, and you get a little guarded and concerned about how you are saying it. 14, 18, 20 Matt Johnson, one of our social workers, and I did a fifteen minute radio piece with KDAL 610 last Wednesday. 12, 15, 16, 19 Tom Hanson, who was the radio person that we were working with, and he was bouncing in and out of weather and international news and local news and that type of thing, but he went out of his way just for conversation to establish a more personal type of atmosphere. 15, 16, 18 Once things started—it doesn't often happen but Matt and 15 I got done with that interview and we felt really good about what we're doing, what we said, what we communicated. 10, 11, 14, 18 AS: It's really good work. 10, 18 I'm really happy to have the chance to come up here. 18 GA: It's important. 9 Any time we get the chance to share what we're doing for others to experience or read it's an expansion or an extension to what we're doing. 18 We've got an information card that we're going to start producing. 14 Law enforcement will have it at RAAN [Rural AIDS Action Network] where basically for individuals it's kind of on two sides—it's resources: 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 Range Treatment Center, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, United Way 211 information and referral. 12 That's a key piece. 15 On the inside we're going to have risk reduction points: always use a clean needle, don't use with—harm reduction safety points. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 I'm blanking on some of the key points. 15 I'll forward you some of the stuff.  The Minnesota Department overdose reports. 9, 12, 13 AS: Thank you.  This was really helpful. 9, 18"
"2","Beck_Thilo","Dr. Thilo Beck Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer February 16, 2017 Zurich, Switzerland Thilo Beck-TB Andrew Tuttle-AT Amy Sullivan-AS TB: 5 I think to put it short what we do here has very much to do with a pragmatic approach. 18 Pragmatism is, in my view, the way to go about it along with the harm reduction approach. 5, 14, 18 We ask ourselves what is useful, not what should be, what would be the best possible aim or goal. 6, 13, 18 We don’t think too much about therapeutic illusions or fantasies, which is very common in medication therapy. 12, 14 Focusing on abstinence and considering that the majority of the patients we are treating here is not going for abstinence at the moment. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 This has to be respected.  AS: By abstinence what do you mean?  TB: From any substance. 6 All of the substances. 6 The abused substance has been alcohol. 6, 13, 16 I think that is one of the problems in alcohol therapy. 6, 12 Historically, it is based on abstinence and that is why it doesn’t work that well. 13 That is why it is not that successful.  Quite a few of our patients, I would say the majority, don’t want to abstain from alcohol. 6, 18 They are rather thinking about reduction or using in a more controlled way. 5, 6, 14, 18 That is a reasonable goal with most of our patients.  They resonate with it.  The old pattern of addiction therapy has been to push patients into abstinence. 12, 14 Make them think that they want to go for abstinence.  It is like a brainwash. 13 In society it is more of a moral thing, in a way. 12, 18 Abstinence is good and substance use is evil. 6, 10, 13 It has to be wiped out.  All these fantasies about substance free societies. 6 It is an illusion.  It is a ruse. 6, 13 AS: There are people who can handle substances and there are people who can’t. 6, 9 TB: That is one thing.  In political discussions when I try to get this over to politicians they still think that substances are dangerous, which is not true. 5, 6, 11 I know that is a provocative thing to say. 12 The majority of people use any substance in a controlled way. 6, 9, 13, 18 This is the case for heroin, which is unknown. 11, 12, 16, 17 Most of the people out there think that heroin is very dangerous and if you use it once you are hooked. 6, 9, 11, 13, 16 That isn’t true. 5 We know from studies -- in Switzerland there was a study, too -- and studies in the UK, there is a big group of heroin users that have no problem with using it in a controlled way and in a recreational way. 6, 12, 13, 16, 18 This is the case with heroin, alcohol, and cocaine. 6, 16, 17 There is a minority of people being vulnerable for genetic reasons, growing up in a bad environment that are vulnerable to the action of psychoactive substances in a self medicating way, probably. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 That’s not their fault.  This happens and it is a fact that we cannot avoid. 15 This is about fifteen to twenty percent of regular users with this risk. 6, 13 In my view this is a fact we have to accept. 12 It is part of the solidarity -- we owe it to these people to stand up and help them and not judge them and punish them. 9 We need to try to help them manage their vulnerability as best as possible.  This is also possible.  That’s another story -- once addicted always addicted, which is not true either. 5, 12, 14, 15, 18 Addiction, or dependency, is a state you can manage. 13, 14 There are long-term studies, prospective studies for twenty or thirty years that follow people up. 9, 10, 14, 17 This is also the case when we ask our patients in treatment: What did you go through? 12, 13, 17 They tell us they have been abstinent for ten years and they started to use again and they used controllably and then shifted into out of control use again, dependent use, and then they stopped again. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 18 This is not a linear development from abstinence into total catastrophe of addiction. 9, 12, 14 We still don’t quite understand the factors contributing to why people stop after ten years of use. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18 We still don’t know. 12 Sometimes we think therapy might have to do with it, but on the other hand -- AS: What kind of therapy? 12 TB: Addiction therapy. 12, 14 It might help people come to grips better. 9 Sometimes I think they have decided before they come to therapy that they wanted to change and that’s why they come. 12, 14, 18 We assist in a natural process that they would go through anyways. 17, 18 AS: You reinforce what they already are doing. 8 TB: Yes, what they already want.  I’m not quite sure we really contribute. 11, 18 I think what we can do for sure is help to reduce harm. 5, 14 This is for sure.  AS: Can you talk about what harm reduction means to you as a physician? 5, 14 I was talking with another historian last night who does HIV and drug stuff and he’s saying that what he has realized is that depending on where you are in the world the word harm reduction has different meanings. 5, 6, 14 Can you describe what harm reduction means for you here in this clinic in Switzerland? 5, 14 TB: One point is that it is something very individual depending on the individual patient.  Each person we assist.  It is trying to help this person to use substances in a controlled way, in a way with as least risk as possible. 6, 13, 18 This is individual harm reduction. 5, 14 There is also the political side to harm reduction. 5, 9, 14 We try to involve ourselves into the political process to help get the framework adapted that harm reduction is possible. 5, 14, 15, 17 I think politically there are goals that are not very useful that way. 6, 13, 18 It is not useful to criminalize users. 6, 8, 13, 18 This is causing harm. 6 So, if we tried to engage in harm reduction we have to see that those are adapted. 5, 6, 14 We try to work on that, which is rather difficult at the moment. 8, 10, 12, 14 AS: There is political opposition to harm reduction? 5, 14 TB: Switzerland went through a very important process back in the nineties. 9, 12, 17 The situation was that bad.  This was the biggest opiate drug scene worldwide. 5, 6 This made Swiss politicians and Swiss society move. 12, 15 That was rocking our system. 14 This made the four-pillar policy possible.  AS: Because of the extreme nature of the problem. 12 TB: There was a lot of pressure. 10 Now, we are suffering of the success of this approach because the opiate scene has disappeared. 5 The opiate dependent people are not seen in public anymore. 6, 9, 19 There is no problem perceived. 12 So, politicians and society have forgotten the lessons we learned back in the nineties. 10, 12 No more problems. 12 The questions coming up about why we should continue to pay for treatments. 12, 13 It is a recession and there is not enough money. 8, 10 People are thinking of how to save money. 8, 10 In times like this you start to think about shortage of budgets like this. 18 The first priority is to cut budgets of minority focus. 14 AS: How many patients do you serve here in a year or a day? 14, 16 TB: It is about two thousand patients.  We are running four outpatient clinics. 8, 11 We employ a staff of about one hundred and twenty people. 9 Nine hundred are in substitution treatment, opiate [unclear] treatment, which was our starting point. 12, 13 We were founded shortly before the needle park closed -- was shut down. 5, 9, 10, 18 We started with low threshold opiate substitution -- methadone treatment at that time. 10, 12, 13 That was twenty-five years ago. 13, 14 Now, we have evolved into being active in the whole field of addiction medicine. 12, 14 All substances. 6 AS: You’re model went from opiates to everything?  We have the exact opposite.  TB: We transferred our harm reduction approach into the whole of addiction treatment. 5, 12, 13, 14, 17 I’m very proud of that.  I’m working hard to push this approach. 9 I think we are getting on in the addiction medicine field. 12, 14 They start to slowly understand this approach. 10, 17, 18 AS: Even here?  TB: Yes, even here.  AT: As a therapist you need a personal kind of evolution into that, too.  I remember in the beginning when I was more like, “Okay, it is doable. 11 I can be abstinent.”  Over time you can think, “It’s just not going to happen.” 15 TB: You’ve got to become and accept things. 12 Accept the patient.  Accept the people that come to treatment. 9, 12, 13 It is about respect and taking them as they are. 11 In many addiction treatment programs this still isn’t the case. 12, 13, 14, 17 Still very much like abstinence oriented and not trying to understand about the values of this person. 17, 18 It is about the aim of treatment that will be abstinence. 12, 13 It’s just not perceiving the person as a human being with values and individual goals. 19 That is the point about individualized treatment. 12, 13 It isn’t general goals, it tailoring treatment to the needs of the individual patient. 12, 13 That is one very important part of this harm reduction approach. 5, 9, 14 Accepting that some people have their own concepts -- whatever! 9 I’m not the one to judge who is right and who is wrong. 8, 11, 12 Why they use substances. 6, 13 I’m just trying to help them to make the best of it.  AS: Would you mind giving me some background on your career? 14, 15, 19 How did you into psychiatry and addiction medicine? 12, 14 TB: Well, I started as a psychiatrist.  When I was in my internship at that time I was forced, because there were vacancies, into the addiction world. 8, 12, 14 I was forced to work there. 8 This is a stigmatized field. 9 Psychiatry is stigmatized in the first place, and then within psychiatry addiction is stigmatized again. 9, 12, 14 AS: Why is psychiatry stigmatized? 9 TB: First of all it isn’t paid well.  We are amongst the lowest income group in medicine. 10, 12, 14 Child psychiatrists are lower. 10, 12 TB: So we are low. 10 AS: I’m glad I asked.  TB: I know surgeons are ten-fold. 12 That is one point.  The other point is the perception that it’s a frustrating job with no results. 6, 11 AS: Because you are dealing with mental illness. 12 TB: No sufficient results. 6 All of that stuff.  That is the same in addiction therapy as well. 12, 14 They are lying; it’s not working, and whatever.  This is the result of the wrong approach. 6, 11 If you are going into treatment with somebody and you expect them to do something they don’t actually want no wonder it doesn’t work! 7, 12, 13 This has to be frustrating.  We try to advocate for -- AS: That is a great point. 20 It is the approach.  TB: We battle with resistance forever and feel bad and frustrated -- both the patient and the doctor. 12, 14 If you choose to find the right approach and just try to meet these people where they are and invite them into a therapeutic process that’s a collaborative process. 9, 12, 17, 18 I don’t know what is right for this individual guy. 12 This is interesting for me as well to find with every single patient what is important for him or her. 9, 17 What should the goal be?  And to develop options.  This is interesting and not frustrating at all. 17 AS: Go back to how you got forced into it. 8 TB: I started to find out that the patients there were people as well. 9 They were interesting. 17 I like working with people anyways. 9, 17, 18 I got fascinated with seeing how stigmatized they were and how much they stigmatized themselves. 6, 9 This was such a treat for me.  And seeing how much could be improved and done, or how badly the system was working. 6 From then on I was hooked.  I was fascinated by how much could be done.  AS: For the better.  TB: For the better.  There is so much that should be and could be improved.  There is incredible potential to help and to make things better and create a better society as well. 5, 6, 12 I am still intrigued.  I am still fighting and working for this.  AS: How long have you been here? 17 TB: I started to work here in ‘97.  This is the twentieth year now. 12, 14 AS: You said you talk to politicians.  Can you describe your job here and what you do outside of dealing with patients? 11 TB: Arud [Centers for Addiction Medicine] has always been a political organization as well, a pressure group. 10, 14, 18 This is because we are a private charity.  We don’t have to obey any government regulations. 12 Most of my colleagues are working in state clinics and they cannot speak up.  They have to be careful about that. 19 We try to use this as an asset. 6, 13 AS: Do you collect information from them?  TB: Part of my work is to network and try to get specialists and Society of Addiction Medicine to organize that. 14 To get the specialists together to lobby for improvement of policy. 8, 12 We work with the state authorities.  AS: If you are a private charity do you get government assistance? 12 We actually function like a private practice. 7, 9 AS: When you were talking about the government trying to cut funding you meant for state-run agencies. 8, 12 TB: We have the four pillars, we have consumption rooms, and we have stuff like that. 14 We talk about cutting budgets of these places.  In society we have fifty five percent of Swiss people now that think substitution treatment shouldn’t be covered by insurance anymore because it is their fault. 5, 9, 12, 13 AS: There has already been a swing back.  TB: Yes.  There has always been a majority of Swiss people remembering the experience from the nineties where the success was so obvious of the low-threshold harm reduction oriented therapy. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 The acceptance was high. 7, 12 There was sixty-five or seventy percent pro-substitution treatment. 12, 13 Now it has shifted. 8 AS: Do you think part of that is the general swing towards the right that we’ve been seeing? 6, 9, 12 TB: It is this neoliberalism thing.  AS: It is not just that the problem of heroin addiction is being controlled. 12, 14, 16, 18 TB: Like saying that obese people should pay more for health insurance because they eat too much and that creates problems and causes costs and they have to cover themselves. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 This is the discussion, which is absolutely useless in my view because this is not their personal decision that they choose to use heroin and are fully responsible for it and they cover all the costs. 6, 13, 14, 16 That is not the way it goes. 18 That’s a discussion in the health treatment system: thinking how we can cut costs. 12, 13, 19 Make the people pay themselves. 9 AS: What about the disease model of addiction? 12, 14 We are still talking about this in the United States.  TB: Yes, I know. 12 Nora  Volkow is really strong on that. 18 AS: The surgeon general just came out with that.  In our society it is still a new concept. 12, 16 I’m wondering if yours is different. 15 TB: The disease model has been useful, I think, as a first step to fight stigma. 6, 9, 13, 14, 18 Then it shifted from moral to a disease. 8 Now I think we are stuck with the disease model and it is not that useful in my view. 6, 13, 18 AS: How does it fit into this? 15 If you are diseased you have to do what someone tells you to do to get better. 15 It is not just fate.  I think there are factors contributing to dependent behavior and risk factors might add up in a syndrome that looks like a disease. 5, 17 It is not something we have a pill to cure.  It is much more complex and there are so many other factors contributing, also societal factors. 13, 17 I think there are societies that cause vulnerability and make people use substances in a problematic way. 6, 9, 12, 13, 18 It is not the individual’s fault.  There are so many ways to manage this behavior. 18 It is not just fate and nothing to be done about it.  You cannot just take the medicine and see how it develops. 6, 12, 14 I’m not so happy with the disease model because it deprives the individual of their autonomy, in a way. 18 AS: It creates a dependency. 13 TB: It is a habit that there is nothing to be done about and that is not true. 5, 20 AS: A typical addiction doctor in the US would explain it as similar to diabetes. 10, 12, 14 It is a way to frame it because we do care about diabetics. 15, 18, 19 TB: I think it is good in the discussion about stigmatization because diabetes is not as stigmatized. 9, 10 If you make the analogy that is good. 10 AS: Heart disease is another one that they use. 6, 8, 13 TB: Talking about diabetes there are many things to manage besides taking pills. 10, 11 It is about a healthy lifestyle and living another type of lifestyle, maybe. 5, 10, 15, 19 There are many things the individual can do, and that is the case. 17 In general in psychiatry we deal with chronic conditions. 6 It is not so much about healing or making it disappear. 10 It is more about managing something; managing yourself.  Also talking about schizophrenia for example.  We have no right to push schizophrenic patients to medicate with neuroleptics, for example. 10, 12, 14 That is their point to decide whether they want to use medication or not. 6, 13, 14 To decide if medication might help them on their way as one factor or not. 14, 18 It is not the silver bullet.  It is just one possibility to assist.  This might work for some and others it might not.  AS: Is that how schizophrenics are treated here in general? 12 AT: Psychopharmacology is probably the cornerstone of the treatment; you can’t get around it. 8, 12, 13 TB: There are clinics where the patients are pretty much forced to take the medication, which in my view is not the right thing to do. 8, 10, 12, 14 AS: Even if they were going to self-harm?  TB: People have the rights to self-harm. 12 In my position I try to inform them as best I can of the possible risks.  If they still continue to self-harm I think I have to go along with this. 17 That doesn’t mean I am happy with it. 18 I am still, as a professional identity, I don’t approve this, but I accept their way. 12, 18 I think life is dangerous. 10, 11 Everything is dangerous in life. 10, 11 If we wanted to avoid all dangers we couldn’t live. 18 Taking substances is dangerous, driving a car is dangerous, and it is how much danger you want to take that is an individual decision. 5, 6, 11, 14 I think in my view it is free will.  I don’t think society -- as long as you harm only yourself, we don’t have that much of a right to interfere. 12, 17 That’s my individual opinion.  AS: Would you say your opinion is an outlier?  TB: No, I think there is an argument now in general about how much interference of the state is acceptable. 12 That is a public health discussion. 19 How much should the government make their citizens behave in a certain way? 12, 17, 18 There is no right or wrong to that. 11, 12 That is a norm you have to decide on. 14 AS: Do you see people here -- patients, is that what you call them here? 6, 9 TB: Patient, clients. 10 AS: How many would you say have a co-occurring mental health issue? 12, 13, 19 TB: Practically all.  That is who we have here that come to treatment. 12, 13 The ones we see here in treatment. 6, 8, 12, 13 There are so many studies in that as well, that co-occurring psychiatric diseases is three to four -- not only one.  That has to do with our system of diagnosis, the DSM. 6 You end up having quite a few disorders. 6, 13 There are so many co-occurring disorders. 6, 13 Schizophrenia is about ten percent of the population we treat here.  In the general population it is about one percent, so it is ten fold.  We see about thirty to thirty-five percent with ADHD. 6 The general population is about four percent.  About forty to fifty percent with depressive and panic disorders, or personality disorders. 6, 13, 15 Those are just the psychiatric disorders. 6, 13 Disorders like infections, hepatitis C, HIV, liver diseases.  AS: When a person comes in seeking treatment for addiction are they evaluated for other things right away? 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 Is that integrated in a way? 18 TB: they come here with a substance problem because we are an addiction clinic. 6, 12, 14 Our job then is to try to check them for other disorders, which isn’t that easy in the beginning because they don’t want to see a shrink. 6, 11, 13 They come for a substance disorder, and if you start asking them about psychiatric problems that might be hard for them. 6, 9, 12, 13 That is our job to try to involve them into disciplinary approach. 11 We work in a very integrated way in psychiatry: internal medicine, we have social work. 12, 14, 18, 19 We try to offer everything under one roof because [unclear] are so frequent in our experience I can understand. 17, 18 It is very difficult if you have to see three or four doctors for all the different disorders you have to treat all together in one place. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14 And then we try to prioritize and treat the disorder that is most impairing at the moment for the patient; the problem the patient wants to work on. 8, 12, 13, 14 We try to motivate them to get a sense of their other disorders and motivate them to get into treatment there as well, but we cannot force them. 6, 8, 12, 13 AT: It is very modest -- the scope that you can actually engage them to work on. 7 There are low levels of resources then the goals are going to be small. 10 AS: The resources in the person?  You have to adapt therapy to the resources of the client or the patient. 10, 12 It is a very important process to try to identify how much this person can do, what he wants to do, and focus on that and not try to make them understand that they should do this. 9, 17, 18 It is important to inform them and offer them information and education, but they have to make the decision. 9, 14, 15 To go along with their decision. 14, 17 That is very important. 9 AT: I find myself trying to tone down the expectations of patients. 8 They come in and are already burdened with all the expectations gathered from the environment they are living in. 5, 12 I say, “No, you can’t do that.  We have to take this step by step.”  “Yeah, but I want this.”  Then we will see where it goes.” 6 TB: That is the problem. 12 The extrinsic motivation is so strong.  We try to evocate that motivation.  It is the only motor that really works. 9, 18 As you said, very often if we see the patients the first time they are in a crisis. 6, 14 What is their first idea when they go through a difficult time in their life? 10, 14 I have to stop using. 6 Then they think that is the solution because that is what they hear from all over: it is bad that you use and you should stop. 6, 9, 13 When they have a hard time when they try to stop -- that that’s the idea -- then everything is okay. 9 If you try to analyze this, if you take your time and talk this through with a patient then they start to realize there is not a single problem to resolve just by stopping the use of a substance. 6, 12, 13 In contrary, it might even make problems bigger. 12 Many of our patients it is the way they structure their lives, their routine. 15, 18 No alternative at the moment. 8, 12, 14 You shouldn’t take it away because nothing is left. 14, 18, 20 That is not a good place to be. 10 We try to explain this to our patients that we have to find alternatives. 14 Before we cut down or take away, it is a much better position to have alternatives already than to decide to reduce or take the substance use away. 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 20 Never do that without alternatives. 14 Obviously then you wouldn’t require someone to detox? 19 TB: No, it is useless. 6, 13 We have patients here that have been through twenty, thirty, forty times.  How many more treatments of that kind do you want to go through? 12, 13 Every time you go for one or two weeks and then you relapse and prove to yourself that you cannot do it. 15 You’ve failed again and you are a failure. 14 What is the use of this approach? 6, 13 It is not really useful. 6, 13, 18 Sometimes people say we are against abstinence, which is not true at all. 5, 9 I think abstinence is a state: it can be good, useful; it depends for who and what situation. 6, 10, 13, 15, 18 It is not per say good or bad. 10 It depends on the context. 15 AS: What would you say to someone who said that if they stopped using something like heroin or meth and they see drinking beer as triggering that desire -- I know people who have quit and then they think they can have a beer -- and within forty-eight hours they are using meth again. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16 How would that be managed in this environment? 12 Because that person would say that they should never have a beer again. 16 TB: That is our job to work with triggers. 11 I think education is very important to explain the mechanisms of what is happening. 9, 14, 15 I think that is pretty important. 9, 10 People feel less of a victim and it becomes something they can do because there is something happening. 15 There are different approaches to understanding that you can control triggers. 14, 17, 18 This is possible.  The earlier that you detect the starting point -- the triggers won’t just go away. 15, 18, 20 The more awareness you develop inside to realize when this starts low. 9, 10 The earlier you intervene the better you can manage. 15 That is what we work on with our patients.  That is pretty successful. 10 AS: I have been interviewing some people in long term recovery who are also in addiction treatment who are moving towards this model that you are espousing that is more individualized. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17 A couple of them have said that they haven’t used anything for twenty years and now they have decided that if they want to have a glass of champagne or a glass of wine with dinner they do it, but how hard it was to go from the idea that if you ever touch it again you are an addict. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 One man told me -- he runs a methadone clinic and would be very in line with what you are saying -- he said when he told his friends from AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] they said he was never really an addict. 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 20 TB: I am having a problem with this twelve-step approach because it is too -- 12 AS: Does it have a place here?  It has a place, but not as much in the US.  AS: By here I meant in Switzerland.  TB: There are AA groups. 12 I have patients that are in AA groups. 12 There are patients that really like it there and it helps them. 18 There are some pretty good 10 AA groups here that are not that dogmatic, more flexible in a way. 12, 18 They accept the use of substances. 6, 12, 13 They work with people who are still using. 6, 9 I don’t know. 12 It depends on the individual patient. 15 For some patients it is too dogmatic.  Then it is stigmatizing again because it makes them feel bad if they use substances. 6, 9, 13 AS: Your model is more helping someone early on in the process figure out what they can handle and what they can’t handle versus a twenty year time period and then saying, “I think I could have a glass of wine.” 11, 14, 17, 18 I just think of the intensity of that decision after all that time and then having people who were close to you say that you were never an addict when that person’s life had fallen apart. 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 It just seems healthier. 6, 19 TB: This all or nothing approach isn’t really helpful. 9, 18 I am trying to advocate the continuing of possible goals and states.  This is not you are either abstinent or an addict. 14 There are all different shades in between.  AT: How can you achieve a manageable balance?  AS: Where you are in control of your life and happy. 10, 18 TB: The degree of control. 18 Even control is not an all or nothing thing. 18 There are different degrees of control. 18 We try to help our patients to improve control, whatever that means. 18 With one patient that might be to reduce their beer consumption from seven liters a day to five liters. 5, 14, 16 It is still an improvement. 12 For others it might mean they only drink on Sunday once a week, or whatever. 5, 15, 16 AS: They come up with that and try it out.  TB: It is our job to help them find their own goals and what works for them. 9, 11 That starts anew with every patient. 16 There is no recipe that I could offer that would say this is the way you have to go. 18 I think that is what the patients here appreciate about it. 10 Feeling accepted and respected and realizing that we listen to them and we depend on their view. 12 AS: How long do people usually seek services here? 6, 9, 17, 19 Aside from methadone. 9 TB: Methadone is another point. 8 Saying opioid addiction is a chronic disease. 6, 12, 13, 14 I think it is a chronic disease that we have here in treatment because they were not for their own faults sort of entrenched. 6, 12, 13 That is a result of the political and societal conditions we have had. 6 They were forced into this marginalized lifestyle. 8, 10, 15 They were made chronic. 6 They are so impaired, not by the action of the substance of heroin, but of the side effects of illegal lifestyle and these horrible years they went through. 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 That impairment makes their condition chronic. 6, 12 That is my view on that.  There are famous surgeons that have been living with opiate addiction and have been going through a very successful career because they had no problem providing themselves with clean morphine. 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 I think heroin addiction is not this hopeless chronic disease, per say. 6, 9, 12, 14 There are other factors contributing to this. 17 That is a misconception of it.  We treat the effects of the bad conditions they were living under, the impairment of this lifestyle. 10, 12, 14, 15 This is a group -- some of them have been having treatment now for twenty-five years already and they might continue until the end of their life. 10, 12, 13, 14 There is a very small number in that group of people recovering, in a way. 9, 18 Recovery is another term that can be understood in many ways. 17, 18 Recovery in the UK and in the States as well, I think, has been hijacked as a term for abstinence, which is not the idea of it. 17 Recovery means to get to terms with something and to be able to live a normal life with the substance or without, whatever you choose. 6, 10, 16, 17 It is about integration and being part of society with or without substances doesn’t really make a difference there. 6, 9, 12, 18 It is the degree of control. 18 There is this group that is in our treatment for long term, opiate addicted people. 9, 12, 13, 14, 17 If, for example, with alcohol or cocaine we see people come to treatment for a period of time and then they go ahead with their life, get to terms with it, and they might come back after five years and get another treatment. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 That is the pattern we see. 6 Some we might not see anymore. 6 AS: Do people come for group therapy or is this more one on one? 9, 12 TB: Swiss patients are going for one on one.  They hate groups. 12 I love groups and I think groups are very helpful. 9, 12, 14 We have started so many groups and they all ended up with one or two or no people. 9, 12 I think we are in the luxurious position that we can offer one to one treatment. 12, 13 There are other countries like Germany that have fewer resources.  The treatment system depends much more on group approaches because of resources. 12, 13, 15 Here we still have enough funds to finance one to one treatment. 12, 13 Also, because self becomes stigmatization and not wanting to have other people know they use, or whatever. 6, 9, 12, 13 That is another thing I am not really happy about. 18 Our patients are not really ready or up to political involvement. 12, 18 We have this in the UK, for example.  We have user unions and advocacy groups. 6, 12, 13 We do that for our patients and sometimes I feel a little bit sick of it. 15, 20 I voice for the patients who won’t speak up. 17 AS: We have had that issue with Alcoholic Anonymous because they want to stay anonymous; they are safe in that space. 13 Lately there are more people who are coming out to say what is happening, parents who will speak out, and advocacy. 9, 15, 20 We are actually getting legislation change because we are speaking up. 7 TB: It is very important. 9 This is what makes politicians move. 15 Somebody has to step up.  Somebody who has a problem. 12 If I come up and say, “I have patients who have a problem” that is not the same. 12 AS: That is how we got Narcan to be more available.  We have a law called the Good Samaritan Law so that someone will call when there is a person that is overdosing rather than just drop them or leave. 5, 11, 13, 18 It was a group of mothers who lost their children who then lobbied the legislators. 5, 11, 14, 20 Whether they were teary or not they made a huge impression and it was an incredible vote, almost unanimous. 5, 10 TB: That is very important, but it is really hard to hear. 9, 18 Sometimes I think it might be our fault because we have been very active from the start and we are used to this. 6, 13, 16 I think we should have pushed them more from the beginning or evolved our patients more from the beginning to the whole political process as well. 11, 17 AS: There is still quite a bit of stigma still. 9, 20 It isn’t that you have overcome stigma. 9 It is that you have overcome a different treatment model. 12, 13 TB: Yes.  There is lots of stigma still. 9, 16 We try to work very closely with general practitioners because I think they see a lot of people that have substance problems but don’t come for substance problems and go for other reasons. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 I think they have a very important role in screening and prevention and trying to make people realize or understand about risks of drug and substance use. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19 There as well the stigmatization is so strong. 9 General practitioners say they don’t want to deal with it. 8 It is like opening Pandora’s box: “Oh, no. 10 That’s too much.  I don’t want to know about that.” 12 That’s a problem. 12 AS: We have the same problem. 12 Is there medical school training around addiction? 7, 12, 14 TB: We have started to improve.  There is a new concept now for medical students. 7, 12, 14, 16 The Society for Addiction medicine has been invited to contribute to this program and it is getting better. 12, 14 I think we are learning from Canada. 10 Canada is pretty ahead in that way. 10, 14, 18 The medical students there already have quite a bit of addiction medicine -- because it is so frequent. 7, 12, 14, 20 It is underrated.  I think medical students should already practice and get experience working with people with substance use problems. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 That’s what they emphasize in these courses too: that they should self reflect on their stand on substance use. 6, 13 AT: Using a lot of Ritalin to be able to study enough to pass.  TB: It starts with your own understanding and perception of the problem or the phenomenon. 12, 14, 17, 18 To get a normal approach to that. 16 There is still a lot to do.  With general practitioners sometimes I think this is a really hard job. 8, 9, 11, 18 They are still very much in this paternalistic way of understanding medicine. 12, 14, 17, 18 The expert: “I tell my patients what they have to do.  If they don’t listen I tell them harder, and then even harder. 9 If they still don’t listen I throw them out of the treatment. 12, 13 I don’t want to see them anymore because they don’t want it.” 6 AT: The other ones you also don’t hear about a lot. 8, 9 I know a lot of general practitioners that have a really good approach to addiction. 8, 10, 12, 14, 18 They are really good. 10, 18 They are the people that people go to, too. 9 TB: The ones I am talking about I would say are the old generation. 8 It is coming to an end now. 12 The ones that are in their sixties now. 8, 12 They have just grown up in another way. 10, 18 The younger practitioners think differently, but still aren’t educated well enough in that field. 8, 14, 20 There is a big lack of knowledge. 12 AS: The thing I’ve heard is they ask what they would take out and remove from course time because it is so packed. 9, 15 What would they not teach?  TB: What we really work a lot with is the motivational interviewing approach. 18 That is an approach that has been done a lot in the alcohol therapy field. 6, 12 Miller and Rollnick back in the sixties.  That was so helpful. 9 This is now getting adopted all over medicine working with chronic diseases. 6, 12, 14 It works with intrinsic motivation: 9 trying to make people want to change for their own sake. 9 This approach is so helpful working with people with obesity, or diabetes, or HIV, or whatever. 9, 10 They have to manage the long lasting condition where they have to have a motivation to do something and be active to manage their health. 17, 19 This approach I think should be already taught with medical students because it is an attitude. 7, 14 AS: Do you use that here? 6, 13 TB: Yes, we do.  Understanding that you have to advocate intrinsic motivation and that therapy wouldn’t work otherwise. 12, 14 You should forget about treating people if you don’t know what they really want. 9, 12, 13, 18 That’s where therapy starts. 12 This sounds pretty trivial, but so many doctors don’t really talk with their patients about what they want: “Do you really want to take those pills?” for example. 10, 12, 14, 18 On behalf of adherence. 14 Only half of the pills prescribed are really taken. 10, 14, 18 That is also a result of that. 6 Nobody really cares about what the patients actually think. 7, 18, 19 There is this shift going on in medicine at the moment -- slowly, but it is -- that we understand that patients are human beings as well and we do a job together with them. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 It is not just us saying what they have to do.  There is also the Internet and all that stuff contributing to that because patients inform themselves.  They are getting out of their role as a victim and getting more active, which is good. 10 I think those are the most important points of our approach. 9 Ever since Arud was founded -- it has been twenty-five years now -- we have always been growing. 10, 12, 14, 18 I think this is also a good thing to see. 6, 10 I think this is because we offer a treatment that fits. 12, 13, 15 We still have a long way to go and we will continue to grow because there are still so many people out there not coming into treatment because they don’t find a treatment that fits. 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 They don’t want to hear, “You should stop again. 9 There is no other way. 18 You are bad.”  Feeling that their doctor is frustrated and they don’t want to talk about it because they are just supposed to stop. 12, 14 There is still quite a potential for us to grow. 6, 10 That is what we have always been true to. 5, 18 We never say we are full. 14, 16 If all our therapists are busy then we just employ new therapists. 15, 16 AS: You don’t turn someone away? 18, 20 TB: No, never. 16 I really believe in low threshold treatment. 10, 12, 13, 18 You have to use the window of opportunity. 6, 13, 19 Whenever someone has the feeling that they need assistance you should be ready to offer this within twenty-four hours. 15, 16 AS: There are some people starting to do that in Minneapolis. 9 TB: I think all this waiting is terrible. 11, 15 AS: Many of our children are dying because they aren’t getting in at that moment, especially young people. 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 20 You finally somehow twisted their arm and then you have to wait ten days. 8, 16 TB: In the UK and in Scotland I have been several times to assist them.  They are about to open a heroin assistance treatment now, but it has taken three years of lobbying and sharing our experiences with them. 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 Up there they have a waiting list of up to six weeks for someone with opioid addiction to get admitted to agonist treatment. 12, 13, 14, 15 This is just impossible.  That’s not the way. 18 Here anybody can just walk in and within twenty minutes is in treatment. 12, 13, 15, 16 AS: That’s what you call low threshold. 10 You don’t have to prove anything.  TB: Yes.  The only thing you have to do is take a urine specimen to prove there are opioids in the system. 6, 12, 13 AS: Is that the only time you would do a UA [urine analysis]? 6 TB: Yes.  We shouldn’t start opioid treatment if someone is intolerant. 12, 13 That would be dangerous. 11 Sometimes you have people coming in and saying they need substitution treatment. 9, 12, 13 I had one patient that was a schizophrenic just pretending to be an opiate dependent. 10 Then you can only tell with the urine analysis. 6 If there are no opioids in the urine then you won’t start treatment. 6, 12, 13 That is the only condition.  Then we start right away. 12, 18, 20 In opiate assisted agonist treatment what is very important is the individualization to be able to use as many different substances as possible. 6, 9, 12, 13 We started off with methadone in the nineties and that was all there was around. 12 Now we know that, as with any other medication, there are different individual side effects. 9, 12, 14 People tolerate substances differently. 6 Now we use methadone, buprenorphine, slow-release morphine, and heroin, the original substance. 6, 10, 13, 16 That is the very important thing to be able to do. 9 It is long-term treatment and it is about quality of life. 10, 12, 13, 17 You have to find the substance that fits best for the individual patient. 6, 15 That might be methadone, that might be heroin, that might be morphine. 6, 8, 16 In my perspective it is very important. 9 It is amazing to see how life can change for a patient who has been on methadone for twenty years because it was the only thing around and now changing to slow release morphine. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 We have had patients that say, “This is like a new life. 10, 16 I feel so much better.”  Others have the same experience with Buprenorphine. 10, 18 I think it is really important to give them a choice. 6, 9, 18 There is no medical indication for what substance is best for what patient. 6, 7, 14 They have to find out what is the best for them.  What we really aren’t happy with in Switzerland is the state of heroin treatment. 12, 13, 16, 18 We are still very much restricted by law. 13 AT: I was just going to ask I mean morphine, buprenorphine, and methadone can be obtained through pretty much every pharmacy. 10 TB: That is regular treatment. 12, 13 AT: Do you think heroin should be that available? 16 TB: Absolutely.  There is no problem with that. 12 We have twenty-three years of experience with heroin treatment. 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 We run the largest heroin clinic in Switzerland. 8, 16 We have about two hundred and twenty people in heroin treatment and we have been doing this for twenty-three years. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 It works exactly as any other agonist treatment. 9, 12, 13 The only thing when we started heroin treatment in ‘94 one hundred percent of users were using intravenously. 6, 12, 13 This is an international, European trend.  There are less and less people injecting, which is good. 9, 10, 13 AS: How do they get heroin treatment? 12, 13 Is that injected as well?  We offer injectable heroin. 16 The majority of patients now have shifted to oral avenues. 8, 12, 18 AT: That was my question.  I have noticed some of my patients have started to get oral heroin. 16 How does that make sense?  My understanding of the pharmacology of heroin is that it very quickly gets transformed into morphine. 10, 14, 16, 17, 18 Does any of that reach the brain in the form of heroin? 13, 16 TB: Yes.  I was so amazed, but the ones who get the oral heroin tablets use it nasally. 6, 8, 13, 16 There the onset of action is a bit faster. 20 AS: It isn’t a tablet?  TB: It is a tablet, but they crush it and snort it.  I don’t have anything against that because snorting it is still much more safe than injecting. 13 We are very happy with this trend. 18 Only twenty-five of our patients do injection only with the heroin treatment. 12, 13, 16 Forty-five percent have shifted totally to tablets. 8 I think this type of tablet based heroin treatment could be transferred to regular treatment. 5, 12, 13, 17 Any general practitioner could give these tablets away. 8, 18, 20 Nothing speaks against that.  AT: I am a little wary about injectable heroin because I think there is a risk of doctors becoming dependent. 12, 14, 16, 20 TB: Well, we have to live with that risk.  I think the injectable heroin is another story. 15, 16 The onset is so fast that it can be dangerous. 11 That is why injecting is still supervised here. 13, 16 They have to inject on the premises. 10 AT: In case they overdose accidentally. 13, 17 TB: If they have used alcohol or benzodiazepines before and they inject the onset is so fast that you can end up having an overdose within two minutes. 6, 13, 15, 16 AS: Are people asked if they are on benzos and alcohol before they get injected? 6, 9 TB: We know them, and we know which ones are risky guys and use a lot of other substances as well. 6, 12, 13 That’s manageable.  We have never had anyone die in twenty-three years. 14, 16 Nobody died on the premises. 10 The only thing that can happen is they breathe less or they stop breathing for a while and you have to assist everything and they come back again. 15 It’s not really dangerous as long as you know how to proceed. 11, 12, 17, 18 Anyways, with the heroin tablets we restrict the take home dose to two days. 16, 18 People with heroin treatment on tablets have to show up at least three times a week. 12, 13, 15, 16 Considering that this is a long-term treatment that should enable people to live autonomously and integrate into society and have a job and have a family life. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 How can you do that having to show up three times a week at the treatment center? 12, 13, 15 Traveling there.  It is just not the thing to do.  AS: Do you think they should have access to more tablets? 9 TB: This is counterproductive. 14 The aim of those treatments is to help people reintegrate in society and live a regular life. 9, 10, 12, 13 Having these restrictions makes it impossible to engage in a regular lifestyle. 10, 15 AS: Can people take methadone home? 9 TB: Yes.  Ninety percent of the patients we have here are on regular agonist substance treatments. 6, 12, 13 Heroin treatment we can only offer in licensed facilities. 12, 13 That is another clinic of ours on the other side of the river. 9 Ninety percent of the patients we treat here in regular agonist treatment have at least one week of take home, which is no problem. 12, 13, 15 They are in control. 18 Many of them work; they go for business travels and whatever.  They don’t have to come here all the time.  AS: But some people do start out that way and have to come here everyday? 9, 16, 18 TB: That’s an exception.  If they are in a psychosis or a very deep depression and are suicidal or for psychological reasons are not able to handle take homes. 10 They might lose them or are not in control of dosing them, but that is the exception. 9, 18 AS: It is very different because we police it very heavily in the US. 8, 16 TB: That is useless. 6, 13 That is another way of institutionalization. 18 It is causing harm and impairing patients. 6 AS: There are all kinds of people who hang around who are trying to sell. 9 It brings the culture that they are trying to get away from right there to the place where they are trying to get better. 12, 18, 20 That treatment now is so stigmatized that so many people won’t even say they are on it. 9, 12, 13 They don’t want to go.  Many treatment centers will not refer you to methadone. 6, 8, 12, 13 They will only do Suboxone or Vivitrol. 8 TB: I think in the States the general practitioners are only allowed to prescribe buprenorphine. 8, 10 AS: Yes.  No methadone. 6, 8 They are only allowed a certain number of patients and they have to go through a DEA [drug enforcement agency]. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17 AT: Each one of those substances has advantages and disadvantages over the other. 6 Ultimately it’s got to be the user who decides. 6, 13, 14 TB: And not the state and not the government. 12 It is really an absurd situation. 18 If you look all over the world you have countries, for political reasons, like in the north -- Finland -- has only buprenorphine. 10, 14 That’s a political decision because they thought any other substance was not safe. 6, 14, 17, 18 Same in France.  It has improved now. 12 It is still about eighty-five or ninety percent of this agonist treatment is with buprenorphine because the government thinks that it is safer. 10, 12, 13, 17 AT: It is a partial antagonist. 9, 13 TB: Yes.  That is also called Indivior, the company that manufactures buprenorphine has been very politically active advocating for buprenorphine and getting quite a lot of government on their side. 9, 12, 14 These are economic reasons.  AT: Drug pushers.  AS: Thank you,  you have been very generous.  [walking around clinic] 14, 16 TB: This is the medical department. 7, 9, 12, 14, 19 This is where we treat Hepatitis C and HIV and other disorders. 6, 13 We see an increasing number of age related comorbid medical disorders. 6, 7, 13, 14 The average age of the opiate dependent cohort is forty-five years. 14 That’s the nineties generation heroin and they are aging. 12, 16 There are hardly any newcomers. 9, 16 Heroin is out.  It is a loser drug. 5, 6, 9 We hardly see any young, new heroin users. 6, 9, 13, 16 The epidemic is over. 13 What we see is a cohort of aging heroin users. 6, 13 They are twenty years older than their actual age. 14, 20 They have aged twenty years because of the lifestyle they have been forced to live. 8, 10, 14, 15 This lifestyle made them sick, not the drugs. 5, 6, 10, 15 We treat the results. 6 This is the lab.  This is quite an important machine. 9 It is sort of an ultrasound, but it measures the fibrosis of the liver.  That’s very important in treating hepatitis c. 9, 13 This is an issue at the moment all over: hepatitis c treatment is still quite expensive. 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 Gilead, which started the whole thing off, earns billions.  AS: They have kept the cost pretty high? 7, 10 TB: Yes, it is about sixty thousand dollars a treatment. 12, 13 AS: Where are they based? 13 For how long? 17 TB: Six weeks. 15 The United States.  They didn’t even develop the substances themselves. 6 They bought the patent and now they are making a hell of a lot of money. 8, 10, 12 We have this problem that sixty percent of the cohort of the opiate dependent population we treat here are infected with Hepatitis C. 12 Also a consequence of the lifestyle and not of the drug. 5, 6, 10, 15 Actually, we should treat them all with this new treatment. 12, 13, 16 It is very effective and has a ninety to ninety-five percent success rate.  We should treat them all; that’s how you treat infections like that, but it’s too expensive.  The government decided to make limitations on the treatment, so we can only treat them if the fibrosis has progressed to a certain level. 12, 13, 14, 17 They have to be pretty sick to get the treatment. 10, 12, 13, 15 It would be wiser to treat them earlier before they get to that degree. 15 That is why we measure the fibrosis grade to get them into treatment. 5, 12, 13 AS: We had the same thing happen with Narcan. 15 The price went up to two thousand dollars right at the time when all the state governments were allowing more access to it. 9, 10, 12 TB: This is internal medicine here and all of the rest of the premises is psychiatry. 10, 12, 14 We work very close together because all of the patients are comorbid and we are trying to get the treatment to fit the needs of the patient. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 We have five hundred patients in agonist treatments. 12, 13 That is quite a numbers.  That’s why we have computerized systems.  We get all the medication per patient for the comorbid disorders. 6, 13, 14 This is the amount for one week because most of them come once a week and get all their medication. 14, 15 This is a project where we are going to move together the four clinics in Zurich next year to one place. 5, 8, 14, 15 We have centralized the outpatient clinics into one place. 11 We think we can offer more comprehensive and better quality treatment if we are all under one roof. 10, 12, 13 That is going to happen the end of this year. 14, 15 AS: You are open six-thirty a.m. to nine-thirty p.m. six days a week? 15, 16 TB: Seven days a week. 15, 16 Now we think of reducing the service over the weekend because ninety-nine percent of our patients are so stable we don’t have to offer the services. 5, 12, 14, 15, 19 That was important in the beginning back in the nineties when people are still very bad off and they needed much more support. 9, 11, 12 Now it has stabilized.

"3","Berry-Brede_Linda","Emily Brunner Narrator Samantha Aamot Interviewer June 28, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Emily Brunner-EB Samantha Aamot-SA SA: 8 First I’ll have you state your name and say that you give us permission to use this recording. 6, 13 My name is Emily Brunner and I give you permission to use this recording. 6, 8, 13 SA: Great, thanks. 11 Do you want to talk a little bit about your childhood and where you grew up and your family? 12, 14, 20 EB: Sure.  I grew up in Ridgefield, Connecticut which is a small town in Fairfield County, Connecticut. 20 I also briefly lived in California--Palo Alto--and my father is a physicist and my mom is a choir teacher, but she didn’t go back to work until I was about nine, I think I was in third grade--no I was in middle school, but she was home for most of my childhood. 5, 7, 14, 16, 19, 20 She never drank or used anything and neither did my father, but we had a history. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16 My grandfather on my mother’s side was an alcoholic and that was why she didn’t drink. 5, 6, 9, 16 I kind of knew that growing up. 10, 16 SA: You were in California at this point?  EM: Both California and Connecticut.  I just remember that being talked about very early on.  SA: And did you grow up having that idea for yourself? 10 Yeah, I definitely remember at one point my grandma offered me a thousand dollars if I could get through college without drinking alcohol, but it wasn’t worth it. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 20 [laughs] 15 She had watched how problematic that was for my grandpa. 12, 17 He ended up going to alcoholics anonymous and periods of sobriety, but then he would relapse. 6, 12, 18 SA: And this was your mom’s parents? 14, 20 My mom’s parents. 14, 20 And then my dad’s family all lived in Wisconsin and a lot of them drank heavily and they were often drunk when we saw them. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16 It looked fun, but like my parents didn’t drink and they were also kind of awkward people and that seemed connected to me, I think. 5, 6, 9, 14, 20 They were sort of embarrassing.  I don’t know. 12 I guess every kid thinks their parents are embarrassing, but I certainly did as well. 8, 17, 20 SA: Did you see your mom’s parents’ drinking affect your mom in any way that you remember? 5, 6, 11, 14, 18, 20 I think she was just very clear that we don’t drink because we have a history of alcoholism in our family. 5, 6, 12, 15 I think she probably puts a lot of characteristics of adult children of alcoholics, but I wasn’t terribly interested in much of that when I was younger. 5, 6, 14, 20 I just thought, You’re awkward and embarrassing. 17, 18 SA: And it was because they didn’t drink. 5 And it’s because they didn’t drink. 5 Well, I mean I think I was pretty committed to the idea of not drinking when I was younger but maybe developed that later on. 5, 10, 11, 20 I certainly had a pact to like never drink. 5, 8, 16, 17 SA: Did you have any siblings?  I do, I have three younger siblings. 20 I was the oldest of four. 20 Two younger brothers and a younger sister. 20 SA: Do you want to talk a little about your high school years or deciding that you wanted to go into medicine? 7, 12, 14, 18, 20 EM: Sure.  And I didn’t decide in high school. 7, 14 It’s actually kind of a funny story where I went to college because--so I was like an uber nerd with not a lot of friends. 7, 9, 15, 16, 20 I had one very, very close--two very close friends who I am still very close with who were kind of like siblings because I wasn’t close with my siblings. 9, 10, 16, 20 We were one the debate team--one of them and me--and we went to a junior year debate meet and went to MIT to a frat house and I got super drunk there. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 18 SA: And this is in high school? 7 It was a trip where we went to Boston [Massachusetts] for a weekend and my parents weren’t among the chaperones and we were all such good kids that they gave us the freedom to not have anyone check on us at night, and so we developed the plan to infiltrate a MIT frat party. 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 20 My dad went to MIT. 14 He was a grad student there, but I always thought MIT was a place that I could be cool basically because it was so nerdy. 17, 18, 19 And so I tried to go there.  SA: What else happened at the party? 9, 15, 20 I certainly don’t remember that much of it, but I kissed a boy, which was a thing I had never done before. 7, 8, 16, 17 I loved being drunk. 5, 8, 14 SA: Was it one of your first experiences with alcohol? 6, 14, 18 It was definitely my first. 9, 14 Wait, no.  It’s always hard for me to remember the details because it’s amazing the power of minimization. 9, 17, 18 I had gotten drunk at a family Thanksgiving sort of sneaking sips of wine when I was thirteen. 5, 8, 12, 14 I remember dancing on a table.  Then I actually took everyone else’s wine after they left the room. 7, 14 I also blacked out that night.  I always loved to drink. 5, 14, 18 When I would drink I would drink to blackout basically from the beginning. 5, 11, 19 SA: So beginning junior year did it start escalating or were these just a few instances? 11, 14 Just a few, discrete like--because I got in lots trouble after all of those things happened. 15, 16 In fact after the debate team thing happened I got kicked off the National Honor’s Society and had to do Saturday suspensions. 15, 16 I think it was only three or four instances.  I also didn’t have access to it. 9 I wasn’t really hanging out with the cool kids. 17, 18 That experience at MIT by the way I liked so much that I went there for college and drank many times. 5, 7, 16, 18 SA: So you went to MIT knowing you wanted to go to medical school? 7, 12, 14, 18 I didn’t actually. 7 I was interested in being an engineer.  SA: What changed? 13 EB: I hated engineering.  [laughs] 15 I sort of theoretically wanted to do it because not many women go into engineering, but I didn’t like it at all. 12, 18 I switched to environmental engineering as a major, I thought that was neat, a lot of it, but finding out that the practical job applications were sewage treatment plants was interesting to me. 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 I think it was late junior year that I loved science and I loved talking to people and I wish there was something that combined those things and someone was like, “Idiot. 9, 14 That’s what being a doctor is.” 12, 14 So I decided to be pre-med at that point. 10, 14 So it was pretty late, but at MIT you were required to do an amount of sciences that fulfilled a lot of the prerequisites, so I had already done all that. 5, 10 I just added on some biology and then I took the MCAT and took organic chemistry my senior year, and actually I loved that. 7, 14, 15 I drank heavily during college, but when I decided to apply to med school I was able to sort of pull it together and stop for a while in that period. 5, 7, 8, 14, 16, 18 SA: What year was that? 14 EB: Junior year of college. 7, 14 I graduated high school in ‘98. 7 SA: Do you remember every thinking you were drinking too much or wished you drank less in your college years, or was that just kind of normal for you? 5, 7, 11, 14, 16 EB: Yeah I certainly had a lot of negative experiences related to it and I stopped drinking for thirty days once just to prove that I didn’t have a problem. 5, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 The thing that sort of perpetuated me thinking it was okay was that I continued to be able to pull it out for tests, and so I had a pretty high GPA and it wasn’t interfering with that aspect of things and that made it feel okay. 7, 10 However, I isolated a lot of people who I had been friends with. 9, 16, 20 I definitely gravitated towards people who drank heavily and I blacked out a lot, but I liked it. 5, 9, 16 I really liked it. 18 There was a period of time where [unclear]. 18 It’s amazing how potently biological that part was. 6, 9 So, I eventually sort of got things together. 5, 8 I worked at an environmental engineering mechanical device company that was in the Boston area after graduating while I worked on getting into med school. 7, 8, 12, 14 I had a year between college and med school. 7, 14 During that period I did not drink or use very much. 5, 6, 13, 18 I should mention in college there was an experience I had where I took ecstasy a few times and I really loved that to the point where I remember thinking I’m going to use this until someone stops me. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18 And that scared me so I stopped. 5, 19 I never used it after that again. 6, 13, 16 After all of that stuff it wasn’t actually alcohol that got me into rehab, personally, it was opiates and benzos and those came a lot later. 6, 7 I had a period where I had it fairly together. 8, 9, 18 I would drink every one or two months always to excess. 5, 11, 16, 18 I had met my husband at this company I worked at. 14 We were fairly serious fairly quickly and he would sort of drive me on those times. 5, 9, 11 He drank heavily when we met, but actually just sort of stopped as he grew up in a normal way, but I continued to escalate. 5, 7, 16, 18, 20 During med school it was always in a very, I don’t have class tomorrow so I can get drunk tonight. 5, 7, 8, 14, 18 There was an element of responsibility, but it was always to the point of blacking out. 12, 18 When I went to med school I was most interested in cardiology or something like that, but after rotating-- [pause in conversation] 6, 7, 13, 14 I also like egotistically wanted to be a kind of doctor that was hard, but in rotating around I really, really liked family medicine. 9, 12, 14, 18 I felt it was a field where I could actually do the kind of medicine I pictured doctors doing when I was little and could answer questions for my family members. 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 20 I really liked the variety of it. 18 I have always really liked people’s interesting stories and family medicine has a lot of that. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 While I was in med school I got a tumor and my experience of being diagnosed was I was on rotation and I was sleeping in the hospital two or three nights a week. 7, 8, 15, 16, 18 Not really sleeping--not sleeping in the hospital two or three nights a week. 8, 15, 16, 18 [laughs] 15 I found a stomach swelling and went to the doctor who said I needed to get an ultrasound and the ultrasound lady knew I was in med school and tipped it around so I could see and there was clearly a giant abnormality and I asked her what is was and she said, “You know, I don’t know. 6, 7, 12, 14, 16 I need to get the radiologist right away.” 12, 18, 20 And it scared the crap out of me even though it turned out to be--anyway so at that period of time I had to take a medical leave from medical school. 5, 7, 14, 18, 19 I had to get a surgery and when I was getting the surgery I was consented to have all my ovaries and uterus taken out. 5 At that time I had not really thought much about having a family or the future, but I really started to want one. 12, 17, 18 I had also had sort of strong feelings that strong women don’t get married and at that point sort of changed my tune. 7, 12, 13, 15 I had been living with my now husband for a couple years. 11, 12, 14 I don’t know, I hadn’t thought much about making a family. 10, 12, 17, 18 So that was really frightening. 12, 18 Then first doctor I talked to said, “I am going to give you this ativan. 12, 14 Take it as much as you want,” and I took a lot.  I loved it. 14 It was sort of pill alcohol. 6 SA: What year was that? 14 I stayed on the ativan intermittently since that time until I went to rehab in 2009. 17 So after that I got pregnant my first week of intern year at St. Louis. 7, 10, 14, 15 So sort of fastforward: decided to get married and have a family. 7, 12, 14 We started trying--the plan was to have a baby during residency and it would probably take us a while to get pregnant because I only had one ovary and one fallopian tube; the others got taken out. 7, 9, 10 It turned out that the tumor was benign, I forgot to mention that. 12 I got PTSD around that time.  It was frightening. 12 I ended up getting pregnant in 2007--right at the same time as I started residency at the University of Michigan. 7, 9, 10, 12 It was really challenging to be pregnant and an intern. 7, 10, 18 I really tried to not do anything differently than the other residents because they were sort of irritated with me because if I was out they would have to do more work. 9, 18 In fact one of them the first day of our residency tried to have us make a pact that none of us would get pregnant during intern year and I said, “I’m not making that pact.” 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16 It was uncomfortable.  I was really sad during that period of time. 18 I had close friends in medical school and then I moved away. 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 At that point I got married. 7 I didn’t really bring up that my husband was Lebanese, but there were all kinds of sort of complications with his family because of that, but really they were wonderful people. 9, 12, 14, 18 But it was like sort of one more thing that was unknowable, and my response to things like that was always to use. 6, 12, 13, 18 I loved family medicine; it’s really hard and it’s hard to juggle everything and the training where I went. 9, 12, 14, 18 It was really physically and mentally challenging at that time to go through residency. 6, 7, 9, 12, 18 I ended up on bedrest because I was trying to work too hard. 5, 9 I went twenty-one days without having a day off when I was about twenty weeks pregnant. 7, 10, 15, 16 I started having contractions. 14, 19 I ended up having a short cervix. 18 I went on bedrest, and during that period of time I wasn’t drinking or using while I was pregnant, but I had this bottle of ativan that I would just count sometimes. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 18 That was a little weird. 20 It was awful being on bedrest, and I sort of sunk into isolated depression because it wasn’t like the people at residency had time to visit me or anything, you know, so I was just kind of alone. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 I was at Michigan at this point and all of my family was in Connecticut. 12 I delivered then. 5 It was a little bit of a scary delivery. 20 That was in October--sorry, that was in March of 2008.  I got a huge supply of oxycodone after delivering, which was kind of my first exposure to opioids, and I absolutely loved it. 6, 13, 14 I was given like one hundred pills with a refill and then I called to get more refills. 5 There was a comfort that the doctors were prescribing to me because I was a resident. 9, 10, 12, 14 At that point I had never heard anyone say addiction was an illness. 9, 12, 14, 16 I thought the way I drank was probably not right, but I really didn’t know what was wrong with me. 5, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 I was trying all kinds of anti depressants, I had postpartum depression, and it was really just an awful period of time. 9, 10, 11, 18 I loved my daughter so much, I had never experienced anything like that, loving someone so much, and when I had to go back to work it really broke my heart and I didn’t want to, but I felt trapped. 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18 I talked to the residency director who was a douchebag and he basically said, “Well either come back or don’t come back, but there’s no way we can work out any kind of schedule,” which actually isn’t true, but they weren’t really willing to work with me. 5, 7, 9, 18, 19 Around that time I started drinking more and more. 5, 11 Well, so I sort of held it together because I ran out of--when I went back to work I didn’t have anymore oxycodone, I wasn’t using it, and I started going to this like secret residency doctor to help with mental health of residents, which is a nice resource to have but she was giving me a lot of ativan as was my primary doctor and they weren’t really cross-checking and I started using a lot of that and combining it with alcohol. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 I had some back pain which I think was pretty legitimate, and I also remember thinking, I know medicine and no one can tell me I don’t have back pain, and so I was doing physical therapy but also using oxycodone. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 At first it was prescribed and then I was just picking it up and taking it and just crossing all kinds of--I mean I descended into a person I didn’t recognize quite quickly. 10, 11, 14, 17 Got in trouble in October of 2009 in terms of--that’s when I went to rehab. 17 That was a terrible period of time and I don’t want to go into too many details except that I became a person I didn’t recognize rapidly and ended up going to Talbot in Atlanta. 11, 17, 18 For me I got sober largely through a twelve-step, AA based program in a place--Talbot treats doctors and pilots and is very expensive, so my parents had to get like an RV in order to send me to rehab. 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 I will be forever grateful for them.  So that was seven and a half years ago. 13, 14 I actually have not drank or used an illicit drug since that point. 5, 6, 7, 13, 16 I was put on opiates once when I had a nose surgery, but I was under the care of an addiction medicine doctor who like--I went into a monitoring program, I still go to AA now, my recovery has been a really important part of my life. 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19 Actually, I am very grateful for the experience. 18 I will transition into talking more about the addiction medicine because that is how I became interested in it. 12, 14, 17 I was like, What the hell this is a disease?  No one--why didn’t someone tell me? 8 SA: Why didn’t I learn this in medical school? 7, 10, 14 I really had not--I had learned the side effects of liver disease from alcohol, but not that there was any hope for people stopping or that there are medications to treat alcohol. 6, 9, 10, 14, 18 SA: Or about prescription opioids. 6, 10, 13 EB: Right, well we were taught that they were safe.  I went to med school during the period where it was like if you have pain we have to treat it. 6, 7, 18 Pain is a vital sign. 11 You can’t get addicted to opiates if you have real pain, which is wrong. 6, 11, 12, 14 I had always done well on tests and stuff, and had the ambition to be able to make some sort of impact in the field of medicine and became by far most interested in--also, I got really lucky because the doctor who sent me to treatment and evaluated me was probably the best addiction medicine doctor I’ve ever seen practice. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 His name is Pat Gibbons.  He has passed away since, and I’m pretty sure he’s available regarding historic--he was like an amazing, wonderful mentor and doctor and I hated him at first because he held really high standards for how he would treat you. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 There were also a number of doctors in my area that were in recovery, had been sober a long time, and took me under their wing. 8, 12, 14, 17 I had an amazing sponsor who was a cardiothoracic surgeon who has been sober for twenty-three years, so she was like invaluable. 9, 14 Early sobriety--I was out of work for eight months, and when I went back it was with restrictions and I was on a monitoring program and had drug testing every one to two weeks and calling every day for three years. 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 That structure--I wouldn’t have stayed sober without that. 15 I wasn’t really interested in [unclear] and I wanted to keep my license. 13, 18 And I loved my daughter. 14 At first I was still mad at my husband for making me go to treatment. 10, 12, 13, 14 I was like obsessed with the idea that we needed to get divorced. 7 He was like the most wonderful, amazing guy and kept our family together. 8, 9, 12, 18 I got to fall in love with him all over again in sobriety, as well as sort of expand the interest in addiction medicine. 12, 14 I did family medicine as a second year resident they made me repeat my second year, which was, you know, they should have, so I got to really thoroughly learn that, and then after that I started working at a clinic in Michigan as well at a place called Pain Recovery Solutions in Ibsoleny with two doctors, three doctors who were really excellent at doing addiction medicine and I was there one day a week. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 You could do an addiction medicine study specialty without doing a fellowship, and you still can, but that’s going to close now. 9, 10, 12, 14 I decided that that was going to be my goal and started doing that in 2012. 14 I got boarded in 2014.  That was around the time I wanted to have one addiction medicine job and moved to Minnesota to work at Hazelden. 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 Also, I had met Bob Levy at conferences and we were friends and he worked there at that point too. 16, 20 SA: So you got to Hazelden in…  EB: December of 2014.  This whole period of time in 2012 to 2014 there was this escalating opioid use epidemic and a lot of talk about whether suboxone was just another drug replacing a drug and that was very controversial in doctors who were also in recovery. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 The CMO of Hazelden had decided that they were going to be both abstinence based twelve-step as well as using medication so it was kind of a big deal. 6, 13, 14 I was excited to be able to come be a part of that and I wanted to be able to do studies on it and stuff. 9, 18 I was primarily at Hazelden treating opiate use disorder. 6, 13 Most of my patients were eighteen to twenty-six, and severe opiate use does have a huge amount of comorbidity, mental health issues, profoundly ill. 6, 12, 13, 19 I became struck by how much more effective suboxone was than vivitrol as well as than nothing. 8 Suboxone is so much more effective than nothing.  Than treatment alone. 8, 12, 13 I developed a belief that treatment alone for opiate use addicts who are younger than twenty-six is inadequate. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 20 That’s my personal opinion.  But it was hard to watch that happen. 9, 15, 17 It’s hard to watch all the misinformation about suboxone go through the world. 9, 17 It is a medication that reduces the risk of relapse and death by fifty to seventy-five percent and is hugely effective and we do not employ it with the vast majority of patients. 5, 14, 18 They’re dying.  I’m tired of watching; it breaks my heart. 5, 8, 9, 17 SA: What sorts of things struck you about how Dr. Levy and other doctors that talked about addiction when you were learning about them or went and saw them? 10, 12, 14 EB: It just was inspiring to me.  I knew so many people from recovery who had been sort of shamed by their doctor. 9, 12, 14, 16 I think addicts have the world’s most fascinating stories. 9, 14 That was always something I liked about addiction medicine. 12, 14, 18 It was probably Herb Malinoff and Pat Gibbons, these doctors in Michigan, who got me the most interested. 12, 14 I mean if you interviewed Herb Malinoff on the phone and he was okay with it, he’s like an amazing practitioner in Michigan. 8, 9, 16 I just wanted to learn to do what they did. 10, 18 I would see it being handled in my primary care clinic in a horrible way. 6, 10, 18, 19 SA: Do you have any examples that come to mind?  EB: I just remember in residency my last year spending an hour and a half with a patient who wanted oxycodone for back pain and ativan for anxiety, which weirdly were my two drugs of choice, and just recognizing that they were having a problem with it and trying to give them these tools of other ways to help with back pain like acupuncture and they were just so angry and like immediately went from complaining to about what a bad doctor I was. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 Luckily at that clinic they were like, “That’s exactly what you should do.”  Around that time there was a doctor from Chelsea who had really high doctor Yelp scores who was selling--was cracked down on by the federal government for selling oxycodone. 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18 Anyway, it really struck me that the doctors I looked up who were getting one to two star reviews because they pissed people off because you really shouldn’t be doing what your patients want you to do, you should be doing what is in their best interest. 9, 12, 14, 18 Even though you should do it in a kind, loving way. 18 That was what I really admired about those doctors was they were not mean or shaming or unkind or judgemental, just like, “Here’s what I can safely offer you,” and that’s what I wanted to learn how to do. 5, 10, 12, 14, 18 Because you don’t really learn those skills about how to have difficult conversations with patients. 10, 18 But in a deliberate way you sort of end up learning as you go. 10, 18 SA: When did you leave Hazelden? 18 EB: I left in 2016. 14 It was not out of any kind of bad feelings in anyway. 15, 18 It was a wonderful place, but I missed the medical system and being able to get labs rapidly, see patients efficiently, see patients on Medicaid because they didn’t take Medicare or Medicaid, so it was a really different patient population. 6, 7, 14, 18, 19 So I had met this doctor from Health East at the Minnesota Society of Addiction Medicine conference who said they needed new doctors and like a year later I contacted her and said, “Do you still need new doctors?” 12, 14, 16 [laughter]  “I kind of miss medicine.” 12, 14 Not that it wasn’t medical there, but it was like [unclear] a new clinic and it was primarily for seeing counselors. 6, 7, 14, 16 And I had three kids.  I really love what I do. 14, 18 I feel really blessed and proud and happy and it’s kind of not where I ever thought I would be. 17, 18 I had no plans to move to Minnesota, be an addiction medicine doctor, and have a lovely family, like objectively that was not the plan. 12, 14, 15 It’s so much better than I would have guessed.  That’s amazing. 9 Do you still do family medicine with addiction medicine? 12, 14 EB: I mostly do addiction medicine. 12, 14 I would like to do some family medicine again someday, but right now there’s such a vast, gaping need for addiction medicine doctors. 12, 14, 16 SA: Have you seen the field growing? 6, 10 EB: I think more people have talked about it in a way that has minimized stigma, and it is certainly a great thing that there’s a formal, medical subspecialty board, but I think it’s a field that if the Medicaid expansion is taken away it will be decimated. 7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 18, 20 So, I’m very worried about the safety of my patients. 19 SA: Do you want to talk a little bit more about what has been going on or what you see for the future or what your worries are? 6, 20 EB: Sure.  I think that it’s pretty scientifically established how you treat opiate use disorder. 6, 10, 13 I don’t see that being implemented the way that it needs to be. 6, 12, 18 I’ll just say I think making an opiate commission headed by Chris Christie is asinine. 10, 14 I think that we should just be expanding funding for treatment right now and finding in-house places for people to recover. 6, 9, 12, 13 One population that is very dear to my heart is mothers with addiction issues, and there’s no social supports for them, we’re not well networked between medical field, the healthcare field, even the research field, and the CD world, and the legal world. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 It’s all split up, and that kills people, and I hate that because it’s actually not that complicated to treat. 7, 9 We just have not had the resources to do it.  SA: You mentioned more focus on treatment. 8, 12, 13 In your day to day is that what you wish there were more avenues to? 16 EB: Yeah, and to find an addiction medicine doctor in the Twin Cities is tough. 12, 14 We don’t take new ones at the clinic 8, 16 I’m at unless they go through the residential, so there’s really limited options to step in with an allocation [unclear]. 9, 13, 18 A lot of them are cash only.  There are some great doctors that are cash only because it is really hard to deal with the insurance companies. 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 But it sucks.  It puts up a huge barrier.  Often the mental health comorbidities aren’t well managed. 12, 19 There’s still certainly a lot of pejorative stigma surrounding suboxone, language around not being clean if you’re on it, which I think kills people. 8, 9, 14, 17 If I’m prescribing someone a medication they are taking as prescribed then they are abstinent. 10, 11, 14 I hate when people tell them that they’re not. 9 SA: That goes along with AA’s-- EB: Well, AA has a pretty clear--it’s really different now how they implement it. 10, 12, 17, 18 It’s pretty clearly delineated in there that, “We’re not doctors, we do not mean to interfere with physician treatment,” but there is sort of a historical stigma that has preceded--and actually when I was in residency I had to do a research project and I did mine on stigma across different levels of the healthcare field, and the trend was that you got more of it in med school and residency and people had less preconceived notions about addicts and we intensified those with exposure to people. 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 You don’t really see--when I go to the doctor sometimes I say, “I’ve been sober for seven and a half years,” I tell it to them the first time I go, but there are a lot of people in sobriety who don’t. 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 Doctors can be real idiots about treating it. 13 I went to the ER six months ago for an ear infection and they offered me morphine. 5, 11, 13, 16, 20 They didn’t ask me.  SA: And then it’s up to you to say no.  And I was able to but, you know, there are probably days where that could have ruined my life. 10, 12, 16 SA: Or killed you. 14 EB: I think just because I got sober without suboxone doesn’t mean that’s the right thing for everybody. 12 That was--first of all there was a period of time where lots of other people I went to treatment with are no longer sober or alive. 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 SA: We can go through a typical day you have in the clinic. 16 EB: I primarily now see outpatients with opioid use disorder. 6, 11, 12, 13 I would say one to two of them are in active relapse everyday, and so a lot of what I do is try to check for mental health, talk to them in a way that’s non judgemental and exhibits caring and--you know I get urine drug screens from everyone I see regardless of how long they’ve been sober because you just never know. 5, 6, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 I try to be a sort of safe point that they can access, but you know, one or two no shows, one or two people that are high on a day to day basis, and some of them are doing really well. 7, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18 It’s really rewarding. 18 Again, I just really love what I do. 14, 18 It’s pretty cool. 10, 17 I use suboxone a fair amount. 6, 9, 13 The majority of my patients are on it. 18 SA: Do you prescribe methadone at all? 10 EB: That’s only in specific clinics.  SA: Are you limited in prescribing suboxone? 8, 10 EB: I have a limit of 275 patients and I don’t really see myself ever hitting 275 because it’s pretty unusual to see them any less than monthly. 6, 10, 16, 18 I think it is really stupid that there is a limit because fentanyl is so much more dangerous and has no limit and any doctor can prescribe it. 10, 11, 12, 14, 18 If there’s one thing I could change and promote about addiction medicine changing it is getting more doctors to get a suboxone waiver and treat with it in primary care. 8, 12, 14, 17, 19 I think if you’re going to limit something it should be [unclear] not suboxone because it is very safe if you use it as prescribed. 6, 8, 10, 13 I think there is going to be a trend of a benzo epidemic and I see more and more people using meth and benzos. 6, 9, 13 Meth is pretty frustrating to treat because there’s not a lot we can offer to help. 10 SA: Why do you say that?  EB: I have been seeing more and more patients using those things. 6 For benzodiazepines there are pretty good New York Times articles showing that fourteen percent of people over the age of sixty-five use them on a daily basis. 6, 9, 10, 13 That’s not good. 10 They aren’t really recommended for any long-term purpose, but they are used that way often by people who don’t understand the risks of doing that. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 It’s basically pill alcohol. 6, 19 SA: Do you think a change in educating young doctors is what it is going to take to-- EB: I think that would be helpful. 9, 12, 14 I don’t think that that’s going to happen. 15 I think Bob Levy may be the sole zion of that.  That was part of why I came to St. Joe’s to be able to-- and I still am connected to Hazelden in the sense that I work with them doing consulting to go do training to other health systems for how to treat opioid use disorder and implement the COR-12 program [Comprehensive Opioid Response with the Twelve Steps]. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 I am able to do some slight advocacy stuff.  SA: One last question and we can wrap up.  Can you talk a little bit about being a woman in your field, and anything that goes along with that? 17, 20 EB: Yeah, so addiction medicine has this definite old boy club with like long term AA men flavor. 7, 12, 14, 17 I started going in my first year of sobriety to this international doctors in AA conference that has addiction medicine as part of it. 9, 12, 14 I go every year and actually bring my family. 7, 12, 14 Whenever I go, even now, when I have been going for six years, everyone thinks my husband is the addict and approaches him. 12, 14, 16, 17 It’s just really--in all of medicine there is that feel of there is still a difference of a gender bias that occurs, but I think there have always been pretty amazing and now like Nora Volkow, who’s the coolest. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 She’s awesome.  So, I think there is a different experience of interacting with patients that can feel more physically frightening I think because a lot of them have also had violence towards women in the past and stuff. 6, 12, 18 It’s certainly very possible to sort of move through that stuff. 8, 15, 17 I had a lot of advice on that from my sponsor, so I saw it role modeled really well just sort of how to integrate. 10, 18 She was awesome.  Now I’m part of the executive council for the Minnesota Society of Addiction Medicine; Bob Levy does that, too. 9, 14 We’re trying to build more of a place for that to be a kernel of learning, but there’s not a lot of funding unfortunately. 10 SA: Thank you so much.  EB: Sure.  It’s great you guys are focusing on this topic. 6, 20"
"4","Bining_Colford_Janie","Jamison Danielson Narrator Samantha Aamot Interviewer May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Jamison Danielson-JD Samantha Aamot-SA SA:  Okay, I'll have you state your name and tell me you give me permission to record you.  JD: Jamison Danielson, I give permission to be recorded.  SA: Do you want to start with talking about your childhood? 14, 20 Or we could start with the work you do here.  Really wherever.  There's a lot of space between that, holy shit. 18 So, I have a very interesting past. 17 I am one of five children and four of us are living. 5, 14, 20 My life changed drastically the day that my sister died. 5, 10, 13, 16, 20 She died when she was nineteen days old of SIDS and it was extremely rough on my parents. 16, 20 They couldn't bring themselves to stay in the house that she died in, and they couldn't bring themselves to not stay in the house that she died in. 6, 13 So, their grief stricken course of action was to stop paying the mortgage and pretty much stay there as long as they could, but also being forced to leave, which was, I don't know, I was in second grade, so it was complicated in my mind. 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 Eventually, we got our twenty-four hour notice. 15 From there we stayed with my mom's friend, who was pretty toxic. 10, 14, 20 Her husband was an alcoholic. 6, 14 SA: You and your four siblings?  JD: Yeah, me and my four brothers. 20 I am the oldest--now I'm twenty-eight. 12, 20 My other brother is twenty-five, my next brother is seventeen, the next one is eighteen, so there's a bit of a gap in between us. 8, 20 SA: This is in Duluth?  JD: Yeah, here in Duluth.  From then we stayed in campgrounds and hotels and it was just kind of a rough go of things. 14 Then we were able to access transitional housing through Salvation Army, and we were like on an on-sight managed program for some time just to see like, ""Are these people respectful? 6, 9, 17 Do they behave?  Are they worthy of our resources and time?""  So after, I don't know, six months or a year there we were given an opportunity to live in a house instead of a managed house, which is really rad because the Salvation Army has three of those on Park Point. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 So, to be a poor kid and get to live out on Park Point coming from nothing was really fucking rad. 18 Yeah, it was really cool. 17, 18 Like I said my sister passing really damaged my family, and so I grew up in a pretty toxic household. 6, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20 There was a lot of emotional abuse and physical abuse, and me and my mom just didn't get along. 6, 13, 14, 17 I acted out quite a bit as a teenager due to that. 20 I ended up on probation as a teenager.  I was locked up a lot.  SA: Do you remember if this is middle school or high school? 7 JD: This is, I don't know, however old you are in ninth grade. 5, 12 I don't know, high school was really abnormal in comparison to most people's experience. 7, 9, 12, 16, 18 So, yeah, however old you are then.  I just couldn't live with her.  I acted out because when the social workers would come over she would behave, the house would be clean, because they would say, ""Hey, we are going to come next Tuesday at four."" 6, 12, 13, 16, 19 So they aren't getting an accurate view of what my life was like. 10 My brothers were younger and just didn't experience as much as I did, so they defended her, which we have had conversations about now that we are older. 12, 14, 18, 20 They feel bad for not speaking their truth, but I can't fault them for that.  So, yeah, I was just kind of locked up a lot.  When I was fifteen years old I moved into Renaissance, which was a transitional housing program for teens in Duluth ran through Lutheran Social Services. 6, 7, 14, 15, 17 That was where I came out as gay. 9 It was a really cool experience for me; a lot of the staff around me were also gay. 9, 17, 18 I lived with two lesbians, a bi man, and a gay man, so that was really rad to experience that at fifteen years old. 7, 9, 14, 18 That was one of my comings out.  So, I lived there for a while. 7 I just kind of went through a lot.  No one would rent me, so I was just kind of stuck in that space for a while. 8 Then eventually did rent my own SRO, or single room occupancy. 5, 14 Just kind of a shitty room like this. 14, 18 It was better than being outside where I have slept before in my life. 9, 10 SA: Especially here.  JD: Yeah, yeah it's cold much of the year. 14 That's why I try to get outside as much as I can because I've got like a three to four month window otherwise it's Netflix and snacks, which would be why I'm a big dude. 9, 16 [laughs] 15 I lived there for a while. 7 I then was in a long term relationship for five years so lived with her. 7, 14, 17, 19 That was kind of messy.  I think the first time you love someone is messy, especially when you're young. 14 You don't know what the fuck you are doing and there's a lot of great things that happen; you make a lot of mistakes because you just don't know better. 12, 15, 17, 20 You just don't know how to value something or care for it. 12, 19 It's kind of like if somebody gives you some kind of rare plant and says, ""Good luck,"" and tells you nothing. 15 [laughs] 15 Half the plant might live, half the plant might look like shit and you are like, ""I don't know what I'm doing."" 12, 18 So that relationship ended. 19 SA: Five years is a long time. 14, 17 I guess that's kind of where things get a little messy. 20 I am trans. 17 I am a trans guy, but I didn't want to be trans. 17 Being gay was hard enough. 9 I was really struggling with that, and I pushed my ex away a lot. 18, 20 You know, I have my own drug history. 5, 6, 12, 15 I was using, I guess I'll say I was a garbage can user; anything that came my way or whatever. 6, 13, 18 Anything that made you feel good or made you feel nothing was something I was really interested in. 10, 18 SA: Did that start earlier? 15 Eighth grade, ninth grade? 5 JD: Yeah, I had always been a pot smoker. 6, 18 Pills here and there, and a fuck ton of drinking as a teenager. 5, 11 Fuck tons of drinking. 5, 11 Yeah, I mean I kind of dabbled in stuff.  As I got older it escalated, and I had friends who were heavily using. 6, 16, 20 I've never injected myself, but I did use a lot of hard core stuff. 6, 9, 13, 14, 16 I damaged or lost a lot of important things in my life due to that. 9, 10, 11 There kind of came a point where I had to deal with my gender identity stuff. 14 Well, I guess I hate the word 'identity' because I don't identify as, I am.  For lack of better language tools I'll say that.  So, yeah, I really had to deal with that because it really came to a point where I felt like I had to transition or I was going to die. 11, 17, 18 There was just no in-between.  Oh, I found it.  Okay, when I was a teenager--so I'm twenty-eight years old--when I was a teenager I remember Googling trans things and being like really fucking freaked out. 14, 17, 18 Trying to delete everything, every time my mom walked by I clicked onto, I don't know-- SA: The newspaper. 12, 14, 15, 16 JD: Right, right. 12 [laughs] 15 I remember when I was reading about trans people and people who had transitioned the only stuff I really read about were people who were using hormones and people who were having surgery. 6, 8, 9, 17, 18 At that time the concept of hormones was like a whole new thing, so I didn't know how I felt about that, and surgery from the get-go was something I just never really wanted because I was comfortable with my parts and what was going on, but I didn't like myself when I looked in the mirror. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 When I Googled these things a lot of people were like, ""If I don't have bottom surgery, I'm going to kill myself."" 9 And I could never relate to that. 16 I stayed closeted as a trans person for many years because, ""I'm not trans enough to be trans,"" you know. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 When I look back on that--and I help quite a bit with the trans group here in Duluth--I'll have a lot of people who are just starting their journey and they'll come to group and they'll be like, ""Well, I don't know,"" and whatever and it's like, ""Dude, you are trans enough to be you. 9, 12, 17, 20 You are enough.  You don't want to have to have hormones, you don't have to medically transition. 7, 8, 14, 17 I decided that testosterone was for me, but still no interest in surgery, which is kind of an interesting concept for people because a lot of trans people that know me view me as some super macho dude, however my nickname is Daddy Twink Bear because there's a good mix of both! 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17 SA: Did you come up with the gummy bear road?  [laughs] 15 I did not, that's all Maggie!  [laughs] 15 But it's hilarious.  So, yeah, I came to a point where I was going to take steps I needed to take to transition or I couldn't see myself being on earth. 6, 17, 19 I don't know if you know much about trans stats or anything, but forty-one percent of trans people attempt or complete suicide. 9, 12, 17 That was a very real thing for me and the way I felt was very scary. 11, 18 Living in Duluth there is a population of eighty-six thousand people. 9 For many years I didn't know or hadn't met anyone like me. 12, 14 Yeah, I felt really, really, really alone. 8, 11, 18 I educated myself on the path I needed to take to start T, and so I was like okay I need to talk to a therapist, they write some kind of letter, then I see a doctor who looks at the therapists' letter that says I'm good enough for hormones. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 It didn't go well at first. 14 I found a therapist and I remember walking into his office and he had his degree's on the wall and his name was very religious. 16 I was like, ""Okay, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.""  Then I take a bigger look around and there are crosses, and he was looking at me like I was an insect. 14 What the fuck is happening. 15 I was like, ""I don't give a fuck.  I need that letter really bad."" 18 So, he wants to talk to me, I lay out my whole story, and then he says, ""Well, thanks for sharing, but I don't do that. 11, 15, 18 You think he would have stopped me like fifteen minutes in and been like, ""I don't need to hear anymore. 9, 15 This is a waste of your time, this is a waste of my time.""  I felt like he was super judgmental and then obviously couldn't help me and had no one to refer me to. 8, 11, 12, 16 So I was like, ""Cool, now I'm just stuck back at square one."" 12 I let a couple more months go by because I felt discouraged, and just didn't know any resources or anyone. 11, 12, 16 Then think I did some Googling, but there was a woman here and she had gotten her degree, I don't know much about college shit, she got her degree and had to do like supervised hours. 7, 12, 15, 16, 18 She wanted to gain some experience writing letters for trans people. 9, 17, 18 I saw her.  I didn't really like her, but I was like, ""Alright, I have to jump through your hoops to get what I want."" 12, 18 I remember one day when I was seeing her--she had couches in her office--and I was sitting in the recliner with my feet up, but she was talking about my ex that I was with for five years, and she had asked if I would attempt to get her to come to a session because she thought that would be helpful for us to maybe have some peace or whatever. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18 That made me really angry. 11, 18 So I was sitting up there with my feet and stuff, but I did get like loud, but I didn't move or anything, and she was like, ""You're acting aggressive,"" and I was like, ""Or I have feelings and you brought up a touchy subject and I'm going to get loud about it."" 15 She asked.  JD: Right, like don't fucking ask me things if you don't want--I'm not a robot.  I'm going to react to stuff.  Then I felt kind of icky about her because she was like, ""Testosterone can make you aggressive. 11 I don't know if you're ready for that. 12 She pretty much, I felt, was just waving my letter above my head, which was really hard. 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 It was especially hard to see a cis person about this kind of stuff, and I still think that that's not something trans people should have to do. 6, 9, 17 I have to go convince a cis person why I'm trans and have them diagnose me with being trans and have them decide that it's time for me to start T? 14, 17 Like bitch I know. 12, 20 I know myself. 12 SA: And then tell you it's going to make you more aggressive.  JD: Yeah, which actually I've been on T now for two years. 7, 12, 14 I think that when I get angry I'm able to manage myself a lot better. 11 I think that has a lot to do with just being happier as a person.  Being able to be more present with myself. 5, 10 I got my letter, and I had to wait fucking ninety days until the endo had an opening. 10, 16 Even though you receive your letter they have to get a fax from the office.  So I finally got this golden ticket, which is fucking worthless, and then they tell me ninety days. 16 But then I had an appointment, took my first shot, and it's real fucking rad. 11, 12, 14 There was a trans group that was kind of meeting that I heard about and so I guess this is before T, so I'm telling it a little backwards, whatever. 9, 15, 17, 18, 20 I had an incident one day when I was really close to starting T before my coming out thing, and one of my ex-girlfriends was a TERF, or a trans exclusionary radical feminist, so I told her what was going on, and she was fucking horrible to me. 7, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 Said some of the worst things I've heard in my life to this day. 9, 10, 16 Then I decided that I wanted my ex that I was with for five years to come comfort me. 14, 18 I decided to--I was drinking because, you know, that's intelligent when you're angry [laughs]--and so she came and met me at the bar and she was sober and I was just drunk and belligerent and I made her bring me through Hardee's and I just acted a little crazy, I bought cheeseburgers, I whipped them around her car because I was angry and whatever. 5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20 She kicked me out of her car. 14 My phone was dead, and I just wanted to get from Superior [WI] to Duluth. 8, 16, 18 I walk into this bar and I ask to use the phone and there's this female bartender and one guy sitting at the bar--pretty dead. 6, 8, 10, 13, 16 So I walk in and I show her my phone and I was like, ""Hey, I have a phone but it's dead, I just really need to use the phone."" 6, 8, 13, 16, 18 She looks at the dude, she looks at me, and she just kind of laughs. 15 She comes over and slams the cordless down on the bar and she goes, ""It, or whatever, needs to use the phone."" 6, 8, 13, 16 So I grabbed the phone, you know, and I've already had a really emotional day, and so I use the phone to try to call my parents, they didn't answer, I go to make a second, local, free call, and she goes, ""I said you could make one call."" 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20 So I was like, whatever, I continued trying to use the phone, and I got off the phone and she just starts calling me and 'it' and she called me a 'cunt' and so I whipped my fucking barstool at her. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16 I was drunk. 5, 8, 14 It was probably the worst day of my life, one of them. 10, 16 Of course she called the cops, I was arrested for disorderly conduct, and I was booked for one night in Douglas County [WI] and then you get there and they aren't competent with trans issues, and so when it came to handing over the binder they assumed I was smuggling drugs, I must have this strange vest or something stuffed with cocaine was what they thought I had! 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 [laughter]  It just couldn't be a binder, and I was like, ""No, it's like a binder,"" and I broke it down for them and on my personal inventory list they wrote down 'binder question mark' and I was like, ""No, that's not a fucking question mark. 5, 8 Google this!""  They didn't know where to put me because they have zero experience with trans people, so I sat in a little cement room by myself the whole night, which was a good time. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 Fast forward, on T. So right after that jail experience I found this local trans group that was meeting, so I sat in a room of five trans women I had never met and just started crying about my jail experience or whatever, and then kind of connected with them, took the journey that I explained to you about T. And then that group kind of died off. 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 There was one person running it, and it's fucking exhausting to be a community organizer and have so many people heavily relying on you and looking to you for everything, so I understand why she did that. 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 So, me and a friend and a couple of other people--I guess he wasn't really a friend at that point. 9, 11, 14, 18, 20 There were a couple of trans people in town that decided like, ""Hey, let's sit down and see what we can do."" 6, 9, 11, 14, 17 And so that's when I met who is now one of my best friends, and we decided to revamp the group. 12, 14, 16, 20 It's now called Trans Plus. 12 We have support group and work group.  Work group is kind of like what can we do to change things on a local level, and, you know, advance our place in the world because not a whole lot of people care about our community. 9, 12, 14, 19 So we kind of revamped that and that's been going on for a couple of years now. 11, 12, 14 We have, I don't know, anywhere from ten to thirty people attend group, which I never thought in my life I would ever know thirty trans people from Duluth. 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 And now I, I don't know, I see a trans person just living their life every day and say, ""Hi,"" to them on the street. 6, 10, 12, 16, 17 Some of my best friends are trans. 16, 17, 20 My partner is trans. 9, 17 And so it's really a night and day difference to my world. 16, 18 I'll talk a little bit about my work stuff. 20 So I initially started doing harm reduction work for Center City housing, and I worked at their San Marco location. 5, 6, 14 So, it's a harm reduction facility for alcoholics who are actively using. 5, 6, 14 Before San Marco existed in Duluth many of them were making frequent visits to hospital, jail, detox; it was costing a lot of money, and these people had no where to live. 8, 9, 10, 19 They were just going through this revolving door, which just wasn't helpful to our community, and to those people, you know, more importantly. 9, 12, 19 So they opened San Marco and there are two sides: one is low-income housing side. 6, 9, 10 Some of them drink, some of them don't. 5 They don't require much care from the staff. 19 They just kind of exist.  And then the other side--I can't remember the exact number, I'd say somewhere around thirty. 9 It's for people who are chronic alcoholics, so they are often drinking to the point of black out daily. 5, 6, 9, 11 There are just different ways we treat, you know--some people had to have alcohol plans, so maybe instead of a liter of vodka they got a pint of vodka daily and a six pack of beer, or something. 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 But I felt really good about doing that kind of stuff because of their addiction they have nothing and no one. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18 A lot of their families won't speak to them. 17 While that's sad, you know, sometimes we have to suffer the consequences of our choices while we're using. 6, 12 So, they hadn't personally impacted me so I was able to be friendly and talk to them and be open to them. 20 SA: What do you think got you started with harm reduction? 5, 14 Like walking in the door and knowing you wanted to work there? 12, 16, 18 JD: I guess because I like to live really authentically. 18 I'm a trans guy who works at a needle exchange and lives in an artist coop. 9, 10, 17 [laughs] 15 And so I never like did the college thing because, yeah, money is cool and you need it to live, and whatever, but I'd much rather be rich in happiness than be rich in green pieces of paper. 7, 8, 10, 16, 17 So I had worked at a group home with individuals who were mentally ill, chemically dependent, or both sometimes. 12, 13 I was onsite staff there, and I was just kind of sick of living where my, you know I had my own apartment, but I was kind of sick of living on sight. 5, 9, 11, 12, 15 So I looked around and found out about San Marco, and then a friend of mine is the sight director there, and she has known me since I was eleven years old. 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20 She was actually my parent's case manager at some point. 7, 17, 20 So she knew everything. 16 She knew that I really got it. 16, 18 I really--having been in dark places, dark times in my life, I really want to do that kind of work because I know that those kind of people--nobody wakes up and decides, ""I'm going to be an alcoholic"" or ""I'm going to be a drug addict."" 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 Those things are because of trauma and disconnection, and I really understand those things. 17, 18 So I wanted to not wear a suit and tie and be able to say, ""Fuck,"" at work if I wanted to say fuck. 18 [laughs] 15 And I wanted to be able to be useful to people, and really let them know that somebody was there that really understands it and doesn't judge them. 6, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18 I think I'm really good at making clients feel that. 10, 18 I'm often told, you know, ""You're easy to talk to. 12, 16 I feel comfortable talking to you.  It feels like you get it.""  Clients are going through things and they bring stuff up, you know, not to take away from their experience, but I'll minimally insert something about my life so they know, you know--in the winter we have clients who come in here and they are cold and they are like, ""My feet are wet."" 10, 12, 18, 20 We get sock donations from a thrift store down the block.  And so I'm like, ""Hey, man.  I've fucking slept outside. 9 I fucking understand."" 17, 18 And we look through the socks and wet socks are the worst.  Exactly.  So, yeah I just wanted to live authentically and actually make a difference with people. 7, 9, 18 And then I really liked my job there, but that's kind of where I went through my name transition. 11, 17, 18 A lot of them were older, white, cis men, veterans, and those are not very open minded people. 9, 12, 19, 20 So I had a guy, he came up and whipped a Bible at my head and told me that's what I needed. 14, 16 Some of them threw all kinds of, you know, their booze bottles at me, or an open beer can so I'm covered in beer and trying to work. 5, 12 Some of them would come up to the desk and be like, well, you have these parts so that's what you are. 9 Or Kyra, who was the site director there, 18, 19 ""Kyra says we are supposed to call you this now, but this is your ﻿real﻿ name."" 12, 14 SA: Not a safe working environment. 12 JD: Right.  And the staff at Center City were excellent to me.  I have not a bad word to say about them.  But, you know, kicking these clients out because they are treating me this way is not an option, or not what I wanted because they are the hardest people to house. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18 And it just wasn't working.  They just weren't getting it and I was not able to--I just couldn't do it anymore.  So one guy came up one night and he was just especially awful to me. 11 And instead of reacting to it because often times when clients go off I don't react to it. 10 I'm just calm and cool and like, ""okay, whatever."" 17 So he goes off on me and expects me to probably engage with him.  And I ended up shutting--we had half doors and then top doors if shit go rowdy. 14, 18 So I pulled both the top doors and I sat down at the computer and I just took a deep breath, and I started writing my two week notice [laughs] 11, 15 And I was like this is recording.  So I left there because of that. 14 And I was looking around for jobs, and so I was browsing Craig's List and there was an ad that was like, I don't remember the exact language, but 'working with difficult populations, need to have a sense of humor, maybe some life experience, a degree preferred,' which was a turn off for me, and so I almost didn't apply for it. 5, 10, 11, 17, 18 But I sent an email and I said, ""Hey, this is a little bit about me, blah blah,"" and I knew when I was looking at the article I was like this is some kind of harm reduction thing. 5, 14, 16, 20 They don't want you to know what they are because--they are just being really veiled about this ad. 12, 18 So I was like this is totally probably a syringe exchange for sure. 10 So I emailed back and forth a bunch with Maggie [Kazel] and then we set up a time when I could come in.  And she was working solo at that time, which I don't fucking know--she did that for six months. 11, 12, 16 I work solo for like three days if she is on vacation and I'm like, ""I'm going to die."" 16 So we had set up the time for me to come in-- SA:  Do you know what year this is about? 12, 14 JD: This is early 2015.  So yeah I came in and she had a couple of people in the lobby. 9, 11 She was busy doing other stuff, and I later found out she just wanted to see how I would interact on the fly, you know. 6, 12, 15, 18 SA: Wow.  [laughs] 15 I came in and she was like, ""Uh, go keep those folks busy."" 12, 15 And it was a group of young Native girls. 7, 11 They were obviously pretty high on what I assume--what I think is meth, actually, and they were just coloring and talking and having a good time. 6, 7, 10 So I just--I don't really treat clients any differently than I treat my friends. 10, 16, 18, 20 I mean there's some shit I wouldn't tell them. 18 But beyond that I just walked up to them and was like, ""How's it going man? 16 What are you coloring?  What are you doing today?"" 16 Just making convo. 10 So Maggie kind of saw me do that.  So the ad said degree preferred, but I had almost ten years of experience working with mental illness and chemical dependency and harm reduction stuff, so I had some really solid letters of recommendation, and she saw me interact with those guys. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 I guess she had interviewed like ten people maybe, and I'm sure several of them had degrees. 5, 9 So, I don't know. 12 She offered me the job and here I am. 5, 11, 20 SA: Was your use ever to the point where you had to go to treatment? 6, 12, 13 JD: I did go to treatment as a youngin because they didn't know where to put me anymore. 12, 13 So I didn't really need treatment at that point in my life. 10, 12, 13, 18 It was just the place to put me.  The state put me in a place because it was convenient.  Which, funny enough, so I was seventeen when they did that to me. 9 I was, I don't know, I think I left in like two weeks. 12, 14, 15 I'm not trying to get up in the morning.  I don't want to go to no fucking group that I don't need to go to.  And I don't want your shitty breakfast. 18 [laughs] 15 No thanks, 11 no thanks, 11 no thanks. 11 So they didn't really like me. 18 And then so minors in treatment--but I shouldn't be smoking cigarettes, so they kicked me out for using tobacco as a minor on their grounds. 6, 12, 13 How they kicked me out they were like you have a half hour to figure out how you are getting yourself--and it was from Cloquet to Duluth. 14, 15 I don't drive. 5 [laughs] 15 And so they were like you have thirty minutes to figure out a ride or a sheriff can come pick you up. 15 I was like that sounds fucking terrible. 11, 18 So I ended up calling my ex that I was with for five years at the time and she was in high school. 7, 14, 16 And at the time I obviously didn't sound like this, so I called her high school and talked to the secretary and I was like, ""Yeah this is her aunt so-and-so. 7, 14 There's a family emergency."" 12 So they went and got her and I was like you better come pick me up right now or a cop is going to pick me up."" 12 I don't know how she did it, but she made it from Superior to Cloquet in like twenty minutes. 12, 15 So that was rad.  [laughs] 15 But yeah, so that was an unnecessary adventure.  But there were periods of time in my life where I was using a lot of opiates. 6, 10, 18 I have experienced withdrawal. 5, 18 I have experienced just not liking who I was and what was going on in my life. 10, 18 I think a lot of that probably had to do with the crowd I was hanging out with too.  I had a lot of friends who were IV using. 6, 16, 20 I'm really thankful that I never did because I probably would not be sitting here because drugs are fun. 5, 6, 11, 16, 18 They make you feel good. 10 If I liked snorting pills or smoking them off tin foil or whatever I'm sure I would have loved injecting them. 6, 13, 14 So I'm glad I didn't choose to do that because I would have been lost or dead. 11, 14, 16 SA: Do you want to just go through what you do here?  Or what a normal day looks like if there's such a thing as a normal day. 16 [laughs] 15 [laughs] 15 That's a cute question.  There is not a normal day. 16 Every single day of my life is different, which I really appreciate. 10, 16, 18 I have a lot of friends who do the same monotonous thing all day every day. 16, 20 That's just not for me.  So what I do here is syringe exchange or syringe access. 9, 10 I do HIV testing.  I do Hep C testing.  I do Narcan training and give out Narcan kits.  Really, I mean it's hard to describe what I do because I don't have any degrees in counseling or any degrees in anything, but I feel like daily I'm a counselor. 9, 19 I help people find housing. 6, 9 I don't know. 12 I had a guy come in and he's pretty seriously ill and he needed three bucks for his co-pay. 10, 11 So I gave him three bucks for his co-pay.  I really do just about anything that needs doing. 18 Sometimes there will be a young mom in here. 14 She's got her kid.  Maggie is really good with the young mom's, so I'll babysit the little kids. 10, 14, 18, 20 They look at my piercings like holy shit this guy! 18 I just try to interact. 18 Yeah, so really a lot of everything. 18 SA: Have you seen harm reduction change since you've been--you've been working with it for a long time. 5, 6, 14, 17 Through a lot of different places.  JD: I think one of the main things is that people are becoming more aware of it. 9 People are a lot more accepting of it, which I think is really necessary. 12, 18 One of the comparisons that Maggie likes to make that I really appreciate is sometimes when we do presentations we bring out a shot glass. 5, 10, 11, 18 We go, ""How many of you have used this in the mast month or the past six months?"" 6, 11, 13, 16 Most people raise their hands. 9, 17 Well, alcohol is a drug, and a shot glass is a way you administer the drug. 5, 6, 11, 18 It is a drug utensil. 5, 6 So why should we look at people who are using a different drug and they need a different utensil? 5, 6, 9 We are all altering our state of mind just in a different way. 18 So I think I'm seeing a lot of people coming around to that. 6, 9 Or people who have never heard of it and I explain it and they are cool with it. 9, 16, 17 Just,  ""Wow, I've never heard of that, but that's cool."" 9, 14, 16, 17 I guess when I first started doing this job I was talking to my grandparents about it and they were like, ""Wait, wait. 11, 14, 20 So you're giving syringes full of heroin to people?"" 9, 14, 16 And I was like, ""We do not have a budget like that!""  [laughs] 15 Right, like--I mean supervised injection and all that shit is really rad, I wish we could do that. 16, 18 Maybe some day. 16 But yeah, just taking them from a very ground level and being like, ""No, honey. 8, 11 [laughs] 15 I guess while I'm on this little tangent I'll talk about something that happened just recently. 15, 20 So I posted an article from December 2016 that was posted by NBC, so really mainstream--I find that sometimes when I post stuff like that on Facebook they are more receptive to it. 18 However, I totally post cowgirls riding syringes that say ""fuck safe shoot clean"" so there's a little bit of everything in between there. 7, 11, 20 But so the NBC article was 'overdoses now kill more Americans than car crashes.' 12 I had, I don't know, twenty-seven comments on that status from people all over my life. 9, 10, 12 One of which I was really surprised with. 18 We used to work together. 6, 8, 13, 16 He is religious and he is now a police officer. 8, 12 He was like, ""How can I get Narcan?  Do they sell it at CVS?  I really want this."" 18 And so I did not expect him to be open about it at all.  There's a shit load of positive comments between he and I. 12, 18 And then at two in the morning this fucking idiot that I used to work with at San Marco, so he's done harm reduction with alcoholics, comments and says, ""Well why do we give a fuck if drug addicts overdose?"" 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 Right.  And there's been people in my life that I've told this story to recently and most of them are supportive. 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 I'm part of an intersectional feminism group and I told them this story and it got a couple hundred likes and people were all over it. 5, 9, 11, 15, 16 So anyways he comments 12, 17, 18 ""Why do we give a fuck about drug addicts overdosing."" 5, 6, 14 So, I won't use his name, but I said, ""You know,"" and I tagged him in the comment, ""I want to write this big long thing and break it down for you, but we fucking work together doing harm reduction for people using alcohol, so I don't understand why you don't get it."" 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 Then last year, sometimes we'll browse Craig's List ads just kind of to--what's the fuck climate in Duluth? 14 What are places we could target for testing?  So I remembered last year I was browsing Craig's List and there was an ad titled 'tranny,' which is you know a horrible trans slur. 5, 10, 12, 14, 17 So it kind of irritated me, but I was curious because Duluth is so small. 14 I was like I kind of want to fuck with this person and get them to send me a face picture.  So I played them and I got them to send me a face picture.  Well it turns out it was the guy who commented 'why do we give a fuck about drug addicts.' 5, 6, 12, 14 So there's that back story. 15 So, yeah, 'you should get it, we've done harm reduction work together, also I know for a fact that you're cheating on' and I tagged his girlfriend's name. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 20 They live together, they've been for four years. 8, 14 I said I'm too tired right now. 5, 12 It's three in the morning, but hey girl let me know if you want that screenshot tomorrow.' 7, 11, 12 And I dug it up and I sent it to her and she broke up with him. 5, 8 So he could have just scrolled by, but his hate and his stigma for drug addicts was so strong that he felt the need at two in the morning to say why the fuck do we give a fuck about these human being dying! 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 19 SA: And differentiating them from alcoholics. 6 JD: Right!  And he is at the bar every single night.  I would feel comfortable saying he's an alcoholic as well. 6 So there was just something really satisfying about him trying say bullshit and I'm not terribly close to either of them, but I felt bad for his girlfriend ever since I have had that information, and it's a face picture of him with their dog. 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 20 And so that's what I sent--and it had the title of his ad and whatever. 5 And so he got that bomb dropped on his skull because he had to go be hateful for no reason. 5, 11 He could have kept scrolling and thought whatever thoughts he had to himself, and he still be in his relationship and everything would be find. 17, 18, 19 [laughs] 15 Karma rained on his skull!  I've since been unfriended and blocked. 10, 20 But his ex-girlfriend is still my friend. 7, 20 SA: Any stories that you feel comfortable sharing about clients that have come in that have really affected you? 9, 10, 18 JD: I have so many fucking stories. 9 One that always sticks out to me. 18 Young guy, early twenties.  He robbed a gas station and he stole a couple rolls of lottery tickets and cigarettes, whatever, and so he got caught and they just flew his fucking mug shot all over social media, all over the newspaper, just everywhere. 11, 15, 16, 19 He was booked.  He was there for only a couple of days. 11, 16 So he gets out and he came in and I could tell he was just like looking at the floor like really embarrassed or whatever. 14, 18 So I just walked up to him and like playfully tapped his arm and I was like, ""What up, Mr. Famous. 14, 16 And it made him giggle.  So he was able to kind of come out of his shell a little bit and he was able to ask for what he needed. 14, 20 And he overdosed and he died that weekend. 15 I know that at the end of his life he was experiencing some really hard stuff. 9, 10, 12, 18 And to have him feel comfortable enough to walk in here and have that happen to him, and be able to kind of-- SA: 15, 16 You made his day. 16 Yeah, yeah.  So that felt really good. 10, 11, 18 It's just so hard to think of like individual stories. 9 One thing I guess I'll say though is I live like three blocks from the exchange here, and so people see me all over all the time. 6, 9, 10 It's really cool because a lot of people are really comfortable talking to me in public, and they talk to me like I'm their friend. 9, 17, 18, 19, 20 I can walk down the street and say, ""Hey man, how's it going?"" 16 And talk about the Wild game, talk about my dog, or whatever they did last night.  Another thing that's been interesting working here is you know Duluth is small and I know a lot, a lot of people. 9, 12, 17 I've had friends of mine come in here--people I've known, and one of them is just like--well one, came in, saw my face, turned around and walked out. 9, 11, 12, 16, 20 Facebook messaged me and came back a few days later. 14, 16 Then another friend of mine came in and we just had a long discussion and I was able to hook her up with stuff and she was just really thankful that I didn't judge her. 11, 14, 17, 18, 20 Obviously I would never speak to anybody about that. 16 That's her business.  She, you know, she probably thinks I saw I wouldn't judge you to her face because I'm trying to make her feel good or something but I'm sitting here talking to you and you don't fucking know her and I don't judge her at all. 10, 12, 17 I'm happy she came in and talked to me and was comfortable coming in to get stuff and is using clean stuff. 6, 14, 18 That's good. 10 Like I said there're just so many clients. 10 Anything you wish you could do here and can't because you just don't get enough funding?  Any way you'd like to see this move in the future? 6, 15, 18 JD: There're only two hundred and twenty exchanges in the country. 6, 10, 19 I wish that there was more access for people who use drugs. 5, 6, 9, 13 I wish that there were more places like this so I could talk to people who do the work I do because that's one thing that's really hard about doing this work is, you know, I can talk to my partner about it. 9, 12, 18 My partner has a really long title, I can't exactly remember it, but they're the GLBT director at the University of Minnesota Duluth. 9, 17, 18, 19 So I can talk to them, but what we do for a living is very different.  My day has often started before I have my first sip of coffee with somebody coming and being like, ""I need Narcan. 14, 16 My friend died last night. 20 I brought him back to life. 10 Oh my god."" 11 So I'm holding space for that person before--I'm not even awake.  I don't have coffee with me.  I just unlocked the door.  I've barely got the lights on.  So I can unpack that with my partner and they are fucking fantastic, you know, they are really kind and understanding and listen to me. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 But it would be a world of difference if I could call the harm reduction center in West Duluth and say, ""Hey, you know how this goes. 5, 12, 14 Can we meet up for coffee sometime this evening and just unpack this."" 18 Especially with client deaths or really traumatic client stuff. 10, 18 So I'm super grateful for Maggie. 16 Yes, we are co-workers, but Maggie is my family. 12, 19 I call her mom-dad. 14 That's my name for her.  We are there for each other through a lot.  We are able to talk to each other in a way that most people who work together can't just because of the intimate work that we do. 8, 9, 18 So that's really valuable. 18 SA: Is there any place like this anywhere nearby? 8 It's across the bridge in Superior.  They have a syringe exchange. 10 It's AIDS Resource Center Wisconsin.  There is one staff member that works at that location. 9 And she also does HIV case management for positive clients in six northern Wisconsin counties. 8, 10, 12, 17 So she's almost never there. 16 And then as with anybody in the world we all don't get along and whatever. 17 I don't feel like her and I click.  I would never call her and talk to her about anything. 16 We see each other at World AIDS Day, and we see each other at Pride. 6 We have our friendly small talk. 20 I don't want to talk to her about my shit. 18 No thanks. 11 But it would be cool if there were people I felt comfortable talking to. 9, 11, 17 And people that I could bounce stuff off of or whatever. 9 Or just get their tips and tricks about this stuff because I've been doing this for a long time, but I'm not perfect. 17 Harm reduction work is--you don't have much time to think. 5, 14 It's a lot of on the fly reacting.  I have to be different with every person.  Even tone and the way I say things. 18 If some rowdy guys come in I have to be like, ""Hey guys, one at a time.  You need to go back and sit there.  You can come up it's your turn.""  Whereas maybe the next minute I have a young, single mom come in and she's crying. 5, 14, 15 So when she comes in maybe I'll go up there and offer her kid a coloring book. 5, 14 I'm kind of softer with her and I'm like, ""Hey, want to come up?  What's going on today? 16 You look upset.  I've got some cookies.  I've got some hot tea.""  You know? 12 So you really just have to know how to interact with people in different ways very quickly. 9, 12, 18 And I can oftentimes have those interactions back to back. 18 I really have to be mindful of myself, too because if I'm having a fucking shit day and someone comes in I need to be able to hold that space for them and put my own shit aside because the way I serve them could determine a lot about what they are going to do in that day. 9, 16, 17, 18 I need to be mindful that I just need to be a certain way sometimes. 14, 17, 18 Which, you know, I often on the weekends like to drink beer, go hiking, play with my dog, be with my friends. 5, 12, 15, 16, 20 I have to do the stuff I love. 14 Being a native Duluthian I am always doing something in Lake Superior. 14, 18 I have already been kayaking this year, which was frigid. 14 I went underneath the lift bridge in between the canal--in between the piers.  A fucking big boat was coming out.  A big thousand footer.  I was with a friend I was like, ""Rachel I'm going to die!"" 20 She was like, ""Just keep paddling, Dory.  Just keep paddling.""  So I wave my paddle in the air and I'm like, ""I hope you see me giant ship!"" 6, 9 Try not to tip and die in this current.  The water was super cold. 16 The surface temp right now is like thirty-seven degrees. 12 And she--so my friend is tiny so all her life jackets are mediums, so I'm like it's on the kayak and I'll grab it, but I'm not wearing that! 10, 20 So, yeah.  I definitely have to find ways to relax and just kind of decompress in my life, which I'm pretty excellent at given my own trauma. 9, 10, 14, 18 I know stuff that I've had to deal with and apply that. 12 I've had to be a grown up for a lot longer than most people my age. 9, 10, 17 SA: Do you see any difference between Minneapolis--the cities--versus up here in Duluth? 6, 7 Are you in contact with anyone down there?  JD: I've talked to some people who do similar stuff down there, but they're busy as fuck. 9, 15 We're busy as fuck. 15 So we see each other at conferences or trainings, but I won't get a change to really know them. 6, 12, 18 I don't really go to the cities that often. 7, 18 Everybody is like, ""Ooh, the cities!"" 7 I go there for sports.  I go there for concerts.  I go there for work.  But it's big.  It's full of people. 9, 14 There's no grass.  Where would my dog pee?  So that's just--I really like being in the woods and being away from people. 9, 18, 20 I don't really care to go there. 18, 19 SA: Anything else we didn't talk about that you want to bring up?  Anything before we wrap up?  JD: It's been a log day. 16 It's been a long week. 15, 17 So, I think--I probably said a lot.  SA: A lot of great things. 20 Thank you so much.  JD: Yeah, thank you. 11"
"5","Brunner_Emily","Stephanie Devich Narrator Zachary Malett Interviewer May 1, 2017 Stephanie Devich—SD Zachary Malett—ZM ZM: I just need you to say your name and say you're okay being recorded.  SD: Sure.  This is Stephanie Devich, and yes, I'm okay with being recorded.  ZM: So where Amy has historically started is just talking a little bit about you. 20 A question she likes to start with is what was your childhood like? 14, 20 SD: [laughs] 15 My childhood. 14, 20 I grew up here in Minnesota. 20 I grew up in Minnetonka. 20 Only child. 14 Parents were together, and no communication in my home. 8 We just didn't talk about anything.  So when I started using alcohol at the age of thirteen dad kept that hidden from mom when I got caught. 6, 14 And he never said a word to her. 16 He just cleaned up the vomit.  [laughs] 15 So I learned early on if mom doesn't find out think are okay, and how to keep a secret. 10, 14 From there it just, for me it was drug abuse after that. 5, 6, 13 I went on to weed, pot, or LSD, PCP, mushrooms, and kind of continued on. 6, 14 I graduated from out here, but I was high on graduation day. 7, 16 [laughs] 15 Yeah I was on PCP when I walked. 16 So, yeah.  My childhood, you know, no abuse. 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 Some verbal abuse and such, but my family history on my mom's side definitely a lot of mental health and drug addiction problems. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 All on my mom's side. 9, 14 ZM: Where you aware of this when you started experimenting, or not? 12 SD: No. Saw it later on.  I noticed it with my mother.  I recognized it now that she had a problem with alcohol. 6, 12, 17 Her mother definitely, and I know my aunt had prescription painkillers were her thing for many years. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 So she's part of the opiate problem. 9, 12 ZM: What happened after graduation? 15 SD: After graduation a few years later I moved to southern California. 7, 14, 15 I had done some traveling to San Diego and decided after we had that Halloween blizzard. 14 You're probably too young to know about that one. 8, 12 [laughs] 15 But in like 1991 where we got hit with like a foot of snow and I decided to get the hell out of here so moved the day after Christmas that year and moved to San Diego, but all I did was bring my own stuff with me, for the most part, so it was just me bringing my problems and unhappiness along with me and started using methamphetamine out there. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 Got very much into using whatever was in front of me. 6 It did not end well for me in California.  [laughs] 15 California  I have six felony convictions from living out there.  Sales charge, transportation of narcotics, went to prison for a couple years in California. 11, 14, 17 Got out of prison June 30th, 2009.  Moved back home on parole [unclear] in Minnesota. 10 I was on parole here because they transferred me up here and California parole ninety days later I moved back out here. 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17 Got off parole after a year. 10, 14 Started using again. 6 Crack cocaine was my thing. 16 I tried heroin. 16 Did opiates for a little while. 20 It wasn't really my thing. 18 I definitely liked the upper thing. 9 Crack cocaine, needle abuse, like everything. 6, 10, 13, 16 I overdosed on cocaine. 14, 16 Died.  Wound up in a hospital ICU for several days. 8, 16 Woke up in handcuffs.  Went to prison from there.  ZM: That was back here?  SD: That was back in California and then moved back up here. 7, 15 Then moved back out here shortly after I got out of prison. 7, 15, 18 Did a couple of years in the prison system in California where they set you up to fail. 11, 14 Send you with two hundred dollars gate money when you get out of prison and nowhere to go. 8, 10, 12 [laughs] 15 As a drug addict and a drug dealer there's only, you know, I don't really have too many options of things to do. 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 So, I tried to get out here as fast as possible and move back out here and started using about a year later again. 6, 14, 15 And put myself in treatment. 12, 13 While I was in treatment I applied for school, and wanted to become a drug and alcohol counselor. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18 [laughs] 15 Figured who better! 5 All based on a journal I had written in prison and I was reading it while I was in prison and one of my goals was to become a counselor and I thought, sure, why not? 13, 17, 18 So since then I have my license in alcohol and drug counseling from Metro State. 5, 6, 13, 19 Bachelor's from there as well as a certified prevention professional, and have been working at Valhalla Place for two and a half years after working somewhere else a little bit. 10, 14, 19, 20 So I've been in the field going on four years now I think with internships and everything. 12, 14 ZM: Great.  [laughs] 15 ZM: You've only been working for four years, but what do you see? 6, 14 SD: What do I see? 6 I guess where I really started to notice things in, you know, I saw this in California when I was living there because I was selling drugs out of a house holder. 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, 20 It was like a low-income kind of housing thing where a lot of people were getting medications. 6, 9, 10, 14 So they were trading their medications for cocaine. 14, 16 And so they would trade me oxycontin, things like that.  And I would take that, trade them crack for it, and go and sell the opiate medications to somebody else that would go and sell them to rich, affluent housewives in [Loyola], California area which is pretty affluent. 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16 So I saw it back then and how it was really affecting people, but I saw more of the upper class people using it. 6, 7, 9, 18 Heroin wasn't really something I saw too much of. 18 I used heroin for about a month when I lived in California because it was just what was out there for the time, but it was black tar back then. 6, 7, 13, 16 But I remember the friends I used with having to need it on a daily basis getting sick, and us having to drive around just to get ten dollars worth of heroin. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16, 20 And slapping people around. 9 The old way of trying to reverse an overdose. 18 Throwing them in my bathtub in cold water, and things like that. 16 Trying to bring them back.  And luckily that apparently worked. 20 [laughs] 15 Because it really doesn't. 18 So I saw it out there, but I guess I started to see it more when I came into the field, and in my internships a few years back that more and more people were coming in for opiate use. 6, 9, 13, 14 For treatment. 12, 13 And I think that's when my harm reduction stance changed, because I went into treatment where it was like abstinence based. 5, 12, 13, 14 That's the only thing that's going to work for you and if you don't do those things you're going to die.  That kind of stuff.  Those were like the messages I heard from going to those meetings. 9, 18 And I stopped going because I didn't want to live in fear the rest of my life. 10 I had lived in fear all my life as it is. 7, 10 And I just thought if this is what I have to do forever, and the other thing is like meditation and some of this other stuff isn't good enough. 10, 17, 18 I don't want to do that.  It didn't make sense to me.  So I stopped the NA thing years ago and started implementing harm reduction in my own life. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 I drink alcohol. 5, 6 But I don't use drugs. 5, 6, 13 I just can't use illicit drugs because I don't do them well, or I do them too well depending on how you want to look at it. 5, 6, 13 [laughs] 15 I've had enough of those.  I'm still around luckily.  But I think I saw in my internship like I said was that I had a lot of clients coming in that weren't willing, or weren't ready to stop using everything. 6, 10 And so I was referring people to places like Minnesota Alternatives, which is more of a harm reduction program. 5, 9, 14 I don't know if you've heard about that. 9, 12 I heard of Minnesota Alternatives. 9, 14 I went to a conference out here called MAARCH [Minnesota Association of Resources for Recovery and Chemical Health] years ago early on in school. 7, 13, 14 Paula DeSanto is the owner, former owner I believe of Minnesota Alternatives, which is like a harm reduction based program where they teach people how to lessen their use. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14 Because if I don't want to quit drinking completely, but I want to learn how to drink three alcohol drinks a night, or whatever it is and be successful that's how they work instead of kicking them out of treatment because you haven't stopped. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 And so it had a lot of people coming in that just weren't ready to stop all drugs. 5, 6, 9 And for me to set them up into my program or to an inpatient program knowing that they're going to need to use and they're just going to get kicked out made no sense to me. 6, 12, 13 So I was referring outside of the company I worked for [laughs]. 14, 15 I was like it's not about my treatment; it's about their success. 12, 13 So I decided to look into a different realm, and wanted to do something that was more harm reduction and methadone was really interesting to me. 5, 6, 8, 14, 17, 18 I kept seeing like I said more and more clients coming in that had either been on methadone or were using heroin or prescription pain killers who had lost a ton of people in their lives based from overdose, and I just thought this is where I need to be. 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 And came to Valhalla Place two and a half years ago now almost. 12, 13, 14 What else do you want to know? 12 What am I seeing now? 6, 12 ZM: Could you just describe more of what you do at Valhalla?  And what Valhalla does?  SD: Absolutely.  Valhalla is a medically assisted treatment program, so we provide methadone or Suboxone to patients that are opiate dependent for at least one year. 7, 12, 13, 14 So they have to have been abusing an opiate for a year prior to even being eligible for our program. 6, 14 ZM: Is that like regular—daily, weekly? 15 SD: You know, it depends on the person. 12, 15 So whether it was something they were maybe originally getting prescribed, and they're supposed to take three of them a day and now they're taking maybe six or eight or ten. 5, 10, 11, 12, 16 But they're seeing withdrawal symptoms when they don't have them. 5, 6 Or if it was heroin on the streets. 5, 16 Things like that based on use, and not being able to use as prescribed. 6, 10, 13 Or if it's illicit use and having withdrawal if they don't have their substance around. 5, 6, 13 We can come in and help them with giving them methadone, Suboxone, which can eliminate the withdrawal and the cravings so they don't have to use those substances anymore. 5, 6, 8, 13 ZM: And the year cut-off—is that just an arbitrary line? 9, 14, 20 It's kind of a weird line that's drawn in the sand that, you know, now it's kind of hard because there are people that will call that are at eleven months, but they just don't qualify for the program. 5, 9, 11, 12, 16 I believe that's federal. 8 Like a federal guideline that there's this magical number that a year I have to have been abusing these things. 6, 8, 9, 14 Even though some people can do a lot of damage in six months. 9, 11, 16 Especially now with what's out there. 12 They just wouldn't be able to qualify for the medication. 14 Their insurance won't, and they're not appropriate for treatment here, which sucks. 12, 13 ZM: Do you see people attempting to fabricate— SD: 6, 9 Yes, oh absolutely.  ZM: How do you tell?  SD: Absolutely.  Every now and then we will see people who come in—because we do a screening process with everybody whether it's over the phone, or they physically come in here. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 A lot of times, especially in certain communities, the Native communities especially some of the reservations where they don't have treatment options. 12, 13, 17, 19 They really don't have the resources out there. 18 We will sometimes see families trying to come in, or sending their family members here, and they go through the screening process and you can kind of tell they've been coached on what to say. 6, 12, 17 But if you word things differently, and I've been trained enough to—and being a former...when every word that came out of my mouth was a lie in the past, I'm pretty good at seeing when people are not telling me entirely the truth, or don't know what to say. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 So I can word things a little bit differently. 20 There have been times in the past where I've done a chemical health assessment on them first to just kind of get what they've been using, get some more information versus just the screening process of it. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 And they haven't been coached enough for that.  So then I can see, you know, you're not going to qualify for our program. 6, 12 I think the bigger idea hopefully is that they're family or somebody is trying to get them in here so that maybe they can get the medication for another family that can't get here, or doesn't have the insurance, but for us to admit somebody that doesn't need this program, all we're doing is opening a door to something that's going to cause more harm. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Especially if they're an opiate naive person or not, using opiates to start them on methadone or Suboxone is just going to...cause an addiction problem they didn't have. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 We do a little bit of things around that. 20 For the most part I think people are calling because they know it works, and they don't want to do this anymore. 9, 12, 16 We answer our phone here twenty-four hours a day. 8, 15, 16 If the phone rings and somebody's trying to get in here on a Sunday night and they qualify for our program we'll try to get them in on Monday or Tuesday morning and get them their medication, and start them with counseling here. 8, 14, 16, 19 So, my job here is a counselor here. 11 I am an LADC, licensed alcohol and drug counselor. 5, 6, 13 I'm also a certified prevention professional through the Minnesota board out here as well. 10, 19 But I still created a new job a year and a half ago or so here, so I'm like the harm reduction specialist is my title [laughs]. 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 Sort of that I made up.  I saw a need in the community, not only in our facility, but outside of here where people weren't getting Naloxone. 8, 9, 14, 19 They didn't have the education; not understanding why medication assisted treatment is so beneficial for opiate addiction. 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Colleges, even the colleges I went to—we didn't talk about methadone or Suboxone. 7, 8 We didn't talk about harm reduction in school. 5, 7, 14 It was like a five minute little thing. 15, 20 I see how beneficial it is right now especially with what's going on in the state. 6, 12 That there's a huge need for education out there, so I've spent my own free time educating myself as much as possible. 14, 15 Going to conferences, flying to San Diego last year for the harm reduction conference. 5, 14 Just trying to get as much information as there is on harm reduction services, be it there's more than just needle exchanges. 5, 6, 10, 14, 19 I spend probably about forty percent of my time outside of my office doing Narcan trainings throughout the state. 10 We are the largest provider of Naloxone in the state of Minnesota. 8 ZM: Valhalla?  We dispense, last year, over six thousand kits I believe. 14 We provide Minnesota AIDS Project with their Narcan.  Rural Action AIDS Network.  I've been working with Little Earth, the Native American community over in South Minneapolis for about a year and a half now. 12, 14, 19 I used to sneak in Narcan through people I knew lived there, and teaching them how to reverse an opiate overdose, but the tribe at the time wouldn't really let it happen. 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18 I couldn't actually go do a training for the community. 7, 19 We just kept sneaking it in because people were dropping like flies. 5, 9, 11 They were overdosing daily over there and nobody was doing anything about it, and the community was begging for help. 19 I've got friends who live there, I've got a lot of clients over there. 10, 16, 20 I really have a great passion for the Native American community. 18, 19, 20 So, over the past year or so I've probably donated four hundred, five hundred kits to Little Earth. 14 Last year—reported to me, not 911 calls, because they don't call 911 too often—we had eighty-six opiate reversals. 13, 14, 16 I only know of a few deaths over there so far. 12, 18 It has made a huge difference.  There're certain areas in Minnesota, especially the rural areas, but some of the poorer areas, where they don't have the services and no one is doing anything about it. 8, 17, 19, 20 And Little Earth is one of those places that I think just continues to get the short end of the stick because they don't have the resources. 18 And they're a poorer community. 19 They're all Section 8 GRH [group residential housing], so low-income housing. 6, 9, 10, 13 Just in the neighborhood the park is infested with needles. 10, 20 People are actively using and overdosing all over the place. 6 It's just—something's got to give.  So I try to give as much of my time to them as possible because nobody should have to die from this shit. 18 ZM: Succinctly put.  SD: Yes, yes.  ZM: I just had a follow-up about Valhalla. 10 Who funds it?  SD: Minnesota is amazing. 9 We are really lucky in this state because treatment is funded through most insurance companies. 8, 10, 12, 13, 18 So, whether somebody is straight Medical Assistance and they don't even have a provider yet, if they're straight Medical Assistance whatever county they're in will pick up the tab. 14, 19 We fill out some paperwork, have them sign some stuff, I do a chemical health assessment on them, I shoot it over to whatever county they're in, and say hey, they need methadone or Suboxone, will you pay for it? 5, 11, 12, 13, 19 And they'll sign off on it. 11 The counties will pay for it.  If they do have state insurance, say Medica or Blue Care through the state based on low income that will pay for it. 10, 13, 14 If they're private insured most times that pays for it. 5 Sometimes there's co-pays.  And every now and then you get people that don't have an insurance even though we're supposed to and they'll pay out of pocket. 9, 12 But if they're low-income or no-income we cannot take their money. 8, 10 We have to fill out the forms and do the stuff to make sure their county will pay for it. 5, 19 We can't legally take somebody's money that doesn't have the capabilities. 8, 10 It's like twenty-two thousand dollars a year, which— ZM: And I'm assuming anyone working here wouldn't—even if it wasn't a requirement. 12, 14 So we just kind of go through the rigmarole to get them whatever coverage they need to get the methadone or Suboxone. 6, 8, 10 Methadone for sure will be covered by all providers. 5 Suboxone—it just depends because it's more expensive. 8, 15 And so then the county won't pay for it. 19 [laughs] 15 So, there are certain barriers. 17 Like especially Hennepin County, that's the county we're in, the largest county in Minnesota, and they will not pick up the tab for Suboxone. 8, 19 ZM: What's the price?  SD: Methadone costs about eighteen dollars a day. 16 Nine dollar difference, or so.  But if you figure on how many people are currently in treatment, and maybe how many people they're funding—thousands and thousands of dollars. 5, 9, 12, 13 You know? 12 Residential treatment program, thirty days—if people are sending people to there they're shelling out eight grand a month. 9, 12, 13, 16 Year's worth of dosing.  If they're paying for that for a year or even six months you're looking at three, four, five, six thousand dollars. 11, 14, 16 You times that by however many are in treatment. 12, 13 In our clinic alone I think we have about eleven hundred clients just in this clinic alone active dosing right now. 8, 10, 12 Valhalla is the largest provider of medicated assisted treatment in the state of Minnesota. 12, 13, 14 And there are seventeen programs in Minnesota.  We have currently now four. 12 We were recently merged with Meridian Behavior Health.  So Alliance was another methadone clinic that's now ours. 6, 8, 12 And then Pinnacle up in Brainerd is now ours as well. 12 So they're all turning into Valhalla's. 20 Valhalla is—I'll give you a background of Valhalla's because the story is awesome. 15 [laughs] 15 Valhalla is Norse mythology, but it's basically the fight between good and evil. 10, 19 Our former owner was a patient on methadone at another clinic.  He was a business owner, had a tremendous amount of finances and things, and just didn't like how he was treated at the other clinic that he was at. 12, 14 So he had missed an appointment with his business partner and he was supposed to fly out to Arizona and was late for their meeting. 9, 12, 18 When he got there she was like, ""This is baloney. 8 We can't keep doing this.  This is a hassle.  What do you want to do?""  He said, ""I want to open my own clinic.""  And so that's how we were built.  We were built on somebody that gets addiction because they've been there. 12, 14 Understands methadone, and had an opiate problem, which I think makes us different than a lot of other places because we're really about the client. 10, 12, 18 We're about the people, the person. 9 ZM: If you could in more detail describe your experience in treatment versus the treatment at Valhalla. 12, 13, 18 SD: I think—my experience as a client in the past? 10, 18 I've gone to treatment in California on a couple of occasions. 11, 12, 13 I think three maybe? 5 My experience out there was that I was the same as everybody else. 18 We all did the same stuff.  Nobody asked me questions about my history, or maybe trauma, abuse, things that I had been through. 5, 6, 13, 15 It was cookie-cutter treatment. 12, 13 We all did step one, two, and three.  It was a lot of abstinence-based for sure. 13 ZM: Was it like Minnesota Model, twelve-step?  SD: Minnesota Model for sure.  Absolutely.  But, they throw around words now and you hear 'client-centered' or 'client focused' or whatever it is, and that wasn't really the case. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 So I never got treatment that was catered to what I needed. 5, 12, 13, 16 I got treatment that was catered to what people thought I needed. 5, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18 And they thought I needed the same treatment as the next guy right next to me. 12, 13, 17, 18 And that doesn't make sense because we've all got our own story. 15 And the same expectation that I've got to quit everything right now. 12 That's a lot of pressure because if I look at it and I had had a magic medication to get me off of crack cocaine because there's minimal physical, a lot of mental that came with it, but I still got to smoke some weed along side of it I might have been like, okay, I can do that. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 But that wasn't an option.  You get kicked out.  You use and they kick you out to the curb. 6, 13 And what else am I going to do?  I'm going to go to the same thing I've always done. 18 I'm going to pick up again and continue to use. 6, 13 My experience out here I think was a little bit different, but I think it was because I was different. 18, 20 And I think I was ready to do something different.  I realized where the ball had been missed in the past and went and like [unclear] and said, this is what I need.  And told them the things that I had been through because I knew those were certain things that I know if I didn't work on I would get help on them and really put forth a different effort. 12, 16, 17, 18 Although, the programs I went to were still Minnesota Model for the most part. 9 ZM: Right, so it required a change in your attitude. 5, 14 SD: I think so.  I think a lot of it was because I was ready.  I don't think necessarily that a person has to—I think that people can still be successful if they're per say mandated to treatment because it's jail or probation that's making them go. 9, 10, 12, 13 I mean the choice is still theirs because unless they're in a locked facility they can walk out. 6, 16 There's still, even back then on probation you're required to go to treatment pretty much every time. 5, 10, 12, 13 It's not that I didn't learn anything. 10 I still remember some of the things I learned. 10 I just probably wasn't there at that time, but I didn't feel like an individual.  I just felt like a number. 11 And being from the prison system I didn't really need to be another number. 18 I'm cool on that. 17 ZM: Right, so that was mandated out in the state of California? 13 ZM: Something that I'm currently interested in and researching is just were those costs borne by the state of California? 14 SD: Yeah, California paid for those things there.  They have something called Prop 36, which funds for treatment and it comes with like the criminal justice system somehow gets it out of that. 8, 12, 13 [laughs] 15 So those were all paid for.  ZM: Were those treatment courts? 12, 13 SD: I did not do drug court. 5, 6 Drug court out there is different than drug court in Minnesota. 5, 6 Drug court out there you're mandated to. 13 They choose you to go to drug court. 5, 6 Drug court in Minnesota—you choose to go to drug court. 5, 6 I sat in courts at times in California when I was waiting to go to probation and out there is was extremely shaming if you had came in a couple minutes late to court you were handcuffed immediately. 11, 15 You were arrested if you'd missed dates. 13 If you used you were incarcerated for thirty days. 6, 13, 16 When I've sat in on drug courts and worked with my clients even on drug courts out here it is so uplifting and supportive where the clients choose to be in this program. 5, 6, 10, 14, 19 For one, they know how long the program it is, so they say, yeah, I want to do this. 12, 17 Even if they pick up, they use, they relapse, whatever it is they don't get kicked out. 6, 13 They don't get arrested.  They continue to work with the team of the people they have. 9 They are like, what did you miss?  What do you need?  When they graduated I've seen the judges come out from behind their chambers and give them tokens and certificates and hug them and treat them like they're real people. 6, 7, 9 You don't see that super disconnect and that power differential out here as you did in California. 6, 16, 17 It's just something that if I had a choice between that and Minnesota I might have been more successful a lot faster. 6 ZM: So in Minnesota it's not contingent on sobriety? 12 SD: Not necessarily.  Yes, they want you to be sober, but you're not necessarily going to go back to jail.  ZM: Right.  My understanding of treatment court was if you break sobriety you're incarcerated. 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 If you continue, yes.  But out here they will work with you on certain things. 17 Maybe you need to do treatment. 12, 13 Maybe outpatient isn't enough so they'll continue to monitor these things and what's going on with you. 11 Then they earn phases and things like that.  Then I believe at the end of their time their record is expunged.  Which is great. 20 [laughs] 15 If you've got some charges on you like I do that would be great to have that stuff disappear. 20 It's really empowering here in like how the clientele moves up. 10, 15, 17, 18 In certain phases they have to write a letter on why they think they've earned that phase increase for drug court and why they shouldn't have to come to court as often or whatever the phase increase stipulates. 5, 6, 17 Yeah, out here it's just completely different.  It's about the person.  Everybody's different, and I think that we've missed the mark, especially the Minnesota Model. 5 I think that they've just thought that everybody is the same, and addiction is all the same, and it's really not. 12, 14, 17, 18 There's some brain chemistry and science behind it and genetics and things like that, but the stuff we go through in active addiction isn't the same as what the next person went through. 12, 13, 14, 15 Even if our story is exactly the same how I perceive it and how somebody else does can be two totally different things. 15 I think we've missed out on specializing on certain things and having more involvement when it comes to trauma, and being more open to even the THC thing. 12, 17 If you smoke weed you get kicked out.  I think we need to be more open minded, and that's why Valhalla I think it completely different.  Even if you're still actively using you don't necessarily get kicked out of here. 6 We'll work with you.  We've got a 'it depends' model. 15 [laughs] 15 There's a lot of 'it depends' here. 15 Ideally we ask for one source of opiate, so that means us.  If you're choosing to get your medication from us that means you cannot be picking up prescriptions from another provider. 10, 14 So we will check to make sure.  We'll run their names in a prescription monitoring program [PMP] to make sure they're not picking up opiates from a provider. 8, 10, 16, 18 Things like that.  ZM: Is that a statewide network?  SD: Prescription monitoring is actually a program that actually is all over the United States. 7, 18 Anybody can use it. 6, 13 Anybody can run a PMP on somebody. 8 Any provider.  You need to have some credentials. 5, 9, 14 But any doctor, any prescriber can run somebody's name to see if they've been picking up prescriptions or whatever it is. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 ZM: That was post oxycontin bullshit? 18 SD: Yes.  So now a lot of states are mandating that if they are going to write a prescription for an opiate that they run a PMP on somebody. 8, 10, 12 Minnesota does not have that.  It is still an option.  We do it anyway. 18 But the average prescriber doesn't necessarily do that and then we have a lot of shoddy prescribers out here. 10 ZM: Still?  SD: There are still some out there, yeah, absolutely.  There are some names that we see and we're like, oh we cringe when we see they are picking up a prescription from somebody. 6, 10, 16 Some of the pain clinics, some of the prescribers out there still definitely need to the DEA pay them a visit sometime in the near future. 6, 9, 10 The difference with us is that we don't necessarily kick you out based on elicit use. 6, 13 If the opiate thing still isn't working maybe we'll refer you to a higher level of care, which could mean outpatient on top of working with us here going to like groups. 5, 7, 11, 12, 17, 19 We have an outpatient they would attend for like three times a week for nine hours total. 11, 15 If that's not working maybe we do look at residential treatment, but that doesn't mean you stop here. 5, 9, 12, 13 You still work with us.  You still get your medications. 14 ZM: This is medication and some counseling at Valhalla? 14, 19 SD: Yes.  So, federally, methadone clinics are required to do counseling. 5, 8, 14, 19 It's not just what I've been called, a legal drug dealer. 5, 6 They think the clients just come in here and get their medications, walk out, and there's no treatment involved. 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 They are required for the first fourteen weeks to meet with their counselor for at least fifty minutes a week. 5, 14, 15, 18 We do a creative treatment plan with them, we do a chemical health assessment, or a Rule 25, on them just to get a baseline and see where they're at. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 If funding were to drop we have that done. 5, 11 We can shoot that off to the county. 19 And then we update them yearly to kind of see where they're at and where changes have been made. 6, 13, 14 After the first ten to fourteen weeks they're required by the federal law to meet with us for at least one time a month for fifty minutes. 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 If they are willing to do that, then yes, you can earn a spot up in here as long as you qualify in the other areas, too. 6, 8, 17, 20 You have to have counseling with it. 19 There's a reason why we use. 6, 13 There's a lot more to it than that.  We do provide the counseling and there're groups and a lot of other things here that they can get. 12, 19 Mental health services, and such, as well from us if they want to do that. 19 We don't freak on THC.  For us, clients can continue to smoke their pot. 6, 10 ZM: Does it even come in any kind of chemical analysis? 13, 14 We do do drug screens on them, and it will show on that. 5, 6 Obviously if the county is picking up for the treatment costs here sometimes they have a problem with it. 12, 13, 19 If the THC use is not interfering with their life—I think sometimes the county people that maybe don't spend a day in a clinic such as this don't realize that for us—most of these clients aren't sitting smoking bongs everyday, and I think a lot of times that's they're perception. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 16, 19 Somebody that may have THC in their system.  But for us I see a client that may have walked in here on day one with a two gram a day IV use habit of heroin that six months later maybe has used twice. 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 16, 20 But, that's a huge success, but they've smoked pot the entire time. 6 So, when you're looking at drug screens a lot of times across the board that's a failure. 5, 6, 14 For us that's a huge success.  You're not going to overdose on that.  There's no 'harm'.  The risk over harm is so much lesser that many of my treatment plans say I'll smoke more weed instead of shoot heroin. 12, 13, 16, 20 Cool.  Smoke all the weed you want. 20 My friends smoke pot and own businesses, and they're able to function and do their job everyday. 6, 9, 11, 16, 20 If that's the lesser of the risk, if that's the worst thing someone's doing, smoke the fricken weed. 20 If it's unmanageable then we discuss it.  I have some clients that realize it has become a problem. 10, 12 Great, then let's look at stopping your weed. 20 Let's stop the THC use as well. 6, 13 There's a lot of other drugs we see as well. 5, 6 The amphetamine use has made a huge comeback recently. 6, 13 A lot of that I think is due to the strength of the opiates out there.  The reports I get from a lot of my clients is they hate how high the high is because of the fentanyl that's in there. 7, 10, 13 They're like, I want to be high. 7 I want to be well.  I want to be high, but I don't want to be falling out high. 7 So, then I use some meth because it kind of evens me out and gets them a little bit more leveled out on that end. 6, 13, 20 You know, the opiates that we are seeing out there—it's insane. 6, 12 The stuff that I'm seeing, that I'm hearing, the education I'm doing with the carfentanyl now being out there. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15 I saw that coming last year. 14 I knew that was going to hit us eventually. 5, 16 Ohio had two hundred and some odd overdoses in a small amount of time.  So I've been talking about carfentanyl with my clients and the education that I do outside of here since August of last year waiting for it to hit us. 10, 14, 15 First of all it was cheap.  You could get it for two thousand dollars from China and send it over here.  When it wasn't classified it was super easy. 7, 16 I'm a former drug dealer, so I would have been all on board if I could have gotten crack really cheap from somewhere else sent to me. 5, 6, 16, 18 It would have been an easy deal.  But the potency of the stuff that's out there right now, and I saw a carfentanyl overdose December of last year because it took eight shots of Narcan to revive somebody. 6, 11, 12, 14 Luckily when it happens in front of me and I have as much Narcan as I want I'm able to save somebody's life. 10, 15 But the average person is going to have one kit with two doses.  By the time 911 gets there and they've got maybe two nasal things there the chances of them surviving still are slim to none. 5, 8 They're not going to be able to do that.  This kid, you know, with the amount of shots I put in him plus the EMTs coming along he never should have survived. 11, 12, 16, 17 He never should have survived, and there's no doubt in my mind it was carfentanyl. 14, 16 And the five we've had this year I knew two out of the five people. 9, 14, 16 And now we're waiting on five more pending that we're hearing that probably is. 9, 12, 15 I know when it comes to this epidemic, and I use that term loosely, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. 6, 12, 13, 17 I hate to say that.  I would love to say this year things are going to get better because we're paying more attention, and because we have more access to Naloxone and things like that. 9, 14 The reality is the drug is too fricken potent out there right now. 5, 6, 12 It doesn't matter how much Naloxone I walk around with. 8, 16 If there's carfentanyl in it, or the amount of fentanyl in there, or noscapine that's now in the stuff. 12 There's too many fricken types of opiates that people are getting their hands on. 9, 17 Noscapine is called C3.  It is normally used for cancer patients after chemo for a pain reliever. 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 But it has hit Hennepin County in December.  Last year Hennepin County put out a little blip that it was out there. 14, 20 December 2016.  So, that was being sold as heroin. 16 The prescription painkillers are being sprayed with liquid fentanyl. 6, 10 We had the liquid fentanyl bust in November of last year. 14 Nothing is getting any better.  We are taking notice because this epidemic—because a lot of more rich, affluent, white people are dying from this disease. 9, 11, 13, 19 It's become a more noticeable problem because people are speaking out. 9, 12 I think that people are speaking out or people are potentially being more heard because a lot of times who they are. 6, 9 Families from Little Earth are losing handfuls and handfuls of their loved ones in that community. 8, 14, 19 No one has been listening to them for years about what's going on. 8, 14 But, if I speak out and I live in Edina, suddenly I get heard. 9 As long as people are hearing something and saying something now and we're doing something I'm all for it, but I think we could have done something about this a long time ago. 9, 12, 13, 17 I've watched it just escalate. 17 The numbers are skyrocketing. 14 The amount of deaths that I hear about on a daily basis from the clients that I work with—it's unbelievable. 9, 10, 18 The numbers that we have for here aren't true numbers of how many people have died. 5, 9 Because not everybody first of all are going to do tox screens on everybody. 14 We don't know how many people are truly dying from the opiate itself. 9, 12 They look at complications in other things.  I think our numbers, and I don't even have the totals yet for 2017, but I'm guessing in the seven hundred for Minnesota statewide.  For Hennepin County one hundred and fifty three.  It went up to thirty-nine percent from 2015.  ZM: I noticed that when I was driving up here there was a billboard. 5, 14 SD: Yes.  No Overdose Hennepin County.  So, I'm working with the sheriff's department. 9, 12, 19 Hennepin County decided to do something this year to do kind of a no overdose thing and do as much education as possible. 14, 15 ZM: This is paired with mandating EMTs and firefighters carry Naloxone? 5, 8 SD: It is kind of paired with that, and then just doing as much—right now what I'm seeing is that the billboards are out there, we're doing monthly meetings where a lot of providers and people such as me and parents of people that have lost their loved ones, police departments showing up with what we're doing, but I think everyone's afraid finally. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 They should be because for the longest time it's been this whole NIMBY thing, not in my back yard, that if it doesn't affect me, it doesn't affect me. 17 We are losing everybody.  Every time you turn around it's another person.  I've lost too many fricken clients. 10, 11 We've lost too many here, and the reality is we've lost way less here as a clinic than my clients have lost with people that are not currently here, and that should be maybe in treatment. 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18 But I think that because they're getting the treatment services and things like that and they have access to Naloxone with us, all those kind of things, and they are very much educated by the staff here, and the use obviously isn't as big as a problem as if you weren’t here, but I think that we're still missing the mark. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 ZM: Is there protocol for Naloxone distribution for clients? 10 SD: For us to give to clients? 10 ZM: Is that allowed? 10 SD: It is allowed! 10 So, if you are any sort of treatment provider, treatment program you can administer Naloxone as part of Steve's Law. 9, 12, 13 There are some kinds of stipulations that you fill out some little form and it's written in you variance in your program thing saying, we can administer Naloxone in my residential treatment program so they have it. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 20 I go and do a training.  They fill out this little form. 5, 20 That way they don't get a fine for—the reality is if they get a hundred dollar fine versus somebody dead I'd rather pay the fine. 11, 16, 18 There are stipulations that other programs have to do in order to administer Naloxone. 8 For us we have a variance because we have prescribers. 10 We have a doctor that prescribes a medication, it is basically a [unclear] medication in here. 10, 12, 14, 19 Because Naloxone is now available anywhere, any pharmacy, over the counter. 8, 12 Any pharmacy.  It used to only be CVS pharmacies. 6, 13, 16 I don't know. 12 They are the only ones that kind of have an open mind. 8 [laughs] 15 I don't know! 12 They were the only ones that were willing to test the waters even though not that many of them had it. 8, 16 You would have to call and make sure and then explain to them what it was half the time.  Shit show.  But now any pharmacy in the state of Minnesota can give out Naloxone. 8, 12 They just have to have a prescriber. 10 If they don't have one they can use the medical fricken—the main medical guy for Minnesota. 6, 7, 13, 14 But for us because we have a standing [unclear] medication our doctor prescribes it. 10, 12, 14 All we have to do is train the client. 10 Train the trainer kind of thing.  I train the client on how to reverse an overdose. 10 I fill out a little bit of a form. 5, 20 I don't really get much information I just want demographics on where it's going. 18 The year they were born, culture. 14 I want to see where it's going. 6 I want to know where it's going and then I want to know if you used it I want you to come back and tell me. 6, 12, 13, 16 I want to know how fast it worked. 12 The more and more I know it was successful the more and more I can get it out there. 12 We dispense a huge amount.  This year alone, what is it May 1st now? 8, 12, 14 I've dispensed probably thirteen, fourteen hundred kits so far this year. 14 Huge amount of them come out of here.  Clients know that I am the self-proclaimed Narcan queen. 12 [laughs] 15 Narcan girl in the community. 7, 19 ZM: Still the drug dealer! 5, 6 SD: [laughs] 15 That's right. 12 I'm dealing drugs on a different level now, though. 5, 6, 12 A completely different level, which is funny because on Sunday I met a friend of mine the last place I ever used at. 6, 9, 13, 16, 20 I met him at Cub Foods.  What he was bringing me was the auto injectors for Naloxone because they're expired and I give them out to some other people that are out on the street. 5, 8, 9 Because they still— ZM: Is that like through your position at Valhalla, or do you just do that to do that?  Training and stuff.  SD: It's now my job. 11, 12 It is now part of my job. 9, 11, 12 But before it was something that I just started doing almost a year and a half ago. 13, 14 A year and a half ago I had my first client overdose. 10, 13, 14 ZM: And you were like, I don't want to do that again?  I sat here until eight-thirty at night.  We leave at two o'clock in the afternoon. 18 I was here until eight-thirty at night waiting for his family to call me and tell me if he was alive or not. 12, 15 I couldn't go home until I knew what I was coming into the next day, or if I needed a day off, honestly. 8, 10, 16 I couldn't leave. 18 I thought to myself, if I'm feeling like this and this is my client I can't imagine what a family member, or somebody that really knows somebody personally on a different level than I do—even though I probably know more about my client than their family does quite often—but how it affected me feeling and waiting to find out if they were okay or not that nobody should fricken have to feel like that. 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18 So I started to go just kind of haywire with the Narcan thing.  ZM: How did you transition that into a part of your job? 9, 11, 17 SD: A lot of it was with Little Earth.  I went a did a training with them finally.  I'd snuck it in a few times, and did a big training for the community there. 19 Then started doing some education at the colleges. 7, 14, 15 MCTC, and Century College.  Got some of my professors talking about medically assisted treatment. 7, 12, 13, 14 By word of mouth people started hearing my name. 9 It turned into a bigger, way bigger than I expected. 18 My caseload got dropped because this is part of my job now. 5, 9, 11, 12, 17 I was just kind of doing it on my own time.  I had a full caseload. 14, 17 On Sunday's or at three o'clock in the afternoon, or if it was in the middle of the day I would schedule my work around it, and I would just do whatever it took to make sure I got this stuff out there. 7, 16 I was just like this is it.  I found my niche.  And then talked to, you know, our bigger bosses and things like that. 12 Chuck Hilger, who is one of my bosses here and the VP of our program here.  He knew what I was doing. 16 He gave me—he pointed Amy in my direction! 18 It was something that I just—we were missing it.  Where else do you get Narcan from?  The average person is not walking into a fucking CVS pharmacy and saying, ""Can I get Narcan?"" 16 Because first, I'm going to be judged. 14 Do I have to give you my name?  Am I going to have to pay for it?  An active user sure as hell isn't going to go and get Narcan from a pharmacy. 6, 13 They're not going there to get their needles anymore because they usually don't give them to them. 10 I just started doing as much with the clients and the staff here and just, yeah. 10 Word of mouth.  I've trained from here to Kenyon police department, which I didn't even know the town of Kenyon existed. 8, 9, 12, 19 Very small, like a thousand people. 9 I went and trained their narcotics unit, the police department, and the first responders, but the first people to respond in a small town like that are the police. 8, 9, 12, 14, 19 So, they all have our Naloxones. 8 I've been to Kenyon, I've trained as many treatment programs as possible. 12, 13 Meridian did not have Narcan at all in their patient residential sites open until I came along. 9, 13, 17 I was like, ""This is bullshit. 18 If we're going to work together you guys have to have that."" 8 I've trained all their staff, all their nursing, all their residential programs have that. 9, 13 ZM: Are they an abstinence based sobriety— SD: 12, 13 They're abstinence based, absolutely. 13 But that doesn't mean people don't die. 9 So, I was like, you know, we still should have that. 12 And have been educating more about harm reduction and methadone. 5, 6, 8, 14 I was at RCCS—restoration, counseling, and community services I think it is—last week doing Narcan training with them. 15, 19 MAT, methadone assisted treatment 101, kind of education with them. 12, 13, 14, 15 Anybody that's interested.  I do EMTs, I do Save-A-Life Corporation, which is like first responder classes a couple times a month. 7, 11, 14, 16 I just come in, spend thirty minutes doing Narcan training, talk about opiates, and get out. 10, 15 [laughs] 15 A lot of it originally was volunteering.  It's like I said no one—to start my day off is checking to see how many of my clients didn't dose the day before. 6, 8, 10, 16 And if they're not normally people that miss days in a row, if I notice that they've been gone two or three days and that's not their normal m/o I start looking through the jails to see if they've been arrested. 6, 9, 16 And then I look at obituaries. 20 And the fact that my day starts at 5:30 in the morning with me looking at obituaries to see if I recognize any names is bullshit. 6, 16, 17, 18, 20 That shouldn't be my job. 11 That shouldn't be anybody's normal day. 16 It just really, really shouldn't. 18 Until we do something and really address the problem and fill the gap and talk about this stuff it's not going to matter. 5, 12, 18 We're not going to make a difference.  We haven't talked about it.  We ignore it.  We ignore drug addiction. 5, 6, 12, 14 There's so much fucking stigma that comes along with that. 9, 17 ZM: Especially with something that's so prevalent. 10 Addiction is not going anywhere. 8, 14 Hasn't gone anywhere in forever. 8 It's not going anywhere now so why should I have to be anonymous? 8, 12 And why should I be shamed because I'm on methadone or Suboxone if I go to a twelve-step meeting? 18 Why can't I say that I'm using this as a tool along with treatment. 6, 12, 13 ZM: Is that not accepted? 12 SD: Not so much.  Depends on the group, but they quite often get shamed and told that they're not clean. 11, 14, 16 We try not to use words like clean and dirty here because if I'm clean that means at one point I was dirty. 6, 13 As a person that's been in active addiction and has shamed themselves to death nothing you say can do any worse than what I'm telling myself all day long. 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 So I don't need that from people that are supporting me. 9 You can't tell me how to recover.  The only way to not recover is to die. 18 It doesn't matter.  I don't fucking care how you recover if it's a light bulb and some methadone and a plant is going to work for you then do it. 6, 8, 19 I don't care. 19 Or if smoking pot is going to do it for you, or if the risk is going to be less than the IV use and I'm going to start smoking it, and then hopefully maybe I slow down and I go a different direction and I add methadone into the mix or IV treatment, or it's Teen Challenge. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 I don't care. 19 I don't care. 19 But I think that we've told everybody that there's one way to do things and that's the only way to do it. 16, 18 The reality is that's bullshit. 18 We have extremely high success rates. 7 Medication assisted treatment is extremely successful for long-term use. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17 Most people need to be on methadone or Suboxone for at least a year. 9, 14 Anywhere from 365 to 442 days is the research I've done. 16 But it took you a year to qualify for this program, it's going to take you probably about a year to get your life together. 8, 10, 14 ZM: Is that the average length you see? 6 SD: It all depends on the person. 15 Some people are here for a year, year and a half, a couple years. 9, 11, 14 Then they are kind of ready to titrate or taper off of the medication and go on their merry little way. 14, 18, 20 Some people have no intention of ever leaving and that's okay. 9 And some people don't know, they say they're not quite done yet, and decide to back out for a little while, and then they come back. 9, 11, 12, 14, 20 And we always just hope they make it back. 9, 18 We have a lot of clients that readmit to our program over and over again. 10 And shit, I'm just thrilled when they walk back in the door and they know they made it because a lot of them aren't. 12, 16, 18 We need to do something different out here.  I think education is a huge part of it. 9, 14, 15 Educating and being honest. 8, 14 I think the education piece needs to be done by people who get it. 9, 14, 15 People who have been active users—even the ones that are actively using. 6, 8, 13 People who are maybe on methadone and are doing well. 5 People who maybe still are actively using. 5, 6 And then the families. 17 By people who get dirty and see it. 6, 9 Because the suits, and society, or people that maybe trained in certain things but don't see it all the time. 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 17 I think we ignore a lot of stuff.  I think we've been ignoring it for a long time. 17 Even the fucking war on drugs. 5, 6 That worked out real well.  [laughs] ""Just say no."" 15 I'm a product of ""Just say no."" 14 It didn't work.  What that did was gave people the idea that you had a choice. 6, 9 ZM: I also think it was a race thing.  SD: Absolutely.  It didn't work.  And, ""If you just say no you'll be okay.""  But if you say yes then you're weak because you had a choice to say no. 6 And that's what it freaking put on everybody because society still sees a thing, ""Why can't you just quit?"" 6, 12 Why would you need another medication? 14 Just stop.  It doesn't fricken work.  Having to explain that to my father years ago, you know, when you said you were going to quit smoking and then by six a.m. you're at the Holiday gas station buying another pack of cigarettes—that's how I am with crack cocaine. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 I can't not stop it.  And so if, you know, for him to try to quit smoking you guys have one of those little inhaler things—that's my methadone. 6, 8, 12, 20 He was like, oh, this is like my methadone. 6, 8 I was like exactly!  That's harm reduction. 5, 14 That's less harm and you're weaning yourself.  However you've got to do it I don't care. 19 It absolutely works. 9 I think we need more access to treatment. 9, 12, 13 I think that we need programs—for the opiate piece—we need programs that accept everybody no matter what medication they're taking including methadone and Suboxone because not everybody does. 11, 12, 14 And I don't think it's fair that you can make a deciding factor on what somebody is taking for their medication because you're going to take them if they're taking lithium or gabapentin and those are abused drugs. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 They can cause sedation, they can cause a combination of things if you take them with other fricken medications. 6, 13, 14 So who are you to say we can't take them because they're on methadone. 6, 8 We'll take them on methadone, but they have to be on sixty milligrams or less. 6, 8 Well who the fuck are you to say what that person's magical dose is?  Because you don't know anything about them. 12 I think you should leave it up to the experts such as us and our doctors and things here to make that decision before you say they can't come to our program. 12, 14, 18 Because then again you're outed and there's that shame and that stigma of, well, I'm not good enough to go to that program. 9, 10 Only a couple of them will take me. 11 No sober living's will take me.  It's just not fair. 9 We're alienating a huge population of people that the most amazing people I've ever met in my entire life that don't have a fricken fighting chance because we won't allow them to based on judgment and a lack of education. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 There's my soap box.  ZM: That ties in nicely to where I wanted to go. 18 Do you have any other policy changes that you would like to see in an ideal world where Steph was in charge? 6 SD: In an ideal world where I was in charge I'd get a raise! 14 Then I think that naloxone should be with every first responder, police included, because quite often they are first to the scene and not every police department carries them. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19 I'm speaking Minnesota only—we should be able to open the doors to anything.  Continue to educate each other. 14 This should be in the school systems. 7 We should be educating clinicians going into the field. 14 I think that the doctors and the medical field needs to be educated on what's going on out there. 7, 12, 14 I don't think they really have a clue, and when another person comes in on an overdose there should be a referral process going through. 17, 18 You're usually in there for about three hours and then you get discharged. 15 It depends on the program, the facility. 15 North Memorial starting the eighth of this month will be giving out an optional Narcan kit to anybody that comes in on an overdose. 16 That comes with some referral information and stuff like that.  So, they're finally getting it.  But even talking to the providers there in the emergency department: why are we giving them needles? 9, 10, 12, 19 Is the response. 13 So, there's always this stigma and lack of education. 9, 14, 15, 18 We're like, well, this would be partially cost, but this is the reason because dead people don't recover. 9, 16 That's my short answer for you, but why would we not? 18 Because this could be your kid.  I think that the problem is not enough of us have been affected. 12 And that's shitty that we all have to fricken have lost somebody or see somebody struggle in order for this to be a big deal. 6, 11, 18 Because we just don't know. 12 I think that we need to—Minnesota being the land of ten thousand treatments we have a million and one treatment programs that anyone could get into, but I think Narcan should be on site at every single one of them, they should be opening the doors to anyone on medication assisted treatment, I think our detox processes of people are going to straight detox and doing a detox program instead of doing MAT or anything like that—it's scary. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 I think having to wait to get in is a huge barrier because if I'm going to have to wait two weeks to get into freaking detox? 15, 19 Forget it.  And the perception of addiction that I need it right now—that's why we answer the phone all the time—is that you don't care. 8, 12, 14, 16, 19 Well, they didn't answer the phone and they only answer Monday through Friday from eight to four. 8, 16 Well, two weeks from now? 12, 15 That person might be dead two days from now. 12, 16 So the urgency and trying to just get people straight through. 9 And that's part of the policy piece here. 9 A straight shot from that phone call they make that maybe there is a bed waiting in a detox and maybe then we give them that option to do you want to start on Suboxone or methadone? 5, 6, 8, 11, 15, 16, 19 Is that something that interests you?  Get them started on that because the withdrawal while waiting to get into treatment you're not going to stay. 5, 12, 13, 15 You're going to walk out in two days if you last that long. 16, 17 So from that getting them set up and somewhat stable, or at least somewhat comfy for a few hours out of the day, and then going from there to any treatment program if that's something they need. 12, 13, 15, 16 But having everyone's doors open and the problem is there's always going to be a waiting list for treatment because there's too many clients and not enough programs no matter how many we have out here there's always going to be a wait list, and then there's going to be the ones people want to go to or are referred to more often than others. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 For us for the opiate piece there are certain areas—no one's going to take anybody that's in withdrawal. 5, 8, 17, 20 We have to figure out, you know, we're referring people to treatment there's dimension one, which is all about withdrawal. 5, 9, 12, 13 And if they're at too high of a number they're not going to take them. 7 You've got to go to the hospital first. 8, 14 Well, great. 20 I've missed my bed.  No one's going to hold a bed for you because they're going to put the next body in there. 8 So, we're just missing a lot in order to do so.  I think we all have to act like I guess the AIDS crisis, which you know took us forever to fucking recognize too. 12, 17 ZM: At least the nomenclature of epidemic harkens back to that sort of level of—also level of ineptness to deal with it currently. 12, 13 Just to sort of sum up it sounds like you're recommending an integration of harm reduction into the already prevalent Minnesota Model, twelve-step in-patient as well as on-site withdrawal? 5, 10, 12, 14, 18 Maybe?  SD: Maybe.  If they could figure something out like that that would be great. 20 If somebody was willing to do that.  At least always having special beds available in like St. Joe's or Fairview for people that don't want to get on medication assisted treatment. 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 Yeah, something to that effect.  Or if they're going from one treatment to another, especially for the overdoses, if someone overdoses there should be an automatic phone call. 8, 12, 13, 16 Let's make a phone call to this place. 8, 16 Or at least, you know, here's a card. 12 Call these people. 9 It doesn't have to be Valhalla.  This isn't a plug for us, but you can't just have somebody come in from a near death experience and say, alright see you later. 6, 12, 18 Even quite often when people overdose they don't know or remember what's happened, but the family knows what's happened. 9, 11, 12, 15 We see it. 6 We're affected by it.  Society as a whole has a huge fucking ripple effect.  ZM: Aren't there similar requirements for suicide attempts and things like that? 12 SD: There are some, yeah.  Similar things.  You hold them for seventy-two hours or ten days depending on the situation. 15, 16 If there's going to be some serious medical problems coming along with it then why aren't we holding them for ten days? 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 And then we go from there to the next thing and setting them up with psychiatric help?  Like you would for a suicide then why wouldn't you set them up with treatment and whatever and having choices. 6, 12, 13 People need to have choices. 6, 14 ZM: I think the agency is crucial. 6 SD: These are some choices. 6 What sounds good to you? 10, 18 Because when I have a choice I'm much more successful. 6 ZM: Even if they both don't sound great at least you are picking. 20 Exactly.  At least one might sound better than the other.  Our clients walk in and they aren't mandated to treatment here. 10, 12, 13, 16 Nobody says you have to come to treatment at Valhalla Place. 12, 13 I think there was maybe one person that probation said they had to come here. 5, 14 Our clients come in because they want to come here. 10 Wherever they are in the state of change.  Whether they are here just because it's going to fill in the blanks between their use, or because they really want to stop. 5, 6, 13, 18 However they get here they get here and they fricken walk in, which is the hardest thing for someone to do is say, you know what? 9, 12, 16 I can't fricken do this anymore and I need some help.  And when somebody does that we should be high-fiving them and giving them kudos and support and acknowledging that instead of shaming and making them feel like shit because you couldn't just quit. 7, 10, 12, 18 So, we're missing a lot of stuff.  And we need a whole lot of money. 8, 10 Narcan, grants, all kinds of stuff we pay out of pocket.  Not everybody can afford that.  Oh, and the jail system.  That's my biggest goal is the jail and prison system.  Naloxone is in there, but New York has an amazing program out there that all their jails and prisons, and I think they have fifty-four jails and prisons in New York state, but prior to an inmate being released they have the option of having a Narcan training and having Narcan in their property. 8, 9 How fricken amazing is that? 9 The highest risk of people coming out is treatment and jail of overdose, so why wouldn't I set them up to protect them and having their family be trained as well? 7, 9, 12, 13 And then why should we cut them off cold turkey if they're on methadone or Suboxone when they get incarcerated? 15 Yeah I made a mistake, yeah I did this and that, but all I'm doing is setting them up for failure if they're in there for three days, ten days, three years if I don't have any treatment and no coping skills I'm going to get out and do the same damn thing. 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 Opiates don't go away short term. 17, 18, 20 And they don't go away because you're in a bubble. 18, 20 ""Well, you've been in jail for two years. 14 You'll be fine."" 11 I did prison for a couple years. 11, 14 I still wanted to smoke crack when I got out. 16, 18 So, the craving process when I'm in a safe little bubble was sights and smells and sounds our memory sticks to those things, so why wouldn't we start somebody up even if you're not doing them while you're incarcerated. 17, 18, 20 But sending them up prior to that.  ""I saw that you maybe used opiates in the past."" 5, 6, 13, 16 They talk to somebody about, you know, medical people there and some of the treatment programs. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 Setting them up with something is an option coming out in our jail programs.  ZM: Have you attempted to speak with anyone?  SD: Shit.  I've gotten into Create, which is an out-patient program out here but they do Telasis, which is the Hennepin County jail.  Kind of gotten in that door there.  ZM: You've been sneaking in Narcan to prisons?  SD: A little bit! 20 I'm trying to get in.  With the state and the counties there are all these kind of hoops you've got to jump through.  I only need one.  I need one fricken jail to get on board.  And if it's successful the rest will follow because we love to copy each other. 10, 14 So if I can just get one program.  No one wants to be that jail though. 8 SD: No, so I've got to find the right one and get the right person that'll at least hear me out and let me show what New York has done because they have an amazing program. 8, 9, 12 We would eliminate recidivism as well.  Along with the death toll that comes along with it. 17, 18 But, showing some care and compassion on the way out because they're people. 9, 18, 19 Yes, you committed a crime but you're still a fricken person. 14 We still feel, and we still bleed the same. 16 I think we forget about that just because we have made some mistakes in our lives. 17 I would love to get in there and have a Narcan program. 14 Send that out there.  I would love medicated assisted treatment to be allowed in the fricken jails continued. 10, 12, 13, 14 If they arrest one of my clients why should they get cut off cold turkey? 10, 15 I shouldn't have to write letters to the judge to beg him to get them out, which I've done.  But the only time a person will get their methadone or Suboxone is if they're pregnant. 6, 7, 8, 10 And once they have the baby they're cut off.  So, you're going through the trauma of having a baby in jail in handcuffs, not having the baby with you because you're going back to jail after delivery.  So you've got a shit ton of trauma and are also going into withdrawal a couple of days later. 5, 11, 16, 18 It doesn't make any sense.  It's very successful to have a baby while on methadone or Suboxone. 8 I work with pregnant clients. 7, 10 Better than nothing.  Better than nothing, and it works. 9 But that's the only time we give a reprieve is if that's the case and they are pregnant. 7, 10, 17 I have a client in Shakopee prison right now. 10, 12 We delivered her medication. 5, 14 But when she has the baby three to five days later she'll be done. 16 I can't imagine what that's going to be like for her on top of what she's already going through.  And then being in the prison system on top of all of that.  ZM: Is it hard to just separate your job from emotional investment? 9, 11, 12 SD: I've gotten better at it.  I've gotten much better at it because I've learned that I can't take everybody's stuff with me or I'm not going to be able to function. 9, 10 I have to take care of myself. 19 So, I have learned over the years that at the end of the day I try to leave my stuff in my office, and then go back and be Stephanie and take care of Stephanie. 10, 14, 16, 18, 19 I can't take care of everybody all the time. 19 My job isn't to take care of them. 11, 19 It's to support and guide them and be there for them and listen to them and make sure they know they're heard. 9, 12 All those things.  There have been times where you've got to really let go. 18 We're great here. 20 We're extremely supportive of each other. 19 If I need a break I get a break.  When I've lost clients or found things out in the middle of the day and I'm like, ""I'm out. 7, 10, 11, 16 I'll be back in an hour because I just need a little bit of time to get out of here and decompress."" 10, 14, 15, 20 And we get a great amount of PTO, so we get a lot of time off which is nice. 18, 20 Most places don't that amount of time off that we get here.  They do want us to take care of ourselves because it's hard. 9, 19 It's a hard job. 9, 11 ZM: When I moved from just studying this in an academic sense last semester to actually doing interviews—this is the first I have conducted on my own—but I sat in on a trial run with 7, 8, 14, 15, 20 Amy when she was interviewing another parent in NA and I was floored. 5, 14, 20 I was wrecked for the rest of the day. 16 I was like how am I going to be able to do this?  This is insane.  I can't even imagine.  SD: It's hard. 9 But there are times when we sit with our clients and I'm crying and they're crying too. 10 And then there's bad times.  I have a client who's terminally ill, and I know it's coming sooner than later. 8, 10, 12, 17 And he's always like, ""Why are you crying?"" 18 And I'm like, ""This is hard for me! 9 Because I'm trying to prepare for your death."" 10, 18 How can I prepare for that? 10 Because I'm trying to grieve and you have to allow me my grieving process, too. 10, 17 And that he could understand, but he was trying to not deal with it in his own right, and I can't imagine being in his seat. 12, 17, 18 I think it's important that they see that we're real people, and not a machine. 6, 9 I'm human, and I do share my story when it's going to be good for the client. 10, 14, 15, 19 If it's something that's going to help them to connect, to realize that they're not alone and it's not going to be harmful then absolutely I will share stuff if they ask me certain questions. 8, 17 I don't have anything to hide.  If it's going to help them absolutely.  Because I've been through a lot of shit. 18 I share my story when I go to treatment programs and speak a lot of times. 12, 13, 15 I wouldn't wish my story on anybody, but I think they need to know I have been there. 12, 15 I know what it's like to sit in that chair. 12 I know what it's like to be you. 12 I know what it's like to have a record. 12 I know what it's like to be judged. 12 I know what it's like to have labels all over me. 12 And guess what?  I got a job, I have an education, I have a career all after I did all that other stuff. 11, 14, 15, 19 I think I'm proof to many people that you can get out. 9 And you can do something different.  Don't let society, or your background, or whatever it is write your freaking path because it's bullshit. 12, 18 If I had done that I'd be dead by now. 12, 16 There's no way I would have made it. 18 ZM: It seems like the whole individualized and humanized and personal element is what you do at Valhalla. 6, 12, 19 I think so.  I think a lot of programs do that too, but I think it's just very individualized.  The same thing can happen, the same person here—like two clients in the same situation going on, but the circumstances still could be different. 10, 15 This is a newer client. 10, 16 This one's been here for two years, so they know these things. 8, 12, 14 This one maybe doesn't. 5, 8 So, as I said we have our 'it depends' thing around here. 15 ""Well, this guy, this is what you guys did.""  ""Well, this is different.""  ""But it seems the same."" 6 Well, it's not.  Our job is to fight for the client. 10, 11 Sometimes there have been times when fighting for the client means I have to discharge because it's a higher risk for me to have them continuing treatment here than it is to let them go. 7, 10, 12, 13, 17 That one sucks, but at the end of the day I have to protect myself, protect my company, and protect that person. 14, 16 I work with some more difficult patients. 10 I also am working with clients that are committed; they're on a full chemical dependency commit. 10, 13, 14 They go into law facilities sometimes at Care Anoka, and I am one of the counselors that was going there for them, and so we provide them they're medication and then I go and see them and meet with them. 6, 13, 14, 18 In order to commit you've probably done a lot of things.  Numerous overdoses, suicidal attempts, hospitalizations, in and out of the systems. 8 Things like that.  You're either really good at what you do or not so good at it depending how you want to look at it. 10, 18 But those are some high risk patients. 7 I have to make sure they're safe.  Sometimes saying methadone is not appropriate for you anymore because I have to make sure you're safe is my decision. 14 I'm always hoping I'm making the right decision for everybody. 10, 12, 14, 18 ZM: That's the difficult part of the job. 9, 10, 11 Not having a road map really. 10, 18 SD: I have to weigh the ficken pros and cons, and what's going to be less harmful.  Sometimes the less harm is saying, ""You can't.  This isn't going to work for you anymore.""  And letting them go, and hope that they find another way. 9, 18 It's a hard fricken job. 9, 11 I'm surprised I didn't cry today. 14, 16 I'm usually a squishy one. 8 [laughs] 15 Every now and then certain stories... 9, 12, 17 But I'm extremely passionate about making a difference out here. 10 ZM: I can tell.  Is there anything else you think would be important to know? 9, 12 SD: Dead people don't recover. 9 No stigma. 9 My little hashtags: 20 Carry Narcan Now!  That's what's important. 9 And thank you for letting me hopefully be a part of this because this is important. 9, 11, 14 And I'm glad that patients such as mine are going to be heard in this project. 5, 9 This is amazing. 9 Because they need to be heard. 9 Thank you.

"6","Cole_Bill","Rae Eden Frank Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 31, 2017 Maplewood, Minnesota Rae Eden Frank-RF Amy Sullivan-AS AS: Rae, would you state your name and tell me I have permission to record this?  RF: My name is Rae Eden Frank and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this.  AS: Thank you.  Do you want to start with where you were born and your childhood and whatever you want to share? 14, 20 RF: I was born in Boston, Masachusettes. 6, 13, 14 My family moved to Long Island, New York when I was an infant. 7, 12, 15 We moved to the Twin Cities, Minneapolis, when I was six years old. 7, 14, 15 I was in first grade. 5, 14 I had a pretty -- how would I describe my childhood? 10, 14, 20 My parents -- my mother and father -- were married until I was nine. 7, 16, 20 They got separated.  I have one brother who is two years older. 14, 20 We, for the most part got along. 9, 17 The biggest trauma for me was when my parents got divorced. 7, 20 My father was still very active in our lives. 16 He basicially wanted to be an active participant. 9, 18 There was a lot of grief and sorrow that she had -- she was not expecting the break up.  She fought very hard to keep us for one hundred percent custody while he was fighting for joint custody. 9 We were caught in this battle and that was pretty impactful in my childhood. 10, 14, 20 AS: What year were you born? 14 RF: I was born in 1969. 14 We are probably about the same age.  [laughs] 15 There was no substantial chemical use in my imediate family. 6, 12, 13 My father never drank. 5, 16 No one ever drank in my housefold, not even social drinking. 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 19 My parents didn’t smoke. 20 Chemicals were not a part of our family or our life. 9, 10, 12 AS: Was that due to a religious upbringing?  RF: I know my dad’s parents were heavy smokers so he could never stand the smell of cigarette smoke. 6, 12, 14, 16, 20 He never drank. 5, 16 My mother tells stories and she tried drinking and she didn’t like how it felt so she didn’t do it. 5, 9, 11, 15 That’s just not what they did and that’s just not the people they are. 9 Do you want to know about my chemical use? 6, 12, 13 Do you have other questions about my childhood? 14, 20 AS: Sure.  Well, where did you go to school? 7 Were you raised in any religion? 14 RF: My heritage is Jewish, but when we moved to Minnesota -- this is the story my mother tells -- she couldn’t find a synagogue that she liked so she started going to a Unitarian church, which she was familiar with because her mother had been a Unitarian. 7, 8, 13, 15 In Minnesota we started going to a Unitarian church and I was raised Unitarian. 14 My father’s heritage is Jewish, but he’s not very religious. 16 AS: What did you parents do for a living? 20 RF: Well, you know my mother. 12 I was thinking how long can I go before this comes up? 17 You have interviewed her, I believe.  It is really interesting to me because of the parallel. 17, 18 AS: Who is your mother?  RF: I was like I’m going to be saying these things and then if you know that are you going to compare notes? 12 But it is kind of fascinating.  AS: Who is your mother?  RF: Kathy Frank.  AS: Kathy Simon Frank?  Oh, I love your mother. 14 RF: She’s very lovable.  I didn’t want to tell you until you figured it out. 5 Then I was like I’m saying all these things about my mother and you know my mother. 12 AS: Well, I don’t know those things about her at all! 12 So, you and your mother must have figured this out? 5 RF: We figured this out about a week ago. 5, 13, 15 She was talking about a friend of hers who is doing this research project and a story and blah blah. 5, 15, 20 She was telling me about the project and I was like, I think she’s interviewing me next week! 5, 15 [laughs] 15 AS: What a small world.  We are great. 20 You just keep going.  Your life is safe -- RF: I’m at a place in my life right now where I feel really comfortable talking about things. 10, 12, 18 My mother and I have had some really hard conversations about what the dynamic was between the two of us growing up and my experiences as a child and my experience being parented by her. 9, 10, 14, 18, 20 AS: She is so open.  She was a stay at home mother until my parents divorced. 7, 20 Then, she worked at the University of Minnesota in the sociology department for many, many years. 9, 12, 14, 19 My father was a professor of math at the University of Minnesota. 16 My stepfather who my mother married when I was eleven was a professor of electrical of engineering at the University of Minnesota. 7, 16 My stepmother, who my father married when I was thirteen, has always one way or another been in the family of social science department as an instructor. 7, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 Very infused in the University of Minnesota! 6, 13, 16 I went to school. 7 I lived in a neighborhood in southeast Minneapolis. 7, 20 We lived two houses down from the school. 6, 7, 9, 13 When I was in elementary school my brother and I would walk home for lunch and have lunch at home and we would walk back. 7, 12, 16, 20 When she started working, that was when I was in third grade, that changed because we couldn’t come home. 5, 13, 14 AS: Was that hard for you? 9 RF: That was, yeah.  AS: The whole divorce.  The whole divorce, the whole being stuck in between these two parents. 20 AS: Did you end up getting to spend time with your dad? 10, 14 It slowly crept up to half time. 10 It was two nights a week, then it was three nights a week. 15 When my mother announced that she was marrying my stepfather who I did not like at all -- I had great disdain for him when I was younger -- I told her that if she married him I was going to live halftime with my dad thinking that then she would say she wouldn’t marry him. 7, 14, 16, 20 That was really why I was saying it because I knew it was the most painful thing I could say. 6, 16, 18 The most hurtful thing I could do to my mom was go live with my dad halftime. 14 She just broke down crying and I was like, Well shoot, I guess I’ll go live with my dad halftime. 8, 14 AS: You were eleven at that point?  RF: Yeah I was eleven at that point.  He had rented a house in the same neighborhood. 6, 13, 20 They both worked at the U -- well, she didn’t work at the U yet, but she then did.  Or, by that time she did work at the U. He had always stayed close. 9, 10, 14, 18 He had rented a house and then he ultimately bought a house. 6, 13 They live two blocks away from each other. 18, 20 They now get along. 12, 17 We have family holidays now. 12, 16 It’s so interesting. 17 I went back and forth.  First it was week to week. 15 I hated it.  I absolutely hated it.  When I was fifteen I got really drunk and locked myself in the bathroom at McDonald’s in Uptown and ended up in what they called twenty-twenty, which was the detox unit on Franklin and Cedar Avenue. 5, 8, 14, 18, 19 Then ended up in the children’s adolescent unit at Fairview Deaconess. 5, 8, 14, 19, 20 Again, these places don’t really exist anymore. 18 AS: Fairview -- the one up by the U?  RF: It is now Fairview Riverside but it was Fairview Deaconess. 8, 9, 12 They had what was known as the STOP Unit. 11, 12 Before that, when I was there, it was just called the adolescent evaluation unit. 19 I was there for two weeks. 15 When I got out of there I went back to my father’s house because that’s where my stuff was -- that’s where I was when I went in. 6, 13, 16 The day that it was supposed to go back and forth was upset because I had been away for two weeks. 15, 16, 18, 20 So, then I just stayed at my dad’s and we started having all these family therapy sessions and they said, When do you want to go back to your mothers? 12, 14 And my mother was asking when I was going to go back to her house, and I was like I’m not. 6, 13 I was done going back and forth.  I didn’t get along with my mom very well at that point. 14, 17 I got along with my father a lot better. 16, 17 From fourteen to sixteen I lived fulltime with my father. 7, 14, 16 I was hellbent to get out of my parent’s house -- I did not want to live with my parents at all, but they wouldn’t let me move out until I graduated from high school. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 I fast tracked high school and graduated when I was sixteen and moved out the summer -- I have a summer birthday, and that summer I turned seventeen. 7, 15, 16 Then I moved out. 7, 15 AS: Did they have emancipation?  RF: I don’t think they had to because I graduated from high school. 7 I don’t know. 12 There wasn’t anything illegal or anything.  AS: Tell me more.  Where did you move and what were you doing? 15 RF: I moved to Uptown because that was the cool place to be. 7, 15, 17 I was a punk rocker in high school, an eighties punk rocker. 7, 14 We would hang out in the Lake and Hennepin area. 8 The McDonald’s was an open plaza and so we would have out at the McDonalds.  We all had fake IDs and we would go to the Uptown bar and First Avenue and see bands and get drunk and do acid and smoke pot. 5, 6, 8, 14 Drug use and partying was just part of the punk rock music culture. 6, 9, 13, 14, 20 It wasn’t independent, like just getting high. 7 It was just part of the scene and the lifestyle that included getting really fucked up. 9, 10, 15, 18 At that point I was using alcohol, pot, and psychedelics for the most part. 6, 9 I had friends that were slightly older who used heroin. 6, 13, 16, 20 They would inject heroin and use needles. 6, 10, 13, 16 I thought they were really, really cool. 17, 18 That was who I idolized; that was who I wanted to be. 18 It is interesting because in some of the Narcotics Anonymous texts they talk about “We didn’t want to be addicts” and I’m like, I didn’t want the misery and the heartache and the trauma. 9, 14, 17 But, those were the people that I idolized. 9 They were the singers in the bands and they were just slightly older than me. 20 They were the dark-siders and they shot heroin. 9, 11, 16, 17 That was appealing to me.  I grew up -- sorry I’m going back and forth. 20 I hated life. 10 My prayer every night before I went to bed was, Please God take me away and don’t let me wake up in the morning. 18, 20 Every morning I would wake up and just be like, Fuck, here I am again.  There wasn’t severe abuse going on. 6 There wasn’t abuse, there wasn’t neglect. 6, 13 We were a middle-class family, always had my needs taken care of, always fed, always clothed. 7, 12, 18, 19 I’ve never been hungry, I’ve never been cold. 16 I have so many privileges and so much gratitude -- now I have gratitude. 12 I have so much privilege, but I had severe depression. 6, 10 I don’t even think I knew it was depression. 10, 16 I just hated life because I thought it was this terrible thing. 10, 11, 17, 18 All I saw was ugliness, destruction, war, hate. 9 When I was very young I read these books by Torey Hayden who works with severely abused children. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 She is awesome and she is a child psychologist, works with severely abused children and I was reading her books at ten and eleven years old saying, See, people suck. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 AS: What age were you when you started feeling like you didn’t want to wake up in the morning? 15 RF: I think it was eleven, twelve.  Yeah I mean I was just like, My life sucks, the world sucks. 10 AS: Well, your parents split up when you were nine. 20 I didn’t really like people and I didn’t like what they were doing to the world. 9, 18 I didn’t like what people were doing to animals. 9 I didn’t like what people did to each other. 9 I just thought the world was a terrible, ugly place and I wanted to be taken out of it. 11, 17, 18 For me, using drugs was an escape. 5, 6 It was also a part of the punk rock culture -- we all hated life. 9, 10, 14 The music was always like, Fuck you! 9, 18 The music was about how the world sucks. 9 That was my whole essence of being.  AS: And I’m angry about it. 11 RF: And I’m angry. 11 In college I joined the political student organization and did a lot of demonstrating and at some point I can talk about what my degree is in, too. 7 I did find some outlets other than drugs, but for the most part it was just, Get me out of here. 5, 6, 9 AS: You were talking about the people you idolized that used heroin. 6, 9, 13, 16 RF: Oh, yeah.  I had moved out with a best friend of mine and, I don’t remember what happened, but once we started living together we just weren’t getting along well. 7, 8, 15, 17, 20 I knew there was a room for rent in a house that some of these people that I thought were really cool lived. 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 They shot heroin and they were the bomb. 11, 16 I asked this woman if I could rent the room and she said, Yes. 14 I started living there.  That’s where I first used heroin, but I didn’t get strung out at that point. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16 I did not live there for very long. 17 I think I went traveling that summer and so I moved. 7, 15 Circumstances of looking back and I’m like, Wow, I really dodged a bullet. 18 AS: What year is this? 14 RF: I am seventeen, maybe just turning eighteen. 5, 20 I graduated in 1986 so this is probably about 1987, now. 7, 12 AS: Did you use heroin just a couple of times? 6, 11, 13, 16 RF: I just used it a couple of times at that point. 6, 11, 13, 14, 16 AS: You didn’t feel like you had to have it?  RF: At that point, no.  I didn’t get into the physical addiction part of it. 6, 9, 12, 14 Part of it was access to it. 9 At that time, in the eighties, it was before a lot of the pills were available.  In Minnesota at that point it was the white powder. 19 It was very difficult -- there were basically one or two people that sold it and I didn’t have access to that person. 9, 10, 19 I had to get it from my roommate who got it from someone else who got it from this one person. 14 It was very hard to get. 9 AS: And there are no cell phones. 8, 16 [laughs] 15 RF: There are no cell phones. 8, 16 Right.  AS: It was a word of mouth circumstance.  RF: We had telephones, we had landlines. 8, 9, 16 [laughs] 15 It was very much like somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. 16 My basic understanding -- 14, 17, 18 I never got that close to it -- that there were one or two people in Minneapolis that sold it and you had to go through people to get to that person. 9, 10, 16 It was white powder, which I don’t even know if that’s on the streets now. 5, 12, 19 I ended up traveling that summer and moving away. 7, 18, 20 I moved to New Mexico. 7, 15 AS: Where in New Mexico?  RF: Outside of Santa Fe. I was going to study with an herbal medicine woman. 9, 12, 14 I hated the cold so I went there to get away from the cold. 14, 18, 20 Not aware that the elevation makes it cold and snow! 12 It was milder than here, but it was kind of funny because I was thinking New Mexico -- that’s the south, it must be hot. 9 Not in Santa Fe. At some point I had equated misery with drug use and I had stopped using. 5, 6, 13 It was right after I had moved out of the house with these folks, so maybe that was part of it -- being so immersed in it, seeing all these people that were pretty strung out. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 There was some pretty serious health stuff going on. 10, 11, 19 Some pretty severe dysfunction. 6, 9, 10 At some point I was like, Okay, I’m miserable and I’m using drugs, and if I don’t use drugs that will help meeley the misery. 5, 6, 13 When I first moved down to New Mexico I was not using. 6, 7, 14, 15 I met a woman who I just fell madly in love with. 14 She was just this mountain woman and she was everything that I wanted. 18 She was counter culture, she had this similar ‘society sucks’ mindset, and she had managed to live outside of it. 12 She was off the grid.  I thought, this is the life. 10, 17, 18 I’m off the grid and I’m not dependent on this society that I am totally opposed to. 12 She was a very heavy drinker and pot smoker. 5, 6 I spent the next couple of years being a complete co-dependent. 11, 14 She was miserable and unhappy and had a way worse childhood than I had as far as abuse and stuff. 6, 13, 14, 18, 20 I decided that my life goal was to prove to her that she was lovable and that the way she was going to find happiness was to stop drinking and to stop smoking pot and I was going to be the one to show her the way. 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18 That wasn’t very successful.  I became very miserable.  We were now living in the mountains of California where it is just beautiful. 12 It is also a very heavy pot growing community. 6, 10, 19 At that point -- now it is the early nineties -- cocaine has come up from the cities into the mountains of California and it is just rampant. 7, 12 Methamphetamine was being made all over in the mountains.  I started using meth and found that I -- I didn’t share this earlies, but part of growing up I was very shy and very quiet. 6, 9, 10 I hated myself for that and I always wanted to be talkative and have things to say. 18 I wanted to be able to engage with people. 9, 18 I just couldn’t because I was shy and I was quiet.  Fast forward to about nineteen years old and I used methamphetamine for the first time and I loved it. 6, 13, 14, 16 I could talk, I was all energized.  I don’t remember the first time I used needles, but I was very attracted to going back to the heroin crowd. 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 There was a part of it for me -- I know you are kind of focused on the heroin -- AS: No, no. 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 RF: The injection part of it, there was the appeal of that; it was my route of choice for admission -- was needles. 6, 9, 10 I started shooting meth, started selling meth. 6 AS: Are you still with this woman?  RF: I’m still with this woman.  Things are absolutely terrible. 11 She is smoking crack, I’m shooting meth. 6, 16 Things got really bad, really fast. 18 Her and I have a terrible breakup. 11 I start living with this man who has a frame shop in this small town in northern California. 8, 15 I knew him because I sold drugs to him. 5, 6, 16 I’m thinking that he’s got a business, he’s got a straight life, I’m going to start living with him. 10 I don’t know how much of this was conscious; part of it was. 9, 12 And, I was going to stop selling drugs. 5, 6 I don’t know if I was going to stop using drugs but I was going to stop selling drugs. 5, 6, 12 I think I was going to stop using. 6 I stopped selling and I couldn’t stop using. 6 That was the first time I realized I was an addict. 14 I love how this is, to kind of watch how the history goes back and forth. 14, 15, 17 I told you about being in the adolescent evaluation unit when I was fifteen. 16, 19 I was diagnosed at that time at being borderline chemical dependent. 13 They don’t use that diagnosis anymore, but that was what I was given in 1985. 6, 13 I was told that if I stopped using I would be fine, but if I did use it was a progressive disease. 6, 11, 13, 16 I didn’t get that I just got that I was borderline.  I supposed to not use, I had to sign contracts with my parents that I wasn’t going to use. 6, 11, 13, 19, 20 AS: But something stuck in your head that you were borderline, you’re not an addict, you’re just on the edge no matter what you did. 14 No matter how far you went.  RF: I’m not an addict, I’m borderline. 14 Fast forward to the frame shop in California. 15 I couldn’t stop using and this man who became the father of my oldest daughter, also a very heavy user, says to me, Do you think you’re an addict? 6, 13, 14, 16, 20 I said, No, I’m not.  I was diagnosed when I was fifteen as borderline.  AS: The frame shop guy? 15 RF: Yes.  He just looked at me and said, You have gone across the border.  You have crossed the border.  I’m like, Wow, here’s this guy -- I don’t know if I thought he was an addict, I don’t know what I thought -- but that was the first time that it occurred to me that I was an addict no matter if I wanted to or if I was trying to. 5, 12, 14, 17, 18 It just wasn’t happening. 15 I got pregnant and that was when -- this is 1994, now -- I got really scared because I didn’t want to be pregnant and using. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 18, 19 I didn’t necessarily even want to be pregnant. 7, 10 Because life sucked and life was horrible and it was already over populated because people sucked, my intention was never to bring another human being into this world. 9, 10, 16, 19 That was a terrible thing to do. 11 I did like kids and I thought someday I’ll try to adopt. 16, 17, 18 When you have sex with women and you don’t need to use birth control, I don’t know if you want to know this, but then you start having sex with men and there’s this thing called birth control and I kind of forgot! 6, 12, 13, 18 [laughs] 15 I’m pregnant and he really wants to have the baby and I’m like, Okay, I’ll have the baby. 7, 10, 18 I’m twenty-four years old, strung out on meth, great. 6, 8, 14, 20 At that point I was like I need to stop using and I’m pregnant. 6, 7, 10 There was a woman in that community and she had two young children. 5, 14, 19, 20 At some point, I don’t remember when, she was had shared that she was using but she had stopped during those nine months of pregnancy because those nine months may be nine months of her life but it was the entire foundation of her kid’s life. 5, 6, 10, 11, 16 That had really stuck with me. 18 I could not stop using. 6 That was a second ‘Ah Ha’ moment. 8, 12, 14 I have a problem. 12 I am an addict. 14 I’m judging this woman because I think she is a junkie, and yet she was able to stop using when she was pregnant and I cannot stop using. 6, 7, 10 We moved. 7, 15 AS: What do they call that?  The geographical -- RF: The geographical.  We loaded up the frame shop. 15 We left a lot of stuff, got a U-haul, loaded up the frame shop, loaded up our stuff, and moved to Seattle, Washington. 7, 14, 15 RF: I had no idea.  I had a friend who lived there and we stayed with her. 7, 20 She is someone I knew from college. 7, 16 She was one of my protest friends who does not use. 6, 13, 16, 20 She was not an addict. 14 Turns out her roommate was a heroin addict. 14, 16 We move in with her. 15 We find this out about her roommate but I didn’t start using at that point; that comes later. 6, 14 We learn of this picture frame shop for sale. 10, 15 We buy this picture frame shop. 15 It is already an established, up and going frame shop, so now we have another business again. 12, 15 Within a couple of weeks we find meth again and we are both shooting meth again. 6, 11, 15 I have my daughter and she is basically full term. 14, 17, 19 She was due around April fourth and she was born on March, 26 1995. 5, 14 She was four pounds, six ounces.  They said that even though she was basically full term, over a third of her placenta was dead from the meth. 6, 14, 16, 17, 19 She was otherwise fine developmentally. 11, 12 She was little but she had all of her eyes, ears, all of her senses, and all of her functions. 9, 20 I immediately tested positive -- I don’t know how all the processes work, if I told them or what -- because I had been getting prenatal care. 10, 12, 16, 17, 19 I know at one point they had wanted to drug test me and I had kind of talked the doctor out of it or something. 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 AS: Do you think they suspected because her growth was so small? 10 RF: I think what happened was we were in the hospital and I was having contractions and they found that the umbilical cord was being crushed, and they were recommending a C-section. 8, 12, 14, 15, 19 I thought they are going to start doing medical interventions, they are going to start giving me anesthesia, or whatever they give you, and here I am I have meth in my system and I need to tell somebody. 6, 7, 14, 17, 18 That’s what happened and I did tell the doctor. 12, 14, 15 They brought in CPS [child protection services] and the case was opened. 14, 17, 19 I don’t know if this is because it is 1995, I don’t know if it is because -- I do believe a portion is because I am white and my daughter’s father is white, and we own a business, and we had an apartment. 5, 9, 11, 12, 16, 19 There were cultural things and we didn’t fit the stereotype. 15 Even though a case was opened, we were required to go and give UAs to pee. 5, 17 I was court ordered to treatment, but I started going and I stopped. 5, 12, 13 We had to go pee, but I was unobserved so we started peeing in bottles and putting it in the fridge and bringing it with us.  I don’t remember if they were testing the father as well or just me, but for sure me. 16 At that point was when I started doing heroin again. 16 I don’t remember why we went from heroin to meth at that point, but it was Seattle in the 1990s and meth was very accessible and heroin was also very accessible. 6, 9, 16 It was black tar heroin, which was different from what I had used in Minneapolis, but it was very accessible and comparatively cheap, I guess. 6, 9, 13, 16 We started using heroin when my daughter was about six weeks old. 6, 15, 16 Even in the eighties the whole overdose thing -- I know you are interested in the overdose thing -- that has really been an epidemic from what I see from the 2000s. 6, 12, 13, 18 We would shoot up a lot.  I don’t know if it was the pure heroin. 12, 16 People did overdose but very few people overdosed and died. 9 AS: In the nineties. 12 RF: In the nineties. 12 The eighties and nineties. 12 If they did it was a mixture of alcohol and other things. 6 AS: So maybe it wasn’t as pure? 5 That’s what I have heard. 9 RF: Or it was just heroin and not mixed with all the other stuff. 16 Fentanyl  I know is what is happening now. 12, 15 People would be like, Let’s see how much we can shoot up! 6 The quantities were large amounts.  I was around people who would nod out, but I was not around people that totally stopped breathing. 9 The big thing then was Hepatitis C.  At that point it was non-A and non-B.  They hadn’t even identified it as Hep C at that point.  Needled exchanges were springing up. 6, 10 I had learned from a friend of mine in Seattle about how not to share needles, cookers, and cottons. 10, 20 There is a lot of that kind of education going on, but not so much about the overdose that is going on now. 12, 14, 15 I then went on a run for almost two years of heroin. 8, 14, 16 The physical addiction part was just -- I mean when you talk about your daughter and how the overdose happened and she continued to use it is so insane but I understand it completely. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 That is how insidious it is.  Addiction in general, but also specifically heroin use. 6, 13, 14 That physical component of the use is just overwhelming. 6, 8, 13 Detoxing from it is the most horrible thing I have ever done in my life. 10 I am actually glad I am talking about it because it reminds me that I never want to go through it again. 7, 16 It was a nightmare.  When my daughter was about a year old I remember I put myself in treatment. 12, 13, 14 A couple of things happened. 11, 15 I didn’t want to raise a child as a using addict. 6, 14 There were pieces of me that were still sane.  I was like I love this child and I did want to give her a chance and a life. 10, 14 What kind of life was I going to give her while I was using? 6, 10 I tried to quit a couple of times and absolutely could not. 11 I did the detox thing and went through hell for three days and then get out and start using again because I was so miserable. 6, 16, 19 I tried to get on methadone but the waiting list was really long. 6, 8, 15, 17, 18 I then got into a mother daughter treatment program. 12, 13 It was three days of detox and was absolutely miserable, but I then went into an inpatient treatment program and I was just so sick. 12, 13, 15, 16, 19 I remember for six weeks I didn’t sleep. 15, 16 I would wake up every hour on the hour. 15 It was miserable.  It had helped to care for my daughter but it was just exhausting. 14, 19 They recommended me for a six month program. 12, 16 I was from Minnesota, which at that point the standard treatment was the twenty-eight day model. 12, 13, 16 I wrote my own treatment plan and I said, You are recommending me for six months and that’s absolutely insane. 11, 12, 13, 16 I will stay for sixty days because that is double the twenty-eight day program. 16 That is twice as long. 17 They were telling me that I had to stay the six months but on that sixtieth day -- AS: This is a place that was recommending six months and your daughter could live there so there was surround care? 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 I’m assuming this was a nice place? 18 I was kind of in a house -- AS: You’re not leaving because it’s substandard care. 6, 13, 14, 19 You were just leaving because you didn’t want to do six months. 11, 16 RF: Exactly.  AS: I just wanted to understand that. 17, 18 RF: I was getting a lot out of the program and bonding with some of the other women. 12 I knew what I needed and I only needed sixty days. 16 AS: Are you still with her father at this point? 16 RF: I’m still with her father. 16 He is still using, although I think at that point he was on methadone. 6 I don’t remember what I was telling them. 15 I do remember physically I had been so sick and the only thing that kept me in there was each day saying, I do not want to go through day one, two, three, four again. 6, 15, 16 Like I was saying this on day five. 16 I don’t want to do that again.  I was so physically horrible. 6, 10 Saying that to myself: how I didn’t want to go back again.  Each day I stay clean and don’t use heroin I’m one day further from that. 6, 13, 16 Day sixty I leave and go do meth. 6, 18 I was thinking about not using heroin again. 6, 16 I wasn’t going to go through that detox again. 19 I leave the program -- this is over twenty years ago now -- I went and used meth with my daughter’s father. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 We were still together. 8 We are off and running on meth again. 6, 8 I was still thinking that I didn’t want to raise my daughter while using. 6 We decided to move again. 14, 15 We sell the frame shop. 15 Some of these things I’m like, How did we manage this?  AS: To pay bills?  Live a life? 10 Is that what you mean?  RF: Yeah, and how things fell into place.  We knew this person was a businessman and he bought the business from us. 16 AS: Because you were so strung out you don’t remember it? 8 RF: I don’t remember the intricacies of how it happened and also when I look back I think about the chances of all those things happening and all the things falling into place the way they did. 15, 18 We sold the business and we moved back to northern California, but a different place. 7, 8, 15 My daughter’s father’s father was a -- I don’t know if you know about the Anananda community? 12, 16, 19 They follow Ananda I think is his name. 10 It is an Eastern based philosohy of yoga, meditation, vegetarian eating. 13 They have a community in Nevada City, Californina. 19 My daughter’s father’s father lived in Fresno, but was a member of this community of Ananda. 7, 16, 19 We find out there is a retreat house and we can go there and do work exchange. 6, 10, 13 We drive to this beautiful, moutainous place, and they put us up in a yurt and they are all vegetarians. 5 We live in a yurt and are doing work exchange. 10 Then, we find another place to live right outside this Anananda community. 12, 19 I am going there to meditate and do yoga in the community center and it is beautiful. 19 Then we find meth. 6 AS: How long did that take? 17 RF: Weeks.  AS: Several weeks in? 15 AS: When you say you found meth, what do you mean? 6 Explain that to a non-meth user. 6, 13 How you could just find it at a yoga center.  RF: [laughs] 15 Some of it is that there is something about people that use drugs and that radar kind of thing. 5, 6, 9, 13 There is something else I just kind of believe that the energy you put out is the energy you get.  Some of that new-age stuff I really believe. 16, 18 I was still emitting that energy and attracting to me, not consciously thinking I want to do this thing, I wanted to get away from this thing, but I was still drawn to it. 5, 18, 20 My daughter’s father was looking for a job and we were told -- this is all in the same area -- there was a guy, he wasn’t apart of the Anananda community, but he had a sawmilll and he was looking for people to mill the wood. 8, 9, 11, 16, 19 He got a job there, and the owner of the sawmill smoked meth. 6, 11 Here you have somebody who is just trying to be clean and not really and he finds out this guy smokes meth. 6, 18 It was small, it wasn’t a big business.  The two of them were working together and he catches on that he does meth. 6, 8 They start talking and then I’m like, Oh yeah, I’m there too.  They were smoking meth but then I started shooting it because that’s just what I did. 6 That went on for another year. 14 Finally, during that period of time I was just getting more and more desperate. 18 Things were falling apart between the two of us and we were not parenting well. 9, 11, 20 We were fighting constantly and I was miserable.  I remember saying to this woman, I really want my daughter to grow up and be happy and healthy. 10, 18, 19 She said to me, The most important, number one thing you can do to ensure that happens is for you to be happy and healthy. 9, 15, 18, 19 It was one of those so simple and so deep profound moments of my life. 8, 10, 12, 14 I was like, This isn’t the way it is going to happen. 15, 18 My stepmother knew I was miserable and she said, Why don’t you come back to Minneapolis and visit? 14, 16 Some plan was formulated that my daughter and I were going to come back to the Twin Cities and I couldn’t figure out how to pack.  Simple daily things I couldn’t figure out how to do.  My mother ended up flying out.  The nearest airport to the place I was was Sacremento. 12 My mother bought us roundtrip tickets, she flew to Sacramento, drove for three hours to the mountains, picked us up, drove back to Sacramento, and flew to the Twin Cities. 5, 12, 15 That was January 18, 1998.  AS: Why do you remember that date? 13 RF: January 18, 1998.  That is the last day that I injected or used drugs of any form. 5, 6, 13, 16 That is the date that recovery in earnest started. 13 My clean date I call January 19th. 13 The day after. 16 The last day I used drugs was when my mom was driving down the driveway to come pick us up. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 18 I did not come back out here to get clean.  I was miserable and here was this imitation.  My intention was to come out here and spend some time with my family and then come back to California. 10, 12 I had a round trip ticket.  I didn’t have a ton of stuff because we lived in a yurt. 7 I came with a suitcase and that was it. 17 AS: How long were you planning to visit? 17 RF: I don’t know. 12 [laughs] 15 Opportunities kept presenting themselves. 5, 10, 19 I kept saying I was going to go back after I did this.  I didn’t have a driver’s license anymore because I had let it expire and so I was going to get my driver’s license then I was going to go back. 5, 13 Then a friend of mine was teaching this play therapy class and she asked me if me and my daughter wanted to participate in this class and I said, Sure. 7, 9, 12, 18, 20 So then I was going to take this play therapy class and then I was going to go back. 7, 12 At a certain point I was just like I’m not going back. 17 I started attending Narcotics Anonymous right away. 12, 18, 20 AS: You didn’t go back into treatment? 12, 13 RF: I didn’t go back into treatment. 12, 13 I was living with my mother and my stepfather in the house I had moved out of when I was fourteen and had never moved back into. 6, 7, 13, 15, 16 AS: How old are you at this point?  RF: I am twenty-nine at this point.  AS: It has been half of your life since the time you had been there. 10, 14 RF: I come back to mom’s house and she nursed us back to health. 6, 13, 14, 19 She financially provided for us while I got on my feet, I went back to school. 7 AS: Had you started college before you moved to Santa Fe? 7, 14, 15 RF: I had started college. 7, 14 I was in a program called the Program for Individualized Learning at the U of M. It doesn’t exist anymore.  AS: A lot of schools had something like that. 7 RF: I could design my own major. 11 I had designed it around political activism and community organizing and things that I loved to do anyways. 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 I was getting some kind of credit for this herbal medicine internship. 5, 12, 14 I could do projects and get credit for them. 5 When I was in California I had worked on this reggae festival.  I was the handicapped support crew person. 14 I had done a project around accessibility at large venues or something. 5, 9 I had to find professors at the U of M who would work with me on it, but I had always managed to do that. 18 As all of this is going on I am doing a project here and a project there. 5 At some point I completely had stopped going at all.  I come back to Minnesota.  I had finished the core of what I needed to for the Program for Individualized Learning, but I had to do a senior project. 5, 14 I really didn’t know what I wanted to do. 12, 18 I then found the Alcohol and Drug Counseling Education program which is a two year program at the University of Minnesota. 14 They had another program called the Inner-College program, which I think they still have, where you could take minors from two different colleges. 7 My stuff was basically from the college of liberal arts and the alcohol and drug studies was from family and social science. 5, 6, 7, 12, 19 I could take two of those things and put them together and have a degree. 8 I dove right into school, I dove into NA, the alcohol and drug counseling education program, and I got my degree in 2000 I think. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 19 AS: What was the turning point for you? 20 You said things in California were going poorly.  You got this invitation.  Had you reached out at all?  Did your family back here know that you were in really bad shape or was it kind of a surprise? 12, 18 RF: They knew. 16 I don’t know if they knew how bad, but they knew. 12, 16 AS: By the time your mom came to get you, you were ready to be done. 14 Did something precipitate that? 10 Was it falling out with him?  RF: That was an event.  It is always like how people talk about what their ‘bottom’ is. 9, 18 AS: I just mean that it seems like they came and got you and then you started going to NA. 6 [laughs] 15 If that is your story that is totally fine, but I was just wondering if there was some other precipitating things. 10, 11, 15 You had moved before to try to stop, so I’m just wondering what it was about this move. 7, 15 Maybe I interrupted you earlier when you were trying to say something. 15 RF: Part of it was I think I had isolated myself from the community in northern California. 8, 14, 19 Even though my community there, the family there, the saw mill family became my family, they had kids and we spent time together. 8, 12, 19 I had isolated myself from them and I really had nobody. 18 I was in this yurt all day with my daughter and had totally isolated myself. 16 Him and I were not getting along. 17 I had had this conversation with this woman about being happy. 18 Just all these little things that kind of added up. 20 Although I didn’t make a conscious decision that I was going to come back here to be clean it kind of fell into place. 14 Also, being at my mom’s house where there was no alcohol and drugs. 5, 6, 13, 14 Of course, as I told you before, I could have easily found it, but something just changed. 13, 16 Something had changed when I had got on that plane. 13 Part of it was the desire to use was lifted, which is unexplainable because up until that point, part of how I defined addiction was that I couldn’t stop using and I had this compulsion and obsession. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 If anytime I had tried not to use I was just so overwhelmed that I had gone back to using. 6, 13 Somewhere between traveling from California to Minnesota that obsession was lifted.  When I arrived in Minnesota I didn’t have that drive. 5 I think if I had I wouldn’t have stayed clean. 14 That miracle had happened despite any intention that I had. 15 I got internships.  I worked at mothers and daughters programs because that was my own personal interest.  I worked at a methadone program.  Then I started learning about harm reduction. 5, 10, 14 I had always been interested in needle exchanges because another part of my story is that I don’t have HIV or Hepatitis C. 6, 9, 10, 15, 18 I didn’t contract those diseases through all of that using. 6, 19 PArt of that I attribute to the education I got in Seattle from the injection drug users there who were very much about educating each other through peer to peer education. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15 I had always had a very favorable view on needle exchange and harm reduction. 5, 10, 14, 18 When I came back to Minnesota and I started connecting with some of my old friends many of them were dead through either overdose or suicide. 14, 16, 20 One hundred percent of those people, like those roommates I talked about that I had injected with in 1984, had Hepatitis C. 9, 14 Again, I really dodged a bullet here. 18 A couple of them had HIV, but one hundred percent of them have Hep C. I found out about a needle exchange that was hiring. 10, 11 It was called Woman with a Point.  Later we changed our name to Access Works. 13 I started working there in 2000.  Yeah, because the internships I did while I was in school were with the methadone clinic and the women’s program. 6, 7, 8, 12 My first job was as an HIV tester and Woman with a Point. 11, 14 It was a federally funded program to do HIV testing in the drug using community. 5, 6, 8, 19 I worked there until 2007 and I went from being an HIV tester to a program manager to the executive director. 18, 19 AS: Is this with Access Works?  RF: This is with Access Works.  I was the executive director. 18, 19 During that time we started an overdose prevention program. 10, 19 Fentanyl had hit the streets. 5 There were these pockets of overdoses happening. 15 Mostly they would be tied back to a single source.  We started doing things with alerts like if there was bad dope we would have bad dope alerts.  We had a users group so people could share information. 6, 9, 13 It wasn’t a safe injection place it was just an information thing.  We exchanged needles. 10, 13 We gave clean needles, syringes, education, HIV testing, Hepatitis C testing, counseling. 10, 14, 15, 19 We got a grant from the Collmer Foundation to do overdose prevention. 10, 19 I had leraned about Narcan and there was a program in Chicago called the Chicago Recovery Alliance that was giving Narcan to people on the streets along with their syringe exchange. 5, 9, 10, 13, 17 I contacted the director there and developed an overdose prevention program based on that program where we teach rescue breating and CPR. 10, 13, 18, 19 Once people had been through this training that we gave we would give them a prescritpion for Narcan. 9, 10 At that point I had found a doctor who was willing to write prescriptions. 10, 12, 14 We couldn’t get the Narcan and give it to people, but we could give them a prescription and they could go to the pharmacy and they would fill it. 5, 9, 10 I think that’s how we started.  AS: Who was the doctor? 12, 14 RF: I can get back to you on that.  I don’t remember how I got connected to him.  I think I was just talking to people and networking. 9 I also connected with doctors at the University of Minnesota that were looking for community based experiences. 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 We started a wound care clinic because another thing that was happening were huge abscesses and people being afraid to go to the doctors. 9, 12, 14, 15, 19 We had medical insurance come on site and do wound care. 7, 14, 19 AS: That became part of what Access Works did? 9 AS: Where were you located?  RF: Eleven West Fifteenth Street in Minneapolis.  Right off of Fifteenth and Nicolette.  Minnesota  Aids Project also had a needle exchange. 10 I don’t know exactly the history of that. 12, 15 I think they started around the same time in the nineties. 12 We were basically the only ones doing overdose prevention in that time. 8, 10, 19 AS: Do you remember when Women with a Point started? 12 RF: Maybe ‘95, ‘96.  The founder of that, Sue Purchase, would probably love to talk to you. 14 She is delightful.  AS: I would love to talk to her. 14 RF: I think she lives out in Colorado now. 12 She is still actively doing work with women drug users. 5, 6, 12, 13 She has a program now called the Morpheus Project. 12 It does needle exchange and I think overdose prevention. 10, 19 She’s got a ton of historical stuff with heroin use in the Twin Cities and establishing needle exchange and stuff. 6, 10, 13, 16 AS: I want to know about the stigma about abcesses. 9, 12 People were getting these and not getting treated for them because they were afraid to go to the hospital to be drug tested. 5, 6, 8, 12 What was their fear? 10 RF: One of the fears was how they were treated. 10, 12 Another fear was being disrespected. 10 They were also not given pain medicine because they were heroin addicts. 6, 12, 14, 16 That kind of thing.  We would see people oozing, just really horrific wounds caused from injections. 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 AS: You found medical students from the U of M who would come and treat wounds off site? 7, 14 RF: It was at Access Works.  That only lasted one semester.  Then we developed a relationship with the Uptown Community clinic. 19 AS: Was it called NIP?  RF: On twenty-fourth and Hennepin? 5 AS: Yeah, right across from the Walgreens. 12 It just closed down. 5, 9, 10 RF: Did it close? 9, 10 AS: Yeah, because of the Affordable Care Act.  RF: Really?  AS: They had so many outstanding bills. 14 It is completely closed down. 5, 9, 10 RF: I think of her name, too, but whoever was the medical doctor there started something where they would see people when they dropped in or at certain times, I can’t remember, but we had some type of direct relationship with them where we would send our clients to them for wound care. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 AS: Did this include antibiotics?  RF: Yes.  Packing, teaching how to pack and repack wounds.  AS: Was that anything that ever happened to you? 15 My daughter’s father got some serious abscesses and he had to have both of his biceps taken out. 11, 16 I didn’t ever have to do anything like that.  AS: You listened to the advice.  Part of that is that people that get abscesses from muscling -- when people can’t find veins anymore, so they muscle -- I didn’t do that. 9 Oftentimes people go into the vein and then miss it. 9 The drug residue goes elsewhere. 5, 6 I didn’t ever have any of that.  AS: You’re the executive director of the program until 2007. 18, 19 Does it still exist?  RF: It does not exist anymore.  A series of events happened. 15 I look back and I think if I had made different choices things might have happened differently. 6, 15 I got the opportunity to be the executive director of Foundation. 18, 19 I was like, Oh, I’m the executive director! 18, 19 And I loved it. 14 I wasn’t paid a whole lot because it was a tiny organization, but I was the executive director. 18, 19 I got this position with Sobriety High Foundation.  It is twice the salary and I decided I wanted to go for it. 14, 18 RF: It is a foundation that -- it doesn’t exist anymore either; I leave this trail. 18 [laughs] 15 It was a foundation that ran three or four sobriety high schools. 7, 12 One in Edina, one in Maplewood, and I can’t remember the other one. 8 They ran sober high schools, which still exist, it just doesn’t exist in this manifestation. 7 Pease Academy, Insight in White Bear Lake.  There are a number of them.  It was really just a big fundraising arm, it was kind of a clunky thing. 5, 14, 18 It was a fundraising arm for these schools. 5, 7 I had gone from being involved with the communities, developing these programs and I didn’t realize how much I loved that. 14, 19 I was also really an effective fundraiser. 5, 18 I was really good at networking and finding resources and grant writing. 10, 18 I had built a strong foundation of a lot of the family foundations in the twin cities that supported us with the needle exhchange. 7, 10, 12 We had the Department of Health grant, the CDC grant, we had the Hennepin County grant. 9, 12 I thought a bigger, better, more money, whatever. 8, 10, 17, 18 I can be the director of this foundation. 18, 19 The 2008 the crash happens and no one is giving money anymore. 8, 10, 15 I was this brand new executive director trying to fundraise in the most horrible time. 5, 10, 16, 18, 19 It wasn’t happening. 15 The same thing happened to the new director of Access Works. 15, 16, 18, 19 She did not have the ties that I had.  I tried to pass things onto her, but her personality was such that -- it ended up being that her personality -- people would say, 9, 15 Oh, she took it down?  AS: People would say that about the new director at Access Works? 16, 18, 19 RF: She was in the same position as me as this new director and agency. 6, 16, 18, 19 You don’t have the footing, you don’t have the history, it is 2008 and the market has crashed, no one is giving money, foundations are closing, money is drying up. 5, 8, 10, 15 They ended up in 2008 or 2009 shutting their doors.  AS: Right in the middle of a crisis. 7 Right when it was needed.  RF: Minnesota  Aids Project was still doing the needle exchange. 10 It might be interesting to talk to someone there because I don’t know any of their overdose prevention stuff. 10, 12, 17, 19 Here we are with the Narcan doing the overdose training, distributing Narcan right then in 2009 and the doors shut. 12 No one I know really picked up the overdose stuff that I can see until the Steve Rumler Foundation. 6, 8, 12, 18 RF: They have done amazing stuff bringing it through legislation. 9 AS: Are we still missing this other piece that Access Works provided?  Are we still missing user groups? 6, 12, 13 Counseling?  Alerts?  I’ve seen the Rumler Foundation try to do alerts about bad heroin, but when they come onto my Facebook page I think there is likely a gap between the Rummler Hope Foundation pager that you were dealing with at Access Works. 6, 16 RF: We were definitely the face of the epidemic as far as Native Americans, Hispanic, African American, people of all economic backgrounds. 9, 13 AS: Do you know where the records are from Access Works? 12 Just the paperwork, your notes from board meetings, your fliers. 18 RF: We could ask Sue because she might know. 12 I can send an email to one of the board members.  She contacted me a few years ago to talk about something else. 13, 14 I might have some flash drives. 5 I don’t have any of the paperwork but we had a whole access database system where we tracked things. 9, 13, 16 AS: This is not what I expected and is making me very excited. 10 Just because these organizations were arising in a crisis for care for people. 9, 19 It is just interesting to me as an important part of the history because so far all you would know if you knew anything about this in this area in the last five or six years all you know about is Steve Rummler. 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 Unless you happen to know people in methadone clinics who are giving Narcan. 6, 8, 9, 12, 15 RF: I don’t know if you have talked to people at Valhalla Place yet. 9, 12 AS: Yeah, Chuck.  RF: Adams?  AS: I haven’t interviewed him yet.  He works for somewhere else now. 9, 12 I think he works for White Earth. 9 They are doing Narcan now. 12 It is out there, but this organization, especially Women with a Point -- RF: When we first started we had outreach workers on the streets. 5, 12, 14, 19 Even the stuff that Minnesta Aids Project, I don’t know if they are still doing the van. 12 The person behind that the mainline, he died a number of years ago. 9, 13, 14 His name is escaping me.  AS: What was main line? 9 RF: It still is what Minnesota Aids Project calls the needle exchange program. 10, 16 AS: So, in 2009 you are at the Sobriety High Foundation.  RF: I leave Access Works and go to Sobriety High Foundation. 18 Access Works closes and I leave Sobriety High after one year. 9, 10, 14, 18 I’m not sure if it was during that year, I’m not sure of the date Access Works closed, but I left in october of 2007. 5, 9, 10, 13, 14 I was the director of Sobriety High Foundation until October of 2008. 18, 19 Not a good fit for a variety of reasons. 10, 15 One was that I was in this fundraising position and I cannot raise funds. 5 Another was that I knocked heads with some of the board chairs. 14 It just was not a good fit. 10, 15 I learned that I liked that program development piece so much more than just the solid fundraising. 5, 10, 12 I left there in October in 2008 having no idea what I was going to do. 14 It was pretty scary. 10 This is a whole other thing, we may have to meet again! 18 The other thing that was going on in 2008 was that my now thirteen year old daughter, the trouble started when she was eleven. 12, 14 Things got really unmanageable. 18 She started cutting. 14 I know there were things that I was feeling ready to move away from the needle exchange, which coincided with my daughter starting to use. 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20 I felt like my whole life was around using. 6, 10, 11 Even though I loved working at Access Works and loved the participants they were still using addicts. 6, 9, 14 I was in recovery and I was a mom and my daughter was starting to use. 6, 13, 14 I go to Sobriety High Foundation, which is now still in the same field but now these are supposedly people in recovery or whatever. 9, 12 I end up putting her in treatment and there was a lot of in and out. 12, 13 AS: She was in treatment as a young teenager, then. 12, 13 AS: And that is based on your experience. 13, 18 You saw it.  You could see it. 6 RF: Oh, I saw.  It was kind of funny because there were times when I would be with my mother and she probably never knew that I was using because there were times with Brianna that it was so obvious. 6, 9, 16 I would just be like you are so high! 7 And my mother was still totally oblivious to it.  I was like, No wonder you didn’t know! 12 I can see it. 6 AS: By thirteen she’s in treatment? 12, 13 RF: By thirteen she’s in treatment. 12, 13 Not only is the economy crumbling, but it is totally chaotic with her.  All this advice.  I never went to Nar Anon partly because I was in NA and I had that as my foundation and my step work and my sponsor. 9, 16 With all these other things in recovery and change with all these people and places and if you don’t like it walk away. 9, 16, 18, 20 I couldn’t not parent my daughter. 20 I couldn’t kick her out.  I had to be immersed and deal with it.  This chaos is going on.  I leave that position. 18 I’m unemployed for six months. 11, 16 It was actually one of the greatest times. 7, 20 At this point I have another daughter who was born in recovery. 14 I was with her father and it was a planned pregnancy. 10, 16 Totally different story. 15 She is a totally different human being. 19 I am applying for jobs like crazy, don’t find anything, no one is hiring. 8, 11, 20 I am going on all these informational interviews which is another great thing I did. 20 I was also able to be present for my daughter at that time that was helpful. 5, 9, 10 There was a little reprieve and I was able to be around a lot. 20 I think she was in eighth grade at that point. 5 My next job was as a licenser for treatment centers with the Department for Human Services. 9, 11, 12, 13 Now I am back, well, I guess I never really left the field. 14, 16, 18 Now I have.  I finally left the field. 14 [laughs] 15 RF: I am a planning specialist.  I work in public health. 19 The reason I got this job was because it was public health and I have so much public health background. 11, 19 The division I am in is in environmental health and I do policy planning around solid waste and recycling. 6, 12, 19 [laughs] 15 Not doing chemical dependency stuff anymore. 13 AS: You became a licenser for treatment centers -- RF: In March of 2009 I start working for the Department of Human Services licensing treatment centers. 9, 12, 13 I got assigned all of the methadone clinics because I wanted to help make the law, Rule Thirty-one work for methadone clinics because it doesn’t work. 11, 13, 14, 18 In the Rule Thirty-one it says your treatment goal has to be the cessation of treatment. 12, 13 That doesn’t work for methadone because methadone can be this long -- AS: Yeah, that’s the whole point. 17 RF: There have been some changes made in statute that happens around some of these -- I don’t remember the exact language now it has been so long -- but there have been some changes to the methadone rules. 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 17 There is more flexibility.  We weren’t citing every single program for a violation.  AS: Does Rule Thirty-one give them federal funds? 8 RF: Rule Thirty-one does not give the federal funds. 8 That’s through Rule Twenty-five.  The Rule Thirty-one was a real specific thing that said that you had to have a treatment plan, you had to have treatment goals. 8, 12, 13 AS: Okay, so it is about how they run? 8 I am a licenser for these programs and my daughter is continuing to get worse. 13 Finally, she goes to Andale, I think that is the girl’s program in Eden Prairie. 7 I am a licenser and I am licensing programs and now I have a daughter that is in a treatment program. 12, 13 She didn’t ever use heroin that I know of. 6, 12, 13, 16 She was using meth, psychedelics, and alcohol. 6 She was just going off the deep end.  As far as I know she has never injected. 12, 16 As far as I know she has never used heroin. 6, 12, 13, 16 As far as I know she has overdosed. 12 AS: Is she sober today? 16 RF: She is not sober.  She drinks socially. 5, 19 I don’t know what -- you know? 12 She is young.  She is twenty-one now and she has a son. 12 I have a three year old grandson. 14 She is doing really well as far as her relationships. 18, 19 She has graduated college, she has a degree from Hamline, she has her real estate license. 7, 9, 13, 14 She loves parenting, she loves her son and she has been really present for him. 5, 10, 14, 18, 20 She did stop using for quite a long, substantial period of time. 6, 17, 18 At some point she decided to start drinking again. 5, 11, 14 Sometimes she drinks. 5 I don’t know and sometimes I try to pay attention: 12 Are you where you say you are going to be?  AS: Right, the bigger things.  RF: It was in that period that she was in treatment. 12, 13, 18 I saw this job in Ramsey County as a health educator. 11, 14, 19 I put an application in.  When I was interviewing for the position I was thinking that this was a pretty big deal. 10 I have worked in this field for so long and in so many different capacities: a counselor, a director, a licensed. 7, 13, 17, 18, 19 And I’m in recovery and my children are using. 5, 6, 14, 20 It was refreshing to have a professional life that was outside all of this. 9, 10 I have been at this job for five years. 11, 14 AS: You are a health educator? 14, 19 RF: I was a health educator and now I’m a planning specialist. 12, 14, 19 AS: For recycling?  You’ve got to explain this!  Or, you can tell me in an email.  RF: Part of this job is to get the information out to communities so that we recycle more. 11, 19 There is a state mandate that we have to recycle seventy-five percent of our solid waste by 2020. 13 We are developing policies to try to get us to that.  I don’t have to raise money anymore. 8, 10 I don’t have to supervise staff. 16 AS: Tell me what it was like for you to be going through recovery and having a daughter going off the deep end into substances? 6 How was that emotionally and psychologically?  RF: It pissed me off.  I thought it was really unfair. 9, 17, 18 I had done all of this work on this road to recovery, to be surrounding myself with all these positive people and good quality of life. 9, 10 Following a spiritual path. 10 Now I have to deal with all this shit and it has to be in my house again. 6, 13, 18 I was really, very angry. 11, 18 AS: How did you manage that with your daughter?  RF: I don’t think I managed it very well.  I was working in harm reduction so I could have great compassion for all these people that I worked with -- AS: And then come home and freak out with her. 5, 9, 14, 20 RF: Part of it was not so much the use, but the result of that use was that she was so incredibly disrespectful and such a little monster. 5, 6, 13, 18, 20 That would just set me off.  How dare she speak to me like that in my house? 6, 13 There became a lot of power struggles. 17 If I could go back and do that part of my life differently with more compassion then I maybe would. 5, 9, 10 It was very contentious.  I didn’t know how to help her. 12 AS: Isn’t that odd?  Isn’t that a peculiar thing?  It makes addiction just one possible element of a teenager’s struggle. 12, 14 Even with your history and awareness of what was going on it didn’t change how difficult or painful it was for you. 6, 9, 10, 15 You worked a progam.  Is that righ?  I still have a sponsor and I sponsor other women. 12 AS: When it is your child -- RF: Yeah, because there is one part of wanting so much for her not to have to go through my experience herself. 9, 14, 18 I already went through this; you don’t have to go through this and then seeing that she does have to go through what she has to go through. 6 Very conflicting feelings about how young a person should be to go into treatment and whether that is beneficial or detrimental. 12, 13, 15 When she was really young to try to keep her safe I didn’t see any other options. 6, 18 I was working full time and was a single mother again with another younger daughter that I was trying to protect from the stuff going on with my older daughter. 14, 20 She was in Fairview Riverside twice. 9 She did outpatient which didn’t work very well at Anthony Lewis. 11 Then ultimately I took her to Onbelay.  I think it is part of the Anthony Lewis centers. 9 Their girls inpatient program. 7, 11 She really loves to write and she got really engaged. 14, 18 Kind of like me there is a part of her that is really into that self growth and self exploration while maintaining some level of destructive behavior. 9, 10, 18 AS: What about your younger daughter? 20 RF: She is a gem.  [laughs] 15 I’m not comparing them at all!  No, I love them both. 14 AS: Oh, yeah, of course.  You don’t have to tell me.  I have two and my youngest is completely different.  Not a ripple of trouble ever.  RF: My fifteen year old -- and I think of myself at fifteen and my eldest at fifteen and she is engaged in school, she does sports, she dances. 7, 14 Her biggest thing now that I think I have to put on a leash is piercing. 12 She got her ears double pierced and now she got her nose pierced for her fifteenth birthday and now she wants her belly button pierced. 12, 16 I’m like, Oh, no I’ve unleashed this piercing monster!  That’s her thing.  Could be worse.  She is pleasant, she is not rude or disrespectful.  AS: What does she think about substances that you know? 6, 12 RF: She knows that in other countries drinking is more a part of the way you grow up. 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18 She’ll say that she wants to try alcohol and we have conversations around what that means and the legal age and why the law is twenty-one and whether or not that makes sense or not and that her father is also an addict in recovery. 6, 13, 14, 16 I had nineteen years in January and he had twenty-one years in January. 14 We met in recovery and he has been in long term recovery. 17 We have conversations.  She saw what it did to her older sister. 20 I don’t know that she’ll never use because she has curiosities about what it means. 6, 12, 13, 16 She is curious about stuff.  AS: But you talk about it.  RF: We talk about it, yeah.  AS: Anything else you can think of?  RF: No. I am also in touch with some of those people that I thought were so cool and I idolized. 9, 17, 18 Some of them are clean and some aren’t but I could ask them.  Some are in their late forties or early fifties.  They would have that perspective.  They were really entrenched in the heroin use in the eighties in the Twin Cites and the punk scene. 6, 13, 16, 18 I can get you in touch with Sue.  AS: That would be great. 20 Thank you,  Rae.  RF: Thank you. "
"7","Coleman_Brandon","Adam Fairbanks Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer August 10, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Adam Fairbanks-AF Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I'm at French Meadow Cafe.  It's August 10th, 2017.  I'm with Adam Fairbanks.  Adam, will you state your name and say you give me permission?  AF: Okay.  My name is Adam Fairbanks, and I give Amy permission to do this interview.  AS: Alright, do you want to start with where you were born, where you grew up, just a little bit of family history, childhood stuff? 12, 14, 15, 20 AF: So, I was born in Bemidji, Minnesota on July 5th, 1983. 14 My father is Native American enrolled in the White Earth Tribe, and my mom is non-Native mix of various European blood, and I have an older sister. 14, 16, 20 She is thirty-seven, and I have a younger brother who is thirty-one, and a twenty-one year old sister. 8, 14, 20 Both of my sisters are half sisters. 14, 20 My parents went to school—tribal school in kindergarten, Fond du Lac where we moved after I was born. 7, 14, 15, 19, 20 Lived in the Duluth area, and my parents got divorced shortly after kindergarten. 7, 8, 18, 20 I was a little young, gay person, kind of picked on in school. 7, 9, 20 My parents got divorced, we moved back to Bemidji. 7, 15, 20 I didn't really know I was gay at the time, but was picked on throughout elementary and middle school. 7, 9, 12, 18 Kind of started hanging out with the wrong crowd, but in many ways it was a protective crowd that I was drawn to. 5, 11, 18 I think that was part of the reason why I hung out with these kind of badass Indian girls. 7, 9, 11 They did—they protected me in many ways from the folks that, you know, the non-Native white guys who would pick on me. 12, 18, 19 I was getting in quite a bit of trouble in Bemidji, which is where we moved to from, you know, it was first grade until sixth grade. 5, 7, 12, 14, 15, 20 Started getting in trouble.  My mom decided she was going to move us out of the area to kind of get me away from the trouble I was getting into. 8, 14, 15, 18, 20 That of course didn't change my behavior necessarily.  I went wherever we went, so.  [pause] 6, 13 We moved to North Dakota, to Grand Forks for a brief minute, then Mayville, North Dakota. 7, 15, 19 Then my grandmother got Alzheimer’s, and my mother wanted to move closer to her in Wabena, so I was there for eighth grade. 5, 9, 10, 15, 18 So eighth grade, you know, I was still kind of getting in trouble. 5, 12 I came out to my mom at the age of sixteen, and I was kind of tired of moving around. 5, 14 I was living in a rural area as a gay man, and it was difficult. 8, 9, 10 And I didn't want to do it anymore, so I told my mom I would like to move out on my own, and drop out of school, and get my GED and go to college. 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16 She said she supported that, and so I did.  I dropped out at the age of sixteen of high school, went and got my GED, and then I went to St. Cloud State University. 5, 7, 11 AS: So when you say trouble what do you mean by trouble?  AF: I think in elementary and middle school it was mostly getting in a lot of fights. 7, 12 AS: Because you were being picked on?  So getting in a lot of fights, smoking cigarettes, there was some dabbling with alcohol and marijuana, and then when I came out I ended up going into adolescent treatment for a brief minute, and that's when I actually became sober as like a fifteen year old. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 And then I came out and that's when I went to school and college, and was living on my own in a larger area. 7, 8 It wasn't the Twin Cities, it wasn't a city, per say.  St. Cloud is a city, I mean I— AS: Compared to where you were before. 5, 14 But it wasn't a metropolitan area. 8 So, I felt a lot safer at that point. 11 AS: Did you live by yourself?  I moved in with a boyfriend, actually. 7, 15, 20 And was in school and lived off campus. 7, 14 I was taking some pre-college courses because I got my GED, so I was taking those. 7, 10, 11 I was there for a little while, but then got exposed to Minneapolis, and was like, ""Oh my god,"" I had to move there. 11, 15, 20 [laughs] 15 To be around the rest of the gays. 9 I moved to Minneapolis. 7, 15 Broke up with that boyfriend and moved to Minneapolis. 7, 15, 20 Got a job. 11 That's when the on and off again adult learning kind of stuff happened where I couldn't do school full-time because I needed to work and take care of myself, so then I would work, do a job, and then get kind of on my feet in that job, and so I would start school again. 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19 Then I would get a new job, so it was like on and off of school. 7, 11, 16 This is like nineteen through the age of twenty.  I was just kind of working these odd jobs. 11 I was working at a restaurant briefly. 19 Then a salon for men. 12 I was like a front desk person.  I got into drug use earlier on. 5, 6, 13, 15 I was twenty years old, am thirty-four now. 12, 14 There was probably a full year of substance use with methamphetamine. 6, 13, 14 Maybe it was longer than that. 17 A year and a half probably. 14 I really lost my way at that point. 11, 18 I wasn't going to school. 7 I wasn't really working. 18 My life was really overrun by substance use, drug addiction for methamphetamine. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 Things fell apart after that year and a half and I ended up going to treatment a couple times. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 Went to PRIDE Institute for a few days and left, and then went back a month later for a few days, and left. 14, 16 I finally went another month later and completed the program. 7, 16 After I got out of that treatment I got a job working at a drop-in center called the Aliveness Project. 5, 11, 12, 13 They're an AIDS service organization in Minneapolis that works with people living with HIV. 9, 19 They had a drop-in center and it was an entry level job. 5, 11 I was kind of exposed to that environment just because I knew people who had HIV. 9, 12, 16 The job that I got was working within a small grant with the Minnesota Department of Health—the county. 9, 11, 12, 19 Ryan  White counseling did the program. 19 The job was to be in the drop-in center and talk to people about harm reduction and safer drug use. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14 I think my title was Peer Educator. 14 So as a person who had had some experience in substance abuse my job was to talk to other people on how to do that in a safer way. 6, 9, 11, 13, 18 Well, at the time, I mean this was really early on. 18 It was 2000—I'm thirty-four now so it was twelve years ago. 12, 13, 14 2005, early 2005.  I didn't know anything really about harm reduction. 5, 12, 14, 18 I had heard about it when I was at PRIDE Institute. 9 Kathy Vader is a therapist, and she had a group about it.  During that group it didn't really sound like anything more than common sense, more or less. 14, 18 I got that entry-level job, and I read a book. 11 I went to her and said, ""How do I learn about this?"" 10 And she said, ""Read this harm reduction psychotherapy book."" 5, 12, 14 So I read it and it made a lot of sense to me.  I was like, ""Wow.""  The abstinence based world that was taught to me at the PRIDE Institute I guess made sense to a lot of people because there were so many people involved in that, but I also had understood that there were a lot of people using drugs, so that model didn't work for them. 5, 6, 9, 13 [laughs] 15 My job was to teach those people how to do things in a better way before they were ""ready"" to be completely abstinent, drug and alcohol free. 5, 6, 9, 11, 18 I became really passionate and motivated about that model. 18 I was involved in the abstinence based recovery world at that time, and I was apart of this committee for this conference that they held every year called GLBT in Recovery, held a conference, like a workshop. 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 I was on the committee, and I said, ""Why don't we do a little workshop in harm reduction?"" 5, 9, 14, 15, 20 And they like almost chased me out of there!  [laughs] 15 Like they thought I was crazy. 17, 18, 20 They said, ""That's enabling people. 9 Telling them that it's okay.""  It was such a threat.  And I was like this isn't a threat.  It's a good way to get people into this model that we are all apart of. 9, 10, 11, 18 To keep them from getting diseases.  All the public health benefits of harm reduction. 5, 14, 15, 19 People just didn't see it that way, and I think there was just this block from them being able to because then it challenged, I think, their own view around abstinence. 6, 18 AS: Does that surprise you considering HIV—using condoms and safe sex—that you were chased out of the room? 6, 9, 12, 14 Because it kind of surprises me.  I was very naive about the whole thing.  I just thought people would like get what I was talking about. 9, 17, 18 [laughs] 15 I didn't think I would be so controversial.  It was very controversial.  I became very angry and resentful that what I was really passionate about was viewed so negatively by the people, the community that I became apart of. 5, 9, 11, 18, 19 AS: They saw it just as harm reduction just as it related to drug use? 5, 6, 13, 14 AF: Correct.  And that's how I presented it, too. 5, 10 Harm reduction is obviously involved in public health, but from the perspective of that conference it was harm reduction and public health were viewed separately to the drug and alcohol abstinence based recovery world. 5, 6, 13, 14, 19 It's like, ""Public health makes sense. 19 Of course we support condoms,"" but we start to talk about public health and drug use/harm reduction—then it's a threat. 5, 6, 13, 14, 19 And really problematic for them. 12, 18 I got angry and was basically like “f” you guys. 11, 19 I care about those people that you're afraid of helping and think that they are just not ready, and I became very passionate. 9, 19 I actually got another job after that at Minnesota AIDS Project shortly after. 7, 11, 18 Nine months later. 11, 16 Probably 2005 still.  In the needle exchange program. 10 That's when I decided I was no longer part of that community both their choices of them not really wanting me there, as well as my choice of not really wanting to be there. 6, 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 AS: The AA community? 19 I don't know if I'm an anomaly or what. 12 I just didn't need that in order to—I think in that book I read it was just like I could get rid of my urge to use drugs if I made a commitment not to do it. 5, 6, 12, 13 I would just tell myself, you don't use that anymore. 6, 13 You're a non-crystal meth user. 6, 13 That decision removed the ambivalence that I had, and without ambivalence I was just able to be sober. 7, 14, 15 My recovery was based around my passion, and my passion was based around helping people that nobody else gave a shit about. 9, 13, 18 AS: Do you remember the name of that book?  AF: Harm Reduction Psychotherapy by Patt Denning is the book. 12, 14 So I worked in the needle exchange van of Minneapolis. 10 Driving around this big ambulance with Roger Moore.  He passed away, but he worked there forever. 18, 20 Fifteen years or something like that before he died. 14 Running that ambulance around.  And there were two needle exchange programs: there was Minnesota AIDS Project, the ambulance, and then there was Access Works, the set site location. 10 It was a store-front needle exchange. 10 You know, you know about Access Works. 12 Well, this was prior to Access Works closing, which was really a big loss for Minneapolis, but after being there being part time—I was under a grant so like thirty hours a week or something like that. 9, 15, 18 They were trying to figure out how to make me full time, and there was a partnership between Minnesota AIDS Project and Access Works, and I think the Red Door Clinic, which is the Hennepin County STD clinic. 9, 12, 14 They had this grant to work with gay men who used methamphetamine to do education on harm reduction. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 It was a collaborative.  I talked to my boss and said, ""How's the program doing?""  She said, ""Not well.  We are really underperforming. 18 No one is going to our groups. 8, 12 The people that are going aren't really part of the population."" 9, 18 AS: Who was your boss?  AF: Kathy Strobel was her name.  She was awesome.  And so I said, ""Well, let me do that!  I know all those people!"" 9, 12 [laughs] 15 I was involved in that community. 14, 19 I could get them to come to that group.  I've always had this high level of confidence in my ability to get things going. 7, 18 One of the people that I know, a colleague of mine, she said, ""There's thinking outside of the box, and you don't even really have a box."" 9, 12, 18 [laughs] 15 Like it doesn't even exist!  AS: You don't feel constrained.  Honestly I think some rules should be changed. 8, 13 They are ridiculous, or they are a barrier to success. 14 And if they can be changed we should try to change them. 13 I think most people operate within, ""Oh, these are the rules. 9, 13 This is how we've always done things."" 18 And I just don't agree with them.  If it's a barrier change it, is the way I look at it. 18 Thinking creatively to get those people to come to the group. 9 There was the little incentive budget, so I said, well, people who use meth need food, so let's get pizza—because it was all we could afford, Domino's Pizza. 6, 9, 13, 20 And we'll do five-dollar gift cards to come to the group.  Over a period of nine months the group was a huge success. 11, 16, 18 It started off with me and just a couple of people. 9, 11 And then the word of mouth got out there, and more people started coming, and more pizza had to be ordered, and the group wasn't specific to—it was a harm reduction group for gay men who used crystal meth, but it was also written in the grant, 'or had used crystal meth' and I was like, I didn't know how that was going to work. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 How are we going to get people in recovery to go to the group of people who are using? 6, 9 I'm like let's try it.  I reached out to a few people and said, ""You should come check out this group."" 9, 14 I was a recruiter.  I was a harm reduction activist, and passionate about that work. 5, 14 Public health person, and recruiter. 19 So I got more people to come. 9 It worked fine. 11 It actually was awesome. 7 It got people in recovery, even in the abstinence based recovery world, to support people who were actively using. 6, 9, 13 And we are all hanging out in the same room talking to each other, and not having it be a threat to the people necessarily. 9, 14 I mean they chose to come to this harm reduction group, so I think it really just strengthened their ability to be sober more than be a threat to their sobriety because it kind of removed that belief that, ""I need to completely hide from any risk of interaction with drug use."" 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 By the end of the grant—it was unfortunate; it was so successful—at the end of the grant there were twenty-three people. 9 I think the maximum number we had was twenty-three, and the grant period ended. 18 Things changed. 13 Access Works lost their funding, some of their funding. 11 The grants changed. 13 Red  Door Clinic got some money, and so I left Minnesota AIDS Project and I went to Red Door, which is the Hennepin County public health clinic—STD clinic. 8, 10, 14, 19 And that was again an HIV grant.  Still in school, still adult learning on again off again. 7, 10 AS: What were you majoring in?  What were you drawn to? 5 AF: I was not sure.  I was just taking generals, technical college. 7, 11 And then during that time I enrolled at Metro State, which is a four-year college, and I decided to go for like an individualized program because there was no public health at a bachelor's level program in Minnesota, or that I was aware of. 7, 14, 19 So I decided to design my own degree and it was going to be around harm reduction public health was the focus. 5, 11, 14, 19 And with an individualized program you get to kind of use work experience and write essays and work with an instructor to kind of craft your own class around it. 6, 7, 13, 14, 18 So I used a lot of what I had done with work to design the degree and get some school credit for it. 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 16 Because it was so unique.  I mean it was like how else do you get that experience? 18 And I just continued to advance and advance in my career without a degree. 15, 19 Because I had this very specialized niche of working with gay men around substance use, and people didn't—that just didn't exist. 6, 9, 12, 13 Like where do you find somebody like that who has even like direct experience with it themselves? 18 And who isn't a total disaster, right, waiting to happen. 12, 15 So sadly Access Works closed. 5, 9, 10 The van continued to operate.  AS: Access Works closed in like 2009, 2008? 5, 9, 10 Somewhere around there?  AF: Yes.  So this was after I had started in my career—2005, 2006 at MAP [Minnesota AIDS Project]. 14, 15, 19 I was there for a couple years, and then I went to Red Door Clinic, and that was shortly after I started there was when Access Works—they weren't able to survive on their other grants so then they closed their doors. 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18 They got reorganized—MAP got the money—and the needle exchange services operated through the van exclusively in the state. 8, 10, 19 Lee Hertel, who you and I have talked about, was kind of—is it okay for me to talk about this?  You'll have to check.  AS: I'll check.  He's been interviewed one-on-one.  AF: Right.  He was a participant in that group. 9 The pizza group.  And he and I had similar backgrounds, right? 12 And he was so hyper [laughs]. 15 Couldn't sit still, and kind of a big mess.  AS: He's almost twenty years older than you. 14, 20 AF: Yes.  And I remember like saying, ""We need to get more drug users involved in this HIV prevention world because we're losing funding. 5, 6, 10, 13, 19 The needle exchange programs are losing funding. 10 We need to have a larger voice. 17 How do we organize?""  And so I talked to Lee and I said, ""You should get on this committee, and you should be the drug user. 5, 6, 13 Like the gay, male drug user and represent that community."" 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 19 And he was really, he just wasn't quite sure, and I said, ""I really think you could do this. 11, 18 You majored in English, you're well written, you have a lot of energy."" 5 [laughs] 15 And so he applied and I don't remember what committee it was, but I think that's really when Lee entered in his role of activism as a drug user activist. 5, 6, 10, 13, 18 And I went off to the Red Door and started doing HIV testing and working in a clinic setting.  I was there for four and a half years. 14 I was on the inside of this cynical world as kind of a government robot doing these HIV testing stuff, but I was always an activist just trying to do stuff on the outside, like influence things. 9, 12, 18 And Lee was one vessel I was able to use to do that. 6, 13 I go, ""Did you hear Ryan White? 9 Go to this meeting and you should talk about this."" 18 AS: So you would provide him with information that gave him— AF: Yes.  That gave him intel.  And worked to figure how to not manipulate, but change the system internally to move this movement forward because again the reason it was so easy to get passionate about this work was A, I had previous experience with it, but it was so easy to care for people that nobody else gave a shit about. 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 And that is what kept me really passionate, and like sober. 18 And I had made that commitment, and I wasn't able to do the good work that I was doing if I was a crystal meth addict. 6, 10, 12, 14 [laughs] 15 Some people can. 9 Lee is a good example of one. 10 I never tried, but I wouldn't. 16 [laughs] 15 So that was when I went and I called Chuck [Hilger] one day. 16 I met Chuck.  Well, actually I met Karen Greensend. 7 She was the owner of Valhalla Place.  She was crazy, in many ways, a friend of mine. 18, 20 Crazy in a good way. 10, 18 Motivated.  She didn't have a box either.  The only other person I've met like that.  And she just came and crashed a meeting one day. 16, 18 She was like, ""Oh, they're having a drug user meeting over at MAP? 5, 6, 13, 18 She just showed up, and she had started this methadone clinic and was trying to learn about the community and get her clinic going, and it was called Valhalla Place. 6, 8, 10, 19 I don't remember when they opened, but now they're the biggest provider in the state. 12 AS: It wasn't even ten years ago. 13, 14 AS: Right, if you're talking about 2009.  And that's when I met her.  I was working at Red Door and we went to this meeting and she was there. 18 We clicked right away and we stayed in touch. 12, 18, 20 I talked to her about maybe wanting to work there. 5 She ran a methadone clinic.  It was a really good overlap of public health and a medical clinic and harm reduction and working with drug users. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 I mean it was a perfect fit for me in my next transition. 15, 17 But it was a private company so it was something I wasn't used to. 6, 13, 14, 16 I was always used to working with non-profits and government. 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 The time came.  I met Chuck.  He became the executive director and I reached out to him and I said, ""Hey, Chuck. 18, 19 I have this big donation of needles that was provided by somebody across the country that mailed"" —I don't remember how honestly I got them, but it was this big pallet full of needles that someone offered me—and I said, ""I would like to store them there, because I don't want to put them in my house, at the Valhalla clinic."" 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 19, 20 And he said, ""Okay, well I'll talk to Karen.""  And Karen is like, ""Sure, I don't care."" 19 And I said, ""If I store them there would it be okay if I came once a week and then gave them out? 15 Like on a Friday if I gave needles out to people? 9, 10, 16 And we started a little needle exchange?"" 10, 20 And he's like, ""Okay, sure.""  [laughs] 15 And so that little needle exchange started. 10, 20 I got a bunch of people involved. 9 I used to go to speak at these—the HIV prevention world had interns at the U of M, and public health students. 6, 10, 13, 16, 19 I talked about my passion, and it rubbed off on people and they wanted to get involved. 9, 18 So then I had all these like bachelor's level, sometimes master's level, public health students that were like running this needle exchange program out of a methadone clinic with me with the support of Valhalla Place, and I thought this is a really good way to get people to come in to a clinic setting, become familiar with it, and then enroll in services. 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19 It's like a marketing tool. 5 And that was kind of like, oh, I started to get into the business thinking of it as like public health and working within a private company and seeing how we were able to do good but make money. 6, 8, 10, 14, 19 AS: And sustain yourselves, sustain the business because non-profits are so dependent on grants that are the whims of the government. 12, 15 AF: Right.  And so I was able to convince them that you should invest money into this because this is good for your bottom line, and it's also good to get people into treatment, which is why we are ultimately here. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 The CFO of organizations may not think that way, but the people who start the programs do. 9, 18 And that's all the counselors, and clients, you know, they're all about the treatment. 10, 12, 13 So, and I was all about the harm reduction and started the needle exchange. 5, 10, 14 And then I asked if I could work there.  I was hired as their Harm Reduction Services Director, I think was my title, and I was there for about a year. 5, 14 The needle exchange was successful, and I went to a conference. 10 It was a White Earth Hep C conference in 2015, yes, 2015.  It was in May.  When I was there I got a phone call from Chuck and he was like, ""Oh, you know our CFO is bitching that you're just footing around at conferences and not generating revenue for us. 8, 12, 14, 16, 20 You should really ask around and just see if there are opportunities for partnering and doing something with other organizations."" 6, 9, 18, 19 So I asked around, and again White Earth is my tribe.  I ran into Clinton Alexander, and he's like, ""Yeah, I totally know exactly who needs you. 12 There's this new program they are trying to start called the MOMS program, and they're looking for a Suboxone provider."" 16 I was like—went over and talked to them and Julie Williams she was the manager.  And Mina Spalla, she was the nurse.  And they were directed by Tribal Council to direct this program in like three months. 11, 16, 18 And they had everything they needed.  They had the counseling, and the mental health, and the nursing. 12, 19 They had everything they needed to run a program they just didn't have the prescribing doctors. 8, 10, 12, 14 And so I said, ""Can I be of assistance?""  They said, ""Well, if you can get prescribing—a doctor for us that would be awesome."" 10, 12, 14 So called Chuck and said, ""Hey, Chuck these guys need a prescriber. 10 Is it okay to do telehealth? 19 He said, ""Yeah.  If we can get the software to do this let's do telehealth and we'll just start the program."" 19 So then I met with some folks from administration and talked with them and they were supportive of the partnership and wanted to proceed with a contract. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 We started with a program that had, I don't—I want to say like seventeen days to get the program going and we did it. 16 We met the deadline. 9, 16 I think we did it in fifteen days. 16 So, you know, I worked with—Valhalla Place at that time was a big organization, so I had access to nursing staff, and as a team we put it together very quickly. 8, 9, 12 AS: Was this before they transitioned to Meridian or Alina? 8, 17 AF: Before, yeah this was before.  So this was Valhalla Place prior to the Meridian merger.  Right around that time actually. 7 So White Earth did this to address the babies that were born exposed to opiates. 5, 14 And were being removed from the home. 7, 15 It was a huge problem on the White Earth Reservation. 12 All reservations really. 18, 19 And this was an approach—they wanted specifically Suboxone. 8, 18 They didn't want to do methadone.  This was an approach they wanted to move forward with because it was what they learned was the evidence based way to deal with it. 10, 13, 15, 18 And there was this reluctance, and it was controversial, but there was also urgency and other things weren't working.  The program started.  We did the prescribing through Valhalla Place. 10 Patients met with the doctors. 12, 14 We had telehealth and then they got all their treatment and dosing at White Earth. 12, 13, 19 And it was awesome.  People enrolled.  They were a little nervous at first I think, you know, going to the program. 12, 14, 20 I was the liaison, the point of contact at Valhalla Place so if they had issues they called me and I would address it. 5, 12, 13 And I was really glad to be of assistance to my tribe. 18 Over time—the program evolved very quickly.  Within months they were changing from just the pregnant women and the women with child protection cases to their partners or the men of the women, the fathers of the babies. 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 Then it was everyone who lived in the house. 6, 7, 13 Treat the whole household. 6, 13 And then it was the communities demanding access that were not part of the demographic, and it was really apparent within a short period of time, I want to say six months or so, that White Earth needed to provide these services across the entire Reservation, and there was such high demand that they needed to open multiple clinics. 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 And so I decided—the Meridian merger had started to happen. 14, 15 I was not exactly sure—I felt uneasy, you know, uneasy about the future, and so I reached out and said, “Hey, I'd like an opportunity to help start those clinics that you've expressed interest in.” 10, 11, 12, 19 And so I was hired by White Earth to do that. 5 And there was a year period of time where we worked towards getting the, I want to say four additional clinics open. 14, 18 Five, sorry.  So there were two on the Reservation, then there was one in Bemidji, which is four hours north of Minneapolis. 15 North and east of White Earth Reservation.  And then there was Minneapolis next.  There was the MOMS Program started in Minneapolis as well as the medical assisted treatment kind of for everybody, Native American clinic here in Minneapolis. 7, 12, 13, 14 And it was very rapid pace that we moved. 7, 15 I mean getting, you know, I recruited a doctor, and helped with some of the clinic design, and how to set up the dosing windows. 11, 12, 14 Just things that I had learned from my work at Valhalla Place. 10 AS: So are the clients coming and getting a dose of Suboxone everyday? 10, 16 AF: Correct.  AS: So they're not getting a prescription. 10 AF: Correct.  AS: Why that model?  AF: Diversion concerns.  When you have a lack of access, and something is just becoming available, there is a huge demand for—you know demand is there, lack of access is there, you have a black market for it. 5, 9, 12 It's worth a lot of money. 8, 10 So, what White Earth did, and what I think was a really good idea, was to keep tight control of it until there was broader access. 9, 10, 18 Then once it's readily available people can just go into a clinic and enroll—then you can start to look at giving people take-out medications to have at home because the demand has decreased in fulfilling the needs of the population. 5, 9, 14 AS: So that is a little bit of a different model with Suboxone. 8, 20 AF: Well, it's a methadone model.  AS: Right, it's a methadone clinic model— AF: Rather than a prescription, take it home model. 10 And are those common around the country that you know of, or is that unique? 12, 19 AF: I want to say it's unique to tribes specifically. 12 I'm not aware of any other Suboxone only programs that have that tight control and dosing policies and limitations. 8, 18 AS: Okay.  So that would be a unique aspect of the Tribal program.  AF: Correct.  And that's what I'm aware of is how they're being operated.  Now there are also people who probably go to a physician that live near the Reservation and get a prescription. 9, 10 So there's nothing that would prevent you from being able to do that other than you can't find the doctor. 10, 12, 14 AS: But this also allows clients to be brought into other services and support that they might need. 10, 19 AF: Correct.  And White Earth always provided culturally based services. 13, 14, 18, 19 It was about how do we incorporate culture into programming for treatment, and having people that are Native American providing the services. 9, 12, 13, 19 Having it be for the people, by the people. 9 Comfort, and culturally based, and connecting people to something that they maybe have never had access to, or have lost along the way. 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 So that was a really cool part of the White Earth model is connecting culture to treatment. 9, 12, 13, 17, 18 And probably a really important component of how, you know, to make that work for the people who need it. 8, 9, 12, 18 And you know if culturally based treatment isn't what people needed then maybe it's not the right program for them. 5, 9, 12, 13 But it wasn't like cramming culture down people's throats either. 9 It was like this was just our model and this is how we do things.  We help you participate in the ceremony, but you certainly need to go to your three hours of group everyday three days a week, or whatever the treatment goals were. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 AS: Right, there's minimum participation, and then there's other opportunities. 9, 19 AF: Correct.  And over time the rules started to become a little bit more like, okay, we can give so-and-so a take out medication. 13, 14, 20 We can be closed on Sundays. 5, 9, 10, 16 We can give people take outs on the holidays. 9, 16 And just over time things gradually started to evolve to more of a—less controlled. 18 And I think that it made sense to happen that way. 15, 18 AS: Do you have any sense of the success rate?  AF: Yes.  I mean as far as I know there weren't any deaths from the year that I was there for people that were actually enrolled in the program. 7, 9, 12, 14, 18 So that's, you know, opiates can be fatal in many ways, so keeping people on Suboxone and providing treatment is very effective. 8, 9, 12, 13, 18 Was Narcan available?  We made Narcan available through the programs.  AS: So participants could bring it home and have it at home? 9 And then Clinton also did like harm reduction work on the Reservation too. 5, 14 So he was doing kind of more true harm reduction, non-MAT [medically assisted treatment], needle exchange work, and Narcan distribution. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 So, yeah, there was actually a lot of Narcan available. 7 And the other tribe that had significant need and White Earth was providing services to out of the Bemidji program was called Oshkimanidoo, was Red Lake Nation, which is thirty minutes north of Bemidji. 11, 15, 19 So they were going to a White Earth clinic, and traveling because it's a long distance away, so spending time in a van, and having to get from their house to the van, and from the van to the clinic, and then the clinic back home. 6, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20 It was—it is quite the ordeal currently. 11 And I ended my employment with White Earth recently and wanted to be of assistance to Red Lake because they expressed interest in wanting to do a program like that. 10, 12, 18 The need is there.  The travel is ridiculous that people have to go through. 9, 14 And I have a very unique skill set to offer.  So I was brought on as a consultant on July 12th of this year. 14 So, yeah, I started on July 12th, and Red Lake declared a public health emergency the following Tuesday. 5, 10, 14, 16, 19 AS: Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you.  Do they kind of have a plan in place to declare that emergency, and to hire you? 14 I mean were things kind of— AF: I don't know exactly how that came to be. 12 AS: I'll have to find someone to talk to about that.  I mean, I think I could— AS: That's a really powerful thing to do, as we just saw this last week when we thought the President of the United States might declare opioids an emergency, and he didn't. 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18 AF: Right.  So, yeah, I don't know. 12 It might be really... 18 I'll see who I can put you in touch with. 6 They declared that public health emergency that Tuesday, and I started [pause in recording]. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 19 Red  Lake declared the state of emergency. 5, 14 They're looking at two major things within the resolution. 9 And I've asked for support from the Governor's Office and a bunch of other federal agencies to help them address this, I don't think it is specific, but—well, it is. 5, 8 Opiates I know are like the primary focus, and so they're looking at banishment, which I don't know a lot about. 12, 19 That's part of the resolution is banishment. 9, 12 And they're also looking at the Narcan, other public health type things. 19 Medically assisted treatment, that's what I was hired to do was bring on the Suboxone clinic. 5, 8, 12, 13, 14 I work with their chemical health division. 6, 13, 19 And I love starting new things, so it's really fun. 14, 16, 18 I'm in my element right now. 12 As far as the model I think both White Earth and Red Lake have really great models of integrating culture, and this biomedical drug treatment approach. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 A Western medicine approach combined with traditional, culturally based treatment. 12, 13, 14 I think it's a good route for tribes to go. 10, 12 I believe that it does conflict a little bit with the traditional way that like alcohol has been addressed. 5, 6, 18, 20 But in my opinion the alcohol use, and all the substances need to be looked at as unique to each other. 6, 13 We can't lump marijuana with heroin. 16 Marijuana doesn't kill people. 9 So, like I think every substance needs to be—services need to be uniquely planned around it. 6, 19 There can't be a one-size fits all approach. 15 Twelve steps is a support group, not a treatment modality. 12, 13 Evidence based treatment is the way to go. 12, 13, 18 Medication assisted treatment has the most evidence. 12, 13, 14 Methadone has been around forever.  [laughs] 15 And this daily dosing model, and getting people counseling and medication has been around for a really long time. 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 It's just taken states, and tribes, and different places to get over their reluctance around the controversy of treating substance use disorder with medication. 6, 12, 13, 14 But there's been alcohol medications for a while. 6, 14 Antabuse, I mean why is that okay? 6, 13 [laughs] 15 But then opiates aren't.  I guess it's a narcotic, but if it's a treatment that works, and it doesn't get people high, which everybody thinks it does, why wouldn't you use it? 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 17 Speaking to the White Earth outcomes of no deaths we're just getting people on their feet, and all that stuff. 9, 18 I mean that doesn't address the larger issue in my mind, which is poverty. 5, 13 I mean that's the true culprit I think of addiction. 5, 12, 14 I think until we address that we're never going to get out of this. 5, 16 Livable wages, getting out of crappy living environments, education, opportunity, jobs. 11, 12, 14, 15, 19 All of those things that make somebody feel valuable, and not living in fear of not having enough. 10 There's so much around I mean people shouldn't feel that way. 9, 18 So I guess that's what I would say is needed to get over this issue is addressing the way we look at substance use as a consequence of poverty, and we need to address that. 5, 6, 13, 18 Because we can give people Suboxone and we can keep them from using heroin, but at the end of the day they still go back to the same place they were living unless we give them other opportunities. 6, 8, 9, 16, 19 And then we're preventing them from dying but we need to also work towards getting them opportunities to be successful and thrive. 10, 19 AS: And it kind of connects to your own experience when you talked about being committed to something in a new way, or a new thing in your life versus using to continue using. 6, 10, 14, 16, 18 It's about creating...  AF: Feeling good about what I'm doing in my life. 10 AS: And seeing a future, and seeing potential. 6 AF: Exactly.  I mean when I was using drugs I had, you know I was—my partner says the horizon line that people see in front of themselves, you know, at that time was only a few inches in front of my face. 5, 6, 9, 12 I didn't see very far beyond what was directly in front of me. 6, 18 And then over time as I advanced in my career, and I became more successful and able to move towards being able to provide a much larger contribution in my life, my horizon line really sort of started to grow. 9, 10, 14, 15, 18, 19 In addition to not really having a box, now I don't necessarily see the limitations, you know, the not having a degree thing has never held me back. 6, 12, 16, 18 It's something I'm going to get.  I have like two classes left. 7, 14 But here I am again in a situation where I'm consulting, and I have a very short deadline to get this program going and it's like, okay, start and stop, start and stop, start and stop. 9, 16, 18 But it's fine. 11 I don't need it to be able to do what I'm doing, you know. 12 AS: So what do you see in the future for yourself? 6 What do you envision on that horizon?  AF: I want to help all the tribes do this. 12 AS: In Minnesota?  AF: In the region.  For now the region. 12 I'm still learning. 10 I understand the Minnesota system. 17, 18 How to enroll in health care and [unclear]. 19 I understand all that stuff. 17, 18 Now it's like trying to figure out how does this work?  Because health care system with IHS [Indian Health Service] and Tribal Services and all that. 19 It's very, very complicated.  If I started talking about it you would have no idea what I was talking about.  But figuring out how to do it, how to do it well, and go in and help the tribes that are interested and ready for this sort of thing. 12 It's only a matter of time before all the tribes are having this problem, hearing about how Red Lake and White Earth have addressed the problem, and then trying to find out how did they do this? 5, 9, 12 AS: And then you raise your hand!  AF: And then I raise my hand.  [laughs] 15 I know how to do this! 12 AS: So, Adam, do you have any mentors? 12 Do you have people that you look up to? 9 You can know them or not know them personally. 12 I would say Chuck for sure.  Chuck Hilger.  He brought me on to Valhalla Place.  He and I worked very well together. 8 I'm kind of able to just speak to him openly.  Bounce ideas off of him. 18 Swear in front of him.  [laughs] 15 He's a wise person.  And I'm like young, and ambitious, and maybe need to be slowed down sometimes and think things through. 5, 10, 20 I'm still learning as a young professional. 10 I think also...I don't know. 12 I have some friends in San Francisco that are really doing some amazing work in harm reduction, and just the national harm reduction community in general. 5, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20 There are so many just amazing people doing great things, and advocating for drug users. 5, 6, 9, 13, 20 It's so refreshing to go to those conferences and be like, oh, yeah I can talk about the fact that I believe drug users deserve things and should have a voice. 5, 6, 13, 17 I don't necessarily always speak that way in meeting settings because it's just not always productive. 14, 18 Then I have to sit there and explain things.  It's just not worth it.  That's not what I'm there for, but that is what I believe.  And so being around people like that every two years at the harm reduction conference is like being recharged and reminded. 5, 9, 14 And who knows. 12 Maybe tribes will at some point, or maybe it's happening somewhere behind the scenes and I don't know it, but will look at legalization. 5, 12, 15 Marijuana, and maybe decriminalization, and putting people in treatment. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 Increasing treatment. 12, 13 A lot of what other countries have done that are actually really effective. 7, 18 And I would love to be part of that because I believe in it. 9, 14 I think I would be able to do it really pragmatically. 18 And again it's just common sense.  But we get so—it's like the moral thing of drug use and it's a choice, and they're bad people, and they don't care about themselves. 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 And it's just not true. 5 There may be times where I felt really bad towards myself. 11, 18 I didn't like myself.  But it didn't mean I didn't care about wanting to be alive, or... AS: Or that you didn't love your family. 12, 14, 19 AF: Exactly.  I just had lost my way. 11, 18 I think I had a couple of attempts to find my way, and I didn't succeed, and then I did. 11, 18 [laughs] 15 And again it was the opportunity. 19 It was the part-time, eight-hour a week job at a drop-in center and becoming passionate about this one thing. 5, 9, 11, 15 That's what it took.  AS: And you couldn't maintain using if you were— AF: Yeah. 6 That was what I needed.  There's so many different ways that people can give back. 9, 18 Or maybe it's like just their family is important to them, and they're not like me. 5, 9, 12 They don't need a career that they're passionate about. 14, 15, 19 They just really care about their family, or whatever. 12, 18, 19 But people have to find value in what they do. 9 AS: That's great. 20 AF: So I think other tribes are at a variety of different places. 12 Some are still probably completely against public health strategies, and just can't figure out why their current models aren't working still. 19 Still blaming others instead of trying new things. 16 Because it does go against the values of being completely drug-free, abstinence based community. 5, 6, 13, 14, 19 That was what needed to happen to address the alcohol problem, which has been tearing tribes apart forever. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15 AS: Thank you.  AF: You're welcome. "
"8","Danielson_Jamison","Carol Fallowski Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 2, 2017 Macalester College St. Paul, Minnesota Carol Fallowski -CF Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan. 10 I’m with Carol Fallowski at Macalester College. 10 It is March 2, 2017.  Macalester College, St. Paul Minnesota.  Carol do you give me permission to record this interview?  CF: Yes.  This is Carol Fallowski. 10 I give you permission.  AS: The first thing I like to start with is where people are coming from since this project is based in the state of Minnesota. 5, 9, 13, 14 It’s going to look at Minnesota primarily.  Can you let me know where you’re from, where you grow up, whether it’s Minnesota or not? 10, 12 CF: I was born and raised in Minnesota, not far from here. 14 My parents got married at the Macalester President’s College. 7, 9, 20 I worked at a dress shop that used be right down Grand Avenue. 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16 I’ve been in St. Paul my whole life. 10 I got interested in the addiction field in the school of public health in the 1970s because it was the 1970s and it seemed like everybody was involved with drugs. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 19 I thought that was really interesting. 17, 18 I went through the chemical dependency counseling program and with one month left of an internship realized that counseling was the farthest thing from what I would ever want to do for a living. 13, 14, 16, 19 It was too sad for me.  I would go home and cry at these sad stories. 9 While you have to be empathetic you really shouldn’t be so sympathetic that you’re reduced to tears all the time. 5, 14, 18 I switched my focus in college and after that because I was also while I was in the chemical dependency counseling program was an undergraduate teaching assistant in statistics and research methods. 6, 7, 13, 19 When I graduated from college I got a job with the government evaluating two-day jail sentences for drunk drivers in Hennepin County which was a very nice fit. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 Then did a statewide study of plea negotiations.  Then did a study on family violence. 6, 12 I just moved into the research field instead of direct service. 7, 15, 18, 19 AS: The topic has remained interesting? 17 CF: Oh yes and then eventually I wound up at the department of human services alcoholic and drug abuse division. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 From there participated in a national drug abuse epidemiology network of twenty researchers from the country and we were all convened twice annually by the national institute on drug abuse to present our drug abuse reports on those respective twenty cities. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 19 They looked at data, overdose deaths, treatment admissions, crime lab data, and hospital emergency room data. 8, 12, 13, 14, 18 I wrote a report on drug abuse trends for the feds in that capacity for thirty years until it sort of reinvented itself in 2014. 5, 6, 13, 14 It gave me a great perspective because we would all get together for four days twice a year as well on emerging drugs of abuse, patterns of use, and populations at risk here as well as in those nineteen other cities. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 20 AS: So you just gave an elevator speech of our whole entire interview.  AS: I’m going to make you back up if you don’t mind.  CF: Here is that most recent report. 13 AS: I think I printed this.  CF: April, okay you’ve got it.  AS: I just printed that out.  I haven’t read it.  I’m looking forward to it.  I want you to back up and talk about...  You grew up in St. Paul. 20 You said drugs were everywhere it was the 70s. 5, 6 Do you have any addiction tendencies in your family? 12, 14 Did you experience any? 18 Did you see people in high school? 6, 7, 9 What drew you to it? 5 CF: I was a sociology major, man and society. 12 Looking at that it was a great social phenomena and statement of popular culture. 12, 19, 20 I do not have any addiction in my family. 12, 14 My mother, my two uncles, and my grandfather all died of tobacco addiction at young ages. 12, 14, 16 AS: It was the time and the place.  And you went to the U and you got your Bachelor’s in…?  CF: Sociology.  AS: Then you got a Master’s?  AS: That is really awesome. 18 You’re a really smart person. 18 CF: Thank you.  I don’t know about that. 12 My grandfather was a very smart person. 16 He was born in Laverne, Minnesota in the Southwest part of the state. 9, 14 The only county without a lake. 5, 19 After he graduated from high school took out a loan and bought the Rock County Star newspaper. 7, 15, 16 He ran that newspaper and then he was editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press and then he went and worked at the New York Times for a couple of years. 8, 11, 14, 15, 16 Then he went in 1956 to become managing editor of the Washington Post and then executive editor and then in 1969 was appointed ambassador to the UN to the United States by Lyndon Johnson.  He never went to college. 7, 16 I’ve never really thought that higher education was a prerequisite because that guy was so accomplished. 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 AS: This is your grandfather? 16 CF: Yes, who lived until he was ninety-seven. 7 He just died in 2000.  AS: What was his name?  CF: James Russell Wiggins.  AS: Do you have a family? 12 Did you get married? 7 Do you have children? 5, 14, 20 CF: Yes, I’m married and I have two adult children. 5, 7, 14, 20 And I have one grandchild who my son won’t let me put on social media. 14, 19 AS: That’s a bummer because you’ve still got a lot of fun when you do that.  Some day he will, maybe. 5, 16 Tell me what it was like when you first started doing research with drunk driving, with addiction? 5, 8, 12, 14 Can you kind of back up?  AS: What was it like when you were first studying it? 14 What was the culture like?  What was the bureaucracy?  CF: Drug abuse? 6, 13 AS: Yes, for drug abuse. 5, 6, 13 I’m looking for some changes over time. 6 CF: Well this is all governmental structure stuff. 12, 15 AS: That’s okay.  That is interesting to me. 17 CF: The federal government, for many years, passed through grant monies to states for drug abuse prevention and treatment. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 They’re called block grants.  The state Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency which in this state is now called the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division of the Minnesota Department of Human Services is the state agency responsible for dispersing those funds. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 The funds come from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMSA. 6, 13 The state alcohol and drug agencies vary by state. 5, 6 In some states they’re located in the Department of Human Services. 9, 12 In some states they’re located in the health departments. 9, 12, 19 Here it’s in the state Department of Human Services. 9, 12 That’s sort of the state structure. 15 I was working there at the research unit when I did a study of two-day jail sentences for drunk drivers. 5, 8, 14, 16, 19 Then in 1986 due to some changes I became part of this drug abuse epidemiology workgroup of the national institute on drug abuse. 5, 6, 9, 13 It’s called the CEWG, Community Epidemiology Workgroup. 19 It was reconnoitered in 2014. 5 It’s called something else now. 12 Then when I would write my very first report, by and large the drugs we had anything to talk about in the state of Minnesota were of course alcohol and then marijuana and then everything else took a remote backseat to those two drugs of abuse in terms of both prevalent abuse and consequences of use. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 17 AS: Do you remember what your findings were for the two day? 16 This is basically the old idea that you take the drunk person and you make them jail detox. 5, 8, 14, 19 It’s kind of like a jail detox. 19 CF: I did a time series analysis.  It did show to reduce night time injury accidents, I compared Hennepin County to Ramsey County which did not have the two-day jail sentences. 5, 13, 14, 16 Because they’re locked up for the weekend or whatever those days. 15, 16 CF: They can schedule them when they come in but they still have to spend two days. 10, 16 It was an effective deterrent as measured by changes in the rate of nighttime injury accidents. 5, 6, 13, 14 AS: So did they keep it after your report? 13 What happened? 15 CF: The judges kept it up.  Then as changes happened in the judge’s appointment it kind of fizzled out. 6, 12, 15 That was my first published article. 14 It was on reducing two-day jail sentences and using time series analysis which is pretty complex. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 It was interesting. 17 Then I did my first drug report in ‘86. 5, 6, 13, 14 The VA had a methadone program.  I think it was the VA had one and Hennepin County had one.  There had been one in St. Paul that I kind of came in on the tail end of that. 14 There must have been some problem with it. 12 It had been closed down. 5, 9, 10 There were really only those two. 18 The prevalence of heroin was very low. 10, 16 It was very sporadic. 14 It was as if there would be a short brief supply of heroin and then there would be dry periods. 5, 13, 16, 18, 19 Eventually, I’m just going to talk about these trends in drug abuse. 5, 6, 13 I think as the result of our sporadic supply of what is very low period of heroin it became apparent that the Twin Cities had some of the higher rates of prescription opioid abuse. 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 AS: After oxy is approved.  CF: No, prior to that.  AS: Where were people getting it? 9 Hospitals?  CF: From a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy. 16 The source, I don’t recall the source of it.  It was interesting to me in looking at the hospital emergency room data that relative to other cities we tended to have higher rates of exposure to prescription medications which was attributed by me and by others to the fact that we didn’t have a constant supply of heroin. 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17 To supplant that people would seek out prescription narcotics. 6, 9, 10 That lasted into the mid-90s.  Also, when Prozac or fluoxetine was introduced we had one of the higher rates of hospital emergency room episodes involving that as opposed to other cities. 7, 8, 14, 17 I believe it was a carry over to sort of a penchant of drug abusers here for prescription drugs. 5, 6, 10, 13 AS: To abuse Prozac. 6, 13 Interesting.  We’re in the mid-90s now and are you still at DHS or have you moved on? 7, 12, 15 CF: I left DHS in 1997 to 2007 I was at Hazelden. 14 Then I went back as director of the state alcohol and drug abuse agency in ‘07 and did that until 2012. 5, 6, 13, 18, 19 In 2012 I hung up my own shingle and now I do education training and consulting. 12, 14, 15 With drug abuse, cocaine then started. 5, 6, 13 When I got into that group in 1986 cocaine was on the upswing and we always met in a different city and then would take field trips. 16, 18 It was my ongoing education about drug abuse. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15 We happened to be meeting in New York City. 15, 18 I think it was in June of 1986.  When Len Bias, the aspiring basketball player overdosed on cocaine. 14, 16 We passed around little vials of cocaine. 16, 20 The police came and we all got to look at them and see what it was. 6, 8 We went on a field trip to some treatment program in Harlem. 12, 13 It was my ongoing education about drug abuse because we were together for four days twice a year. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 AS: Many of the same people? 9 CF: Yes.  That was a good learning experience. 10, 18 AS: This is the Len Bias who the law is now...this is his case of his overdose? 12, 13, 17 Where they’re trying to convict drug dealers? 5, 6 They have a Len Bias Law?  AS: Yes.  CF: Federal?  AS: Well I think so.  I think right now there’s a drug dealer named Beverly Burrell who’s being charged with third degree murder of five young men in this area. 5, 6, 8, 12 What I understand is that it’s the Len Bias. 17, 18 AS: So you were New York right after that happened. 12, 15 So cocaine, what about cocaine here? 16 CF: We saw cocaine here. 16 The first time I was quoted. 14 Many researchers aren’t really articulate in explaining things to the public. 18, 19 But I seem to have that knack for it. 6 The first interview I ever had in the newspaper was about cocaine. 14, 15, 16 I know that from looking back at old newspaper clippings. 12, 15, 16 I think I said, “It seems as if everyone and their dog is using cocaine.” 6, 16 I think that’s why the media always still comes to me for good little sound bites. 10, 18, 20 I never really a saw a dog use cocaine. 6, 13, 16, 18 I think that was an embellishment. 12 Cocaine came and rose.  I learned how to not only gather data but interpret data because I noticed an extreme spike in people coming in to treatment. 9, 10, 12, 13 With any drug epidemic having people come into treatment is a good thing. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13 It was just such a dramatic increase. 5 Talk to my colleagues across the aisle from me at the alcohol and drug use agency. 5, 6, 13 They’d opened three different federally funded programs for cocaine addicts. 8, 14, 16 Of course you’re seeing these kinds of increases. 6 AS: This might seem like a boring question but can you explain how you got the data to do the research? 6, 13 Are all of the treatment centers supposed to report to you? 12, 13 Can you explain how that process works? 9, 17 CF: We have a system called the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Normative Evaluation System or DAANES. 6, 13 We thought that was so clever. 17, 18 DAANES is a requirement of anyone who receives public funds for treatment in the state. 12, 13, 19 DAANES has two hundred and sixty some variables about patient history and how they came to be there and that includes information collected at intake and at discharge. 15 It also allows us to look at changes in time over number of people coming into treatment for different drug categories. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13 AS: Is this still used today? 6, 13, 16 CF: I can show you.  Exhibit 6, this one. 8, 20 Page ten.  That is DAANES data. 13 I invented this chart way back in the day. 14, 16, 18 It’s a good way to look at the number of admissions coming in and what the primary drug of abuse is. 5, 6, 10, 13, 18, 19 Then within that what is the gender, race, ethnicity, age, route of administration, we put smoking in there too. 6 AS: On this if you add heroin and other opiates that would be the number two after alcohol. 6, 16 CF: Oh yes.  Heroin alone what’s significant now, what’s unprecedented now in this report of April of 2015 is that the percent of heroin admissions exceed the number of marijuana admissions which has never happened. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 You can see where cocaine has really dropped off to four percent. 5, 6, 11, 18 Methamphetamines is actually rising. 7 The fact that heroin admissions surpass marijuana is a significant plight in the state of Minnesota. 11, 16 AS: Is there someone doing your same kind of work now? 12 Since you’ve left? 14 CF: I still do it.  CF: I don’t know. 12 To be determined. 17 I’ve done it so long. 17 AS: I can help you with it.  I’m concerned because the numbers have actually gone up in 2016. 7 There’s been more deaths. 18 They dropped in ‘15. 5, 11 CF: They all come from different public data sources. 13, 19 These reports were unique in as much as they put it all together. 8, 13 By putting various data sources together, collectively they painted a picture that did not otherwise exist of drug trends. 5, 6, 8, 13 AS: Are you talking nationally?  No, you’re talking about here in Minnesota.  CF: And the people in nineteen other cities that did this. 7, 9 That’s the value of these reports. 13 Now data is much easier to get, public data. 13, 19 It was very difficult to get. 10 DAANES data, treatment data was maintained and I worked on the drug and alcohol DAANES system. 5, 6, 12, 13 That was easy to get always. 18 These other data sources used to be very hard to get. 6, 9, 13, 16 To get crime lab data for Minneapolis I used to have to go and individually record things from three ring binders to write that down. 6, 13, 16 Medical examiner reports 13, 14 I would have to go sit over there in their office in Hennepin County and go through manually pieces of paper.  It’s come a long way. 17, 18 My first pie chart was done by putting a coffee cup on a piece of paper and drawing a circle around it because computer technology did not exist to make graphs. 5, 14 It’s come a long way. 17, 18 Data is much better.  Some of these agencies have been very proactive in putting their own data together. 8, 13 Some of them including other people’s data. 9, 13 The state monitoring has actually improved over thirty years. 7, 14, 18 You think it would, it has for everything else.  AS: There is something about learning how to present it and communicate it to the audiences. 5, 10 CF: Then go to this Exhibit 14. 20 This shows trends over time. 17 That’s that same treatment data on page nine. 12, 13 You can see as a percent of, or these are just raw numbers, of people coming in. 6, 9 But you can see that rise in heroin. 6, 16 You can see that rise in methamphetamines. 6, 8 AS: They’re kind of on a parallel line aren’t they with each other? 9 Other opiates, that is a little more steady there. 20 CF: Then this one, talk about the State Health Department. 9, 12 It always had mortality data. 13, 18 It has started being much more active in the last two years in making that public data, public. 10, 13, 14, 19 Because you wouldn’t necessarily know what the person died from or what the medical examiner…? 7, 12, 14 CF: No, they’ve just become more proactive in making it more accessible. 9, 10 They’ve always had it. 18 They’ve just started because in this state the state alcohol and drug abuse agency is in the Department of Human Services not the Department of Health. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13 Even though the health has the vital statistics. 19 They’ve kind of gotten on board in making it more public and here you can look at overdose deaths in the eleven county metro area versus greater Minnesota for Minnesota residents. 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20 Which are the lion share of the deaths. 18 What’s going on, to me the point of this is that it’s not just a metropolitan problem, it’s all over the state. 12 So in the meantime, I’ll just do the short thing of drug trends. 5, 6, 18 When I started in that group I really had nothing to say about it. 18 Everybody really organizes their presentations around drugs. 5, 6, 10, 18 I had nothing much to say about heroin or cocaine. 16 After a few years I thought, “Whoa. 14, 17, 18 I wonder if I’ll ever have anything to say about those drugs.” 5, 6 Then it changed with cocaine peaking out then methamphetamine became a big problem. 12, 13, 14, 16 AS: When would you say cocaine peaked out?  CF: ‘86 was a height.  I’d have to look.  It was somewhere there.  For at least ten years now that’s been declining. 12, 14 The thing is it never really disappears. 16, 18 Something else.  What makes news in the drug abuse world is large increases. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16 The declines not so much. 9, 14 Then methamphetamines came in and it peaked in 2005.  Here as well as nationally.  Then has been declining. 14 Minnesota was one of the first states to have state laws about methamphetamine manufacturing. 6, 8, 13, 14 Then thirty-four states total had state laws about it and then the federal law came in. 8, 13 Our senator at the time, Senator Norm Coleman was very active in that and driving that national legislation. 5, 14 That was 2005 and then things with methamphetamines declined for a few years. 6, 8, 9, 14 Certainly there were fewer methamphetamine homemade labs.  We had the federal law that restricted the retail sale of products that contain pseudoephedrine. 5, 8, 13, 14 Starting in 2009 or four years later increases started happening again with methamphetamine. 6, 8, 14, 15 It was in 2015 that indicators related to methamphetamine in Minnesota were higher than they were in 2005. 6, 7, 8, 14, 17 Because opioids were at that time capturing the headlines, it didn’t get much public attention. 6, 9, 13, 14, 19 It is still the case that methamphetamine is stronger than it ever was. 17 There’s not that element of labs blowing up and pollution. 10, 12 It’s coming in from Mexico.  AS: It’s being made there so people aren’t making it here. 9, 10 CF: It’s a huge problem. 12 Mixed in with all that are the synthetic drugs and synthetic opioid drugs like fentanyl which is a complete game changer. 5, 6, 13 I could talk forever.  Ask me a specific question.  That’s kind of the overview.  AS: I’m just letting you go and then I’ll ask you another question.  Can you talk about your time at Hazelden and what you did there?  Who were you seeing? 6 Were you still collecting data for Hazelden? 13 Is Hazelden one of those places that has to report to the DAANES? 13 CF: Yes.  AS: They do because what public funds do they get? 19 CF: They get some money from the Chemical Dependency Consolidated Treatment Fund, CDCDF. 8, 10, 12, 13 AS: You’ve got a lot of alphabets.  CF: The Consolidated Chemical Dependency Treatment Fund is a pool of federal money and state money that is available for people who could not otherwise afford treatment for addiction. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Each county in the state gets an allocation from that big pool of money that’s based on a formula. 8, 10, 13, 19 That’s like a population based rate. 13 Each county gets their allocation and then the county administers those funds. 19 In order for a person who’s low income to receive alcohol or drug treatment they have to go to their county human service agency, get a chemical dependency assessment, and then the county determines the severity of problem and matches that with the level of care of services. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 17, 19 They also match it with the treatment providers with which they have contracts so they can send patients there. 12, 13, 19 It’s an enormous fund.  The state contribution the last time I looked was like probably 2012, it was about over one hundred million dollars were state funds to that.  There were some federal funds, some from this block grant. 8 It provides treatment for people in the state. 9, 12, 13 At Hazelden it gets people who come on that. 9 The data systems are good. 10, 13 Almost any treatment program in the state is in that. 12, 13 AS: It’s a good picture, it’s inclusive. 10 CF: Some states have more limited ones and only collect Medicare or is it Medicaid. 8, 14, 19 AS: I can never remember. 16 CF: Some just have data systems that look at public paid clients through their Medicaid. 10, 13, 14, 19 Ours is pretty much all treatment programs report on it. 10, 12, 13 It’s a good snapshot. 10, 11 It’s almost a total snapshot as opposed to a sample. 11 AS: So what did you do there and were you at Center City?  CF: Yes, I was at Center City.  I came in working in the research department. 9, 12, 19 I did these reports. 13 Then I helped with other different patient studies.  They had different studies for different patient groups. 12 I’d take part in that. 9 Then the CEO at the time said I should be in communications. 14 Being in government 12 I never had a CEO. 16 I thought well if he’s saying it I should go do that. 17, 18 Then I worked in the communications. 14 All the time I kept doing these reports. 13 You keep doing them not necessarily because someone is telling you to but because you want to keep your eye on what’s going on? 15 CF: No, because I was a part of this national workgroup. 9 It was only twenty people. 9 I wanted to. 18 AS: You needed the Minnesota data so you could report it to that. 13 CF: I wanted to be a part of that group because it’s a spectacular learning experience going to all the different places we went to in different cities to see aspects of the drug problem. 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 18 I kept writing those reports. 13 I worked in communications. 14 Then I worked in public policy driving the national Ramstad-Kennedy legislation at the national level. 5, 14, 19 I made trips to Washington.  I did that for ten years. 14 AS: How did you find it different moving from DHS into a place as prestigious and well known as Hazelden? 10, 11, 12 CF: It was a breath of fresh air because Hazelden had campuses in Chicago, New York City, Florida, and Oregon. 6, 13 I got a lot of my experience through going to those areas of the country and speaking to different professional and parent audiences about it. 8, 18, 19, 20 That was really a great experience. 18, 20 At Hazelden if you had a good idea it was so welcomed. 10 It was like, “That’s a great idea. 20 Let’s help make that happen.” 15 When I worked in state government two different times as I was a young woman coming up I had some ideas and I’m very outspoken. 12, 18 I would take them to my superior and two different times I had different bosses say, “We aren’t about good ideas here. 10, 16, 18 We’re about doing things the way we’ve always done them. 18 You should know that.” 12 It was very deflating.  Working in government is a great experience and I learned so much about how bureaucracies work and how money flows. 8, 10, 12, 18, 20 It takes a certain outlook to maintain long-term in government and I just didn’t have it. 12, 17 I believe you should improve things and quit doing some things.  So when I went back to government I went back as the director. 12, 18, 19 I thought, “Now I’ll be in a better position because I’ll be the director.” 17, 18, 19 AS: Were you able to make change?  CF: I was able to make some changes. 6 AS: Like what?  CF: I freed up some funding for recovery based services like the Minnesota Recovery Connection. 13, 19 There’s another one down in Mankato.  We get this block grant money so why not have those. 8, 10 They’re really an important piece. 9, 18 The theory behind them is that when someone’s in recovery, the person in the throes of addiction has lost their friends, their family, their job, their social supports. 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 It’s very hard to go back and integrate into the community. 9, 19 The idea of recovery centers is to provide services to those folks who are just trying to get their lives back in order. 12, 19 Recovery or systems of care is the buzz phrase that they use. 6, 13, 19 I helped start those.  I also got some training going.  We had at the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency an American Indian desk that really deals exclusively with the American Indian programs. 6, 13, 18 There was a person there who had developed a curriculum to teach non-Indian service providers about Indian culture and how to best deal with Indian clients. 10, 14, 19 I freed up some money and time to go deliver that to different audiences over the state, to correctional workers and different workers in different domains. 8, 10, 12, 19 AS: So Minnesota Recovery Connection started with you?  CF: Yes.  AS: That’s awesome.  You’ve done a lot of talking to parents. 20 Can you talk about how you approach that and what your philosophy was and your strategy?  Those situations, where they happened, the response you got. 13, 15 When did you start doing that?  Was it while you were at Hazelden?  CF: Yes.  That’s when it really took off. 18 They had people working in all those cities. 7, 9 They wanted to get Hazelden’s name out there in a high profile way. 7, 18 What better way than to have something for professionals during the day and then they’d something for the community at night? 16, 18, 19 My busiest day in Kentucky I talked to school teachers in the morning, a combination of the Lions Club and the Rotary at lunch and they’d never met together. 7, 8, 16 I said, “Now don’t you boys get in a fight.” 7, 11 Then a law enforcement group at three in the afternoon of regional law enforcement people. 8, 9, 12, 13 Then that evening a community event. 19 I was on the speaking thing.  Parents are often the last to know what to do. 12 They may be the first to realize something’s going on with their child with drugs and alcohol or they may be the last to know what’s going on with drugs and alcohol. 5, 6, 12, 14 The challenge really of parenting in today’s age is that the signs and symptoms of drug abuse are very similar to the signs and symptoms of normal adolescence. 5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 The list is almost identical.  Changes in hygiene, changes in friends, changes in mood, loss of interest in usual activities. 6, 16, 20 AS: Sleepiness, staying up too late. 7, 16 CF: All of these symptoms that are in my book are also the same as the symptoms of an emerging drug or alcohol problem. 5, 6, 12 The key is that when they all happen together, when it’s not spread out over time. 8, 10, 15 When all these symptoms are occurring all at once chances are there’s a drug or alcohol problem involved. 5, 6, 12 Another thing parents don’t realize is that they don’t know how to distinguish, is it a drug or alcohol problem or is it just normal adolescence? 5, 6, 12, 16, 20 Then they don’t know what to do about it. 12 They don’t realize that if their kids are involved in a drug or alcohol problem they will lie about it. 5, 6, 12 They’ll look at you in the face and lie to you.  That especially for some parents is just appalling. 20 I say your kids will lie to you and you can hear a gasp in the crowd. 9 “My Johnny would never do that.” 16 It was really an eye opener for me about how parents grapple with this. 18, 20 Not only do they have a hard time identifying it but they don’t know what to do about it and they don’t know about the drug abuse situation today. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 They don’t know that their little angel just by going to a good private high school can buy heroin now. 7, 10, 12, 16, 20 That would just floor them for as little as ten bucks. 14, 20 They don’t know that their little angel who goes to a public school as early as seventh grade can be offered Adderall in the bathroom or a joint at the football game or alcohol on the school bus. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 19, 20 They don’t have a concept of how our culture has drugs and alcohol all over it. 5, 6 We are blanketed in this country with drug and alcohol access at a very young age that we’ve never seen before. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16, 19 It really was gratifying for me to go all across the country, learn the local problems. 10, 12, 18, 19 Because I was a part of this national monitoring group I could read the reports of my colleagues in those areas before I went to kind of familiarize myself with the numbers and the epidemiology in those specific areas. 8, 9, 13, 18, 20 Then talk to parents and listen to their concerns. 20 I was talking in Cape Elizabeth, Maine which is a hoity-toity suburb outside of Portland, Maine.  No one was coming. 8 The school principal had to be convinced to do it. 7 “If we host something on drugs people will think we have a drug problem.” 5, 6, 9, 12 That’s how schools were like and probably still are like. 7 No one was registered to come. 5, 8, 14 We might get twenty-five people there. 9 That Sunday 16 I was speaking on a Tuesday and that Sunday a sixteen-year-old girl got drunk in the middle of the day and drove her car into a tree and killed herself. 5, 7, 8, 14, 16 It was an accidental car accident but she was drunk. 5, 8, 13, 14 Come Tuesday it was standing room only. 14, 16 They had to move it to the cafeteria and an adjacent room. 14, 15 It was packed and you could have heard a pin drop. 5, 9, 11 I spoke first and then we had a panel of the police chief and the school principal and a treatment provider and another woman whose son had struggled with addiction. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 When the panelist were all through making their introductory remarks a woman stood up and just lost it. 5, 10, 11, 14 Saying,  “When is this community going to face the facts about our drug and alcohol problems? 5, 6, 12, 19 How many people have to die? 9 She was just really agitated. 18 After the police chief took that question. 8 After it was over I said, “Who is that?”  She said, “Her son got killed by a drunk driver fourteen years ago when he was in high school.” 5, 7, 8, 13, 14 It was such an a-ha moment for me because what an example of unless communities kind of step up to the plate about talking about drug and alcohol you’re going to have people like that. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 19 You’re going to have this ongoing rage and burning rage inside of people unless they can have some community programs or events or something. 9, 19 Some community to plug into where they get support for underscoring it as a certain problem. 12, 17, 19 We still are so shameful.  Kids who get into trouble in drugs and alcohol. 5, 6 I’ve talked about the parents but the kids themselves, if they get labelled in high school as having a drug or alcohol problem then the parents don’t want their kids to hang out with that person. 5, 6, 7, 12, 20 Even when they get the help they need they don’t get the support for it.  They’re still labelled.  Minnesota used to have more sober high schools than any place in the country. 6, 7, 13, 16, 19 Now because the failed business model, they didn’t figure out how to make themselves charter schools and spent all their money on transportation. 7, 8, 10, 17 Minnesota was a pioneer in that area of sober high schools where kids once in recovery could get support for being in recovery. 7, 8 Parents are really key and that’s one of the things that motivated me to write a book. 15, 18 The book is called Drug Abuse. 6, 13 I brought that for you too.  AS: Thank you.  CF: An Easy to Use Reference for Parents and Professionals.  I said don’t pick a scary title and then Dangerous Drugs in big red letters. 5 It’s a guide for parents. 20 It has the signs and symptoms. 11 For every drug it talks about the observable signs of use and then when you should call 9-1-1. 5, 6, 11, 13 It didn’t exist.  I felt really good about writing that and going around and talking about it. 10, 11, 18 That’s great. 20 Thank you for that.  Just getting back, what have you seen change here in Minnesota because of the heroin and opiate pain killer epidemic with parents, with kids? 6, 13, 16, 20 Did you notice a shift with parents here or is it the same as what you were just talking about where people don’t really want to acknowledge that maybe in Northfield or Minnetonka that there’d be a heroin…? 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20 Do you think it’s really changed? 13, 18 AS: The general response. 13 There’s a lot more in the media.  CF: There was stuff in the media about methamphetamine as there is about opioids now. 6, 12, 13 With every drug trend it gets varying degrees of public attention. 5, 6, 19 Every drug epidemic has a certain characteristic about it. 5, 6, 13, 17 Every drug has its own characteristics. 5, 6 The key thing about methamphetamine that was used to drive prevention methods was it rots your teeth and it gives you a sunken appearance. 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19 Still parents didn’t think that their little angels could access meth. 6, 9, 20 There’s a drug. 5, 6 We live in a culture where we are rewarded for doing more in less time.  It’s a perfect fit with our culture. 15, 17 A strong stimulant, long acting drug. 5, 6, 17 AS: And Adderall is this generation that’s been raised on the ADHD drugs. 5, 6, 14 CF: I’ve looked up a story and I can’t remember when chill pill came into our dictionary. 14, 15 I think it was 2003.  You could confirm that.  AS: Thank you for reminding me about that.  CF: That’s a very good thing to have in a book and I have it. 10 I’ve got a million PowerPoints but I can’t remember which one I put that in. 8 It shows that one thing that’s happened sociologically is the increased use of pills to treat all sorts of medicine. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 And direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that happened in 1989. 5, 6, 10, 15, 18 That sort of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs, I’m not sure that ‘89 is the year. 5, 6, 10, 14, 18 I can’t remember the exact year. 14 That really does start this increase in the abuse of prescription drugs non-medically. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 18 It still is the case that kids get a lot of their information from television. 17 Especially if you watch the national news, nightly news. 15, 16, 17 Those are all prescriptions but they’re mostly for older people with different body function failures. 9, 10, 12, 14, 20 The thing that distinguishes the opiate problem for me professionally was whenever I would speak to these various professional and community audiences and when I started doing that, it happened a couple times with methamphetamine, it started happening more frequently and regularly with audiences where I was talking about heroin and opiates. 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 Someone would stay back afterwards and tell me that they were the parent of a child who had died from an overdose. 14, 20 The numbers grew so much that at one point I had a dozen emails of parents whose kids had died. 20 I just sent out an email to all of them and said...I would meet with them and talk. 5, 18 It’s such a devastating thing that their family will probably never recover from. 12, 16 I got them all together and I think that’s maybe how Mothers Against Drunk Drivers started. 5, 8 Just letting them know each other. 12 AS: Was this mostly in the state of Minnesota? 12 Yes, it was in the Twin Cities area. 8 AS: Do you remember some of those mothers’ names? 16 CF: Yes.  You want to talk to some of them?  AS: I’m wondering if I’ve already interviewed some of them. 15 I don’t know. 12 Did you know Star Selleck? 12 She’s good. 10 AS: Yes, and Gloria Englund.  CF: And I can’t remember the one I always talk to. 8, 18 I’ll have to look.  That’s what changed about that. 13 The thing that distinguishes the opiate problem from other drug epidemics we’ve had in the past is that for each epidemic you have to look at prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 19 The three prongs of drug policy in this country. 5, 6, 19 Given the pivotal role of prescription narcotics with the opioid crisis we have to look at prevention, treatment, and law enforcement, and the practice of medicine. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 We have to look at the situation and figure out what we can do about it within the medical community. 7, 14, 19 We have two hundred and fifty-nine million prescriptions written for opioids in a year. 6, 10, 13, 14 In a country of three hundred and twenty million people. 9, 19 We need to look at what we can do to curb that.  At the same time, we have to add that fourth prong, the practice of medicine. 5, 12, 14 It’s not just looking at the conditions under which we prescribe prescription opioids. 6, 10, 13 It also involves integrating the screening for drug and alcohol problems into primary care. 5, 6, 12, 19 With other chronic diseases with behavioral components where you have to change your behavior in order to get better we screen for those. 6, 8, 15 You go to the doctor and you get screened for high blood pressure. 7, 10, 12, 14 If you have high blood pressure the doctor talks with you about your high risk conditions. 7, 10, 12, 14 Obesity the same thing.  We screen for that every time we go to the doctor. 12, 14 Asthma is screened for, diabetes. 10 With those conditions about ninety percent of the people who have those conditions receive treatment for it. 9, 12, 13 With alcohol it’s the inverse. 6 About ten percent of the people who exhibit symptoms get treatment for it. 9, 12, 13, 20 That’s due to a number of things.  One that the treatment system developed outside the practice of medicine. 12, 13, 14 Secondly there are some people who manage their addiction simply by going to self-help groups. 9, 12, 14 There are a group of medical professionals who seriously believe it’s not really a medical problem you can just go to one of those self-help groups to get better. 7, 11, 12, 14, 18 They don’t really own it. 18 Finally, they don’t get training in addiction even though they are prescribers. 10, 12, 14 Even though they’re more likely to see someone who’s addicted than they’re likely to see someone with some horrible cancerous rare growth. 6, 10, 12, 14 They don’t get training in it.  We have a long way to go. 17, 18 It’s as if the prescription opiate problem has brought to light all these shortcomings of all the different systems involved. 10, 12, 18 Getting out of it and turning it around is multi-layered. 5, 20 It’s going to be a multi-year thing. 14 It’s pretty complex. 10, 13 Doctors as a group do not take to being told how to practice medicine. 12, 14, 16 Yet voters in twenty-eight states created this sort of outside of mainstream medicine systems of marijuana distribution. 12, 14 Changes have happened in spite of what doctors want. 12, 14, 15 It’s very multi-layered to address it. 5 I did for the Minnesota Medical Association I travelled around, this was in 2013, the state had me talk to different groups of doctors that they had convened about this opiate problem. 12, 14 AS: What was that like?  CF: It was really interesting. 17, 18 I remember particularly one doctor who had said that whenever he tried to reduce, he had a patient who was probably one of those people. 5, 9, 12, 14, 16 AS: That was how he said it?  CF: Yes, one of those people. 9 An addict. 14 “Gosh, he’s been my patient for a long time. 17 Every time I try to reduce his prescription or don’t increase it he threatens to kill me or my family.” 5, 10, 12, 14 I said, “I’m no doctor but if someone was threatening to kill me and my family I think that would be a law enforcement issue. 8, 12, 13, 14 Even if it were a patient.”  That’s a threat against me.  I said, “Did you do that?”  This is in a small group of doctors. 12, 14 There are about thirty doctors in a room. 12, 14 I just write him a new prescription.” 10, 16 I don’t think he’s the only doctor who deals with that. 12, 14 I don’t he’s the only doctor in Minnesota who does that. 12, 14 I don’t think he’s the only doctor in the country who does that. 12, 14, 19 What I learned from talking to these doctors was that when they went through medical school they were taught, don’t worry about prescribing opioids. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 It’s only one percent are going to get addicted. 12, 14 You know that was from that little note. 12, 20 They really learned that. 10, 18 Then there’s a switch with the introduction of long-acting oxycodone to start using it for the treatment of chronic pain as well as acute. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17 This long term chronic pain, Purdue Pharma they were fined in spite of that. 6, 11, 17 We have the prescription monitoring programs which are good. 10, 18 Still we need to have more education, more integration. 14, 15 The National Institute on Alcoholism and Abuse developed a great curriculum for doctors on how to talk to patients about their drinking. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 It has little video, if you’re teaching a class this thing is great. 7, 18, 20 When I was at the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency I had our staff watch it for a staff meeting. 6, 13, 17, 18 AS: What’s it called again?  CF: It’s at NIAAA.NIH.gov.  They’re whole initiative is called “Rethinking Drinking.”  Just look for clinical guide for doctors. 12, 14 It shows doctor interactions and one of them for example is a guy who says he drinks but only on weekends but only when he watches football games and doesn’t drink at all during the week. 5, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 The guy’s presenting with high blood pressure and the doctor says, “Well how many games do you watch a weekend?” 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17 “Well if it’s in the season I’ll watch the college games on Saturday and then I’ll watch the pro games on Sunday.” 7, 16, 17 The guy’s watching about ten games and he only has a six pack every game. 8, 17 That’s a lot of drinking. 5, 11 You think a football game does last a long time. 17 AS: It’s just asking that second or third question.  CF: The doctor saying, “I could put you on medication for your high blood pressure but do you think you could drink less? 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 Do you think you could limit yourself to a six pack a day on a Saturday or Sunday?” 16 If the person’s not addicted they’re like, “Oh sure.” 12, 14 Those conversations are easy to have.  Doctors aren’t really well versed or trained in how to do it. 18 AS: The doctors I’ve spoken to have said there’s also a time issue and a hassle issue. 12, 13, 14 They have less time and they don’t want to be hassled.  CF: Chronic pain patients and addicted patients are the most challenging of patients to deal with. 6, 12, 14 This is just screening within the general population.  They found extremely good results. 6, 10 The other one is the screening brief intervention and referral to treatment, SBRIT. 8, 12, 13, 19 It was developed by the national government and tested in many different settings across the country both on reservations and in urban areas and in rural areas. 8, 12, 19, 20 Screening brief intervention and referral to treatment involves just a very few little screening questions for people for patients who present for primary care. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19, 20 Sometimes they have it in emergency rooms. 14 Then they found that just doing a brief intervention on them, like the one I just described would qualify as a very brief intervention, that over half of the people changed their drinking behavior. 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 19 The people who were not addicted. 9, 12, 14 Where else in behavioral health do you get that kind of behavior change? 15, 19 Never.  It’s never been that high. 7, 16 It can be very effective in interrupting a person’s progression to addiction. 12, 14 To have a health professional, whether it’s a doctor or one of their people, just say, “You might be going on the road to addiction if you keep this up. 9, 12, 14, 19 Why don’t you just try reducing it for a while.” 5, 14 Then all these other health problems will probably diminish. 12, 19 That’s been really effective. 18 SBRIT, there haven’t been any sites with it here.  I wrote a grant when I went to the state and it didn’t get funded. 8 SBRIT is great but it needs to go to more places in the country. 19, 20 Now Allina has a variation of that.  Different health plans are starting to integrate it. 19 That’s a huge issue. 13 Just talking to people about it. 9 If you teach this, you know this but you know doctors are trained to believe there’s only 1.5 percent of people would develop addiction. 9, 12, 14 We now know from different studies and from the CDC it’s up to twenty-five percent of the people. 9, 12 AS: To opiates?  CF: Yes.  There’s even one doctor 12, 14 I know who believes that if you have a room of one hundred people and you give them all Percodan for a month at the end of the month they’ll all be addicted. 9, 12, 14, 16 CF: Dr. Chris Johnson.  AS: I was going to guess.  CF: Have you talked to him?  AS: Yes, I interviewed him.  He’s an interesting guy. 17 He’s actually the kind of spokesperson and Evangelist to get the attention of doctors. 7, 12, 14 Those kinds of people emerge as well. 9 In a crisis situation you need the people who are going to rattle your cage. 9 CF: Doctors are much more inclined to listen to other doctors than anybody else. 9, 12, 14 You talked about the parents that you met… 20 CF: I want to finish back about this doctor who said that. 12, 14 I don’t think he’s the only doctor. 12, 14 Another thing that has to change in the medical world in addition to screening, in addition to more reasoned prescribing of opioids for certain conditions. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17 We need to train doctors on what to do with people who are addicted. 9, 12, 14 Many times they don’t know what to do. 12 Again it’s an outgrowth of treatment centers developing outside of mainstream medicine. 10, 12, 13, 14 AS: That’s interesting. 17 What your ideal model be for treatment? 12, 13 CF: Different health plans. 19 We have a crisis in health care too. 19 Each treatment plan has to figure out their own stuff. 12, 13 AS: In an ideal world what would you see? 6 CF: It’s like with any other health condition. 19 Go to your doctor. 12, 14 You’ve got addiction? 12, 14 Go to your doctor. 12, 14 People coming into treatment based on the DAANES data, only six percent of people coming into treatment are referred by doctors. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17 Nobody really wakes up and says, “Oh gee. 18 I’m sick of my life. 10, 15 I think I’ll go to treatment today.” 12, 13, 16 That just doesn’t happen. 15 It’s either family, the criminal justice system, or your employer that says, “You’ve got to do this or else.” 8, 12 AS: If our health care system was functional we would have more access and more time with doctors. 9, 12, 14, 19 If they had more training they would look for signs. 11 The fifteen-year-old that’s wanting birth control to the family nurse practitioner could be screened for other things as well. 8, 12, 14, 18 They could talk about all kinds of things with them.  Do you think that opioids have changed anything in the way that we look at addiction or do you think it’s just another drug in the grand march of drugs of the day? 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 CF: I think they’ve put a spotlight on how we deliver treatment and what treatment is delivered. 5, 6, 12, 13 The science is overwhelming that the use of medication in the treatment of opioid addiction is very effective. 6, 12, 13, 14 Yet, treatment providers in Minnesota as well as over the rest of the country have been very reluctant to embrace that as part of their practice. 9, 12, 13, 19 People aren’t getting the kind of help they need.  Hazelden was one of the first treatment programs in the state of Minnesota if not the first to use Suboxone in the treatment of their opiate addicted patients. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 They had a huge influx in the number of opioid patients and they were noticing that they were leaving without staff approval. 13 Once they left a number of them were overdosing and dying. 14 They wanted to do something and introduced state of the art medication assisted treatment. 12, 13, 14, 18 Now people go through a program they have at Hazelden that includes that. 9 Trying to get other treatment providers to incorporate the use of medications in the treatment of opiate addiction in the state of Minnesota was one of my primary goals as a director of the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 I liken it to pushing a piece of string.  It just collapses on itself.  I had trainings through the professional association of treatment providers. 12, 13 I had trainings through DHS that we would put on and have different panels of parents and law enforcement and doctors. 8, 12, 13, 14, 20 I did a number of those.  AS: Talking about the benefits of medications? 14, 15 CF: Yes, here we are.  This is the only drug category, well alcohol there’s some medication too, for which there are effective medications. 5, 6, 14 We want to be science based in Minnesota not based on ideology. 13 Let’s use the science to deliver treatment. 6, 12, 13 There is a lot of barriers to it here.  I wasn’t able to do that.  AS: When did you start that?  Do I think it’s made progress?  What’s that it’s almost ten years. 14 AS: Hazelden won’t touch methadone either.  CF: Really?  They won’t touch it.  CF: Still?  AS: Suboxone is not really their thing anymore. 8, 18 Vivitrol is their…  CF: That’s the same as Suboxone. 8 AS: They won’t touch methadone because they said that’s not their client base. 10, 14 CF: And how many people who are on methadone go to AA meetings or Narcan meetings and are told, “You aren’t really sober.”? 9, 16, 18 It’s very frustrating.  The analogy I use is that someone has high blood pressure. 6, 7, 10, 13 They go to their doctor. 12, 14 The doctor says, “Lose weight, exercise, and watch your diet.” 12, 14, 17 Then they go back in a year because nobody really exercises or loses weight. 9, 14, 18 Here it is a year later they still have high blood pressure. 7, 10, 14 Then the doctor says the same thing, “Diet and exercise.” 12, 14 Then the person has a stroke and dies.  If you were the family of that person and you knew those prior conversations wouldn’t you say that doctor is guilty of malpractice? 12, 14, 16 He didn’t even mention that there’s a medication for high blood pressure. 7, 10, 12, 14 What kind of doctor are you going to? 12, 14 He doesn’t even mention that. 12 In treatment you have people who go into treatment programs and they say, “This is what we do for treatment programs.” 9, 12, 13 It’s all cognitive behavioral therapy. 12, 15 They don’t even mention there are medications that can really help with the craving. 12, 14, 18 There are medications that you can be on long term that really help manage this disease with behavioral components. 8, 14, 15, 17, 18 They don’t even say that.  One of the changes that’s happened is there’s now language in a law that says treatment providers have to inform their patients that there are medications. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 CF: A couple years ago. 11, 13, 14 I’m not sure how that’s going.  I’ve been at a distance and just reading these list serve emails about the language.  Big fights about the language in it from people who do not believe. 9 If this is really a disease you should use what the science says is available to treat the disease, not your personal beliefs about it. 6, 13, 18 “I just don’t believe in that.”  AS: Do you think that’s an impact of the Alcoholics Anonymous model or do you think it’s the moral model of addiction? 12, 14 CF: I think it’s both of them.  It’s news to me that Hazelden still does not accept patients with methadone. 6, 8, 12, 15, 16 However, I’ve taught at their graduate school and everything. 7 There’s this belief that some of the people who are treatment providers now, back in the day were trained in the belief that a drug is a drug is a drug and methadone is just a drug. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16 Whenever I talk about this publicly it tends to be students who are in the counseling in training programs at different places who say, “I was taught that a drug is a drug is a drug.” 5, 6, 16, 19 I don’t know if there are any programs that have counselor training programs in the state and I don’t know where they’re still hearing that. 9, 12 What also floors me is that just two weeks ago I got a call from a woman about a speaking event that I’m doing. 13, 14, 15 In the course of talking about what I would be covering I talked about this issue. 13 The use of medications and how much resistance there is to integrating them into effective treatment models in the state. 6, 12, 13, 14 She goes, “Oh boy that’s my son. 7 He’s been to treatment twelve times and he’s nineteen.” 12, 13 I thought, “It’s still going on.” 17, 18 I was stunned.  That just tells me. 15 This was unsolicited from this woman.  He had been to twelve different treatment programs. 12, 13 I said, “Well did anybody ever mention Suboxone to you or Vivitrol?” 12 I gave her the name of a doctor to talk with. 12, 14 I gave her the websites of how to read about these medications. 14 AS: This is someone who’s planning to bring you to speak?  CF: Yes.  CF: She’s a nurse.  She’s taken her kid.  He’s had twelve formal treatment episodes. 12, 13 It’s never been mentioned. 8, 12, 16 AS: It’s never worked because he’s addicted to opiates. 12, 14, 16 CF: She didn’t know what medications. 12, 14 She said, “He also has mental health problems.” 12, 19 I said, “That’s really common too.” 18 AS: You can stabilize him on methadone or Suboxone. 6, 8 Those drugs have such stigma. 5, 6, 9 CF: That blew my mind.  I could not believe my ears.  That was two weeks ago that that came up. 13, 15 Totally unsolicited.  We were talking about something else.  Then she said, “That’s my son.”  We talked for twenty minutes about her son. 15 He never had any treatment programs that brought up medications. 12, 13, 14, 16 AS: It’s criminal. 8 CF: It’s horrible. 10 It’s not limited to Minnesota.  Yes, people who are addicted are very challenging patients. 9, 12, 14 People are long term chronic pain patients are very challenging patients. 6, 17 But we have to give our medical system and our treatment provider system the tools they need to help these people get better. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 That’s one thing I realized going to all these events that it’s so polarized.  AS: Then you also have the DEA who are involved in the monitoring of methadone and how difficult it is to even prescribe that or have a clinic or the doctors. 10, 12, 14, 18 They’ve changed the law. 13 If doctors aren’t trained how to understand how to prescribe it and monitor it, they won’t agree to have a hundred patients. 5, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 Didn’t they even up the limit to three hundred?  AS: Yes, but who’s going to do it unless they understand it. 17, 18 CF: Doctors, why would they volunteer to treat the most difficult patients. 10 AS: The people who got worse. 9 CF: “I think I’ll get my Suboxone training so I can start treating addicts.” 8, 13, 14 That doesn’t happen either. 15 AS: Even though one doctor I interviewed said he has a great practice. 12, 14, 20 He has very few problems. 12 He is a primary practice physician who has a specialty in addiction medicine. 12, 14, 19 “These aren’t the people coming in the ER who see me. 6, 9 This is after we’ve gotten their lives stabilized.  They’re much better.”  It’s when are we going to quit the ER scenarios, the overdoses.  That’s the mythology around addicts is that they’re just these horrible people. 9, 10, 14 CF: Which reminds me.  The things that are different about the opiate crisis are not only that we have to look at the usual prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and the practice of medicine. 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 Also what distinguishes it from other drugs of abuse is that it’s got high abuse potential, high addictive potential, and high overdose potential. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 Unlike methamphetamine, unlike cocaine, unlike the hallucinogens, just a little bit too much can kill you. 6, 8, 16, 20 That’s what makes it different as well.  The final thing that makes it different is this onslaught of China produced fentanyl that is appearing not only in the supply of sniffable drugs whether powder fentanyl has been mixed with heroin as well as cocaine. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16 It’s getting mixed with the supply of powdered illegal drugs. 5, 6, 13 Also it’s being put in counterfeit prescription pills. 10 That is really only in the last year or so. 14, 18 That is implicated in the death of Prince and everyone who becomes addicted to prescription pain medications at some point runs out of the supply that they legitimately get. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 They seek them out on the black market. 5, 6 They find a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. 12 People who may be selling these counterfeit pills probably have no idea there’s fentanyl in them.  A little too much can kill you. 20 That’s the other thing.  AS: That’s the case with the woman who sold to the five. 17 CF: She was selling heroin that had fentanyl in it? 16 AS: Yes.  CF: I’ve looked at this death data for thirty years. 13, 14, 18 Historically fentanyl deaths were either like an anesthesiologist diverting it or someone not taking it as medically prescribed. 7, 10, 11, 14, 18 The classic case of that was a death of a guy who had knee pain and then was treating his knee pain with a heating pad. 6, 7, 13, 17, 18 Then he had the surgery and went home and still put on the fentanyl patch and put the heating pad on it.  Of course because it’s transdermal it opened it up and his wife found him when she came home from work on the couch with the fentanyl patch with the heating pad over it deader than a doornail. 14, 16, 17, 20 That was just not taking it as prescribed. 10, 11 Those were the kind of fentanyl deaths. 18 Then one case, this was a law enforcement report where kids were trying to roll up and smoke fentanyl patches with a joint on the inside. 8, 9, 12, 13, 17 AS: You’ve heard some stories I bet. 9 CF: I’ve got a ton of them.  That makes it new to this wild part of the counterfeit drugs. 5, 6, 9, 16 AS: So now you’re doing the drug abuse dialogs. 5, 6, 12, 13 How busy is that keeping you? 15 Do you want to stay busy? 15 Do you want to keep working in this?  How do you feel about it?  CF: That’s personal.  AS: Sorry.  CF: We have a lot more drug education going on because law enforcement drug task forces in order to get their federal funding have to deliver training. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15 We have a lot of non-profits who are delivering training. 15 There’s more training available to people. 9 AS: Then what you experienced in the beginning when you were asked to be in communications? 11, 14, 18 CF: Right.  There’s a lot more free training.  It’s a challenge doing it as a business.  AS: I didn’t mean that as a personal question.  There is more education. 14, 15 CF: That’s primarily what I want to do.  It’s hard to find a niche in there when people provide it at no cost. 9 I’m still sought out by the media quite a bit and I’m on TV three or four times a month. 16, 20 People come into my house. 6, 13 AS: Well you’re a good sport. 10 Thanks for taking the time with me for this project. 5, 11 Is there anything else you wanted to share? 18 CF: Looking over the course of my career 15, 19 I think it’s very disheartening because the drug abuse situation in my estimation as the trained observer of it is as dire and tragic as it has ever been. 5, 6, 9, 13 Compared to when I got into this thirty-five years ago drugs are more accessible, they’re more dangerous, they’re more unknown. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 Our public policy response over the past thirty years to me is not as swift as it needs to be or as broad to adequately address it. 5, 13, 14, 19 AS: That ends on a sad note.  Your perspective is important. 9 Thank you.  [End of Recording] "
"9","Devich_Stephanie","Carson Garder Narrator Amy Sullivan Sue Purchase Interviewers January 11th, 2019 Tribal Health Department Building White Earth Nation, Minnesota Carson Gardner -CG Amy Sullivan -AS Sue Purchase -SP CG: Well the PhD behind your name means you have learned how to learn! 9, 10, 12 [Sullivan laughing].

CG: Sure.  I hope that... 9 My only question is not a question.  It's a request.  I hope that you will communicate with me and let me know when your book comes out and I will buy it. 9, 12 AS: Oh yes, of course I will.  Everyone who I'm interviewing is gonna know about that. 12 Mostly this is a typical release form that just says that I can use what is said and spoken here in my other work and venues. 6, 13 The actual interview itself will belong to you. 17 [Long pause. 6, 13 Papers shuffling.]  AS: And Sue, I would say that if you have a question or you wanna participate I'm gonna introduce you as part of the conversation because you're in the room. 9, 14 SP: Cool.  SP: Okay.  CG: I'm gonna initial the review the content thing, not because I'm paranoid but I'm an old family doctor. 12, 14 AS: I put that thing in on my own after another doctor asked me. 12, 14 CG: Yes it's not, it's not that I distrust you.  AS: Yeah, yeah.  CG: One of the reasons is we have a big push right now here on White Earth land to try to develop some ethical forewarning for people who come in here to do acts of artistic expression. 9, 10, 12 You may have heard of or seen, The Seventh Fire video? 6, 9, 18 It's a video that a couple of citizens here linked up with an LA producer/director. 11, 14, 18, 19 And, they made a video and they kind of let people know they were here, but there was no supervision and no ethical contact. 9, 12, 16, 18 And, it turned out that the choice of the director and producer were to present things out of context in a very hurtful way. 5, 6, 10, 14, 18, 19 That really hurt the community of Pine Point [unclear]. 18, 19 I think I did hear about this... CG: ...and our citizens. 9 And so, I don't recommend that you watch it. 12, 17 Except, that yes in a way I do. 18 It talks about issues you're concerned about AS: What was it called—the seven fires? 12, 13, 14 CG: It's called The Seventh Fire.  And yes, you should watch it. 17 But, when you watch it you need to understand that's what should not be done, because it hurt a lot of people here. 9, 17, 18 And, the tribal council was upset and the community council at Pine Point was upset, and they tried to contact the producer and director, and they sort of blew it all off. 14, 18, 19 And said, ""We can do whatever the 'eff' we want.""  So, there's been a groundswell movement here to try to develop some ethical way to instruct interviewers, writers, filmographers... about the ethics of presenting a contextually respectful story about White Earth when it's done. 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18 And, that doesn't mean we don't want you to tell the truth.  The basic ideas in that video about drug abuse issues and generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences certainly are grounded in fact. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 They do happen, but the whole video presented things out of context in a quite hurtful way. 5, 10, 11, 15, 18 And the two individuals, neither of whom live here anymore and didn’t at the time that was made, are felt to have opportunistically taken advantage of their having lived here to make that video. 7, 11, 13, 18 So, that isn't why you're here, and it may not have anything directly to do, but I have to tell you that if you haven't seen The Seventh Fire video you should look at it, because it deals with issues that you are going to deal with in your own way, and your creative product. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 But, just know that the way that whole thing was done was exactly not what the tribal council of the community council and our communities wanted. 12, 18, 19 So, that's why I mention it, and that's why I'm signing initialing this. 11, 12 AS: Right.  No, I appreciate that so much. 10 SP: I think the actors... didn't, you are Clinton tell me before?  Was Natalie Portman that was in that movie.  I haven't looked for it yet, I had it written down.  She was a producer, and of course her work is wonderful. 14, 18 And so, nobody's gonna condemn her for her dramatic work and everything. 5 But the way the video was made was not acceptable and no one here was given any chance to ethically offer any standards or to review it or anything. 8, 12, 14, 18 Natalie Portman no one's gonna say anything but good about her work as a dramatic professional. 5, 8, 10 So... but she put the money up and produced it and it wasn't as it should have been done. 8, 10, 14 In our opinion.  That's our opinion but it's a solid opinion.  AS: Your address would be perfect since we had such a hard time finding you! 5, 9, 17 [Sullivan laughing].  SP: Clinton says he's supposed to be done by twelve thirty.  I was told two interviews, but they had way more come for the interviews. 16, 18 AS: Okay.  [Long Pause] 6, 13 CG: There, as you can see I'm a storyteller. 6, 15 It's hard for me to get anything done without telling a story. 9, 15 AS: Thank you.  CG: I'm just not as dramatic about it as some. 5 AS: That's okay.  So, do you have any questions for me before we get started?  Like, who I am or what I'm doing.  Want me to tell you a little bit about how I got...? 20 CG: You know what, I would love to hear a little more about that. 9, 12, 14, 20 You know what your time schedule is. 12 I'll leave it up to you, but yeah I like to hear people's stories. 9, 18 AS: So I, have a...worked on my Masters and my PhD while I was also raising my two daughters.  My PhD is from the University of Illinois Chicago. 13 My oldest daughter struggled with addiction issues that no one would call addiction 'cuz she was a teenager. 8, 12, 13, 14, 20 And, when she was... and, I was also pursuing one of my areas of interests is history of medicine. 8, 12, 14, 15, 20 And then, history of childhood. 14, 15, 20 And then, women's history. 12, 15 So those are kind of my areas in U.S. history. 8, 15, 20 I also have background in Native American history, particularly twentieth century. 9, 15 And I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 20 And so, I've been in my life very much, my life's been very enriched by my association and being surrounded by Native culture. 10 CG: Other than obvious need to connect with Native communities, do you have other connections other than professional connections with Native communities? 14, 19 AS: No, just you know personal things in my life. 10, 12 Cherokee nation.  CG: Do you have published work on the history of medicine and Native American history? 12, 14, 15 AS: No, not yet.  I'd like to know about those articles if you have them I would read them. 12 AS: Sure, sure.  Well I wrote my dissertation about the Girl Scouts in Oklahoma who experienced a very intense tragedy in 1977 when three girls were assaulted and murdered at camp, outside of Tulsa near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. 5, 7, 11, 14, 18 Yeah, so I wrote about that.  So my... CG: Our community understands such things. 17, 18, 19 AS: Yeah, so where I'm coming.... where my work has come from has been looking at trauma, and PTSD, and how communities heal from crisis. 19 CG: We have a lot of efforts going on in many of our divisions, and departments, and our community councils, and private individuals who are faith connected or traditional spiritual healers and teachers. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 So a lot of healing work going on all the time here.  So a lot of the women that were at the camp at that time were never diagnosed, and never had a chance to heal from that trauma. 12, 16 And, I was a child at the camp at the time. 14 I was ten.  And so, my insider status to that very—what became a very closed and tight-knit community because of the fear of that tragedy, you know, forever staining Girl Scouting in Oklahoma. 5, 9, 10, 12, 19 It was very... it was my personal experience that allowed people to trust me thirty years later to talk about what happened. 9, 10, 14, 15, 18 So, parallel to that is my work with the opioid epidemic because my oldest daughter ended up overdosing on heroin in our home before I, when I had never known she was ever possibly using any such thing. 6, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20 To me, as a child of the seventies that's not anything people would use. 6, 9, 13, 14 [Laughs].  Right?  So, her overdose, near death experience, coma, surgeries, and recovery. 18 In all ways—physical, spiritual, everything—really intrigued me. 6, 18 CG: How is she doing now? 12 AS: She is great. 20 She has a three and a half year old daughter, she's married, and she's about to start back at the University of Minnesota. 7, 14 Give her a hug for me.  You don't have to tell her that it comes from me, but give her a hug from me.  AS: [Laughs]  She's very, very much an inspiration.  CG: Good.  AS: But, what shocked me, as a very attentive, educated, mother, was that this could've happened in my house. 6, 13, 14, 15 And so I started, seeking out, just from my own personal knowledge. 6, 12 How did this happen? 15 What happened? 15 And then someone said to me, who was working at a methadone clinic, he said, ""You know you should really write about this. 12, 18 You should really talk to people."" 9, 18 'Cuz he said, ""Things are changing, and in how we're treating... the opioid epidemic is changing treatment. 12, 13, 17 It would be great, because you do oral history, if you could collect these stories."" 9, 15, 20 CG: Yes, it's a perfect match. 17 I've done about seventy interviews in the last two years. 14 And in all, in all... many different venues, all kinds of different people. 9 What I have been particularly sensitive about, I came to the harm reduction, the summit two years ago. 5, 9, 13, 14 Not last year. 14 I met Sue two years ago. 13, 14 CG: Meeting  Sue will change your life 10 [All laugh].  AS: Apparently! 20 Yeah, apparently. 20 SP: Thank you!  AS: So we, I interviewed her.  And then, have been able to bring her on to do interviews as well.  CG: Good.  I don't know Sue personally, but I know Clinton personally. 12 And, Clinton speaks superlatively highly of Sue as a pioneer in harm reduction life saving in Minnesota. 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16 AS: Yeah, he called her the elder birch bark.  SP: Yeah, he called me an elder birch tree of harm reduction! 5, 14 [Sullivan Purchase laughing].  AS: So, I'm gonna make you a little patch that says that. 20 So anyway, that's just kind of how this got started. 18 And, yeah.  I'm really honored to be here. 5, 18 I also want to say that the chapter that I'm gonna work on around tribal nations and the opioid epidemic, I come to that with extreme awareness and sensitivity about portrayals and I'm very versed in my own history, where my people come from. 9, 13, 15, 19 How I enter the story, my vantage point. 15 So, I just want you to know, that I'm so honored to be able to be here doing this. 5, 12 I will treat this with the most sacred kind of intellect that I can bring forward. 5 CG: Good, well you'll sell more books if you make us look twisted and evil.  [Sullivan laughs]. 15 But, you will help more lives if you make us look human. 19 AS: Well that's exactly what I'm doing CG: And, you can ask Sue, but I suspect Sue and certainly Clinton will tell you that some of the harm reduction we're doing here is pioneering work on Native lands, if not everywhere in Minnesota. 5, 8, 14, 17 AS: I know that. 12 CG: So, we're praying and working like hell to help save lives here, and to help offer people real healing of the underlying problems. 9, 10, 12 AS: Yeah, and well that's exactly why I wanna devote a chapter to it.  Because I got a sense from the harm reduction summit, that things were happening in ways that were transformative and that there were lessons and things being learned here that could be applied. 5, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18 CG: Your problem is, you really need to interview about 350 people here, and you're not gonna get to do it. 9, 12, 18 You and Sue.  AS: I know, that is my problem! 12 CG: You're gonna end up being selective, and by being selective you won't go crazy, but you'll also miss some powerful stories. 9, 10, 17, 20 AS: Right, but, if anyone you know of is willing, anyone else is willing to be interviewed we are open to it. 12 We have cars.  CG: I think the best shot is Clinton and his team. 11 Helping you Sue, to make connection with those who will want to speak their stories. 9 So, that's gonna be your best shot. 11 But, you know if, if you were an artificial intelligence and gonna be around for a thousand years you could interview almost everybody on the res here, cuz almost everybody would have a story of some kind. 12, 14, 15 To connect to the pain and wounds and to the reach for healing. 6 AS: Right.  So, that said.  [Coughs].  Excuse me. 6, 13 We should get started [coughing]. 14 My sinus, I'm not sick. 15 My sinuses had a, took a beating last night at the hotel. 6, 13 [Official Start Time: 15:40]  AS: So, this is Amy Sullivan.  I'm here with Sue Purchase, and Dr. Carson Gardner.  And we are at the White Earth Nation public health...? 19 CG: Tribal health department building. 9, 12, 19 AS: Tribal health department building. 9, 12, 19 In White Earth, Minnesota.  It's January 11th, 2019.  Carson just to get started, I wanted to ask you to just state your name and say that you give permission for this interview to take place. 18 CG: My name is Carson Gardner, and I am an employee here of the White Earth tribal health department. 9, 12, 19 And, I give my permission for the interview to take place.  And, I have obtained the agreement and support from the White Earth Nation research review board to allow me to do this interview. 10, 12, 14 The only stipulation is, I will not be able to give specific identifying information on White Earth citizens.  AS: Thank you.  So, one of the things that we like to start off with in oral history, as I talked to you about is... get your, to look at, to get the whole story of a person as much as is possible in this short time we have. 15, 18 But, if you could start with your childhood, where you were born, your birth date if you're willing to share it, and just talk a little bit about your childhood. 13, 14, 20 CG: Sure.  I was born on July 1st, 1952 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. 14 My mother was forty years old when I was born, my father was fifty-six when I was born. 14, 16 It was my father's second marriage. 14, 16 They had been married for thirteen years, unable to have a child. 7, 14 And, I came along and it was a great joy for them, for one year. 14, 17, 20 And, when I was a year old my father fell off a sixteen foot ladder, and he was terminally injured. 5, 14, 16, 17 It took him two years to die. 14 My mother was heartbroken. 8, 9 Never really recovered from the grief of my father's death. 5, 16, 18 My mother developed cancer when I was seven and died when I was nine. 10, 14 I was a food stamp kid.  We had not enough money. 8, 10 My mother got a job working as a secretary in a bank so she could get health insurance. 11, 19 And she worked for a year with a breast lump until she could get health insurance, and got health insurance, went to the doctor, and it was too late. 12, 14, 19 She died a year later with brain metastases and lung metastases. 13, 14 And we had no money and the insurance ran out. 8, 10 And so, they put my mother in an open state mental hospital cuz it was the only hospital that would take her. 8, 12 And when she died the duty nurse called our home, and my grandmother answered the phone and fainted dead away. 5, 8, 16, 18, 20 I picked up the phone and heard the nurse saying, ""Mrs. Gardner is dead. 8, 9, 16 What do you want us to do with her body?""  So yeah, adverse childhood experiences. 14, 18, 20 My grandmother took over my care when I was nine and she was nearly 80, and she lived to be almost 98. 5, 7, 19 We lived in the projects in East Minneapolis —across the river near the University of Minnesota. 5, 7 I can remember calling cops because there was a stabbing in front of our house. 6, 13, 16 You know, kinda rough, but a lot of good too. 10, 12 My grandmother decided she wanted to show me that she was serious about my staying in school and getting an education. 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 18 So, with her eighth grade education she enrolled in some extension courses at the University of Minnesota. 5, 14, 15 She completed a year of college, you know she didn't graduate, but everybody in the neighborhood thought that was pretty cool that Jenny Carson completed a year of college in her nineties. 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 So, that's kind of the context of my story. 14, 15 AS: Were you named after her?  CG: My mother named me her maiden name as my first name. 14 My name is Carson Timothy Gardner.  And, I don't know if you wanna know this stuff, but... 12 CG: My mother prayed to her spirit helper, named Timothy for thirteen years begging to have a child. 14 And so, my middle name is Timothy. 7 And she quit praying to the spirit helper, specifically after my birth.  So, I've always found that to be somewhat interesting. 17, 18 Many other spin-off stories. 9 But, you know darn, nobody's ever asked me to tell my story. 12, 15 So you're gonna get some stuff like this that may not be pertinent, but it will help you understand who I am. 17, 18 AS: It's beautiful.  That's right. 12 Would Timothy be a Saint Timothy?  Do you know? 12 CG: I don't think so.  I think Timothy would be more like a minomoni [unclear] duke—a traditional spiritual helper, even though my mother was not avowedly or publicly involved in any traditional Anishinaabe spirituality. 19 The other thing that I suppose I'm gonna tell you is important to me, because it gives me at least some connection here to the Anishinaabe community. 9, 19 My grandfather, Joseph Evan Carson, was the first white child born in Bemidji. 14, 16, 19 His father and Uncle ran Carson Brothers Trading Post. 16 And there's a whole story there that should be told. 15, 16 AS: Okay.  CG: But, when my grandfather was a preschool aged child, Shaynowishkung, if you know Bemidji you know about the statue in Bemidji of Shaynowishkung, Chief Bemidji. 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 You know that story? 12, 15 He's across from Paul Bunyan!  I didn't know his name or that there's a story, but I know exactly.. 12, 15 CG: Shaynowishkung. 12 There's a new statue, a beautiful bronze statue, done by a Montana, actually I think he's from Washington… 7, 16 but, he lives in Montana.  Sculptor, that was commissioned by the city of Bemidji, after much argument and debate and years of planning. 8, 12, 14 So, if you wanna know the story of the Anishinaabe in Northern Minnesota you should drive by the Shaynowishkung statue some time. 5, 12, 15 But, Shaynowishkung was an Anishinaabe man who lost his wife and some of his children and moved to the wilderness around what became Bemidji. 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20 And, he lived there and tried to put his life together after grieving the death of his Anishinaabe wife, and white people began moving to the area and he began helping them. 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20 Even though ultimately it resulted in him losing his own land and home and being displaced and everything. 6 He just kept helping white settlers. 19 And he was well loved for hat. 14 That's why there's' a statue of him there in Bemidji, because he helped, he helped white people and they remember that. 9, 19 So, he came into Carson Brothers Trading Post often for routine supplies.  And, one day he came in, and as usual set his musket up against the wall. 16 And, my grandfather walked over and grabbed the musket and of course those guns were loaded. 16 And, Shaynowishkung came over and just read my grandpa the Riot Act [confirm, unclear what “Act” Gardner is referencing], and my grandpa cried. 12 And, Shaynowishkung probably knelt down, I don't know, but he comforted my grandfather and that began a friendship. 12, 16, 20 And, what happened eventually is, not my great-grandfather but his brother, my great uncle, married one of Shaynowishkung's daughters—Mary. 5, 7, 12, 15, 16, 20 And so, we married into the Shaynowishkung family. 7, 12 And, Evan Carson, my grandfather, stayed good friends with Shaynowishkung through his life. 10, 12, 16, 20 He was obviously much older than my grandfather. 16, 20 But, when Shaynowishkung died he had a Western will. 12 And in his will he willed that musket to my grandfather. 16 SP: [Sullivan laughing]  Oh, that's beautiful!  CG: So, and it was on display in Bemidji for many years—lent by my uncle. 14 He died, and my oldest cousin, Nule Carson [confirm name], decided he wanted it back. 14, 18, 20 So, my cousin has it now. 12 But, I am connected to Leech Lake, and really to White Earth by that story. 15, 18 And so, you wanted me to tell you about my past and so I'm telling you about my past. 15, 18 That story is known to a few people in the Beltrami County Historical Society and to my own family. 9, 11, 12, 15 And a couple, two and a half months ago, my wife Gale and I, and my cousin Nule and his wife Barb—who drove on short notice all the way from Kalispell, Montana— got to meet Donny Hedbird [confirm name], the great great grandson of Shaynowishkung. 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 And, got to meet a couple from Texas who are from Mary and Elle Carson [confirm name], heritage—descendents of Shaynowishkung. 11, 12, 18 So, we all got together and had supper in Bemidji. 8 Met them for the first time. 14 That's history and that's oral stories. 9, 15 So, it isn't directly related to your book but now you know more about who I am. 12, 18 AS: Exactly, thank you. 11 So, what was your path to becoming a medical doctor then? 7, 12, 14 CG: I don't ever remember a time when I didn't talk about wanting to be a doctor and a minister. 12, 14 That's what I said as a little kid, and it used to amuse my mother. 6, 13, 16, 20 My grandmother took it seriously. 5, 11 And, that's just how it was.  But, I'm quite sure that it had to do with my parents and their health problems. 11, 12, 19, 20 I don't remember my father. 16 The only thing that I remember about my father is the smell of his pipe tobacco, he was a pipe smoker. 16 Not, a traditional Anishinaabe pipe smoker, a Western pipe smoker.  So, I remember only the smell of his pipe tobacco and I don't remember anything about his health problems. 12, 19 But, my aunt Grace was a legal secretary in Saint Paul, and she got pro bono help from her employer to try to get us some benefits since my father was millwright. 12, 15, 16 Fell off the ladder at work when he was working, in a situation that called into question responsibility of his employer.  Anyway, it didn't work out. 18 But when I got older I got to read that. 20 My family got no benefits. 12, 15 And I'm sure, I probably as a kid heard my mother and grandmother talk in distress about how they were gonna survive. 5, 7, 9 And, my mother's breast cancer metastasis was a horrible thing. 10 I do remember as an eight and a half year old kid, standing by my mother's wheelchair in our little rented home in Eden Valley, Minnesota and watching her have a seizure. 8, 14, 17, 20 And, she would come out of the seizure, look at me, and cry.  She couldn't talk, but she would just cry.  And I remember being very angry at her doctor. 11, 12, 14 Not specifically, not knowing him, not anything. 12 But, just angry at the doctor for letting my mother die, and I'm sure that there was some anger in me. 11, 12, 14 And, I'm sure I decided that I was gonna grow up and become a doctor and fix everything and cure cancer and make the world better. 10, 12, 14 I grew up and became a doctor and spent, I've spent over forty years now, and I realize that you can't fix everything and that bad stuff does happen. 12, 14, 15, 20 And that, that doctor probably did everything he could to help my mother at a time when there was no Affordable Care Act and there was very little support system. 12, 14, 20 And that, my mother was lucky to have anywhere to go like the Anoka State Hospital. 8 No one ignored her and no one did anything wrong. 5, 8, 11 But, I'm sure that my experience as a child, and knowing about my parents' fates, probably gave me an exceptionally strong motivation to not give up and to succeed. 12, 14, 18, 20 I went through a church school system, the seventh adventist system. 5, 7 My grandmother became an adventist when I was eleven, and I joined the adventist church along with her. 5, 17 I am no longer a seventh adventist because of my own personal experience of noting administrators in that church, promulgate subtly the idea that if people didn't believe like adventists they would not go to heaven. 5, 9, 17, 18 And, you know, there are a lot of wonderful adventist people, I'm not telling you the story to condemn that, but I left that particular church's politics and ideology for that reason. 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 But, they have a very strong commitment to health care based on compassion, based on Christian values, based on the beatitudes, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. 12, 13, 14, 19 And so, I went to boarding school. 7 I went to adventist boarding school right on through college and medical school because I got accepted at the seventh adventist medical school Loma Linda University in Southern California, and I did my training there. 5, 7, 12, 14 And then, I came back and did my residency in family practice at Hennepin County medical center in Minneapolis. 7, 9, 12, 14 And then, my wife Gail and I achieved my dream of becoming a family doctor in rural Northern Minnesota. 5, 12, 14, 20 We moved to Park Rapids. 7, 15 We spent eighteen years there, but due to a number of things, I reached the point where I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe history. 14, 15, 18 And, I discovered that I have actually a few drops of Anishinaabe blood. 5, 7, 11 The old joke about nose bleed Indians, I mean no disrespect, I have to tell it on myself. 16 I try to avoid fist fights 'cuz if I get punched in the nose I'm gonna lose my Anishinaabe blood in the first thirty seconds. 9, 14 But I do have some blood, it's from Bowantan [unclear] from the Salto [unclear]  Anishinaabe —the Sioux band, the Sioux Saint Marie band.  And so, I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe heritage, and the stories about marrying into Shaynowishkung's family. 9, 12, 14, 18 And so, on relatively short notice I made the decision and Gale supported me, and we left our job in Park Rapids and came here. 11, 14, 18 And we've been here for twenty years, and every day has been a joy. 14, 16 Because I can joke with people, and then talk with them about spiritual things, and then talk with them about tribal health business, all in the same conversation as perfectly fine. 9, 11, 17, 19 So, I've found a lot of what I was looking for.  Learned a lot about Anishinaabe spirituality and also been able to help.  And so, that's my medical background in being here. 7, 14 AS: That's fantastic.  Did you always wanna be a family doctor? 12, 14, 18 CG: I went through some struggles my last year of medical school. 7, 14 I thought about becoming a pathologist, but I'm red green color blind so that pretty much checks off looking at microscope slides. 5, 10, 17, 18 I thought about becoming a psychiatrist. 17, 18 Forty years, I've learned that basically family doctors are unlicensed psychiatrists in much of what we do. 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 So, I also thought about being a pediatrician, but in family practice you get to take care of kids and families. 12, 17, 18, 19 So, ultimately I decided for family practice. 12, 14 But those other thoughts certainly went through my mind in the intense last year of medical school trying to make some decision and to find some match. 7, 8, 14, 17, 18 AS: Did you ever have interest, or I mean did you ever have experience with addiction or a personal connection? 12, 14, 18 I wanted to kinda transition to... did you have experiences in your life that have later influenced you? 10, 17, 18 CG: Not during my childhood. 14, 20 My grandmother... certainly as a historian you must know about Carrie Nation? 5, 8, 12, 17 AS: Mhm, yes!  [Laughing]  I teach about it!  CG: When I was in third grade I watched my grandmother who weighed a hundred bounds soaking wet, bodily throw a drunken 200 pound man out of our apartment who had wandered into the apartment. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17 So, my grandmother was abused by her step-father when she was a teenager back in the late 1800s. 5, 6, 13, 16 And, my grandmother made it clear to me when she said that at age 13 if she had been strong enough and tall enough to get her step-father's gun off its mount on the mantle, she would've killed him. 5, 14, 16 So, that's a pretty harsh thing to say. 10 My grandmother wasn't a violent person. 5 She was a devout Christian, and believed in forgiveness and everything.  But she also told me that story. 15, 16 So, he was an alcoholic. 6 And, people in the throws of active alcoholism like other drug abuse, can do things they would never do if they were in their right mind and with good judgment and impulse control and everything. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 So, that's my family connection, but not in my immediate family. 12 As I said, we ended up living in the projects from the time I was middle school aged until the time I went away to college, and I still lived there came home from college. 5, 7, 14, 18, 20 So, we saw the effects of chemical abuse in the families that were our neighbors and friends in the projects. 5, 6, 13, 16, 17, 20 So, we saw that, but my grandmother was a very gentle woman who was iron fisted when it came to anything related to alcohol abuse, or any other drug abuse. 5, 6, 13, 14 And, white [unclear] people didn't mess with my grandma. 9, 19 And didn't try to argue with her about that.  So, on anything else she was very tolerant, understanding, and even often very progressive in many of her views. 14, 17, 18 But, do not talk with her about any kind of drug abuse being okay. 5, 6 Don't even try!  So, that's my background.  And I began to of course in high school learn about kids who got kicked out of boarding school for going out and getting drunk. 5, 7, 8, 10, 14 And then, in college learned about kids who got into all kinds of trouble. 7, 10 I was always involved in the seventh adventist church school system and they also had no tolerance whatsoever. 5, 7, 18 And didn't often, you know, in the sixties and seventies didn't often offer much harm-reduction focused sympathy on young people who were abusing drugs. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 They just got booted.  So that was, you know, kind of a harsh and fairly one-sided view, but that was my growing up view. 9, 10, 12 And then when I got to medical school all of a sudden, my relatively protected childhood was ended as I got involved in clinical work, taking care of patients, and studying the science of substance abuse, and the damages it could do. 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 19, 20 AS: Do you have children? 5, 14, 20 CG: No, my wife and I were never able to have children. 5, 14, 16, 20 And it was a spiritual and emotional ethical debate for us.  But what we ended up deciding to do was number one, to throw our lives into our professions. 14 My wife's a dietician, and she did dietetic consulting in all the years in Park Rapids. 14, 20 And then, did dietetic consulting here.  And as a historian, you should know this little fact that is not trivial. 12, 20 My wife, Gail Gardner, developed the diabetes Bingo game. 10, 20 which is now very popular, both in places like Oklahoma and other places where there are reservations, and also places where there aren't reservations. 12, 19 She and her assistant Paulie Nyson [confirm name] developed a game based on bingo that teaches good diabetes self-care. 10, 13, 19 It was developed right here about sixteen seventeen years ago. 12, 13, 14 And, a printing company out of Fargo Moorhead area, printed up the games. 8, 14 And, a number of them have sold.  My wife hasn't made any money on it, it belongs to the tribe since she developed it as an employee, but she helped to develop diabetes bingo. 8, 10, 17, 20 So, we threw our lives into our work, and also we decided we would rescue big dogs. 14 I always wanted a big dog. 18 When I was in medical school, one of my classmates and his wife went away for holidays. 7, 14, 16, 18, 20 Gail and I couldn't afford to do that.  And they asked us to take care of their Saint Bernard Golden Retriever mix—Ginger. 19 A wonderful gentle dog. 18 And we weren't going anywhere, so we took care of Ginger. 8, 19 And I took her for walks in the neighborhood when I hadn't been out in the neighborhood very often cuz I was busy studying. 15, 16, 20 And, one of the first walks we were taking, out from an unfenced yard that was about a foot and a half higher than the sidewalk, came a full sized Great Dane running right up. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 And, I, you know my life passed before my eyes. 10, 12 And then I thought, my god Fred will kill me. 5, 11, 17, 18 This dog is gonna kill me and then kill Ginger, and if I wasn't dead already Fred'll kill me when he got back. 5, 16 And the dog came up to me and...  Pardon me, I respect your space, but this is [acting out the scene]...  I'm a storyteller! 15 The dog came up to me just like that and went [licking sound].  [All laughing].  And as I was laughing, and wiping my face off, I said to myself, ""Damn I'm gonna have a Great Dane someday."" 16 So, after we moved to Park Rapids, in 1981, a few years later we adopted our first Great Dane, Chuckie. 7, 14, 15 Who was a mis-breed of the breeder.  He had a slightly short jaw, and the breeder couldn't sell him for big money, and so we adopted him for less than big money. 8, 10, 18 And he died at three and half of osteosarcoma. 14 Great Danes get spinal cancer. 10 He died of osteosarcoma Christmas week, when he was three years old. 14, 15 And Gail and I, amidst oceans of tears and anger against fate, said we'd never adopt another dog. 16 And one month later we got a call from a couple in Osage: ""We heard your Great Dane died. 9, 11, 16 We have a Great Dane named Sarah.  And, she's been running the neighbor's cattle. 8 We're farmers too. 8 We're not willing to fence her.  Our neighbor came over and just said, 'You know folks, I love you guys, you're wonderful neighbors. 12, 14, 18 But next time Sarah runs my cattle I'm getting out my deer rifle.' 8 And so, would you take Sarah?""  And Gail and I looked at each other.  We had said never again will we have a dog, we're not gonna go through that kind of grief again. 16 So, we took Sarah, and we've kept it up through the years. 14 So we've had eight or nine Great Danes and other breeds.  And we also had cats for a while.  But, Sarah was our general.  Sarah had a higher IQ than me, I'm sure. 7, 17 Not that mine's that high, but hers was well-higher. 7, 17 And she, if we had let her run free, she would've organized all the dogs in the neighborhood into an army. 8, 20 And she was the general.  Our neighbor was the Becker County canine officer deputy, and he kept his canine at home. 8 And when the dog wasn't working, it got to run free. 8 And the day I brought Sarah home, she was indignant about being on a leash, and she and I were trying to work that out. 16 And the neighbor's dog came running over to introduce himself, and Sarah yanked the leash out of my hand, turned around, and my god.... 8, 11, 14 Sigourney  Weaver would have been less terrified of Alien than the snarl that Sarah offered that dog! 5, 20 And she chased the police dog back into his yard. 8 And then she turned to me and looked at me like, ""Well let's get this over with.""  So, I picked up the leash and started walking down the road, and that dog came back out again. 16 You know, head down, tail down, crouched, and tried to walk up to Sarah and make amends. 12, 14, 16 And she turned around snarled and chased him back into his yard, and he damn well never into our yard again! 14, 16 So that was, Sarah, our second Great Dane.  And she was wonderful. 18 She lived almost thirteen years, which is exceptionally long for a Great Dane. 7, 14, 17 And she enriched our life with laughter and tears and wonder at her brilliance and her organization, and that's how we became dog rescuers. 10 And we specialized in Great Danes for years. 14 But, our last great dane a few year ago, Reggie, had congenital hypothyroidism. 6, 13, 14, 20 And by the time I convinced the vet to do a thyroid profile on him, ""Listen Gardner.  You're not a vet!  You're a family doctor. 12, 14 Your problem is you feed him too much."" 12 He weighed 279 pounds.  And when, the vet finally said, ""Well, bleep! 16 I guess you were right and put him on thyroid medicine."" 12, 14 He got down to a svelte 212 pounds.  But, when he developed serious heart failure at five years of age, Gail and I couldn't lift him anymore. 9, 11, 14 so we, decided we better rescue smaller dogs. 14 So, we now have a couple of Australian Shepherd Great Pyrenees mix dogs, that weigh about 60 pounds each. 11, 12 And they have double merle syndrome, which renders them partially blind and deaf. 5, 9 And we got them from a shelter in Southern Minnesota, who got a call from a shelter in Oklahoma that was a kill shelter, that said: [Feigning a Southern accent]  ""Would y'all send someone down and get these dogs, we don't wanna kill 'em they're such nice dogs."" 18 And so, Gail and I always tease people up here and say, you know our dogs bark with an Oklahoma accent. 9, 12, 18 But they came to a Minnesota non-kill shelter.  We found out about them on the internet and went down and got em.  I'm sorry, but you're a historian, and you like hearing stories and I'm a story teller, so! 9, 15 [All laughing]  Okay, so we should move on. 15 CG: Yeah, those are our children. 5, 14, 20 But we should move on. 15 AS: That's great, that's fantastic. 20 So, why don't we talk about at what point...  well why don't you tell me what your job here is exactly. 11 And, if it's changed. 13 Like, what did you start here, and what are you now? 12 CG: My job now is, I am the medical director of the tribal health department. 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19 That is not the top position.  My boss is Pat Butler, RN-BSN-PHN.  She was the long time director of public health nursing here. 17, 18, 19 And when the predecessor director of health services left, she took over that job. 5, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19 So, she's my boss.  But, I'm the medical director. 7, 14, 18, 19 And I'm the medical director of the White Earth ambulance service, a rural ambulance service that does 700-900 runs a year. 7, 8, 14, 18, 19 Far, rural, long-run times. 8, 17 Difficult, low-budget, lot of challenges, and a lot of overdose calls. 10, 16 And, a couple of years ago I became the chair of the White Earth research review board. 11, 13, 14 The White Earth tribal council, now called the reservation business committee, decided in the wake of Havasupai Incident, do you know about that? 12, 14, 19 AS: No. CG: You should read about that.  It isn't about drug abuse, but it's about abuse of power. 5, 6, 13, 17 A researcher from Arizona State University got the agreement of the Havasupai Nation, that live in the Grand Canyon, to allow blood to be drawn to do genetic research on diabetes. 5, 10, 12 And, it was all fine and good, and the consents were signed. 5, 10, 11, 14 But, several years after the study was done the lead researcher allowed frozen blood samples to be used by other researchers who were doing anthropologic, sociologic research. 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 And ultimately, that was used to put forth the theory that the Havasupai people came across on the land bridge from Asia. 6, 9, 13, 16 And the Havasupai people were pissed as hell! 9 That's against traditional, spiritual, historical viewpoint of how we originated on Turtle Island.  And, they didn't even tell the Havasupai anything about that.  But, a research review board member of the Navajo research review board, was reading and discovered this article and said, ""How did they get any Indian people to agree to that?"" 5, 9, 14 And followed through, and found out what had happened. 10, 15 She told the Havasupai tribal council, and they took Arizona State University to court and won the case. 16, 17, 19 Got a substantial monetary damage from Arizona State, and it was very embarrassing. 8 Arizona State administration felt terrible. 11 That's not what they set out to do, or how they wanted to do it. 18 But, it all just happened by the taking the easiest route. 11, 15 And so, in the wake of that, our tribal council decided we better have a research review board and institutional review board. 14, 19 And so, it was established two years ago. 13, 14 And, I became a member, and I got voted in as the chair. 14 And so, we're dong that work here now too. 12 So that will inform you about my extra caution.  So that's what I do now. 12 But I came here in 1999, my first act as an employee after being hired by the IHS clinic, was to call in sick [laughs]. 5, 14, 15 You should laugh at that!  CG: Gail and I moved directly from Park Rapids to here, no time off. 7, 15, 18 We did our furniture moving and everything evenings and weekends. 15 And, two days before I was to finish work there and start work here, I ruptured two disks in my back. 5, 16 My left leg went paralyzed and I ended up with an emergency neuro surgery. 14 So, I called in sick. 15 But, and I was here to work in a week cuz I was scared I'd lose my job. 5, 9, 11, 15, 19 And now, I have to tell you another story. 12, 15 You can just slap me up when you're ready [Sullivan laughs] 15 But, some historian should know this story. 12, 15 Poozy Hags [Confirm name], Clifford Hags.  You know about tribal nicknames? 12, 16, 19 AS: Mhm, mhm.  CG: Clifford was the director of evening housekeeping services at the clinic. 6, 13, 18, 19 And the week I started, my leg was still paralyzed! 15 Took months for it to get better after the surgery. 11, 16 And I was dragging my shoe, and I had the kind of shoe that would make marks on the floor. 5, 14 And Poozy did the evening floor cleaning. 14 And so, like the third day of work at the IHS clinic, I was sitting in my office doing insurance forms and paperwork, like family doctors do in the evening. 12, 14, 16 And, in came this very Indian man.  And he said, ""You must be Gardner.""  And I stood up with my cane and limp, and said, ""Yes. 14 I'm Carson Gardner.  Nice to meet you!"" 18 And he didn't even put his hand out.  He looked at me and he said, ""You're making marks on my floor. 5, 10, 14 You come out here and I'll show 'em to you.  We'll get along just fine if you quit making marks on my floor."" 5, 10, 11, 14, 17 And I had no idea that Poozy is one of the biggest jokers on the res, and the biggest story-tellers. 15 And you know, if I'd have known him, I would've laughed and said, ""Ah c'mon Pooz."" 11, 12 But, he took me out, showed me the marks, and said, ""You go buy another pair of shoes!"" 5 And so, I told Gail when I got home, and you know, I took it very seriously. 11, 12, 16 I'm an OCD kind of a guy, and so I was very worreid about it.  So we went to Fargo, went to Penny's, I bought a pair of shoes, and I insisted to the sales person that I put them on, get up, and find the nearest linoleum on the store and rub my shoes.  And my wife Gail tells me that while I was doing that, the salesman turned to her and said, ""Does he do stuff like this often?"" 15, 20 And Gail said ""Yeah, all them time.""  So, I bought the shoes, I came back, I showed Poozy, and then he got a big grin, and said, ""Ah, we're gonna get along great!"" 17, 20 And Poozy became my secret agent here.  He was the evening housekeeping lead who did the floors. 6, 13, 14 But he would come in, and we would trade stories during his break. 9 And I'm sitting there anyway, not being paid for doing paperwork. 18 So, he would come in and tell me a story. 15 But then, he'd say, ""By the way Gardner, one of these days ‘so-and-so's’ gonna come in for some little thing, and you need to know that they're having trouble with a heroin habit. 12, 16, 18, 20 And you should see if you can figure out a way, don't tell 'em I told you, but see if you can figure out a way to get 'em to talk about it, ‘cuz they need help."" 6, 16, 18 So all the years I worked at IHS, Pooz was my secret agent in the community. 14, 19 He was as much a healer as any of the rest of us, snd maybe more so. 5 ‘Cuz he could get away with that, and to hell with HIPAA and all that. 18, 20 Don't every tell anybody I said that.  You may have to erase that.  There may need to be a small blank on the...  AS: You just mean it…  you mean it, in a kind of philosophical way. 18 CG: So, that's what I did first. 14 That's what I did first, from '99 until 2011, and then I retired. 5, 14 And my retirement lasted three months and I got hired here, and I've been working here ever since. 5, 10, 11, 12, 16 And I will probably keep on working for any number of reasons.  Probably the most important one is a statement that I only heard verbalized recently, but I realize rapidly became my own personal unstated prayer: ""Creator help me to live in a way today that will make my ancestors proud."" 8, 9, 12, 16, 18 I just heard that recently, but actually a lot of the stuff we all do here, is based on that. 7, 9, 13 My boss, Pat Butler, in department head meetings, again and again says to us, ""Just remember people, we have to do things twice as well here as anybody else to be considered equal."" 5, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 And so, if you look at the Western administrative records, you'll see that White Earth has developed many best practices pilot programs. 6 And it's because of people like my boss Pat Butler, who believe that, yes we do have to do things twice as well as everybody else to be considered equal, so let's damn well get busy and do it that way! 5, 9, 15, 18 AS: That's great. 20 So, you mentioned you, that you know that Poozy told you about someone with a heroin habit. 8, 12, 16, 20 Was that the first time you had heard about it here? 9, 14 And then, when did it start kind of becoming part of what people were talking about? 9 CG: When I interviewed here, which was just a couple of weeks before I was hired, I called Howard Hayes, the medical director of the IHS clinic. 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19 When I decided ethically and spiritually it was time for me to investigate working on an Indian reservation, I called him, he answered. 5, 14, 19 And I said, ""Hi Dr. Hayes, my name's Carson Gardner.  I'm a family doctor in Park Rapids, not too far from you. 12, 14 And I was wondering if you had any job. 11, 15 And he said, ""When do you wanna start?'""  So, I went for an interview, and he took me around—nice man. 18 But he said, when we did the interview, he took me into the Pine Point, little Pine Point clinic, he took me to NATUA, and in the car he said, ""You know Carson. 12, 20 The Anishinaabe cure will test you.  Just the first day someone will come in and want narcotic pain medicines, and you need to know what your own personal ethics and values are on that issue because we do have problems with that here. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 And, I'm not telling you you shouldn't prescribe pain medicine, but you need to know that you will be tested. 6, 10, 12, 14, 15 People will always come to the new doctor here. 12, 14, 16, 18 People are struggling with substance abuse and will always look for the easiest source. 6, 13, 18 Howard said, ""I'm not criticizing our citizens, I love them, I'm here too. 14 But, you will need to develop your own ethics and your own values and your own decision making process on that because some people will push you very hard to get narcotics."" 9, 10, 14, 17 And so, I guess, in my interview a few weeks before I started here that's what I learned. 10, 15 And then I came and started seeing patients and saw that it was true. 5, 6 And, I was probably one of the most conservative prescribers of narcotic pain medicine. 6, 10, 12, 14 But, after a few years we all realized we needed to take a more aggressive step in standardizing our approach. 14 So, we developed a chronic pain management program at White Earth in the early twenty-first century, where we all sat on a committee, all of us medical prescribers at the clinic. 6, 7, 10, 12, 14 And, we developed a pain contract. 6, 19 And, we developed policy and procedure.  And, we developed random drug testing policies. 5, 6 And, we developed policies on what to do if a person tested positive, and policies on what would be the criteria for second chances, and what would be criteria for release from the chronic pain management program and everything. 6, 12, 14 So, we did that here, and we certainly used resources. 6, 8, 13, 16, 17 You know, other places, we looked at their policies and prodcueres as templates. 12 But we did that in the early twenty-first century here, because we, like many other IHS clinics, had to use locums doctors to fill in. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14 And the locums doctor from elsewhere might have a whole different view on prescribing... 10, 12, 14 AS: What's a locums doctor? 12, 14 CG: Locum tenans doctors. 12, 14 That's I guess latin, and I haven't looked it up, but it's a doctor who specializes in doing fill-in work. 5, 12, 14 All they ever do is fill in for other clinics. 5 They go and work two months at White Earth, and then they have two months off to go sailing, and then they go and work two months at Pine Ridge, and then they go work two months in Oklahoma, and... AS: Is it mostly through IHS? 11, 12, 16 AS: Oh, okay, but it can be anywhere, but? 8 CG: Yeah, it could be anywhere... 8 AS: But once you're in that network.  CG: I'm just using Native American examples. 6 But there are locums doctors that that's their own choice. 6, 12, 14 They want to work very hard for a few months, and then have several months off to not do medical stuff. 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 And, you know, a busy family doctor finds that attractive sometimes. 12, 14, 15 But, locum doctors have no context, and they have their own set of rules. 12, 13, 14 They can come into an IHS clinic, and if there is no policy on it, they will do whatever they think is right. 12 And, it isn't always necessarily conducive to managing responsible opioid prescribing. 10, 13, 14, 16, 18 And so, the chronic pain management program helped to better standardize the policies and procedures for locums physicians. 6, 12 And of course, while we were doing that Clinton and his team were being formed.  And I won't tell Clinton's story, but he started consulting here from a harm reduction program in the Moorhead area. 5, 8, 14, 15 This is Clinton's home, but he was working there in harm reduction, came here to help out, and he will tell you the story about how there was a Hepatitis C cluster here in our community that sort of was the eye opener that helped community leaders to realize we needed a harm reduction program. 5, 14, 15, 19 And, he'll tell you the story on that, but harm reduction was being started on that basis at the same time we were starting a chronic pain management program policy and procedure at the clinic. 5, 6, 12, 14, 15 AS: And this is around 2011?  CG: Clinton will tell you, it was, I don't remember what year. 14 But probably, in the early 2000s.  Sue, do you remember?  SP: Maybe around 2006, 2007?  Somewhere in there.  CG: Yep.  And so, it was probably about that same time.  Maybe even 2005... when we started developing our chronic pain management program. 6, 12 I retired in 2011, but the chronic pain management program had been going for a number of years there prior to that. 5, 6, 12, 14 AS: So, you retired for a few months and then... CG: I retired in 2011. 5, 11, 16 AS: And then you came back?  CG: And, I got hired here by Monty Fox who was the director of health services at that time. 5, 18, 19 So, that's why I joke about my retirement lasting three months. 11, 12, 16 AS: Right.  So it was still like, 2011?  CG: But I became a desk jockey. 15 I hung up my stethoscope in 2011, and that was painful. 6 I still see old patients here, who say, ""Damnit Gardner, why don't you come back and take care of patients at the clinic?"" 6, 19 And I always smile, and acknowledge the joys of clinical practice, but I have been a desk jockey here and administrative physician since 2011. 12, 15, 18 AS: So, besides the chronic pain management plan, how's the public health and the medical system here approached the opioid epidemic? 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 19 Could you describe how it first started, and what it became? 14 CG: A couple of things happened to raise my consciousness, and I regret that I didn't get to meet Sue at that time. 11, 15, 18 But Sue, undoubtably was working with Clinton at that time.  Clinton and his harm reduction team, Minus Bala, Karen, Keller, and not Rachel Lawfranir. 5, 14 [confirm names] 16 She's on the team now, but she wasn't on the team then. 12 But, the harm reduction core team brought Sarah Gordon here. 5, 14 Do you know Sarah Gordon? 12 CG: Yeah, I hope so. 9 If you haven't interviewed her, you pardon my french, damn well better!  AS: I'm going to [laughs], I'm going to. 15 CG: You better, you better!  AS: She's on my list.  CG: Because, she came up here to talk about harm reduction, and specifically to talk to medical providers. 5, 7, 14 I was one of the few who attended that talk, but she showed the video produced by anypositivechange.org, you should know about them they're out of Chicago. 12, 13, 14, 18 Do you know them? 12 AS: Mhm.  CG: Have you seen their video? 6, 18 AS: No. CG: You should watch it, it's on their website. 17 I can tell you exactly what happened. 15 I had been very conflicted.  Not about ethics, and responsibility, and compassionate care, but about how far I should participate in harm reduction. 5, 9, 14, 19 But in that video that's still available on their website—I checked it a year ago—they're still showing it. 13, 14, 18 They use primarily people suffering from active substance abuse, and not actors in that video. 6, 9, 13, 18 And, one of the scenes in the video, a young woman is sitting—calm, well-dressed, alert—and saying ""I got clean and sober, but my man is still doing heroin. 5, 16, 18 And, I want him to quit, but you can't quit for anybody else.  And so, I carry a naloxone kit, because if he's dead he can't recover, can he?"" 16 And the video goes [mimics ""swooshing"" sound effect], to black. 18 And I couldn't sleep that night. 16 And I thought really hard about that. 9, 17, 18 And I thought, okay, I have been a compassionate family doctor, and I support good care, but I haven't been active in harm reduction. 5, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 And, it's probably time I get active in harm reduction. 5, 14 And so, it was Sarah Gordon, and Clinton, and Mina, and Karen, and that video—which you should watch—that was the turning point for me. 17, 18, 20 That's when I got involved saying to Clinton, what can I do to help?  And shortly after that, one of our child welfare workers gave a talk at a community forum meeting, and said, ""I just want you guys to know that last year we had twenty babies from White Earth that had narcotic withdrawal syndrome, and we damn well need to do something about it."" 5, 12, 14, 18, 19 And, it was a shock in the community, and we had more meetings and said you know we need a treatment program specialized to helping our pregnant moms who are struggling with substance abuse, but can we do that? 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 And so, medical minded people like me sat down and thought about it, and did our OCD thing, and wrote out timelines and flowsheets and said, at a meeting in 2013, late 2013, ""Well I think we can put this together. 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18 We can do it, but it'll take us about a year, maybe a year and a half to have it together."" 5, 8, 14 And, Tara Mason, our tribal secretary treasurer, was at that meeting. 18, 19 And she stood up, and said, ""Okay, it's December now. 12 I want this program open and taking clients in June."" 10, 11 And then she walked out of the room. 14, 16 And then we looked at each other and said, ""Well hell!  Nobody told us we couldn't do it!"" 16 So we were open by June taking clients. 10, 11 And the mom's program is still open, and it's won Minnesota state awards, and it's won some national awards. 14 And so, that was the other thing, they asked me to put together a debate position on the negative side 'cuz no one would do that. 8, 9 They had some nurse practitioners come up from the Twin Cities and present the positive position: 5, 8, 10 This is why we should have subaxone treatment program for pregnant women on the White Earth reservation. 7, 10, 12, 13, 19 Well, we need someone to argue the other option so Gardner why don't you put it together. 8 That's your job. 11 And I, put together a lot of information, decided I really couldn't argue the negative position, 'cuz it needed to be done. 8, 14, 18 So, that was the first active role. 10, 14 And then in 2014, my boss Pat Butler said to me, ""You know we have a lot of overdoses. 12 You know that because you're the ambulance medical director. 7, 12, 14, 18, 19 We need to start teaching nalaxone rescue.""  ""Well, I uhm, uh, uhm..."" ""Put together a program! 8 I want to get going here in the next few months."" 11, 16 So, in early 2014, and I guess the motivation was I had told her that the Minnesota legislature was reviewing what became Steve's Law and about to pass it. 14, 16 And that's when she said, ""We need to be teaching nalaxone rescue.  We don't have to have state support, we're a sovereign nation, but it'll be good to have state support, so why don't you put it together?"" 8, 10 So, the ambulance manager  Devon Green and I, put together a teaching program. 8 And I went back to Pat, and to the tribal council and said, ""You know, we're having overdoses. 12, 19 And you know, we're attending funerals here. 12 And so, we need to do this.""  And that was at the time the Minnesota legislature, I think they passed it as of July 1st, but they weren't gonna implement it until late August or early September. 12 And I, I said to Pat, ""You know it's silly, I've got the program ready. 12 We could start teaching.  No experience, but we could start teaching. 18 The sooner we do it the better, but according to Minnesota legislature we can't start."" 8 And Pat said, ""Let me talk to the tribal council."" 19 And, like three days later they passed a resolution saying that we should start teaching and giving out nalaxone immediately, which for me, I'm not licensed by the tribe I'm licensed by the state of Minnesota. 9, 13, 16 And I thought, holy hell. 17, 18 If I do this, and some legislator gets pissed at me, they could yank my license, or have the Minnesota health department sanction me. 9, 12, 13, 19 And I, talked to Pat about it.  We looked at each other, and we said, well they wouldn't dare!  The tribal council would raise such a racism argument that they would get backed against the wall. 12, 19 So, we went ahead. 14 We started teaching nalaxone rescue here a month before the actual implementation of Steve's Law. 12, 16 Of course, it worked out fine. 11 And we met, Clinton, Matt, and I, eventually Matt Luxey Read Holtum [unclear] and you know, made that connection and all the wonderful good that has been able to happen here. 5, 10, 12, 15, 18 So, I haven't compiled the statistics for the last month, but as of a couple of months ago, and believe me there is no spiritual implication for this, so don't even think about spinning that. 11, 13, 16 But, as of a couple months ago, we had trained 666 ""nalaxoners."" 8, 11, 13, 16 [Sullivan laughing].  And better than that, and that's ambulance service training, but about a year and half ago the ambulance service and harm reduction said, we really should get together and do team teaching. 5, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19 The ambulance service has done classes for groups of employees, and for behavioral health therapy group members. 7, 12, 15, 19 And harm reduction has done individual one-on-one counseling, so ten to fifteen minute individual training. 5, 14, 15, 19 Gardner's class and hour and a half with all the science and ""Oh god... 7, 11, 14, 15 Garner's gonna talk again.""  But, actually people like it. 7, 9 They become the ambassadors to correct misconceptions about, ""Oh overdose?  Give em, shoot up milk!""  Or, ""Throw 'em in the snowbank!"" 12 Or, ""Put 'em in the shower!""  Or, you know, our students from our group classes get to help correct misconceptions, and say, ""No, no. 7, 12 You have to see if they don't respond to pain. 6 You have to breath for 'em, cuz nalaxone won't work if they aren't breathing.  And then you have to give 'em the nalaxone, and then you have to keep breathing for 'em 'til they wake up. 8 And this is how long it'll take, and this is what you can expect."" 17 So, the ambulance service and our tribal first responders, who are the security officers at the casino, have a 120 nalaxone saves since the summer of 2014, 120! 7, 8, 10, 14, 19 And twenty of them are the first responders at the casino. 14 They're basic emergency medical responders, not EMTs, not paramedics. 7, 14 But, they came to me in the fall of 2014 and said, ""Doc, we'd like to get in on this too.  We see overdoses at the casino."" 6 So, I'm gonna guess that with twenty saves, that first responder group is probably one of the premier first responder groups in Minnesota for nalaxone rescue. 10, 12, 14 But they came to me, to us!  To Devon Green and me and said, ""Will you train us?  We wanna get started.""  So, but then you'll talk to Clinton and he'll explain to you, that Clinton and I, and Mina, and Karen, and Rachel Lawfrenir, estimate that for every one save, the ambulance has, citizen harm reduction trained rescuers have done three of four, maybe five. 5, 10, 14 So, we're pretty solid on estimating our 120, is probably 480. 10 So, we probably have pretty close to 500 saves, and with all the individual trainings that harm reduction has done we have probably trained, we have certainly trained over 2500 nalaxone rescuers on White Earth reservation. 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 And, ""Isn't that enough Doc?""  We will not stop, I like the quote from the director of the Baltimore Maryland health department who said, ""My goal is to have everyone over twelve years of age who lives in the city of Baltimore trained as a nalaxone rescuer."" 8, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 So, our goal is, we'll stop training when we have a year of no overdoses at all. 14 We'll consider stopping training, we might not even stop then, but we ain't stopping training until we have a whole calendar year of not one single overdose on White Earth land. 9, 14 And you know what, the truth of the matter is, as we struggle with the peaking of this opioid abuse epidemic, and the sinister introduction of fentanyl, and fentanyl cutting of heroin, that isn't gonna just happen like that [snaps]. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 So, we're gonna be doing nalaxone training and rescuing for a long time yet, and we will continue to do it as long as is needed. 17 AS: Would you, do you know, if it was pain pills that introduced heroin here? 6, 12, 14 Is it the same narrative that we're hearing in most of the U.S. about the upsurge of heroin was because of pain pill addiction? 6, 9, 12, 14, 16 That pain pill addiction started... 6, 12, 14 CG: I'm certainly sure that that's a factor. 8, 17 I'm not convinced that that's the primary origin of opioid abuse here. 6, 13, 19 I don't have statistics for you, but I know the street level view point of the matter. 12 We had a serious crack-cocaine problem here twenty years ago, and we've cycled through the various changes in drugs, substance abuse of choice, and everything. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 I believe that there was a small heroin problem here prior to the twenty-first century, but I have no doubt that pain management and prescription opioid use fueled a serious worsening here. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 So, I have no doubt about that.  I don't have statistics on it.  What I can tell you is, a year of two ago, the Minnesota health department put out statistics from 2000 to 2015 on county drug overdose deaths. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 Including the counties that shared with reservation land here- Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater. 5, 12, 16, 19 And they estimated forty-five drug overdose deaths during those years- 2000 to 2015. 5, 6, 14, 18 And everybody I've talked to from tribal council to Poozy Hags, to everybody else says, ""Phew. 19 That's a gross underestimate.  We've had a lot more deaths than that."" 18 Which has brought up the issue of busy old family doctors who are tired and have a desk stacked with insurance forms and death certificates and which one's gonna get more attention? 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 And, what gets put on the death certificate? 18 And, does the coroner take the time to say, ""Well you know, cardiac arrest. 8, 12 Yes, of course, but...  AS: This person was twenty-five... CG: ""...This person was nineteen-years-old, or twenty-five years old, so, I'm gonna call old Gardner and say, 'You know Gardner I hate to be a pest, but you said this twenty-five year old died of cardiac arrest. 12, 14 Well, of course, that's the final mechanism but was there anything else that was a contributing factor or?'""  ""Well yeah, they were a heroin user."" 6, 13, 16 ""Well, wouldn't you wanna put that on the death certificate Gardner?"" 18 You know, that's hypothetical, but you get the idea. 6, 12 AS: But, how things get lost. 11 CG: I'll insult myself and not somebody else.  So, there has been a problem with struggling with substance abuse disorder here for quite some time. 6, 12, 13 And it did include street heroin and other street opioids, but I'm certain that the 1990s concept of pain as the fifth vital sign, and articles from LA or New York about doctors being sued for providing inadequate pain control, and big pharma's advertising ""Oxycontin! 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 No problem! 12 You wont' have any problem..."" [sarcastic tone]. 8, 12 AS: Nobody gets addicted. 12, 14 Right.  CG: [Continues]  ""Yeah, come have dinner.  We'll buy you dinner, and wouldn't you like to prescribe Oxycontin?"" 10 I'm sure that that had a lot to do with it.  I came in 1999…  yeah I'm sorry I talk too much.  AS: I'm just keeping track. 16 No, you keep going!  CG: I came in '99 here, and as I told you, Dr. Howard Hayes warned me. 16 There was a problem with prescription drug seeking, certainly was here. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 17 But I think, my opinion, working at IHS was, that we weren't necessarily the center of the problem. 12 There were other physicians practicing, not associated with IHS, in fact, do you know the Lee clinic story? 12, 15 AS: No. CG: Dr. Lee, god rest his soul… 11 Was he here, around here?  CG: Graduated from a residency program in Fargo, and opened up several urgent care clinics that people could walk into any time, and prescribed tons of narcotics. 7, 9, 10, 16, 19 You know, relatively speaking. 12 And, ended up being charged with malfeasance and losing his license, and later committed suicide. 13, 14 So, very very sad story. 15 Don't remember his first name, but… 14 AS: Fargo.  In Fargo did you say?  Moorhead? 14 CG: Yeah, Dr. Lee.  And the clinic I think is called the Seven Day Clinic.  It's in Detroit Lakes, and it's near Menards.  Sue, if you know Detroit Lakes. 12 That was originally a Dr. Lee Clinic, and it got bought out by someone else after his untimely and sad death. 18 And, ultimately....  Essentia bought it up because they believe in mitigating competition when they can, but they don't run it that way. 5, 8, 18 They run it as a responsible urgent care clinic, but there were several clinics like that. 8, 16, 19 And, Clinton will know about Dr. Lee. 12 And I, you know, I didn't see any court records or any board of medical examiners' records. 6, 7, 12, 14 But, that was going on in the 1990s.  And, I think that, very likely that situation helped to fuel a, you know, a serious habituation to opioids in this whole region. 6, 11, 12, 13, 20 And you would have to look into that.  I can't give you any authoritative history, but I, but I was here when that happened and we heard the stories about people saying, ""Oh I can go down to Lee's clinic, I can get as much 'oxy' as I want to. 9, 15 I can get as much 'vic' as I want to.  What the hell's wrong with you IHS doctors?"" 11, 12, 14 So, we heard that. 9 And, apparently so did the North Dakota board of Medical Examiners. 14, 20 And so did the North Dakota judicial system. 14 So, you may wanna look into that.  It goes across the border.  But, many of his urgent care clinics were through this area, rural Minnesota. 8, 19 In the 1990s.  And, they were handing out 'oxys' and 'vics' like candy.  AS: Right, right. 12 CG: And so, isn't it nice for Gardner to blame someone else. 18 There were various narcotic prescribing strategies by IHS doctors, but we had a solid core group from 1999 till about 2005 or 2006, we had no turnover in doctors and nurse practitioners. 8, 10, 12, 14 And, it was amazing 'cuz the whole IHS joke is, well you know, two years pay off your public health pay back, and then you leave. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 But we have the same group of five medical care providers, primary care, from before '99 until about 2005, 2006. 7, 14, 19 And then it fell apart and people started leaving, and we got in short termers and locum tenens doctors, and it became more an issue with varying philosophies. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 But, from '99 when I cam until 2005 or 2006, we had dependable reliable team of primary care providers who were concerned about the issue and established policy and procedure to help minimize the risks of doing harm by opioid prescribing. 10, 13, 19 So, I don't think in that time of '99 to early twenty-first century we were the primary cause, but we certainly saw the problem. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 And, yes we did prescribe. 10 And I had, I had an individual who had pain issues. 6, 12, 13 This is an interesting story. 15, 17 I'll try to leave out any identifying factors. 17, 18 So, here's the story. 15 This was an individual who was a community member who had pain management issues. 6, 12, 13, 19 Who came in to see me, and I did prescribe narcotics for the individual for a period of weeks. 6, 10, 15, 18 And then, I realized that there were red flag signals here of inappropriate requests, and early refills, and suggestion of using in excess of prescribed doses. 5, 6, 10, 11 And so, I had a visit meeting with this individual and laid out the issues and explained to them that I was going to have to stop their narcotic prescription. 10, 12, 13, 18 And, they threatened to bring a gun to my yard!  Now, I have to give you the perspective, I've been a family doctor for forty years, I've been threatened four times. 12, 14 Three of them were by white people in Park Rapids. 9, 19 So, don't think this is an ""Indian thing.""  But, but this was an individual who was desperate and said something desperate.  And, I reported it to the tribal cops and we looked at each other, and they shrugged and I shrugged. 13, 19 And you, know, no harm was done to me. 12 And so, that happened, but that's not the end of the story because a week and half later I was on emergency call, and this individual came in having a profound severe heart attack. 6, 9, 14, 15 And I got to care for them, and I looked at my nurse and she looked at me, and I said, ""Ueah we're gonna care for this individual."" 19 And so, we did care for that individual, and it was nip-and-tuck and the ambulance had to rush him to Fargo. 19 And they ended up with fairly extensive sub-specialty management. 9, 12 And on that, that's all I'm gonna say.  But here's the thing, I lost track. 11, 16 Ajd a few months later my nurse came to me and said, ""'Member 'so-and-so?'"" 11, 16 And I said, ""Oh yeah, I remember 'so-and-so.'""  And she said, ""Well 'so-and-so' is here and wants to talk to you.'  And I said, ""Geez what do you think?""  And she was a community member here and she said, ""Oh yeah, you wanna talk to 'so-and-so' today."" 16, 19 So, so-and-so's put in the room, and I go into the room thinking, ""Okay, chapter two of the 'What's the matter with you damn doctors?'"" 12, 14 I walked in, the individual had come to me to apologize for threatening to bring a gun to my yard, and to thank me for participating in the team that helped to save their life. 9, 10, 11, 16 So none of the three white persons in Park Rapids ever came back... 8, 19 [Amy and Sue laughing] and said I'm sorry.  But, that individual did, so that's the whole story. 15 But, that happened here. 15 And I would guess that if you talked to everyone of us who had practiced at that time, each one could tell you some other story. 8, 15 AS: Oh, almost every doctor has told me a story like that, yeah. 12, 14, 15, 16 CG: So, that's mine and I tried to de-identify it as much as a I could.  AS: You did a great job. 11, 20 CG: If you would make that into a big deal, I, you know some people who know, ""Well, I know who that is 'cuz I 'member about 'so-and-so's' heart attack and I 'member about this and such."" 9, 12 CG: But, so those were the kind of things that were happening in the early twenty-first century. 14, 15 But I still maintain that narcotic prescribing at the IHS clinic was not the main problem that fueled the opioid abuse crisis here. 6, 10, 12, 13 I think there were other factors in play. 17 We certainly did prescribe narcotics, and yes some of our patients did misuse them. 6, 8, 10, 13, 17 But in the years that I was here, we proactively tried to be very careful. 14, 19 What we weren't good at was we weren't good at harm reduction. 5, 10, 14 We didn't say, I'm going to have to stop your narcotic prescription, but I would like to have you talk to Clinton Alexander and Minus Bala [confirm names], and let's see if we can get you a substance abuse baseline assessment and some support here. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 And maybe we can work out some harm reduction help that will help you get through this. 5, 14 And I still wanna be your doctor. 12, 14 And you know, don't wanna have this end on a bad note, let me put together a team that will help you. 8, 12 We didn't do as good a job at that as we should back then. 10, 11 We're doing a much better job on that now. 11, 12 So, we had to grow up and learn about harm reduction. 5, 10, 14 I told you about Sarah Gordon. 16 I told you about the video. 16, 18 Profound turning point in my professional life was Sarah Gordon's visit and that video. 10, 18, 20 And she will tell you I give her a hug every time I see her. 6 I give her a hug and she laughs, ""You've already thanked me!"" 11, 15 But, that was a profound turning point in my professional and my personal life. 10, 20 SP: Government lady! 12 That's what she's known as up here. 11, 12 AS: Government lady? 12 SP: [Laughing].  Government lady! 12 AS: So, what about, can we talk about medicine for opioid maintenance? 12, 13, 14 CG: Sure.  AS: And, and what have you, when did that, when did subaxone and probably, do you have, you don't have methadone...? 6, 8 AS: No, can you talk about how that fits into the story? 15 CG: I was involved in doing basic research for the mom's program. 14 We recognized that although we were determined to create a program that included traditional medicine wheel, spiritual healing, human services support, psychological counseling and support, substance abuse assessment and support....that we were going to need to develop a medically assisted treatment arm of the mom's program. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 And so back in late 2013, early 2014, I did the research along with others.  I wasn't the only one, but I'm the OCD guy who in my next life is gonna be a medical librarian [Sullivan laughing]. 7, 8, 10, 14 So, I did the research, present it, and said, ""Look subaxone is what we need. 5, 10 We're not, you know, we have to move heaven and earth to open a methadone clinic here, but we can get a subaxone clinic open. 12, 15, 19 You can find the staff who have some experience, or who can get the experience."" 18 And, Julie Williams and Minus Bala who helped Julie Williams start the mom's program here agreed with that. 14 And, Tara Mason, the tribal secretary treasurer, agreed with that. 19 And, all the other members on the work-group agreed with that.  And so, we went with a subaxone program.  And it was the same thing that I've already told you. 16 No one told us we couldn't do it. 8, 16 So we put the program together! 8 And we didn't think too much about it.  Except Tara wanted it by June of 2014, and so it was there by June of 2014- working well not working clumsily and ineffectively. 18 And then, a year or so later people started coming and saying, ""How the hell didn't you get this program going out of nothing? 9, 14 Tell us how you did it!""  ""Well, no one told us we couldn't! 8, 16 We looked at the literature, saw what it would take, got the people, got the training, started it!"" 9 So, you know, it would be good for you to talk to some of the mom's program. 10, 12, 14 AS: Yeah, I did meet Julie. 18 CG: I sound like I'm bragging, I'm not!  I'm bragging up the White Earth philosophy that we can do this together. 8 We have to be twice as good as everybody else to be considered equal, and we can do that. 5, 9, 10 So that's how the mom's program got started. 14 And, if you've talked to Julie, or do talk to her, or will talk to her, she'll tell you more of the detail.  But, it became obvious to me and everyone else on the work-group that subaxone, buprenorphine nalaxone, was what we needed to use. 6, 8, 13 And subutex without the nalaxone I think is an initially what was used. 6, 8, 13, 16 I'm not sure now. 12 I am not a behavioral health employee, and the mom's program is a behavioral health program. 14, 15, 19 Jerry Jaskin is the director of behavioral health. 15, 18, 19 Pat Butler is the director of tribal general health services. 18, 19 So, I was the crossover consultant helper.  And so, I know the literature now says there is not any likely harm from nalaxone, and so pregnant women could certainly take subaxone. 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 But the tradition was to use subutex. 6, 13 But we got that started real fast, and made it work, and provided the traditional spiritual support and healing.  Provided the human services support. 19 Provided the substance abuse counseling. 6, 13, 19 Provided child support, baby sitting. 14 Provided good parenting training. 10, 20 Provided group therapy. 12 Provided…  everything Julie can tell you about.  And, our program has worked very well, and we have served a lot of our equawa [unclear] our Anishinabe women who have struggled with substance abuse disorder, and who have been pregnant and needed help. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13 And, many of them are now clean and sober and helping as counselors in our community and other places. 12, 19 So, that was one of the crossover points.  I told you about the video. 16, 18 I told you about ""fade to black."" 16 I told you about ""I didn't sleep well that night."" 16 One of the big issues for me was medically assisted therapy 'cuz I had been resistant to that. 7, 12, 13, 14 I had supported what is still a very important tenet of the traditional viewpoint, and that is we can provide healing through medicine wheel traditional spiritual methods. 6, 9, 12, 14 And I still believe that, but even our traditional spiritual community are very gaetae [unclear] 19 Anishinabe.  Our very conservative, old-line traditional spiritual healing community, has come out in favor of the mom's program and what the MAT [confirm acronym] program is doing. 9, 14, 19 What they have said is, ""Now, just so long as you don't do what Western medicine always does, damnit! 12, 14, 17, 18 They always leave us out and think that we're some kind of bizarre, extremist group. 18 And you know, 'blah blah blah blah Western medicine and traditional healing could never work. 12, 14, 16 Our medicine wheel healing works. 9, 12, 14 You Western doctors need to understand that you're pretty good at curing stuff, but curing doesn't last. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 What we do is heal people. 9 When you guys'll wake up and invite us to join the team, and help to heal, then your curing will last.  And then we'll do some good."" 10 We're working on that.  I just got a call from out of the blue from an American Heart Association staff member in Minnesota, who has some American Heart Association regional funding and wanted to put on a conference fro Indian Health Service care providers and happened to call me because they have my name. 14, 15, 18, 19 And, like I always do, and have done for years, I said, ""Well you know, there are several things you could do. 12, 14, 18 You know, you do a rapid heart attack response, that' great. 9, 12, 13, 20 You do rapid stroke response, that's great. 13, 20 You teach medical providers how to use a lucus to external compression device. 6, 7, 10, 13, 14 That's great. 20 Why don't you sponsor a healing counsel here and get together Western clinicians and traditional healers and have us all talk together as equals about how we can help with heart health on the reservation here?"" 8, 9, 19 And that always ends the conversation. 18 ""Ah well yeah, that sounds really nice... and well thank's for the call we appreciate it..."" [Sarcastic tone]. 8, 10, 11, 18 But this person said, ""You know, let me talk to my boss, but that sounds like a good idea."" 10, 12, 18 I got an email back and said, ""I talked to the Minnesota AHA vice president here who's in charge, and they said we can do that!"" 9, 10 So I turned it over to our cultural director, Merlan Deegan [confirm name] who will follow up with it. 10, 14, 18, 19 But, you know I'm not gonna hold my breath. 12 I've been saying this since about the year 2000. 10, 14 But actually, I know that person professionally, not personally, and when they say they're gonna do something, based on American Heart Association promise, they do it. 7, 12, 13 So, we may actually have that after all these years, and that would be a very important advance here for Western medicine to invite traditional medicine with respect and humility, and listen to what traditional medicine says. 7, 9, 12, 14 And, you don't have time for me to continue on with this, but I was asked by Dennis Hisgun, one of the senior substance abuse counselors here, a traditional Anishinabe and Dakota healer and substance abuse counselor, and you should hear his story! 6, 9, 13, 15 AS: What's his name?  CG: Dennis Hisgun Senior.  H-i-s-g-u-n [spelling], Dennis.  D-E-N-N-I-S [spelling].  He's about almost eighty now. 12 I'll have tell, I'll have to do the abbreviated story. 15 AS: Okay.  CG: But, Dennis asked me to put together a group of essays he could use to work with teenagers in recover to show them that traditional healing as a stature equal in value to Western medicine. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 And I thought, I said, ""Dennis okay I'll do it."" 17, 18 And I thought, ""Yeah I'll have a few..."" 17, 18 By the time I was done I had fifty-two essays!  And I've, I keep a notebook now, and I've collected several other ones since then. 8, 12 I studied for a decade with a traditional healer, Wimba Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling], he's gone to the star world now. 12, 14 And, when I talk about Western medicine and traditional healing, I always point out to the audience, ""Wimab Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling] came to me at the IHS clinic for Western medicine, and I went to him at his sweat lodge, because we believed it was good to combine the best of traditional medicine and Western medicine. 10, 12, 14, 18 Now, he's gone to the star world and I'm still here so I guess that tells you whose medicine worked best!"" 12, 14, 15 [Sullivan and Purchace laughing].  And the audience always falls over laughing. 18 AS: That's great. 20 CG: But, he used to say to me, ""You know Gardner, I feel bad for you Western doctors. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 If you wanna develop a new medicine, you have to spend twenty million dollars to do the research. 10, 12, 14, 16 And then you have to spend forty million dollars to convince the FDA to okay it. 10 All I have to do is ask Creator and the Healing Spirits what to do for my client, and then damn well do it!"" 10 And we would laugh about that.  But, then he would also say, ""You know the other thing that you need to think about Gardner is you Western doctors joke about placebo effect. 12, 14 You call it lying to the patient, but that's Creator teasing you.  Because what placebo effect really is, is it's the inherent spiritual healing power that Creator has put into a human being. 17, 18, 19 You look at your own Western research.  Often a placebo effect works a third to a half of the time, and you call it lying. 9, 14 It's Creator saying, that there is inherent healing power in a person that can be activated. 17 But Gardner, you Western doctors aren't willing to admit that you have to believe in it for it to work. 12, 14 We believe in it.""  And there was just a study that came out in the Western medical literature, I just read about it a month ago, and it talks about what's called ""open-label placebo studies."" 7, 13, 14, 16 And that's a whole new thing in Western medicine. 12, 14, 16 Western researchers get people into the study and they say, ""We're going to do a study on this medicine 'triple crown barbecue sauce.' 9, 12, 14 [Sullivan laughing].  We don't know if it works. 9, 12 It might not work at all.  We don't know, but we'd like to do a study, would you be willing to try it?"" 12 That's what they tell people, it's just sugar water. 9, 16 And people say, ""Yeah! 9 I'd love to be in your study. 14 You don't know if it's gonna work, have no idea? 12 Not gonna hurt me?""  ""Nah it won't hurt you, but we don't have any idea it's gonna work.  We don't have any reason to believe it'll work, but it was suggested and we'd just like to find out.""  So, they give it to people and hell it works! 9 A big percentage of the time!  So, Western researchers are now saying, ""Maybe we should be doing open-label placebo studies because when people believe that the sugar water's gonna work, they get better, at a much higher rate than they do if they don't believe that they'll get better!"" 7, 9, 12, 16, 17 And so, that's actually happening now in the Western medicine literature. 7, 12, 14, 15 So, okay here's Dennis Hisgun's story. 15 Dennis comes from a family, Anishanabe and Dakota. 12 He had a good stable childhood. 10, 12, 14, 20 Two parent family. 12, 20 I think his dad did farming, ranching. 8, 14 But when Dennis was about thirteen, his dad died in a traumatic accident, and it just broke Dennis' heart and he ended up as a teenager on Franklin avenue in Minneapolis and that's where I grew up- pretty near Franklin Avenue. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 20 So, I wonder if Dennis and I ever met each other.  But, Dennis would overdose on various things—whatever drug he could get ahold of. 5, 6 Certainly alcohol, certainly other drugs. 5, 6, 8, 17 And many people up here and over in South Dakota from his Dakota relatives said, ""You know, just leave Dennis alone. 8, 9, 12, 18 you know, he doesn't wanna get better. 12 He's never gonna make anything. 16 He'll end up dying in an alley down there, and just leave him alone."" 8, 18 But one day, when Dennis came out of old Hennepin General after yet another overdose, there were a few Anishinabe men standing on the sidewalk: ""Hi Dennis, we're here to take you home."" 9, 12, 14, 16 ""I don't know you guys! 12 Leave me alone!"" 8 ""No, we're taking you home!"" 11 ""Let go of me!""  ""Dennis, we're just like you.  We're trying to stay sober and recover.  And we're gonna, we rented a house on Franklin Avenue. 6, 13 We're gonna do this together."" 8 ""Well, I don't wanna go with you!  I don't have a job, I can't help!"" 11 ""That's okay, we'll float you alone Dennis until you're feeling better and can get a job and help us out."" 8, 11, 15 So, what're the chances that that would work?  What is one human life worth? 10, 19 What is another chance worth?  Dennis went with 'em cuz there was no HIPPA, he didn't have a choice. 6 They grabbed 'em and they took him.  But it was good. 10 And Dennis got sober.  He thought things over. 17, 18 He had the childhood, and the background, and the support that would help someone to get back into sobriety. 12, 14, 20 And, he made that transition and he stayed there for a while—helped at the house. 6, 13, 17 Then he came back up here, took an EMT class, became an EMT here for a number of years. 7, 14 He was an EMT here and helped save lives, and then he realized that Creator wanted him to be a substance abuse counselor, and so he got that training and became a substance abuse counselor here, and in the intervening more than forty years. 6, 10, 13, 14, 18 He's number one, stayed clean and sober one day at a time. 14, 16 And number two, he has helped thousands of people make a start on the red road of sobriety. 5, 9, 12 You can't get sober for anyone else, but you need someone there to help you when you're ready to make a try.  And Dennis Hisgun Senior is the one, and so when I'm giving a talk and someone raises that, ""Ah c'mon Doc what's one life worth?"" 8, 10 I tell 'em Dennis' story—I got Dennis' permission. 15 But you would need to get Dennis' permission to tell his story, but he gave me permission to tell it verbally [Amy laughing]. 15 That's his story. 15 If those guys hadn't grabbed him, he probably would have died in an alley.  He will tell you, he had bad active addiction at that time to a number of drugs. 5, 6, 12, 14 But it took, and he dedicated his life to helping other people, and he's now almost eighty. 9, 10, 12, 14 He's still working part-time on the res. 9 He helped the mom's program. 14 He's helped our Oshki Manidoo center in Bemidji.  He's working right now with behavioral health. 12, 15, 19 We're doing regularly scheduled peer support recovery classes. 7 We have tribal certification authority to certify peer support workers, and we do the training, and he's on the team that does the training. 12, 19 So that's what one life is worth. 10 If there hadn't been someone to say, ""Wait a second.  We oughta give Dennis another chance.  See if we can help him.  He might do something good with his life."" 10 He did, but if someone hadn't of stepped up with harm reduction help—it was homemade, but it was harm reduction SP: 5, 14 That's right! 12 CG: You know Dennis probably would've died in an alley of liver failure and other overdose. 12, 14 So, you need to hear Dennis Hisgun's story. 9, 15 And, you have just heard it from me, but you really should try to talk to him. 9, 18 AS: Oh definitely, definitely. 9 SP: Dennis was at the conference, the harm reduction conference in San Diego, with the mom's program. 5, 14 AS: Oh really? 18 CG: Yeah, I think so.  There's Dennis Jr. his son, who works here. 9 And Dennis Sr. but he's in his late seventies.  SP: Jr… how old is... ?  CG: He's a young looking man!  He doesn't look like he's in his late seventies but he is.  SP: So, that that's the same Dennis that I met.  CG: Yeah, probably.  CG: Yeah so, I love and honor him and wish I had met him many year sooner. 8, 14 But, Dennis' story to me is the story of what one life is worth when you step up with harm reduction help and you don't give up on someone and you offer them yet again, help. 5, 10, 14, 15 SP: Harm reduction is home-grown. 5, 10, 14 CG: Yes, of course!  SP: It's the important piece about it. 9 CG: Of course!  You're right! 12 And I, I knew you'd love the story if you hadn't already heard it, but that's a story that should be heard. 9, 14, 15, 16 And Dennis tells it when he tells his own story, but he hasn't made a big deal out of it. 15 It's never been published anywhere, and if I write it in an article I dub him ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling], which is the Dakota name for ""bear."" 8, 16 I don't use his name ""Dennis."" 6, 13 But I talked to him and he gave me permission to tell his story, so if I tell it like this I use his name. 6, 13, 15 But if I write it, I use the name ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling]. 6, 13 AS: Okay, Okay.  I think you've already answered my question about your ideas and philosophies about best practices. 5, 18 If there's anything else you wanted to add about that? 18 CG: Best practices here…  AS: Yeah what you've come…  are what we need to do to help our fellow community members to find safer ways of living, and to find hope to heal the underlying generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences so that then they can receive long-term healing of the superficial issue of drug-abuse. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 Drug-abuse is a superficial issue, but it's a lethal one. 8, 13, 16 But, if you don't offer red-road healing, if you don't offer healing of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences, then the superficial but lethal problem is going to continue. 5, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 And, no I can't show you any community here where we have zero drug problem, but we are working very hard to offer healing for the underlying problems and trying to bring that to the front. 5, 6, 9, 12, 19 It's always been in the background, but it hasn't been the front. 18 And all of our tribal public health, behavioral health, harm-reduction, judicial organizations—a couple of years ago we started an adult drug court, we've had a juvenile drug court, restorative justice courts... 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Is that called the Circle Back Center?  CG: Circle Back is a, is an outpatient recovery maintenance group, therapy program for teens. 11, 12 But, it's connected with the adult drug court DIY—Dually Involved Youth Program—and the juvenile court program. 5, 6 So, they get referrals from juvenile court from the DIY program, and then Circle back can take kids just at their own request of their parents' request with no organizational referrals. 20 AS: Oh, Okay CG: So, we're doing good stuff like that. 10 But we, have been trying since 2013 when we opened the mom's program, to bring to the front the concept that we need to find ways to offer durable medicine wheel healing—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual—for the underlying wounds of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences. 6, 12, 14, 18, 20 And, when we do that, then we'll have a platform for effective long-term sobriety. 12, 17 So, those are the things in general that I think all our divisions and departments are working on, and we have a program that we call the Drug Task Force. 6, 9, 12, 19 Has Clinton told you about that? 16 SP: I don't think so.  CG: What the tribe declared a drug abuse emergency in 2011, or 2012—just around the time that I had my three month retirement and started working here—but shortly after the declaration the tribal council established the Drug Task Force. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 It is not a police group. 8 It's a group where representatives of every division and every department get together and meet once a month, sit down at the table in the administration building—the big table—we all sit there and say, ""So what problems are we seeing in our community now related to drug abuse? 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19 What are the wounds?  What is the healing that's needed?  How can our programs work together across department and divisional boundaries to make things work?"" 6, 8, 9, 12, 19 And certainly that was one of the motivations for getting the mom's program going, 'cuz it was that table where Tara Mason said, ""I want it open by June."" 8, 14, 17 And walked out of the meeting. 16, 18 It was a Drug Task Force meeting. 18 So, a number of our other programs in recent years have been based on that, and the cultural division director is the facilitator of that meeting, which is really good—Mike Larak [confirm name and spelling]. 6, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 The police chief comes, representatives from drug court come—from substance abuse, from behavioral health, from tribal health, from harm reduction—but it's the cultural director of our nation that is the facilitator, Merlon Deegan [confirm name and spelling]. 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 You should talk to him too.  D-E-E-G-A-N [spelling], Merlan.  He is a former cop, he's a former tribal policeman, who has traditional healing training in both Ojibwe and Dakota traditional healing. 8, 19 He's a nephew of Dennis Hisgun Sr. So there's a story there. 15 And so Merlan is our cultural director, and he chairs that committee to help us all keep on task and focus on the fact that we need to provide medicine wheel healing for the underlying wounds of our people if we want to establish successful long-term sobriety strategies here. 8, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 AS: Do you feel hopeful? 9 CG: Yes.  Very much so.  AS: About the opioid epidemic? 13 CG: I do, but I don't feel hopeful for any quick-fix solutions. 9 What we need is the work of the Drug Task Force, the work of the mom's program, the work of our MAT program, the work of our traditional cultural division. 6, 14 Merlan has spent a number of years struggling to work with a consultant, Roxanne Delille. 14 She's a PhD level educator and an medaywan [unclear] woman, who works at Fond 9, 14, 16 Du Lac College.  And, she has been working with Merlan an a group of us, a work group, to develop a new employee orientation program. 16 And as it stands now it's three four hours segments, that talks about the cultural history, the spiritual history, the history that the conquerers got all wrong, the history of work the White Earth nation has done to help its community members, and to help others, and the last section is being completed. 7, 11, 12, 15, 19 And Merlan's hope with the support of our reservation business committee is that every new employee will get to sit in those sessions, and learn that history of ""Gawa ba be banicka"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 Confirm words for translation.]— ""the land of abundant white clay""—its history, its culture, a little bit about its language, its spiritual traditions. 15, 17, 19, 20 And, how they relate to issues today like drug abuse and like public health work, and human services work, and... 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 19 Being a transportation bus driver! 5, 17 Being a child care worker! 14, 19 Being a whatever!  Everybody's gonna get that.  And, a commitment's been made to have all current employees attend that training too. 12 So, that's a big deal for us.  And that's work that Merlan has helped to keep on the front burner, and not to be forgotten about.  Because that's part of that, you have to deal with the underlying issues. 9, 12, 13 And, you have to acknowledge the hope that Anishinabe people have always had, but has often been distracted from by issues of colonization, issues of internalized oppression, issues of discrimination, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.. 9, 10, 12, 13, 18 You know those lectures and that's not why you came here, but I will tell you two acknowledge phrases that you don't need to learn but you should know about. 10, 12 One of them is, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 17 It took me a long time to learn that. 10, 17 I am not a fluent speaker, I've worked very hard to learn that, and here's why. 9, 10 Do you know what that means in English? 12 This is what it means in English: ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 5 So, even if you don't ever learn any other Ojibwe, that's what you need to know as our working policy here, and not everybody can say that. 10, 12 I've worked hard to learn how to say that. "" 9, 10 Gaween......"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 17 ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 5 And the ""you,"" is not Amy Sullivan or Sue Purchase, the ""you"" is the life. 10 Okay?  ""You cannot destroy me life. 10 You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" 5 That is, an ancient Ojibwe saying from [unclear]  Memorial.  It applies right now to the drug abuse crisis. 5, 6, 12, 13 And, we're working on using that in our work here. 6 The other thing you need to hear is this one. 8, 9 This is from Roxanne Delille, who's helping with the employee orientation program.  She taught us this one. 8 I call these two sayings the ""Gaweens"" [Ojibwe.  Confirm spelling of word for translation.] 17 This one starts out with Gaween. 8 ""Gaween...."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 17 Also took me a while to learn that! 10 What that means in English is, ""It is not without reason that I do this.""  That is another Anishinabe saying.  ""Oh geez, oh why did they burn that sage, I always think that smells like weed, you know? 12, 18, 20 'Joe!  Look at putting down tobacco by a tree and there's food in that plane.  That must be some aberration!"" ""Gawenn..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear.  Confirm words for translation.] 17 It is not without reason that I do this.  Merlan can explain, I can explain a little, Roxanne can explain, his team can explain, many of us who have learned can explain. 10, 20 There's a reason.  A healing powerful reason, for each and every ceremonial thing we do here. 10, 17 And, I have to tell you this about smudging, this isn't why you came here, but we smudge a lot.  Harm Reduction smudges a lot. 14 You probably know that. 12 Did you know that there are only 400 nerve receptor endings in the human nose for sense of smell? 12, 19 They're on a little piece of mucosa, about the size of a postage stamp in the back of the nose, 400! 20 You've got hundreds of billions of neurons! 5 I mean 400, that can't be very important. 9 Those 400 receptors are like a 400 character password.  They can recognize more than a trillion different individual inputs, and those sense of smell receptor nerve endings are the only nerve endings in the entire human body that go straight into the brain. 13, 17, 19 They don't go to the spinal cord, they go straight into the brain. 13 And do you know where they go? 12 They go right into the limbic system, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the part that's damaged by drug abuse and needs healing. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13 And, do you know that Western researchers have discovered that human beings who can be given a brief meditational routine that helps to center them on healing thoughts will do much better in recovery, but it's very hard because in our text messaging, and phones, and blogs... 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 it's very hard to get people to do that. 9 That's what smudging does.  The Anishinabe ""Seven Fires"" prophecy, more than a thousand years ago, actually warned the Anishinabe that drug abuse was coming, and said that there would be something to help. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 Smudging is a direct line into the human amygdala, to remind our brain centers of, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. 5, 9, 13, 18, 19 Confirm words for translation] 17 So we smudge here.  ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear.  Confirm words for translation] 17 ""It is not without reason that we do this.""  It's part of our hope. 9 So, that's my own eccentric version...  AS: No I don't think it's eccentric.  CG: ...but I'm pretty sure that people who are not as eccentric as I am, will agree with that. 9, 10 And that's one of my essays, in my group of essays that I gave to Dennis Hisgun, is don't laugh about smudging.  Let me tell you about human physiology, neuroanatomy and how it works. 9, 19 Smudging really works! 9, 18 AS: Will you share some of those with me?  The essays?  Are they ones that you've written? 8 CG: Yes.  AS: Oh, oh okay.  They're not, you aren't collecting research.  CG: Nope!  Here's the deal, I got tired of not admitting that I had written them. 5 I gave 'em to Dennis, but I wrote 'em and so...  AS: Ah, [laughing] the truth comes out!  CG: You can go on to Barnes and Noble, or SmashWords, and you can type in Carson Gardner, and you will see an ebook on a reinterpretation of the Dao De Jing... 6, 10 AS: Oh wow. 17 CG: And you will see an ebook of very eccentric sonnets, and then you will see an ebook of essays. 6 And, I have probably sold ten, so I am not marketing, and I don't give a damn whether you look at 'em or not. 5 But, if you wanna read them you can get access to 'em, 'cuz I got tired of not sharing them. 5, 9, 18 And, I decided well, I'll put em in an ebook and then I'll die. 14 And, after that people will actually look at it. 7, 9 So, I'm hoping to become a famous dead poet and a famous dead essayist! 16 [Sullivan laughing.]  So, the fact that they're available is just a way for you to look at 'em, otherwise if you want a totally free copy instead of spending four or five bucks... 10, 18 AS: No I'll buy it.  CG: I'll email it to you from home.  AS: No, it's okay.  I'll buy it and then you can say you've sold eleven!  CG: I have no desire in making money but, the whole fifty-two that are in there as eccentric as they are and I, you know, there's nothing off color or intolerable, but it will take you down a path that Western Historians don't often go down. 8, 10, 12 But I'll stand by everything I put in there.  SP: You mentioned they're on Amazon, what's the other one? 8, 12 CG: They're not on Amazon they're on Barnes & Noble.  AS: Barnes & Noble.  SP: Barnes & Noble.  CG: Amazon requires that as an ebook author you have to sell 2,000 dollars worth of ebook before they'll even put it on Amazon.  Did you know that? 12 SP: Did you say another one like SmashWords? 8 CG: Smashwords.com A couple in California, frustrated writers, a decade and a half ago decided, ""You know maybe the best thing we could do is put together a website to help other people get their ebooks out there."" 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 And so, the Smashwords.com website has now helped amateur writers like me publish several hundred thousand ebooks. 12 Most people make no money, and SmashWords says, ""You know what? 8, 9, 10, 12 We'll do it for you free, and here's the deal.  If it sells we want ten percent of your profits."" 15 That's pretty reasonable. 10 And so, that couple is making a decent living on that, most of us never sell anything. 10, 11, 14, 16 You know, Grandma buys one, our cousin whose always liked our poems buys one, and nobody else does. 12, 18 But, they do it free, and they still do it free.  Costs you nothing except the rigamarole of getting the electronic text right. 10, 12 But they buy their groceries because 5-10% of their authors actually sell a bunch of copies, and so then they get paid. 7 AS: That's great. 20 SP: I'll have to check it out CG: Yeah, yeah, you get on SmashWords, you can get it somewhere else.  And, if you really don't want to buy a copy I'll give you the essays free 'cuz I always feel guilty. 18 That's why I need to become dead, so that I can become a famous dead poet and essayist, 'cuz I can't countenance charging anything for 'em. 16 And I certainly gave em to Dennis free. 8, 17 But, in case anybody ever asks, you're the first person that's ever asked, but in case anybody ever asks about a year ago I put em on SmashWords. 13, 14, 17 AS: So, thank you. 11 CG: Thank you for putting up with me.  AS: This was really lovely, oh no CG: Clinton and I both have the problem of typically after about 45 minutes in any meeting we're in, someone will say, ""Okay! 12, 14, 15, 18 Bring it in for a landing Gardner.  Bring it in for a landing Clinton!""  So, you can tell Clinton I warned you.  AS: Well, thank you very much, it was really... 11, 18 CG: I'm a storyteller. 15 AS: It was really delightful to meeting you CG: I'm a storyteller, and I was one before I came here, but I have people like Poozy Haggs [confirm spelling of name] who really helped me to become a more effective storyteller here. 9, 15, 18 And so, I will always be a story teller, probably long after I'm retired, and his is an opportunity I couldn't pass up so, I snuck in all kind of stories. 5, 9, 15, 17, 18, 19 AS: No, those were beautiful.  SP: Can I ask you a question?  So what about Hep C up here now? 12 Like, what are the rates like?  I remember like...  CG: Clinton will have some pretty good ideas about the rates. 10, 18 The IHS Clinic of course is reticent to just hand us information like that, but they do keep records, and Clinton is working with their new public health doctor. 12, 14, 16, 19 They hired a new public health doctor, that's a physician with a masters in public health. 5, 12, 14, 16, 19 Who has interest in things like PREP for people at risk of HIV and Hepatitis C treatment. 9, 12, 13 You know Clinton in harm reduction has developed a consulting relationship with, I think a Twin cities hepatologist, who is providing low cost Hepatits C care here. 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 19 So i'm pretty sure Clinton can tell you stats. 10 But I don't know if he has full access to all the IHS statistics. 9, 12, 14 He might though...

"10","Eden_Frank_Rae","Chuck Hilger Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 19, 2017 New Brighton, Minnesota Chuck Hilger-CH Amy Sullivan-AS AS: I’m trying to get a whole picture of the people I’m interviewing. 9, 12 Their life story, how they got into the work or situation they are in, and a past, present, and future. 5, 10, 15 The other thing I will say is that I realized on the drive over here, I’ve known this for quite a while, you are the person who got me thinking about doing this, so thank you. 5, 11, 12 It piqued my interest as an oral historian.  You told me one time, we were having lunch a few years ago, I don’t even think my daughter was in recovery, and you said, If people don’t get on the bandwagon, if people don’t get on the ride with the changes in MAT [medically assisted treatment] and opioids, evidence based treatment, they are just going to be lost in the dust. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 As a historian that really intrigued me. 18 It was really great this past semester to read all the stuff that I was able to finally read; many of the things you and I had already talked about. 18, 20 So, anyways, I just wanted to thank you. 11, 17, 18 Also, I wanted to thank you for the Minnesota Alternatives [Spring Lake Park, Minnesota] connection. 11, 14, 18 They’re awesome.  It feels good to me to have such a good organization being the fiscal agent. 10 CH: Thank you.  AS: We are at Meridian Hills Treatment Center in New Brighton, Minnesota. 12 Can you state your name and tell me you give me permission for this interview?  CH: My name is Chuck Hilger and I give you permission to record this.  AS: I know some of your stories, and sometimes I might ask you things that I already know, but we are just trying to get it on tape. 9, 12 Can you tell your story a little bit? 15, 20 Where you grew up? 20 What your childhood was like? 14, 20 Your family life, any experiences with substances, any struggles? 6, 10, 12, 18 Then we will move into your career and life. 10, 15, 19 CH: My youth was pretty uneventful. 10 I grew up in a middle class neighborhood with an intact home and family. 7, 12, 20 CH: St. Paul, Minnesota in an area called Frogtown, or as I like to say, in the shadow of the capitol. 8 It is a few blocks from the capitol.  Frogtown is a really diverse area; it’s got a long history of being diverse. 8, 15, 17, 18 We are on the very east end of that, almost to Rice Street.  If you head down Rice Street to the north you will get solely Italian, Germanic, Irish; all Caucasian neighborhood. 14, 20 I grew up at the intersection of those two places. 20 I was raised Roman Catholic. 14 I went to an inner city, private Catholic school. 7 I mean the four hundred dollars a year private school just so we are clear on that. 7, 14 [laughs] 15 I almost didn’t say private because it usually connotes something else.  My eighth grade graduating class there was eight of us in the grade. 5, 7 Well, there were thirteen: eight boys and five girls. 7, 11 We were together for most of those seven years. 8, 14 Being in the inner city you wouldn’t think it would be such a small school. 7 It wasn’t because it was exclusive either.  Stereotypical blue-collar neighborhood. 20 Nothing too remarkable growing up. 5, 10 There is a piece of it in the culture and the time of it all that everything revolved around sports.  I was never gifted in those areas. 8, 16, 20 I have a lazy eye so my depth perception is off so I couldn’t play sports.  AS: What year were you born? 14 I’m fifty-two years old. 14 I really stayed in the neighborhood until eighth grade. 5, 18, 20 After eighth grade I met some people outside of the neighborhood and really expanded my horizons. 5, 9, 18, 20 It is really bizarre in a place where your worldview of yourself is based on your community. 13, 14, 18, 19 Then I went to a place where I was hanging out with the coolest guy in the school: my sister’s boyfriend. 7, 17, 20 It was kind of culture shock. 14 High school was relatively boring. 7 I started working when I was fourteen or fifteen doing furniture refinishing for a guy across the street.  AS: Did you go to Catholic high school? 7 I went to St. Bernard’s high school from ‘79 to ‘83. 7 I graduated in ‘83. 7 I didn’t put a whole lot of effort into school. 7 It was Catholic school, but I wasn’t really academically focused. 6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20 I had other external interests.  I did get into a lot of trouble.  I have narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder. 13, 16 Falling asleep is really easy for me. 16, 18 I didn’t know this until I was in my early twenties. 12 I used to get things on my report cards like ‘diligent’ and ‘conscientious’ student ‘when awake.’ 6, 13, 16 [laughs] 15 I had problems in high school because people thought I didn’t care. 7, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 It was more that I just couldn’t stay awake.  Narcolepsy is like in any situation where it is easy for a person to fall asleep it is just ten times easier for me. 16 Excessive daytime sleeping -- so, classrooms; especially if it’s not a topic you’re interested in at that stage in your life. 7, 10, 14, 16 I had a lot of problems staying awake. 7, 12 That really colors a person’s world because of the way people think about you. 9, 18 AS: Did we know much about narcolepsy at that time? 12 We studied it in psychology.  You know those clips they have of the dogs that run around and then fall over? 8, 12 But I slept through that chapter.  [laughs] 15 We did study it in high school. 7 AS: But you didn’t know you had it? 12 CH: Yeah, it just never occurred to me. 5, 16 I was always pretty outgoing, ambitious; I was a risk taker, but nothing extreme. 10, 18, 20 I decided I wanted to go into law enforcement. 8, 12, 13, 14, 18 When I was in high school it seemed like a logical thing to do. 6, 7 Not being one of the ‘in’ kids in the original neighborhood. 20 I took a lot of -- I hesitate to call it abuse, but there was a lot of bullying. 6, 13 That stays with a person.  I think that was probably a big driver between choosing that profession. 5 I went into the military police corps army. 8 I joined my senior year. 14 A couple of weeks after I graduated I went off to basic training. 7, 11, 15 AS: In the Army?  CH: Yes.  In the Army National Guard.  I went straight to the National Guard because I thought I’d go straight back to school. 7, 17, 18 I had two years of schooling and then went into the law enforcement. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 There are some things that happened along the way. 15, 18 First, when I was a senior in high school my high school sweetheart got pregnant. 7, 9, 10 She went home to Washington state to live.  That was always weighing heavy on my mind. 6, 18 My daughter was born February 1, 1983 so that was before I graduated. 7, 14 I went off to basic training.  With regard to alcohol or drug use by the time I was a junior I was smoking cigarettes frequently. 5, 6, 13, 14 The neighborhood bar we could go into and shoot pool, so probably by sixteen -- rarely, never a problem with my parents, never a problem with my school, but around sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. 7, 12, 16, 20 Nineteen was the drinking age in the state at the time. 5, 11 The bartenders knew we were underage but as long as you were behaving yourself and at least someone’s parents were in the bar you’re okay. 16, 17, 20 I still would hang around with that really cool kid, he’s now my brother-in-law. 12, 13, 17, 18, 20 AS: He’s now your brother-in-law? 12, 13, 20 CH: Yeah, right. 12 My sister’s only boyfriend. 7, 20 They have been together for like fifty years now or something I think. 8, 12, 14 [laughs] 15 There was really no alcohol or drug abuse. 5, 6, 13, 18 There was the occasional binge -- mom and dad were out of town or something. 14 I experimented with marijuana. 12 I was never a fan; I never liked the way it made me feel. 16, 18 It didn’t work for me, so to speak.  I definitely did like alcohol. 6, 9 I went out to basic training, was at basic training for two years, came back home, and moved to Washington state for a couple of weeks to meet my daughter and see if perhaps I was going to be a resident of Washington state, but that didn’t work out so well. 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 18 I came back home.  I never thought I was smart enough to go to college. 7, 16, 17, 18 When you grow up in that blue-collar environment where your parents didn’t go to college. 7, 10, 12, 20 I’m one of thirty-five cousins, and I’m one of the younger ones, there are five that are younger than me, but they are all union drivers, union machinists; they are all blue-collar jobs. 5, 8, 11, 20 Everyone in my family was, and they all live in the metro [metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul]. 8, 12 My extended family isn’t spread out. 10, 12 Our family vacations meant going up to a resort with our aunts and uncles for a week or two in the summer, which was magical. 7, 12, 15 Believe it or not, it was.  It was a great experience. 18, 20 Ironically these are still the resorts that we have a travel trailer at.  They didn’t have travel trailers back then.  We have a summer place up there so that is where we spend our weekends during the summer. 7, 10, 15 When I talk to my boys, who at this point are twenty-eight and twenty-nine, my son and my step-son, those are their best memories of growing up. 7, 10, 11 Up with the trailer at the lake and playing board games. 5 We never loved Nintendo or any of that stuff. 14, 16 No electronics.  Just family time. 12 AS: How many siblings do you have?  CH: I have one sister. 20 AS: What did your parents do? 20 My father worked for the post office and was a mail handler. 16 He did that for thirty-five years. 14 He did insurance for a year or two, but that wasn’t really his thing. 14, 18 He is really one of those -- going to work is really a function for earning an income for stability. 9, 18 He always paid the bills on time, he never extended into debt. 16, 18 He squeaks when he walks is all I’ll say. 16 To this day! 16 [laughs] 15 True story: we talked him into buying a new travel trailer two years ago and he said, I’m only going to do this if I can use my bonds. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 His savings bonds.  Because he had been collecting them from 1975.  They had fully matured fifteen years ago, they weren’t even gaining anything, but he’s still got them. 5, 13, 14 Heaven forbid he ever cashed something in.  Then I said that he could have bought some pretty nice travel trailers with that. 10, 18 I’ve been helping him through some of that process. 17 Mom did factory jobs and then for the last fifteen years she works in the kitchen at Hamline [University, St. Paul, Minnesota]. 9, 11, 14 My mom grew up on the west end of St. Paul over on Seventh Street. 14, 20 Her family had a fair amount of substance abuse; alcohol issues. 6, 9, 12, 13 Solid, Irish family: Madigans. 12 Second cousins to the mayor Chris Coleman in the city of St. Paul. 5, 14 My father, the reason for his need or desire for stability was that he moved a lot. 7, 15, 16 Every year it was a different school, that sort of thing. 7, 14 My mom was from a family from five or six and my dad was from a family of five. 12, 14 AS: So they created some real stability that they didn’t have.  CH: Absolutely.  Don’t get me wrong they went out and had their fun. 11 They bowled a lot.  I know this probably comes as a surprise that they are bowlers. 12 [laughs] 15 Not until three years ago were they bowlers. 13, 14 Age has finally taken its toll.  You could write a sitcom and it would be really boring. 18 Very standard.  Not punitive, just very structured. 5, 15, 19 Monday night was Swanson chicken, Tuesday night was whatever. 16 Dad worked second shifts so I didn’t really develop a relationship with him, but my grandparents were in the duplex downstairs. 8, 18, 19, 20 My grandfather and my grandmother and I were pretty close on my dad’s side. 5, 9, 10, 14, 16 My dad bought the house with the grandparents living downstairs in order to provide stability for them. 6, 13, 14, 20 My grandfather was a truck driver and a cab driver and whatever driver and whatever he needed to do. 5, 16 AS: You went back -- CH:  I went into the guard, and I came back and started school for law enforcement and started having trouble with the narcolepsy working in a security job position. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 That’s what guys trained in the military tactics police do. 8 It is easy to get jobs. 11 My narcolepsy started flaring up when I was nineteen or twenty.  I got my first DWI [driving while intoxicated]. 5, 14 I fell asleep while driving a vehicle. 5, 14, 16 It was on Highway 12 up by Highway 100; there’s a really steep drop off. 5, 11, 18 Now there’s a big wall.  Actually, they dug it all out.  Anyway, I got in a car accident. 13, 18 I had literally fallen asleep behind the wheel. 16 I did blow a point one three -- point zero eight is the legal limit. 10 So, knowing what I know now, point one three is not really anything, but I seemed to be fairly sensitive to alcohol. 6, 9, 12, 18 I told them I had fallen asleep behind the wheel and that is actually what got me to go in and do a test for the narcolepsy. 7, 16 I was going to use it as a defense. 6, 13 [laughs] 15 It doesn’t change the fact that you are a point one three, but when you’re nineteen you do what you do.  That’s how I found out I had the narcolepsy.  They started treating it then with a stimulant, which was not an issue for me except I like to drink and I couldn’t mix them. 5, 13 I quit taking the stimulants and just dealt with it. 11 It was much easier just to deal with it then than it is now just because of my age and vitality, I think. 12 I have always been a driven individual. 5, 18 I’m always looking for things that are new and interesting. 16, 17, 18 In high school I did the McDonald’s and Burger King thing. 7 I refinished furniture and continued to refinish furniture for years. 14 I did the security thing, got the DWI and lost my license and that doesn’t go too well. 11, 13 I thought I would try my hand at sales. 17, 18 I became a vacuum salesman.  That was my first sales job. 11, 14 My second sales job was raising funds for what is called United Arts Council, which is now the Ramsey County Arts Fund, I believe. 11, 12 This is back when they were trying to buy the land for the Ordway theatre -- don’t look back at when that was built! 18 I had a knack on the phone for doing that. 8, 16 I didn’t even know it at the time. 12 I thought I was just doing the same as everyone else. 17, 18 It wasn’t something that was really satisfying, if you will. 18 But, I was successful at it and I stayed at it for like a year. 14 I got involved with some guys that were running a multi-level marketing business with a carpet cleaning business on the side. 5, 8, 9 It was called Music Biz.  We grew that into a two thousand person international down line -- when you buy a record and your friend buys a record and you get the idea of the whole multilevel thing. 9, 20 It got so popular that we were on KDWB [Minnesota radio station] back in the day. 16 The state attorney general came in and investigated us because we had so much publicity and so much going on. 19 AS: What was that called again?  CH: The name of the thing was Music Biz -- that’s what we called it.  We had a jingle written and everything.  I would sing it, but I sing really poorly. 18 I don’t know why it is still in my head! 12, 14 For them I did a lot of the maintaining of the databases, which was quite arduous back then. 11, 13 I think we are talking ‘84, ‘85.  The other thing was to maintain the mailing list and send out all the fliers, reminders, and checks to the people that were earning all their downloading income. 9 That went really well until we decided that the two thousand person download was so successful that we should just move to another product and just pick up the pyramid and move it to another product as is, then we would be fine. 11, 14, 15, 18 That bit of diversification was like trying to move a sandcastle. 15, 20 It just doesn’t work.  It collapsed and we had gotten so big that I had hired a mailing company to do the mailing lists for us. 5, 14 I started doing that.  Before that I did do a year or two of factory work. 14 I knew working in the factory I would find myself being very angry for no reason at all. 11, 16 It just wasn’t suited for me, which is really hard for a person who comes from a family where that’s what everybody does. 9, 12, 18 What is your problem? 12 Why would you screw up this job? 11 I worked at an envelope manufacturer.  I worked in shipping and receiving and did that for a year and a half. 14 I branched off of that job into this entrepreneurial piece. 10, 11 My drinking, once I hit the drinking age of nineteen, definitely escalated. 5, 9, 11 A lot of it was culturally informed.  I enjoyed going out to the clubs and dancing and all that fun stuff, but I definitely consumed more on a regular basis than would be healthy. 9, 14, 19 Binge drinking, of course, is if it is any more than five as it is defined now. 5, 11, 12 I managed to pick up a second DWI about that same time.  I got pulled over for going from a friend’s house to a bar. 6, 11, 13, 20 I got pulled over and was point one zero and they gave me a DWI for that. 11 I was even where I was going.  I was like, Look, there are my friends in the window! 16, 20 They were like, Wave goodbye because you’re going the other direction. 10, 18 Part of that had to do with the fact that I had a lot of driving after suspensions. 5, 14 When you have narcolepsy it is considered a seizure disorder. 5, 9, 13 You have to go see a neurologist, I think at that point it was once a year. 6, 14 He would have to sign off saying I hadn’t had any episodes and that it was okay for me to drive. 5, 11 I wasn’t taking my medication so I wasn’t being prescribed; I wasn’t going to the doctor and all of that. 10, 11, 12, 14 They wouldn’t get the letter, they’d suspend my license, I’d get pulled over, I’d get a ticket, I’d get a warning, I would have a fine to pay, I wouldn’t pay the fine, it would get revoked, so forth and so on. 11, 13 I think that background, too, led to the fact that they would say, This guy has got multiple violations, previous DWI two years ago. 10, 13, 14, 17 We should probably do something about this.  I want to be fair to those making that judgment call. 9, 10, 12 Of course at this point I was like, I was so innocent!  [laughs] 15 They pulled me over because I rolled a stop sign at faster than pedestrian walking speed -- that’s what it says on the ticket. 11, 16 California stop is what they call it.  It was on a side street. 9 Alcohol for me can be a real -- I tend to think big picture and over the top anyway, so when you add alcohol the first thing to go is judgment. 6, 12, 14, 18 That’s one step closer to making bad decisions. 9, 10, 14 Alcohol consumption for me is something that has to be closely monitored. 5, 9, 10 At this point I wasn’t really concerned or thinking about it. 18 I met my first wife when I was working at the factory. 14, 20 I did a lot of dating and a lot of going out.  I was the guy that had the constant nine-month relationship. 16, 19 Sometimes I hadn’t even ended the first one before I started the second one. 8, 14 That wasn’t a rule depending on how things went. 13 During that whole time I really didn’t have any idea that I might be smart. 18 All I have sorting the world externally, what I did, I had an external viewpoint at this point.  I did okay in the military, although I had trouble staying awake in those classes too. 7 I graduated high school with a two point something. 7 I wasn’t the guy that the guidance counselor was like, We’ve got to get you to take the SATs [scholastic assessment test] because you’ve got a big future. 12, 13 I had a low self-esteem. 10 I think I wanted to prove something. 18 I was always looking outside of myself. 18 People that appear to be happy and have it together, who have an external orientation, this is what they do and how they have it. 8, 18 We don’t get to understand the complexity of their world view, but this is how they have it. 13, 14, 17, 18 At twenty-one -- and this is coming up on the yuppie time, the eighties. 8 That’s really an important factor because I thought I had something to prove and was always doing work. 9, 17, 18 AS: But, you didn’t feel like you were smart?  That’s why I didn’t go to college. 7 I figured I would figure something out one way or another. 5, 18 AS: But, you knew you could figure it out. 16 CH: I was a creative problem solver. 12 That was always a skill, but not a recognized skill necessarily. 17, 18 You can’t really put that on an application. 18 It’s great, because you always seem to stay out of trouble just at the last minute, escape harm’s way at the last minute. 6, 15, 18, 20 You are just one step ahead of the next situation. 14 Always drawn to the exciting fast lane. 5, 18 I was in my early twenties.  I was generally really stable. 12, 18 My parents owned the duplex and my grandparents had moved out. 7, 15, 20 When I was a sophomore and junior in high school working at McDonald’s I met a guy a couple of years older than me who had moved here from Flint, Michigan to live with his older brother and have better options here in Minnesota. 7, 11, 14, 15, 20 We became friends and we are still close today. 9, 10, 16, 20 We lived downstairs in my parents’ duplex. 7, 20 This is the kind of guy that you live with for five years and you never have a fight. 14, 16 It’s just like that.  Maybe over who ate the last piece of pizza, but that’s about it.  Reasonably stable. 12 I did the factory job, met my future wife, doing these entrepreneurial jobs which doesn’t do much for the cash flow. 10, 11, 20 Keeping things going whichever way I could. 18 In ‘85, ‘86 the small business I was involved with closed down. 5, 9, 10, 14 The guy that had been doing our mailings offered me a job selling mailing services. 5, 11, 19, 20 Labeling mailing services and stuff like that. 19 I thought, Okay, why not. 17, 18 It was a straight commissioned job, of course, and I took that and grew that over the next four years pretty successfully into specialty services. 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20 We had a niche there.  This was before inkjet printers, so we would do what looked like a typed envelope, but we had a machine process for getting it done. 17 It was a very expensive thing to have done, but we would have like two million piece mailings from American Express. 10 I got in with some other companies like I.C. Systems, which also does mail. 10 I went out to San Francisco and landed a big American Express account. 10 I’m like twenty-four and this is the only time I’ve been on a plane is to go to basic training and back.  This is a guy who thinks he’s not very smart; I knew I was street savvy and can get by and figure things out. 16, 17 I did that until that person doing that business wasn’t paying taxes. 14 I got a letter in the mail at the office that he owed payroll taxes.  I took that product line I had developed and I moved it to a large agency in downtown Minneapolis. 6, 7, 9, 14, 15 I sold them on the idea of it and sold it to a couple of employees and went and did that. 11, 14 They washed me out pretty quick. 10 I learned the difference between a small family owned business that was just getting off the ground to working in the corporate environment where you actually have to produce and so forth and so on. 7, 10, 12, 14 Some of the accounts and the markets were just at that next level where you were working with those ad agencies and big players. 5 While I had done well working in the direct marketing group in the Twin Cities -- I had a lot of connections and knew a lot of people -- it wasn’t amounting to enough work so after nine months they let me go. 5, 9, 11, 16, 18 At that point, it was ‘89 and my future wife and I had a child in ‘88, my son Steven. 14, 20 He was a year and a half old. 14 My wife still worked in the envelope factory. 20 I got this really good job and they gave me a really big signing bonus and nine months later it was all gone. 8, 10, 11, 16, 18 We went out and had bought a house. 6, 13 There was a lot of stress at that point. 7 I had also got a job at the post office at the bulk mail center and I was doing ten-key and I’m not a ten-key person. 11, 15 I only did that for a short time but I knew that wasn’t going to work. 16, 18 A lot of mild chaos. 14 Occasional drug use. 5, 6, 13 I had tried cocaine at that point a couple of times. 11, 14, 16 Nothing that had amounted to anything.  I didn’t even get it, so to speak.  Alcohol was still an issue from time to time. 13 Binge drinking again, not black out drinking or anything. 5, 11 Still struggling with the driving issues because I am supposed to be going to the doctor’s and I’m not. 5, 12, 13, 14 AS: This is almost ten years later! 14 When I lost the job at the downtown Minneapolis firm I opened up my own practice because I thought that would be a good idea. 10, 11, 17, 18 I opened up this small, broker advertising letter shop. 8, 15 I didn’t actually do the work, but I brokered all the services. 5, 7, 8, 19 I had brokered so many services for so many years and putting all these packages together that I knew most of the printers in town, I knew all the mail shops, I had all the connections. 5, 8, 14, 15, 16, 19 It was just a matter of landing the accounts.  Quite frankly it went really well for the first year. 14, 18 I made one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand dollars worth of business.  Thirty percent of that was what I got to take home and that was more than enough.  Ultimately, I kept growing the accounts I was making over about a year and a half to two year period. 10, 14, 18 We are now at 1989, 1991. 12 The Gulf War has broken out, the economy is taking a dump, and things aren’t necessarily going to great. 8, 11, 20 I land a big account out of Mason City, Iowa to do Who’s Who mailings.  If you send fifty bucks you can be in the book.  Those mailings typically go out typically in one hundred thousand pieces and they want a high end product, which is what I specialized in. 7, 14, 18 The nice thing about doing a high end product is that you always have a market. 5, 7, 14, 18 I did that mailing and got it out.  Ultimately, they didn’t pay.  My normal vendors who had done the job were like, We can’t keep doing your bread and butter jobs. 11, 16 Now we’ve got this big one hanging out there and it’s all this money. 8, 10 They put their attorney’s on the company. 14 We all worked it out, but ultimately it was the end of that business.  That was hard. 9 There were a lot of technology changes; email is coming along, the Internet was just hitting the market. 5, 6, 17 There were a lot of changes there. 6 As my business declined my drinking really took off. 5, 9, 11, 14, 18 As did spending money on things like pull tabs or gambling. 8, 10 That impulsive kind of stuff took over.  I had bought a townhome with my wife as the business had taken off. 20 I was always doing things slightly on the sly. 18 I was contracting -- it was assumable. 19 I think I made one payment for the year and a half that I was in the house. 6, 12, 13, 14 It took them like a year to get you out. 14 I think 1991 I still had a job with the post office and started carrying mail for the post office as a letter carrier. 11, 14 I was backing out the garage and I slid into a parked car. 14 I actually had my license for a few years at that point. 7, 13, 14 It was an icy slope and I hit a car so I lost my job. 11 I had some friends who were hanging cable up in Brainerd so I went to Brainerd and was installing cable systems. 16, 20 Apparently I was a cable specialist now. 12, 20 Climbing up ladders.  I was up in Brainerd on February fourteenth, my ex-wife has a flair for the -- that was when she moved out of the house with the kids. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 We had a son together and she had had two boys. 7, 8, 11 For the last six years we had been together so I had been raising them. 8, 14 One was six months old when we got together. 8, 11, 16 The other one was three. 8 They were eight, six, and our son was in preschool. 7, 10 That gives you an idea.  That was a huge turning point for me because that was such a loss. 20 That external focus, you know, if you have a nice house, two-car garage, then you are doing okay because that’s how it would appear. 6, 12, 13, 18 I really struggled to have all that stuff and it all collapsed. 18 The drinking took off. 5, 11 AS: Had you been struggling in your marriage? 14 Did that come to a surprise for you?  CH: I really think it was that this is the pattern that people follow. 9, 10, 18 Not that I did any of it in the right order. 12 You don’t have a baby, then graduate high school, then go into the service, then have another baby, then buy the house, then get married. 6, 7, 13, 19 All this time the relationship with my daughter is they come out or I go out once a year, send birthday cards, and that was about it. 14, 16, 19 She had a great stepdad that she called dad; I was more of the stepdad. 14, 20 We kept the connection but it wasn’t really deep. 18 Her stepdad was great. 14, 20 I lost the two boys I had been raising, I lost the house, and still we didn’t get divorced. 6, 7, 11, 13 We struggled.  She was very conservative about how she went about things.  I was much more like, We will figure it out, it will work out.  Her belief was that as I excelled or did well or did less well in business -- she was still working at the factory -- she was being left behind. 14 Marketing and advertising is all this stuff, even back then: five hundred dollar suits, thousand dollar briefcases. 17, 19 That was just a big issue for us. 13 She had met a guy at work that was the picture of stability.  He was a single guy, farmer family, Somerset, Wisconsin. 8, 12 Just the epitome of stability and whatever.  For her it was the right move at that time. 12, 15 After that, I think it took me two weeks to get my third DWI. 15 I’m trying to think of what year it was. 14 It was three DWIs in ten years. 14 I blew a point one three again.  I got pulled over because I was doing fifty-five and I passed a state trooper at one thirty in the morning. 11 He said, You should know that if you are ever on the freeway at one thirty in the morning you should never pass a state trooper. 12, 16, 18 I said, I was doing fifty-five.  He said, I know, I was doing fifty and you passed me. 12 Did you hear me? 9 You should never pass a state trooper at one thirty. 16 [laughs] 15 I didn’t do anything wrong, I just got pulled over. 11 The post office called back and said, You’re right. 12 We made a mistake.  Here’s a bunch of back pay for the year. 14 I had gone to the union and said it was an accident because it was on the ice. 13 It was their truck, in their driveway, in their parking lot. 5, 18 Anyway, now I don’t have a license. 12, 13, 18 You can’t be a mail carrier without a license. 13 Anyway, somebody had introduced me to cocaine in the crack form, which I had never tried before. 14, 16, 18 I was off to the races.  That put me in all kinds of circles.  From the time I was twenty-eight until I was thirty-one it was just one big go.  Having grown up and living where I grew up at the crosshairs of Rice Street and Frogtown I had plenty of gang affiliated members that I could be around by going to certain places. 9, 10, 14, 17, 20 Then I had all my friends on Rice Street who didn’t have access to crack at that point, which was largely an African American gang thing. 9, 16, 20 For the next year and a half it was pretty interesting. 10, 14, 17 Parents of the kids who were in the gangs -- the gangs who were burning down those houses and killing families; I never really thought twice about it. 6, 9, 13, 16, 17, 18 I didn’t get excited about being caught up in the mix because for some reason it doesn’t really faze me much. 14, 18 I had an acquaintance in the escort service so I drove escorts around. 5, 19 I would drive them to their appointment and wait in the car. 5, 12 A whole nefarious group of people. 9 AS: Are you saying these are things that you wouldn’t normally do, but since you were using you were doing? 6, 16 CH: I would do those things to be able to continue to use. 6, 13 I didn’t have any regular income.  I was refinishing furniture again.  I would work for three days, make three or four hundred dollars, then go and light crack. 16 Then use and sell, use and sell, use and sell for three or four days. 6, 13, 16 Then go work for three days. 16 I probably kept that pattern up for quite some time.  AS: Did your parents ever know? 12, 20 My parents never knew. 16, 20 My best friend, he was the best man at my wedding, never knew. 16, 20 I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this. 16 AS: Would you disappear for a few days? 16 CH: There was no disappearing because it was just me.  My children are with my ex-wife; I would have my son every other weekend. 5, 14, 15, 20 I never used when I had my son because he was there. 6, 13, 16 That was the arrangement her and I worked out -- that standard every other weekend. 7, 12, 15 I wasn’t paying child support at that time. 14 I would use several days in a row and it didn’t matter the day of the week. 6, 13, 15, 16 It was a lot of gang activity. 9 You start selling to support your habit and you find yourself in a lot of interesting groups and around a lot of interesting people. 9, 12, 17, 20 I tend to be fairly loud and outgoing, which culturally fits better with more of an aggressive African American male stance, so I never had a problem finding a comfortable spot in that group. 6, 9, 12, 15, 16 I did look a little bit like a cop, so people would sometimes challenge me to smoke their drugs to prove I wasn’t a cop -- which I was completely fine with. 5, 6, 9, 11, 20 Are you convinced yet, because if not I can do some more of it!  There was a point when I was losing my advertising business and I was starting to get into cocaine and my wife had gone. 16, 20 I could get off the plane at five o’clock in my suit, drive home, throw on a pair of jeans and a hoodie, and be down on the block in a completely different lifestyle. 5, 10, 15 I was just really a chameleon. 18 No real sense of identity or way of things that had to be any particular way. 9, 18 AS: What were you going to tell me that you said you have never told? 16 CH: It was my wife who told me that I was smoking crack. 6, 16, 20 AS: What do you mean?  CH: Well, the first time I used was with these friends of mine. 6, 13, 14, 16, 20 They said, Try this!  I knew it was cocaine and I knew we were smoking cocaine, but I didn’t know it was crack. 6, 12, 16 It just really hadn’t hit where crack was -- AS: It was the media. 16, 18 CH: The media to a degree.  It was like, What do you mean painkillers are just like heroin? 6, 16 You know what I mean? 12 It was like, That is cocaine. 16 What’s fascinating is that she is this person that never did any drugs. 5, 6, 16 She liked to drink but she never did any drugs or anything. 5, 6, 16 She is the person that schedules what times the kids get up and what time they put their shoes on and what time they are standing at the door. 14 She’s very organized and structured. 5, 15 The opposite of me, I guess.  She was like, You realize that’s crack? 16 I had heard about crack but I didn’t know what it was. 9, 12, 14, 16 I know that sounds silly. 12, 18 For somebody who’s fairly street smart, who is used to being in the mix -- I’ve got friends who are Hells Outcast on Rice Street. 6, 9, 13, 16, 20 They’ve been long time gang members. 9, 17 Many notorious names and people that I know and still run into from time to time in different places. 8, 9, 12, 16 Then the whole gang thing. 9 I think in the first couple of weeks I told her. 11, 14, 15, 16 She said, What did you spend your money on? 8, 10 Well, somebody gave me this drug. 5, 6 You realize that’s crack? 16 I didn’t, but it’s funny that she enlightened me. 9 I don’t think I’ve ever shared that with anybody. 5 The kind of thing you wouldn’t want to admit.  She was from Blaine.  [laughs] 15 AS: Are we in the eighties or nineties? 12 CH: The business went down in ‘92 so this is starting in late ‘91.  AS: So kind of early in what came to be the so-called crack epidemic? 13, 14, 16 CH: Yeah, yeah.  For Minnesota it certainly was. 8, 17 It was never here like it was -- like we think of the crack epidemic you think of it more in the phase that it was in in Los Angeles. 13, 16 It just never hit that level of height over here. 16 There were a couple of close calls I had with houses where we were moving dope. 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 One of the big gangs in St. Paul, part of the Disciples, had a major connection. 9 Because the kids were in the gangs and this was the stepdad of one of the kids in the gang, we could essentially get access to as much as we wanted. 5, 9, 14, 18 He had the connection so I did more of the driving and the facilitating, so forth and so on. 5, 14 It wasn’t anything that I ever got compensated well for.  They were moving a fair amount of weight and that drew some attention. 5, 9 There were a couple of federal cases. 8, 11, 17 There was actually a book written about it. 7 A house fire on Lawson [Avenue] in St. Paul where five kids died. 6, 13 One was Andre Coppage and his brother Lester. 5, 20 Anyway, there is a whole book written about that group. 18 They waited five or six years to prosecute on that. 14 They gathered them from around the country. 5, 14, 19 There were big articles from around the country about how they brought all these people back from Florida. 9, 19 I think this book is called ‘The Red Light’ [Code of Silence: The Andre Coppage Story by Ann Lee] or something. 5 It has been a while since I read it.  Some really fascinating stuff. 18 That is the level.  You have a lot of low-level gang stuff, but this was where people were killing people and fire bombing houses. 6, 9, 10, 13 The person’s whose car they used was a friend of mine. 6, 13, 16, 20 They traded his car for the night for some crack cocaine. 14, 16 He had lost his car behind that. 11 I was right on the edge of being really deep in. 12, 18 I was at the house on a regular basis. 6, 13 I was never caught up in it like that. 16 I got caught coming out of a house one night after a party. 6, 9, 13, 20 Of course, no driver’s license because we are back to that again. 5, 13 AS: But you are still driving around? 5, 14 CH: Of course.  At what point do you need to stick your driver’s license into the car to make anything run? 5, 8, 13 [laughs] 15 When they solve that problem, then it’s golden. 12 Until then, I’ve got my keys. 15 I came out of a house one night, it was a prostitution house, and we had been partying and the police were in the alley where my car was parked. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 20 I didn’t have anything on me but they put me in the back of the squad.  There are now people standing on the back of this porch because I’m out in the alley in the squad. 9, 12, 14 There was a female officer and a male officer. 8 They asked me all these questions like, Who is inside? 9 You know that is a known prostitution and drug house. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13 No, I met this girl named Tammy at the bar and she said this is where she wanted to go so this is where I brought her. 7, 18 They knew that was my car back there and they said, You’re going to get in your car and go home, right? 12, 16 I said, Yeah, absolutely.  They let me out of the car and the woman cop gets out -- she was in the passenger seat -- and lets me out.  I wasn’t cuffed.  She goes, God, Chuck.  Good to see you again! 6 Thanks for all the information.  [laughs] 15 Just to mess with me.  She must have really bought that I wasn’t from the area. 8, 18 AS: To throw you under the bus in front of everybody.  CH: It didn’t get me in any trouble because the people over there knew me. 9, 16 This is just a really interesting time with interesting people. 9, 17, 18 A lot of pain and a lot of suffering. 6 I have seen a lot of really ugly things. 6, 18 I never got really caught up in the criminality of it, thank God. 8, 11, 16, 18 Excuse me, other than selling drugs. 5, 6, 13 That continued for some time.  I was still going to the bar and drinking regularly. 5, 11 I had a steady girlfriend and we were out one night and we were pulled over because we were waiting for someone to run in and pick up some drugs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 20 A squad had seen me and run my plates and pulled up on me. 6, 8, 11 I’m driving after license cancellation -- three DWIs -- inimical to public safety [DAC-IPS]. 5, 13, 14, 19 A cancelled IPS is what they refer to that as.  There is no way out of this. 18 I’m going to the ADC -- adult detention center.  At that point in my life I wasn’t good at being alone or standing still for any amount of time -- let alone in a six by six foot room having no control. 8, 10, 14, 18 I called a buddy of mine who agreed to bail me out.  He was the one I had been working on the furniture with since I was fourteen and now I’m thirty-one years old. 8, 12, 14 He came and bailed me out.  It was six thousand dollars.  The bond was six hundred bucks so he paid that.  This is a guy who still goes to Latin mass.  [laughs] 15 Do you know what I mean? 12 He won’t wear shorts because if some woman were to have sexual thoughts about him he would be responsible. 12, 16, 17, 18 This is my world.  This is old school. 7 CH: This is old school. 7 Anyways, he was the guy you could never do wrong by. 11, 16, 18 There was one other time when they had brought me in on a driving after cancellation -- they got me one other time -- I was down in Ramsey County ADC and they said, All the guys going to Hennepin County stand on the left side of the room, which was where I was supposed to go. 5, 9, 14 For the guys they were going to let go stand on the right side of the room. 9, 12, 14 I stood on the right hand side, they handed me my shoelaces on the way out the door and I was gone. 8, 9, 11, 12, 18 They weren’t going to let me go this second time -- they were onto me.  I couldn’t have my friend give me the six grand. 20 I just could never do that. 16 I went to court.  I had three DWIs in ten years, I’ve got all kinds of driving violations, and I have no license. 5, 13, 14 The judge told me I was going to do thirty days. 16 He said, If you ever want your license back you need to go to treatment. 12, 13 If you don’t complete treatment you can’t get your license back. 12, 13 I won’t go into detail but there are a number of other business things that I had done.  I was trying to work my way back into sales. 18 I took a job selling satellite dishes for a year and a half down in Winona. 11, 14 Driving back and forth.  I had done a number of things.  I did asbestos removal for a year because that paid pretty well. 10, 14 AS: When you say you have always worked you have always worked. 18 CH: I have always worked. 18 I have never collected a day of unemployment in my life. 10, 12, 16 I have always had at least one job and sometimes two. 11, 18 There were just a variety of other experiences thrown in there while I was trying to get out of that drug lifestyle. 5, 6, 10, 15, 18 I knew it wasn’t going anywhere. 8, 16 I knew I wasn’t going to make a living out of furniture refinishing. 16 It was the base.  Then I would try to do this and that.  The judge told me I needed to go to treatment if I wanted to get my license back ever. 12, 13, 16, 18 That is what got me in.  December 1994.  One of the most devastating things I remember was Christmas of 1994  I had spent all of the money that I saved up for Christmas presents on drugs. 5, 6, 8, 10 I managed to gather up some more to buy Christmas presents again, but just that hopeless feeling. 5, 9, 10, 15 December of ‘94 I was about done. 8 My court date was in January of ‘95, so I went into court and the judge said do this alcohol drug assessment. 5, 6, 12, 13 My previous 10 DWIs they had told me I had to go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meetings. 16, 18 I had to do two days in Lino Lakes doing their education program. 14, 15, 16 It’s not like I hadn’t had plenty of consequences. 6 I went in this side room with this young lady that was the assessor and she asked me -- I swear to God it wasn’t more than six questions. 9, 14 She came back and said that I had alcohol abuse whatever. 6, 13 Of course I didn’t say anything about the cocaine because why would I? 16 The judge said, Yeah, you have to go to treatment. 12, 13 I said, I can’t pay for treatment. 12, 13 He said that there was something called Rule Twenty-five. 14 I said, I’ll do that and he gave me thirty days. 16 I went and did my thirty days. 16 I really like playing darts. 18 I had thirty days but I got out on work release because I told them I was still refinishing furniture. 16 I would hang out at the shop even if there wasn’t work. 15 On dart nights I would still go to the bar and play darts, ankle bracelet and all.  But I wasn’t drinking! 5, 11 In case they came because they could come and test you at any time. 17 I wanted to do my assessment and then go from the end of my thirty days right into treatment. 12, 13, 16, 18 I knew the only way to get into treatment was to get them to know it was bad enough to get a Rule Twenty-five. 12, 13, 16, 18 I went in there and I spilled my guts.  I may have even enhanced a little bit to make sure I would get in. 20 If I came out of the Rule Twenty-five and they said I didn’t need treatment, then what the hell am I going to do? 12, 13 Because I couldn’t get my license back. 13 I went in there and did a Rule Twenty-five.  They gave me fourteen days inpatient treatment and ADEP. 12, 13, 16 AS: What is ADEP?  CH: Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program. 14 It is with the Regions Hospital program.  I went to treatment and I just went to my fourteen days so I could get my license. 12, 13, 16 Thank God this is getting behind me.  Still, being an external sorter, the worst thing you can do is put a person like that in group.  Do you think anybody can keep a secret like that in group?  Right?  CH: An external sorter.  CH: People have internal and external locuses of control. 6, 13, 18 This is something that has been really useful in counseling over the years and working with people. 6, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19 How people view the world is often, especially with people who are involved with addiction, you can have a strong internal focus. 9, 12, 14 You know these people because they already have all the answers. 9, 12 They don’t need you to tell them anything.  CH: People who have an internal sense of self.  They analyze, look at, and make decisions about their life based on their own information and data and process the decision that they have made. 10, 13, 14, 17 External people are like chameleons: 9 they can become whatever they need to become in their environment, they become really good at reading things, thinking they fit in. 10, 12, 15, 18 I’m not saying they don’t stand out.  They are driven by the environment as opposed to individual preferences. 5, 10, 12 Ideally, you want some of both.  There are points where you need to be taking in data from the outside and times from yourself. 9, 11, 13 I just always had a very -- at that point -- external point of reference. 18 I just looked around seeing how other people did it and emulated that. 6, 9 AS: To put you in group, you just mimicked what other people were saying? 9 CH: No, I just shared. 5 When you have an external orientation you don’t have the need to protect or -- you know what I mean? 12 When you are in those settings you just share.  That happened to you? 15 This happened to me, and this happened to me. 15 They are like, See, you’re an alcoholic. 6 You realize that the normal people don’t have to try to quit drinking. 5, 9, 11, 16 I drank the Kool-Aid. 5, 16 Fourteen days after getting out of outpatient treatment I knew I was an alcoholic and an addict. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 I had shared all that stuff about the cocaine and the stuff I had been through. 5, 16 All the crazy stuff. 20 It was fourteen days after I had finished my detox and they called me into the director’s office and he was like, Alright, you are going to be here for fourteen days and this is how it works. 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 You will need to take a look at the books on the shelves; there are four up there for different halfway houses. 6, 9, 13, 14, 18 I said, Sorry, halfway houses? 6, 9, 13, 14, 18 He said, Yeah, the recommendation here from the Rule Twenty-five person is that you do fourteen days inpatient followed by ninety days at a halfway house. 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 At which point I said, John, I can tell you have been doing this a while and I can tell you are good, but if you look around you can tell I have some of the same problems that the people we have in this treatment center are dealing with. 9, 10, 12, 13 I think after I am here for about a week you will see that I don’t have to finish the fourteen days let alone go to the halfway house. 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 At which point he metaphorically pushed my nose into the ground.  He said, It says here if you don’t complete treatment and the halfway house then you don’t get your license back. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 I did my fourteen days and then I was three days in. 16 I got into the program and I wasn’t faking it.  I was like, Wow, I really have this issue. 13, 18 It is kind of like when you read the diagnostic and mental health manual for the first time and you have half of the stuff in there. 12, 14, 19 They give me a choice of these halfway houses. 6, 9, 13, 14, 18 Three of them are in Frogtown and Dayton neighborhood. 20 I was like, I am not going to those!  There were two other choices. 6 It was Cochran and Hastings, River Falls [Wisconsin], which is on the River Falls campus.  They give you a day to go out there and check it out. 16 They interviewed me and he said, Why do you want to come here?  I said, I see you are on a college campus. 6, 7 I’ve never been to college before. 7, 16 I thought maybe while I was here I would take a class. 5, 7, 17, 18 I’m still moving a million miles a minute. 15 Despite that interview they decided to take me. 14 I finished up my fourteen days and I was excited to go to River Falls. 16 It is a really nice place, but it is a forty-minute drive from ADAP to River Falls, which is apparently how long it takes to undo fourteen days of treatment. 5, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 I don’t think it was two hours after I got into the halfway house that I was sitting down with my primary counselor saying, Bob, if you review my records you will understand that I have been pretty successful in my life and I have got some really good things going for me. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 I have a house in St. Paul that I can go back to and live. 6, 13 Of course, the telephone is shut off and I haven’t paid my gas in two months. 8, 11, 16 You’ll see. 6 How long do I really need to be here? 17, 18 He said, Well, Chuck, it says here if you don’t complete ninety days you don’t get your license back! 13, 16 So, yeah, that’s a long ride from one place to another. 17 AS: How did you get the ride?  CH: They would take you.  They transported you. 17 I was their van, which was probably a good thing. 10 Left to my own devices I would have gone for it.  I did the ninety days. 16 They have you do manual labor stuff.  There was nothing wrong with it, but that’s the stuff that really makes me angry and annoyed. 11, 18 Now I am loading trucks again all day long and I have to pay for a ride to work to make like six dollars an hour. 15, 16, 17 All these dichotomies. 14 AS: That is kind of a sort of humiliation.  A lot of grounding.  AS: I’m calling it humiliation and you are calling it a grounding. 16 CH: I don’t think it should be humiliating because there is nothing humiliating about it.  For me it wasn’t so humiliating as it was like back to the roots.  Here is what my family does, throwing sacks. 12 Again, nothing wrong with it, but I always thought there should be more. 11, 17, 18 I was just frustrated.  AS: Okay.  So you didn’t think it was beneath you, necessarily.  I have always been in good physical shape. 6, 10, 18 Well, I was.  I finished my ninety days. 16 One of the most important things that happened to me while I was there was that I started doing more reading about addiction because I wanted to understand it. 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 The differences between my time in sales and my training in counseling -- the skills are really very similar. 10, 18, 19 There isn’t much difference.  I had done all the Anthony Robbins and the Dale Carnegie; I had done all the training for sales.  When you are sitting in group and listening to what people are saying as opposed to applying your own meaning for them I was actually functioning very supportively in group. 7, 9, 19 I finally read  The Road Less Traveled by Scott Peck, which talks about a number of things, but most important for me was a mapping of the world, what this means, what this isn’t. 9, 10 For me, it was a lot of things I had believed to be true, but it didn’t go with the world view I grew up with. 5, 20 It really was a remapping for me. 10, 18 That book launched me into a whole course of action and research and interests.  I finished my ninety days and I returned home. 16 I took a job scraping forums. 11 Like what they pour cement with. 12 They bring them back and they are all dirty you have to scrape it out.  In the yard scraping forums all days. 16 I had to walk right past my old bar that I used to hang out at because I couldn’t drive. 5, 6, 12, 13, 16 Now I am on the honesty program. 8 I am involved in the twelve steps.  I am trying to live a life of rigorous honesty. 8, 10 I don’t have my license; I’m not driving my car. 5, 13, 14 I am halfway out of this program so the promises are going to come true if I just do what I need to do. 5, 14, 18 I am going to meetings and got a job and I’m just getting started again. 11, 18 I started drinking again. 5, 11 I never went back to the crack cocaine because that was a whole lifestyle. 10, 15, 16 It was too far to go.  My parents and in-laws were invited to the halfway house and I did tell them that I was using cocaine and they were pretty surprised. 6, 10, 13, 14, 18, 20 They really don’t know what that means. 12, 18 To them that means, My son was using drugs but he quit. 5, 6 They don’t understand the depth of it and it is hard for me to explain because it is so complex and convoluted. 9, 13, 17, 18 All the craziness, games, and desperation.  I had a gun in my mouth one time.  I wasn’t holding the gun.  I started to drink September 27, 1995. 5 I went back to drinking for two months. 5, 11, 16 I was in the bar and I looked up and they showed a picture of one of my best friends. 16, 20 When I first got into advertising at the company that was doing the envelopes and stuff I had met a guy who had done more than three years in Stillwater prison on three different occasions for stuff. 14, 16 In many ways we were cut from the same cloth but he just got caught and his connections went a little deeper than mine. 18, 20 I am more the guy that brings things together and connects things. 8 He was the fighter.  For many years when we were running together he would keep me out of trouble and I would keep up moving forward. 8, 14 That was my connection.  He did furniture refinishing with me when he needed money. 8, 10 Very close from 1985 until ‘95. 9, 10 I looked up and I saw that he was on the TV and he was being charged with vehicular homicide.  He had borrowed my friend’s motorcycle that owned the refinishing company and at two o’clock in the morning someone had stepped off the curb in front of him and he hit him doing thirty. 14, 20 My friend blew a point one three which is waking up for him. 20 His drinking was way worse than mine. 5, 11, 18 That was the day I decided. 14, 16 To some degree the trouble that he got in I got in, but to a lesser degree.  I thought, This is where this is going. 17, 18 On that day I decided to stop drinking. 5, 11, 14, 16 I have never gone back to cocaine. 16 The one thing that I was supposed to do with the halfway house that I didn’t do was go see a therapist. 6, 13, 14, 18 The next day I set up the appointment and I said, I was supposed to call after I left River Falls and I didn’t. 12, 14, 16 I got set up to see him. 6 I had my job so I just stopped the drinking thing, upped my meetings. 5, 11, 18 At that point I was still going off and on.  I went and saw this therapist in part because of what happened in treatment and the halfway house and my own reading, I went and saw this person and I said, This is my scenario and this is where I’m at. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 He is an exceptional therapist and his approach was very effective.  He asked me, Chuck, how smart are you?  I said, I’m street smart.  I can always figure out a way to get around, I can do what I need to do, I’m good at solving problems, I can do this and that. 10, 12, 18 He said, Let me get this right. 12 You were in the service and you did that successfully. 14, 19 I got out in ‘89.  He said, You were in the service for six years, you were in sales, you were with a small business that you partially owned at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two, then you were building a company, twenty-six, twenty-seven you had your own company, you’ve been through drug treatment, you’ve basically lived on the street, you’ve nearly been homeless, you’ve survived just fine, we are sitting here having this conversation and you’re saying you’re not smart? 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19 [laughs] 15 I said,  Well, that’s street smarts and that’s how you get by.  He made me take an IQ test and it wasn’t off the charts or anything, it wasn’t near genius, but he asked me, Well, how smart are you?  I said, How do you want me to define it? 11 He said, IQ?  I said, I have no idea.  What is average?  He said, One hundred.  I said, I’m one hundred.  I came back after I had taken the IQ test and he said,  What was your score?  I shared it with him and he said, What does that mean? 5 Being an external sorter primarily at that point I said, Basically, it means short of doing rocket science or anything like that I could probably do anything I wanted to. 14, 18 He was like, Yeah, you’re right. 12 His method of therapy was very effective for me. 6, 12 I went once a week for several months before backing off to twice a month and then tapering off. 11, 15, 16 Years later my mom, with all of her family issues growing up, I sent her to him because she has a lot of depression issues and he saw her for like three sessions and he said, She’s good, we don’t need to see her anymore. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14 It was really disappointing for me. 18 [laughs] 15 AS: Those are some pretty good coping skills, apparently! 10, 14, 20 CH: That was years after I had been to therapy but, yeah, that’s great. 12, 14, 20 He said, We’re not going to talk about the twelve steps, that’s not what we’re here for.  He was just very effective at throwing the proverbial bone and then I would go out and look for it for the week and I would come back with the bone and he would take that out of my mouth and throw it again. 8, 15 A lot of what I wanted to believe in my heart of hearts was true, I just had to come to those things myself. 5, 9, 18 I became a much better internal sorter, I became a much better ‘identity.’  AS: Did you go to college then? 7 I was in the halfway house and one of my friends was supposed to help one of these guys move. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 I was on my way to church and this guy pulls over and asks if so-and-so is around and I say, No, he took off for the weekend, and he said, I need someone to move the couch. 15, 18 I said, I’m going to church. 14 He said, Help me move this couch and I’ll drive you to church afterwards and I thought, 5, 15, 17, 18 This sounds scary! 18 This from the guy who used to drive prostitutes! 5, 6, 13, 16 [laughs] 15 I go help him move this couch. 15 He says to me that he had worked with guys from Kinnic Falls before, he had been DVR, Department of Vocational Rehab in Wisconsin and he told me if I wanted to go to school in Minnesota all I needed to do was go down to the Department of Rehabilitative Services and because I was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, besides the fact that I have narcolepsy, they would pay for my schooling if I wanted to go to school for something. 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18 AS: How strange that this guy just shows up and starts telling you all of this. 7, 15, 17 CH: I went and did my fifth step at this small church that I go to.  The fifth step in the twelve steps is where you go and you share your shortcomings and character flaws with another person. 13, 18 You’ve done a searching a fearless moral inventory and now you have to share it. 10, 12 I went to my old church and I was going to ask the priest afterwards if he would do it at some point with me. 14, 20 I thought, I am not doing this. 17, 18 In the church where I was an altar boy for six years. 7, 14 He said in the sermon stuff about Mary Magdalene and the stoning and it is about forgiveness and he was not guilty.  I am really fortunate because next door we have the convent that we sold several years ago for people who are alcohol and drug addicted. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 Part of my job -- I want to get back to the community as I do the fifth steps -- I had not been in that church for five years or more and I don’t think I have been back since. 10, 11, 14, 19 Maybe once or twice.  I went and talked to him and I did the fifth step with him.  I was done and he goes, Alright Chuck, you’re human, thanks for sharing, have a nice day. 11, 12, 16, 18, 19 Which is the definition of how you get rid of shame.  I spent the time with the therapist and it was just really bizarre when you talk about things happening. 15, 18 I also went to DVR and said, Hey, I want to do this.  I did an orientation and he said, What do you want to do?  I have no idea.  He said, What have you done?  I said, How long do you have? 17 [laughs] 15 Security, asbestos removal, cables, sales, advertising, marketing, drug dealing, taxi service. 5, 6, 19 [laughs] 15 They have a series of tests and they do a personality test, an interest inventory, a manual dexterity test, an IQ test, puzzle things. 15 I rocked the puzzle things. 14 The guy was like, That’s one of the fastest I’ve ever seen anyone do that. 6 They send it off, compile the score, and tell you everything. 14 I said, I’ve been making good decisions up until this point -- the twelve steps at this point. 10, 14 I’m letting go; letting God, let’s just see what the plan is. 6 I come in, Jeff Parkin was my counselor, he comes in and I go in and sit down.  He says, Let’s look at your test results. 6 He pulled out the file and said, Well, according to your skills your number one career that you’re best suited for is actor. 10, 11, 15, 19 We won’t pay for that.  Tends not to have such a good success rate. 10 [laughs] 15 That was the first category. 14 That was the number one.  The next category was beauty salon operator, floral designer. 11 I had no idea I was gay! 9 [laughs] 15 Stereotyping; don’t take that personally!  I don’t feel that way, but what I thought at the time was, Great! 17, 18 I’m not a drug addict. 5, 6, 14 I’ve got kids, how am I going to provide for them.  In that same grouping was psychologist, counselor.  AS: Right.  Someone that works with people. 9 CH: Someone that works with people. 9 I thought, I’m already in on this whole drug addict thing. 5, 6, 14, 17, 18 It was believed that most counselors at that point -- historically we know differently -- were people in recovery and that you needed to be in recovery to be effective. 9, 12, 14 The whole idea that one addict helping another addict, which is very effective. 14 I said, I’ll do the chemical dependence counseling thing. 13, 14, 19 At that point it was a two-year program at Inver Hills [Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota]. 14 I went and got signed up at Inver Hills, I took the tests, and I only scored a couple that were over the one hundred -- I had to take a few remedial math class, but other than that everything was over one hundred, which wasn’t bad considering eighteen to thirty-one I hadn’t had an education. 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15 They said to take classes that you like so you can have some time to get used to college. 6, 7, 13, 14, 16 Take a class that you like and that you think you’ll do well at. 7 I took creative problem solving for one and I took a writing one because I have always had a flare and a knack for writing, and then I took a math class that was like introduction to algebra or something. 7, 12, 14, 18 For some reason I don’t have a mind that things algebraically.  I’m not a linear sequential person. 9 I think very geometrically and am more spatial.  Those things just make sense to me.  Algebra just doesn’t work.  My first day of my first class -- I am thirty-one years old -- this is January 3, 1996. 7, 14, 16 I am all of ninety days sober at that point. 16 You think a guy would be comfortable for all the things he has been through.  I was totally insecure.  I’m going to be the old guy in the community college school with the kids who couldn’t get into the good colleges go! 7, 10, 14, 19 That’s not true, but that’s what I’m thinking. 5 I walk into class and there were only a couple of people in there. 7, 9, 11, 16 There were two that looked like they were nineteen or twenty, and there was a woman who looked to be about my age so I went and sat by her.  I did and that was my introduction to college. 7, 14 The college went really well. 7, 18 The woman that I sat next to is now my wife. 12, 20 AS: Honestly? 8 Oh my gosh.  I had a feeling you were going to say that. 15 CH: It was the creative problem solving class and it worked really well for me. 7, 12, 18 I took it because it was fun, it would be interesting, and I had a knack for it. 17 My now wife took it because it fulfilled criteria in two core areas and therefore it would mean she would have to take one less class. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 20 That is about all you need to know about her and I to understand the nature of our relationship. 12, 17, 18, 19 She was actually going into marketing and advertising. 5, 7 I obviously had just come out of that among other things.  She liked the books from the classes I was taking. 7, 11 She never considered social work. 5, 9, 16, 19 I was going to school and decided I was going to -- because I have to have a plan -- I was going to get a two year degree, become a chemical dependency counselor while I finish my four year degree with a bachelors in social work. 7, 13, 14, 19 Did my master’s in social work so I could be an LICSW [licensed individual clinical social worker]. 13, 19 I had this eight-year plan lined up. 9, 14 She liked my classes so much and had never considered being a social worker that she flipped her classes. 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 19 She was going to school because she had been laid off and had a package from her employer to go to school. 7 She is an LICSW now, which I never got because I ended up in administration. 12, 16 She jokes because she says, You knew you would always have LICSW after your name, you just didn’t know it would say, Mrs. 12, 16, 18 Charles Hilger, LICSW.  [laughs] 15 AS: Did you finish your alcohol and drug -- CH: I did. 5, 6 I finished my two years and I did have a knack for it. 14 It was daunting because the professor would be like, Oh you’re the -- it was unfair. 9 I remember I was telling my therapist about it and she’s like, Oh, you’re the superstar? 15, 16 I don’t know what that means, but it stuck with me. 12 I was taking these classes and getting As in these classes. 7, 11 I was thinking, These teachers are dumb because I can’t be this smart.  AS: Right.  You are still in that mindset.  CH: Over time it bears out and I graduated after two years. 7, 14 I had taken a job as a tech in a halfway house overnight so I could study. 6, 11, 13, 14, 18 I always give my wife a hard time because I say, I was thirty-one years old, three months sober, no driver’s license, no vehicle, living downstairs in my parents’ duplex with my dad driving me back and forth to school, with a job -- don’t take this the wrong way -- I was monitoring security alarms overnight and usually when we met, if your alarm goes off at your house I’m the one that calls the police. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 It was like for seven or eight bucks an hour. 15 Is that like a good social experiment, or what? 10, 12, 19 I have no idea.  Oh, this will be fun!  Let’s see where this goes. 6 I mean, what was she thinking.  [laughs] 15 I finish my two years. 14 She had taken a job at detox as a tech, I had taken a job at Cochlear Programs and they happen to be next to each other. 11, 15, 19 I worked for a year as a tech while I was going to school. 7, 14 They hired me the day I graduated to start detox as a counselor. 5, 7, 16, 19 I worked at detox for six years, which was a great experience. 14, 18, 19, 20 I saw about a thousand patients a year. 14 That’s a lot of patients over six years to assessments with. 12, 13, 14 I continued and did my bachelor’s degree in social work. 19 We moved in together in ‘97 and got married in 2002. 7, 8, 15 We blended our families. 17 She has a son that is the same age as mine.  Our sons are just six months apart. 9, 11, 16 They were fast friends at the age of seven when they met and they are still fast friends. 16, 20 I was finishing up my bachelor’s at University of Wisconsin River Falls where Kinnic Falls campus is located.  No irony left on me there. 14 I still go back there every semester and talk to their class. 7 AS: Talk to which class? 7 CH: Use, abuse, and addiction. 6, 12, 13, 14 About harm reduction services. 5, 14, 19 I went into working with opiate addiction. 12, 14 My wife and I worked side by side as counselors for about two of the years of detox after I became a counselor and she became a counselor. 9, 14, 19, 20 She did that for like two years and then we finished our BSW and she wanted to do something else. 14, 18 She went off and did a couple other things and ended up working in a methadone clinic at some point and said to me, This is great because you have patients for two years. 11, 14, 20 If we are going to LICSWs this most looks like the therapeutic model where you have these patients engaged in mental health care and counseling for a long time. 12, 17, 19 It’s a great training ground because you have the same fifty patients. 20 I applied to that company as well and I went to a different location than where she was at. 14 I started working in 2003.  I was a counselor for a year. 14 The company was a national one and they didn’t have a lot of leadership or strength here. 8, 14 The treatment director resigned and I applied for the position. 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 It was three counselors in the clinic -- it was a small clinic.  I think there were 150 patients in the clinic at that time.  I took over as the treatment director. 12, 13, 18, 19 CH: Dakota Metro.  AS: In the Twin Cities?  CH: Yeah, down in Burnsville.  AS: It is a methadone clinic? 6, 8 CH: It is a methadone clinic owned by a management group. 12 I don’t want to be disparaging towards them.  AS: What year is this? 14 In 2004 I was a counselor.  In 2004 I took over as the treatment director. 12, 13, 18, 19 I made a few changes and the clinic took off. 6 I had to double the size of the clinic.  We just did really well. 18 I was fortunate enough to find a few really solid staff members, enough people that knew enough about the treatment modality that I didn’t know yet like the pharmacy and the nursing piece. 9, 12, 13, 16, 18 I used the medical model because I worked in detox before. 6, 7, 13, 14, 16, 19 I do have my license back by this point. 13 [laughs] 15 In the spring of ‘96 Brownie, my wife, gave me the money to pay to take my test and get my license back. 8, 10, 13, 20 She was tired of driving me around. 5, 14 My dad gave up the job he was like, You got it now! 11, 12, 14 The clinic took off and we did really well. 18 I got a call from a friend of mine I knew from the state. 16, 20 I knew him from working at detox next door. 16, 19 He was like, Hey, just so you know another national company is sniffing around Minnesota looking to open clinics. 12, 14 I notified my boss and he notified the CEO and he called me and said, The only way to stop this is to open up more clinics and I want you to do a footprint, get you boots on the ground -- you know Minnesota better than anybody -- and tell me where to put three clinics. 12, 18 Give me three locations.  I worked that out and figured it out with my process and about a year after I became treatment director and I had put this proposal together and my regional director resigned. 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 He was a man I have tremendous amount of respect for and is an amazing individual, great boss, one of the best people I have ever worked with. 9, 12, 20 I was sorry to see him go. 6 It was between me and another guy for the regional director because two of us applied for that position. 18, 19 I had kind of done that groundwork for the clinic.  The CEO knew what I could do but the other guy applied and he had been there longer. 16, 17 In fact, he was the guy that hired me, and I got the job. 5, 11 He hired me as a counselor, then we were peers, and then I got hired. 5, 14 I found out he didn’t know how to run a clinic and I had to terminate him. 8, 12, 17 Terminating the guy that hires you is not fun.  I opened up two methadone clinics for them here in the state. 14 We never did open the third one. 8, 16 AS: Was that Valhalla?  CH: No that would be St.  Cloud Metro and Rochester Metro.  For five years 14 I had seven clinics in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Indiana.  In that time, because it is a national company I got to work with Dr. Thomas Payte since the late sixties, you look at the tip forty-three, which has all the ‘this is how you do methadone.’ 6, 8, 14 He is one of the authors.  He is one of the top ten in the field.  When they point to the elders he is one of them.  He knew the people that pioneered methadone. 5, 8, 9, 16 Doctors Dole and Niswane.  Just an amazing physician. 9 He has a heart for patients and a realistic approach and view of methadone. 9 I got to work under him for five years. 14 The company I was working for didn’t allow for things like additional care like mental health. 10, 12, 14, 19 I was working on my master’s degree for mental health so I really had a penchant for that. 12, 18, 19 They thought it was a good idea but it wasn’t baked into their model. 10, 17, 18 If you add in mental health you end up reducing your profit. 5, 12, 14, 15, 19 They didn’t want to do that.  It was their model.  AS: Because it was just maintenance?  CH: They had all the licensed drug and alcohol counselors, right. 5, 6, 12, 13 When you try to start bringing in higher cost therapists AS: ...let’s treat that problem that you keep talking about. 7, 12, 17 I see. 6 CH: The man I worked for was very difficult to work for. 10 People are surprised that I worked for the five years that I did. 14 Eventually we agreed to disagree on the topic of patient care and I elected to leave. 18, 19 I figured I was finishing my MSW and I needed my hours so I would go work at House of Charity in downtown Minneapolis for a person who used to be a treatment director. 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 I work for her now. 12 We always got along great. 17, 18, 20 I was never one to be caught up on [1. 38.59]. 16 Let’s just get the job done and do it right. 11, 12 I started working at House of Charity, which is a group-housing unit with service for mental health, CD [chemical dependency] services, the whole nine yards. 6, 12, 13, 19 We were doing groups. 12 Can’t do mental health yet, at that point, but I’m doing groups. 12, 19 I have all the methadone patients on the side because that’s what I do on the side. 9 I am taking on consulting jobs so I’m doing some consulting for Valhalla, which is a relatively new MAT [medically assisted treatment] program at that point. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 My friend at House of Charity quit and they offered me the treatment director job. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 If I take the treatment director job I’m never going to get my hours for my LICSW. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 I was just finishing my master’s at that point.  I got to the point at St. Thomas [St. Paul, Minnesota] where I was finishing my master’s degree, it has a clinical focus, but I did the two-year program. 14 I was in year five of the two year program when my advisor who I had never talked to before called me in and said, You will not be the first person to take my two year program and turn it into a six year program -- this was in March -- You have until the end of the semester to finish or we are going to wash you out and you cannot return. 14, 16 I had all the research, I had all the data, and it was just a matter of getting it written. 13 I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. 17, 20 I finished it.  I was consulting with Valhalla and when they found out I had this treatment director job they were like, We could use you here if you are interested in leaving that job. 6, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 They were getting ready for their first accreditation. 5, 14 I told them I would work for them although I had a five-year noncompete with my other employer so I had to be a counselor, I couldn’t do anything else. 14, 16 I was a counselor that was writing policy procedures manual.  And I had a [unclear].  At that point I was the eighth employee hired. 5 My wife had left that other methadone treatment program and opened a locked CD treatment program for people that were committed down in Hastings and the Cochran Programs. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 She moved to Valhalla as a counselor. 7, 15 This was the third company we had worked for together, which works for us. 8, 9, 14 Valhalla was owned by a person that was on a methadone treatment program. 12, 13 The company that I used to work for -- I didn’t know him -- but he wasn’t happy with the way he was treated so he established Valhalla in a way that was a place that I would want to go to and I would want to be treated in terms of how counseling is handled, how insurance is handled, how medical services are handled. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 His idea was a much broader approach.  My only piece when I went to Valhalla was,  It is fine but we have to do mental health care. 11, 12, 19 I won’t do this unless we do mental health, thinking at some point I might get my hours in. 12, 15, 19 [laughs] 15 They agreed to that.  I was the eighth employee.  We had one hundred and fifty patients and that was October of 2009.  Through a whole series of things like the increase in the opiate epidemic, someone who knew how to do marketing, the expansion of services into mental health. 5, 12, 13, 16, 19 We took that clinic from one hundred and fifty to one thousand active patients in just three years, which means we are hiring a counselor every six weeks. 14, 15 It is crazy to think what we went through. 20 We opened a second location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and transferred like one hundred and fifty patients because they were actually closer to that location, and the company was sold last June when we had about 2,300 patients in 2016. 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17 We integrated mental health services so that patients coming in would get a mental health diagnostic assessment in addition to the regular counseling services. 12, 13, 19 We had full time nurse practitioners and physician's assistants and doctors that are on site most of the day and most of the days. 8, 12, 14, 16 Just a whole different level of care. 19 We had expanded Valhalla Place to add a medical clinic that you couldn’t do certain things from the treatment program to provide better and consistent medical care to patients with persisting issues besides do the physicals and the annual physicals. 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 That was really huge. 18 It has been amazing. 9 I never did go and get my hours. 15, 16 I actually never sat for the licensed social worker test that you sit after you’ve finished your master’s. 7, 13, 16, 19 In a short time in Valhalla I moved from counselor to treatment director to executive director. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 They tried to come after me for the noncompete, but it’s pretty difficult when that’s what a person does for a living; for their career. 10, 14, 15, 19 It would have been an uphill battle for them.  It is a different model and I’m not using what I learned there. 6, 10 I’m using what I knew what I wanted to do and it fit with what the owners wanted. 6, 15, 16, 18 AS: The pursuit of your interest in counseling led you to change the model in a methadone clinic setting that actually has improved patient outcomes? 6, 7, 8, 14, 19 Was that a new model for Minnesota to have the mental health aspect integrated? 12, 16, 19 CH: There are other people that have done integrated mental health models. 9, 12, 19 It really depends on the philosophy and the approach. 15, 18 Many of them are in larger mental health centers and medical centers. 7, 12, 14, 19 They are driven by a medical model. 5, 7, 14 Instead of being patient centered it is really about, This is our program and this is what our physicians do. 5, 18 It is not guided by the patient and if the patient is or isn’t progressing through treatment. 12, 13 Is their quality of life stable? 10, 12 Are they looking for something better?  Can we help them improve that if they want to?  Is this as good as it gets and we need to be okay with that? 10 A lot of the patients we have at Valhalla and a lot of the initial growth were patients that have been on a clinic tour for years because they would spend three years at a clinic, they wouldn’t get the results that the clinic expected, they would kick them out, they would go to the next clinic. 6, 10, 14 Wanting to grow, people are always taking patients even though they know -- they think it’s going to be different or whatever. 9, 10, 11, 12, 18 With the mental health patient in tact we can take the more challenging patient and we can work with them. 12, 19 We don’t say that this is going to get that much better.  You’ve been in four methadone programs in the last two years and it hasn’t gotten any better. 14 You’ve been through eight inpatient treatments, three outpatient treatments, four group residential housing. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 Why do you think if we provide you with methadone it is going to be any different?  We fight for stabilization.  Let’s not expect more than what it is going to be.  There is a percentage of the population that just kept doing a clinic shuffle.  Mental health issues kept getting in the way and they do fine for a while and then they have a manic episode and they go off and do something silly. 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 They would sell their doses or whatever and then no one wants to deal with them. 8 Just developing that and being able to do the medical care. 7, 14, 19 Now the patient is more invested in the program that they know they can go to where they say methadone and they know the provider is not going to roll their eyes or say, I’m not going to prescribe you any pain medications. 6, 10, 12, 14 AS: It is destigmatized. 9 It is completely destigmatized. 9 People don’t tend to move away as much from our programs. 15, 18, 20 When you look at our numbers ninety percent of patients that have been on the program for a year are free of any illicit opiate use. 6, 13, 14 AS: For one year? 14 CH: Not for one year. 14 At one year. 14 When you do the measurement, ninety percent are testing negative for any illicit substances. 6, 12 Seventy percent test free of any elicit substances. 6 Between the seventy and the ninety mark is predominantly people who continue to use THC [tetrahydrocannabinol]. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 I’m not going to put someone out, but is this something that is interfering with your quality of life? 10 Do you want to change it because it is illegal?  You might get drug tested at your job? 5, 6, 11 If those things aren’t an issue -- AS: 13 You don’t kick them out of the program.  CH: No, I’m not going to kick them out of the program.  Anyway, it is still ultimately their choice to make. 6, 18 The funder at some point may say, If you continue to stay positive you’re going to do -- we offer high intensity outpatient treatment, which is a twelve week program for five days a week, three hours at a time for twelve weeks for people that have more challenges making the changes they have to make. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 There is no reason to add the outpatient element. 11, 12 Some of them just want to go to in order to get the stability.  The outpatient piece has been critical. 11 The counselors get more training than they ever did, but they still don’t have the depth of knowledge that licensed mental health professionals have. 12, 13, 19 They are teaming up to work with this patient and figure out what needs to happen. 15 It has been a fascinating journey.  The pieces that made the biggest difference were the things that weren’t supposed to -- certainly there is serendipity that has come into play with the church thing and a couple of other things, but the right place at the right time, everything happens for a reason, whatever you make peace with or you look at it. 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17 I was the person that was cornered in for treatment, which we all know never works. 5, 9, 12, 13, 16 I thought that was kind of funny. 9, 17, 18 AS: It didn’t work right away. 12, 18, 20 CH: The Road Less Travelled was a book that I picked out for a guy that had been my roommate at the treatment center. 12, 13, 14 We went down to the library and I picked it out for him and I said,  You’ve got to read this because I think this is what you’re looking for.  [laughs] 15 He elected to leave the halfway house, so he left it on my desk. 6, 13, 14, 18 He said, Would you mind returning this? 20 It is the only reason I read it.  There are a number of those very crystallized moments where I’m like, That was weird. 8, 12, 14 Getting into school, therapy was huge, the mental health piece, the treatment piece was huge. 7, 12, 13, 19 My twelve-step piece was critical as well.  I did CA groups as well, cocaine anonymous groups, for two years at ADAP. 12, 14, 16 I would still go back frequently probably for three years. 14 Eventually I stopped going and haven’t been going for years. 14 Doing harm reduction strategies, we do syringe exchange, we distribution of Narcan and training for Narcan across the state. 5, 10, 14 The numbers that were coming back for 2016 it looks like more than twenty-five percent of the kits that we distribute are being used to reverse overdoses. 6, 13, 16 Huge numbers.  We distributed over two thousand last year. 14 Five hundred reversals out of those two thousand kits.  Watching people go through recovery over the years, people that I still see today that we on my original fifty case load in 2003 -- I always joke that you never forget your first fifty. 6, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18 I’ve certainly lost patients over the years. 8, 11, 14, 17 My belief in the dogmatic approach to recovery, you know the ‘once an addict always an addict’ just doesn’t apply. 12, 14, 18 There are people that it is never safe for them to go back to using. 6, 9, 16 Using anything, using something. 6 People have different physiologies, they respond differently with chemicals. 13 I had a bad accident in 2000 and they sent me home after five days in the hospital. 5, 8, 13, 16 I had a broken collarbone, five broken ribs, and a punctured lung. 5, 8 They sent me home with Dilaudid, and all this stuff I had been listening to people saying were great drugs. 5, 6, 9, 20 I took them with a little bit of, I need to get rid of this pain, and a little bit of anticipation. 6, 20 I don’t get it.  I am a go fast guy.  Thank God they don’t treat those things with cocaine because it would have been a different story. 15, 16 [laughs] 15 It would not have worked out too well.  I believe that our mindset that because someone has problems at some point in their life with alcohol or drugs does not mean that they cannot ever use again. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13 I would be irresponsible if I ran around saying that everybody should find out if it was just a phase. 16 I would never do that. 16 Several years ago I made the conscious decision that drinking at this point in my life would be okay for me. 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 Two and a half years into it I consumed it socially, and I have never gotten any problems because of drinking. 5, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19 AS: You still have your license. 13 CH: I still have my license. 13 [laughs] 15 My methadone piece when I do the eight hour MAT 101 and I kind of roll this out slowly in the presentation but I still have narcolepsy and at age thirty-five it started to get bad to the point where I was counseling in my first year at MAT and I was starting to have problems staying awake with patients, which doesn’t convey any positive regard. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 They were like, Chuck, come on.  The good part is coming. 9, 10 Is your dose okay?  Are you nodding?  Do my pupils look small?  I went to the doctor because they told me it wouldn’t get any worse. 12, 14, 16 He told me I was just getting older so the effects are more pronounced. 16, 20 Thanks.  That’s getting worse.  I don’t care how you sort it, that’s getting worse. 19 Despite the fact that based on the twelve-step philosophy that taking any stimulants -- because stimulants are my drug of choice -- is a slippery slope, then ultimately is going to lead back to regular use and or abuse or addiction, ultimately addiction and jails or those types of institutions, if not death, I elected that I did not want to sit at home and be on Social Security because I cannot drive my car because I cannot stay awake behind the wheel, which is what ultimately could have happened. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 I elected to take the risk and take stimulants.  I am fifty-two and I have been on stimulants for -- I joke and say the only time I ever abused them was the morning I had four ibuprofen in one hand and four of my ten milligram Ritalins for the day. 6, 13, 16 Instead of taking the four Ibuprofen I took the four Ritilin. 11 That morning went by really fast. 18 Other than that I have never abused it. 6, 13, 16 I have never taken it in excess and it allows me to function. 9, 10, 16 Here I am now, here I am a person taking a kissing cousin to my drug of choice. 5, 6, 11, 12 People abuse Ritilin; it is a stimulant. 6, 13 Stimulants are my drug of choice but I take them to maintain functioning so that I can do what I need to do. 5, 6, 9 Without it I wouldn’t be able to do that and it would definitely have a negative impact on my quality of life. 9, 10 Yet, my patients that take methadone, and nobody ever questions whether I’m sober or not. 6, 8 When I started drinking and I did tell a few of the guys that have been in long-term sobriety with me -- and I still consider myself in recovery and long term sobriety and recovery -- that I had made the decision, because I didn’t want to keep any secrets, we were talking about, Oh you’ve got so much time and I said, Well, I’m not counting alcohol anymore. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17 They were like, What do you mean you aren’t counting alcohol? 6 I was like, Well, six months ago I decided it wasn’t an issue for me. 11, 13, 14, 16 I’m not sober from alcohol anymore. 6 They threw me out of the damn club because now I wasn’t really an addict. 12, 14, 18 Now I’m not really a person in recovery because nobody can do that. 18 Nobody could ever go through a phase in their life where they used alcohol or another drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism, and then at some point later in their life go back to use at a regular level. 5, 6, 10, 13, 16 They would say, You were never an alcoholic anyway. 6, 16, 18 To go back to the methadone thing my patients taking the kissing cousin to their drug of choice in order to function on a daily basis -- it can be abused -- some of our patients do abuse that, they mix it with other medications, they do it in order to get an effect. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16 The vast majority, eighty percent of the patients don’t do that and it works just fine. 9, 11, 18 Fifteen years ago even to say that out loud it could put your whole career into jeopardy. 13, 14, 15, 19 I actually work it into the eight-hour medication assisted treatment -- AS: To say what out loud? 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 CH: To say that people could return to normal, social consumption drug of choice, perhaps without the same outcome or the same consequences. 5, 6, 9, 16, 19 AS: Even something like an opioid? 13 CH: Even something like an opioid. 13 An opioid is just another drug. 5, 6, 13 It affects a different area of the brain and it is a very primary area that is part of our reward circuitry for sure. 8, 9, 13, 14, 19 It is part of our survival function; it ties into all those pieces. 9 But, to say that a person, and certainly we have evidence of this, I don’t know if people that are going to go back and try to start using -- I’m not going to go back and start using cocaine recreationally. 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17 Alcohol fits more into the social strata. 15, 19 AS: I’m thinking heroin. 16 Some people are using it socially, at first, but then they get hooked. 6, 9, 14, 19 CH: More people recover on their own from anything than they ever do by going to treatment. 9, 12, 13 AS: We just don’t know who those people are. 9, 12 CH: At best, the studies that we have show a twenty percent success rate.  AS: For treatment? 12, 13 CH: For treatment. 12, 13 When you try and say it is only successful twenty percent of the time people say, Is that their first or second time through? 9, 14 People really get it their second time through. 18 There are people that should never use again. 6, 9, 13, 16 I have seen people that have one beer and they change. 6, 9 For whatever reason -- chemically it is a bad idea. 13 I certainly have heard stories of people who have two beers and go to lockup. 8, 9, 17 You shouldn’t drink ever. 5 I think we need more people out there that say people who go through midlife crises -- they lose their jobs, grief and loss issues, and they may choose to use alcohol or some other drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Ultimately more often than not they move away from it on their own without having to go to treatment. 12, 13, 15, 18, 20 Second of all, if they ever use again it doesn’t mean you are going to be dead in six months. 6, 11, 13, 16 With opiates compared to drinking you are dealing with a whole other level of unknowns. 5, 11, 12 You’ve got carfentanyl, you’ve got fentanyl, you just don’t know. 12 There’re so many variables.  People die from alcohol related disorders every year; more people than are dying from opioids. 6, 9, 13, 14 It’s just quicker with opiates.  Right, you die much faster.  CH: That’s an important piece to get out there. 9 I don’t think we are doing anyone any favor with the war on drugs. 5, 6 AS: That’s a whole other issue. 13 CH: I will point to Portugal and leave it at that. 18 Their numbers are there.  You can’t say it would be the same across cultures, but I think it would be pretty darn close. 9, 10 Statistically it would be in the ballpark.  AS: Thank you,  Chuck.  CH: You didn’t ask any questions.  That’s what’s good. 10 CH: It’s hard! 9 This is going to be a twenty-hour story if I did all the twists and turns. 15 AS: We might need a part two that is just an hour. 9, 15 I might want to come back and talk about harm reduction and where you think this is going. 5, 14 CH: That’s right! 12 That’s how we started out and I completely disregarded that. 14 AS: I think it is really important because it helps me filter and think about how I am going to write. 9, 18 When I wrote the chapter about mothers I didn’t know what was really going to come up. 12, 18 There was this piece about them being embattled.  CH: I hope you wrote something about the crack babies. 9, 16 I’m still waiting to see something about the crack babies. 6, 15, 16 CH: What do you mean they aren’t there?  Sorry.  [laughs] 15 AS: Someone else already wrote that: Susan Campbell.  This idea of mothers being embattled and embattled motherhood and also being addicted to mothering in some way. 12, 14, 18 So, themes come up.  That’s why I enjoy hearing the whole story. 9, 15 Thank you so much.  CH: There are so many pieces. "
"11","Englund_Gloria","Deb Holman Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 19, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Deb Holman -DH Amy Sullivan -AS AS: It’s May nineteenth, this is Amy Sullivan I’m with Deb Holman.  Deb do you give me permission to record this interview and will you state your name?  DH: Yes, I give you permission.  This is Deb Holman.  AS: Thanks.  Okay so Cloquet.  I heard you were born in Cloquet. 9, 14 DH: So do you want me to start way back at age one or whatever? 18 AS: Just what you remember of your childhood. 14, 20 DH: I kind of grew up in Cloquet. 20 A history of alcoholism in the family, my grandpa was an alcoholic, my dad was an alcoholic. 6, 12, 14, 15 My grandpa committed suicide when I was in second grade. 5 I always remember being scared of my grandpa because he was a mean drunk. 5, 8, 14, 18, 19 Then my dad’s an alcoholic too. 6, 14 Growing up he was kind of like the weekend drunk. 5, 8, 14, 15 He’d get paid on Thursday and Sunday or something. 16 There’d always be some kind of blow out on Saturday generally. 10, 16, 18 Mom was super stable, obviously probably co-dependent. 12, 16 Just one of those people that everyone loved, just because that’s just the way she was. 9, 14, 18 Then I started acting out kind of young, blaming it on my dad. 14 Being in treatment as early as age fourteen just for getting in trouble for drinking, skipping school, whatever I was doing, fights at home. 5, 7, 11, 12, 13 AS: You were sent to treatment? 5, 12, 13 DH: I’m trying to think of what happened. 15 I’d end up in different places.  I ended up getting a social worker. 19 I used to run away and drink. 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 18, 20 I’d run away to Duluth which was fun. 8, 18, 20 AS: How far is that?  DH: It’s only like twenty miles.  Looking back on it my home life was not bad, not really. 10, 18 My mom was stable. 12, 14 The dad thing, there was never any sexual abuse or anything like that. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 A lot of probably verbal abuse and some physical but not a lot. 6, 13 He was more the type that would break things.  I don’t recall that.  Sometimes I go, “Are there things you’ve shut out?”  Sometimes I can’t remember.  I really haven’t had a huge indication that anything super bad happened. 14, 15, 16, 18 St. Luke's used to be the detox center here in Duluth and I think I'd end up there a few times. 6, 13, 16, 19 AS: As a teenager?  DH: This is starting at fourteen.  Then I ended up in some treatment program in Duluth and ran away. 12, 13, 18, 20 Two days later me and this girl ran away and then we ended back up at St. Luke's detox. 7, 16, 18, 19, 20 Then we ran away from there too in our jammies. 18, 20 It's all about getting loaded at that time.  Somehow, I don't know if I got committed or if I've got a social worker at this point. 12, 19 I ended up going to a group home in St. Paul for wayward ladies. 18 Booth Brown House. 6, 13 It's still there today but it has a different kind of, I don't know who they work with these days. 12, 16 It's a Salvation Army program.  I think I spent about six months there. 11, 16 It actually was a lot of fun, the ladies and stuff but looking back on it some of them I wish I could connect with but I can't find a lot of them. 7 I spent about six months there and continued to drink or use. 5, 6, 11, 13, 16 I was one of those that would use whatever. 6, 13 There was no like really heroin or coke or anything like that in my life at that time in my life. 10, 16, 18 What year were you born? 14 Then at some point…  AS: So this is the mid-70s you're in treatment? 12, 13 DH: Yes.  AS: What was treatment like at that point? 12, 13 Oh I'll be getting to that.  Oh gosh.  I get a little confused but I think I have a pretty good recollection of it. 6, 10, 13, 16, 20 I got in trouble at the group home kind of using and stuff like that. 6 Then I ended up going to St. Mary's which is at Riverside there. 9 AS: Oh the hospital? 8 DH: Yes, they had a treatment program. 12, 13 What do they call it now? 12 I'm drawing a blank. 5 AS: Was it Synanon?  Oh God I can't believe I can't think of it.  It was very confrontational.  AS: If you think of it you can just text me the word.  DH: I cannot believe I can't think of it right now. 12 It had a name, their treatment way. 12, 13, 18 You had to sign a contract. 11, 19 If you left the program and wanted to come back you had to be willing to sacrifice something. 14, 18 Some people cut their hair or shaved their head. 9, 14 Then at that point they made people wear signs and stuff too. 9, 11 I was fourteen or fifteen I think, fourteen probably, and I wore this sign that said, ""I'm a lying, cheating, slippery, slick junkie."" 11 I wish I had a picture of it.  I should make one just for kicks.  Part of my thought is that, ""Well, you made me one."" 17, 18 AS: They referred to you as a junkie? 5, 17 DH: You made me wear this sign so I became a self-fulfilling prophecy. 5, 11 Then the other part of me knows there's addiction in my family. 9, 12, 14 I know I have the addictive personality. 12, 14, 15 AS: That was traumatic for a teenage girl. 7 DH: I think it was but I didn't realize it at the time.  I think of course I ran from there.  Then I got sent to Willmar State Hospital. 5 I got put with the adults and it was the state hospital and the treatment. 8, 12, 13 We interacted, they still had the tunnels, I don't know if they still do. 12, 18 They had a canteen and you mingled with the MI people. 9 I still remember a few, Charlie, Linnette, Robert.  It's like I can picture them clear as day, you know. 12, 16 Then there happened to be an older gal from Cloquet that was in treatment there at the time and I knew her. 12, 13, 15, 16, 20 We kind of buddied up or whatever.  I didn't really talk about my childhood partying with the Weed Weevils and stuff like that. 9, 14, 18, 20 That's kind of where it all started.  That's kind of what got me in trouble.  I think I stole a car one time too.  That might be what started it all.  AS: Because you did something illegal.  DH: It was Easter, we went to a keg at Chub Lake and then we went to some bar.  You know what? 12 This was later.  I'm getting a little mixed up. 20 Where did I leave off? 18 The Willmar State Hospital.  I think after that I got to go back to Cloquet but of course I never stopped using. 6, 16 Then I suppose if you jump ahead to graduation or whatever. 14 Then I came down to the Cities.  AS: After high school graduation? 7 Sue and them went to Colorado, they went travelling.  I think I went out.  I did meet up with them once that summer. 7, 18 I think I just got some little job. 11, 20 I've always been like, I'd say I'm the super responsible person, pretty responsible. 10, 16, 18 Like right now the difference between me and Sue, and I envy her for it sometimes, is I like a homebase. 12 I need to have my comfort zone. 8, 14 Then the other part of me right now is feeling super stressed because I've got five dogs. 7, 9, 12, 15, 16 I'm getting totally kind of burnt out.  I don't know how much longer I can do this. 12, 17 I wish I could escape it.  Right now I'm just looking for the one good, positive thing that happens every day. 10, 12, 15, 16 It's really somewhat bleak out here. 18 I don't know how to describe it. 12 There are things that rejuvenate me so I'm not totally there yet but I'm aware.  AS: What's your job right now? 11, 12 DH: I do street outreach with homeless folks. 12 Another thing I'll mention because I know that I feel the stress that I feel that led me up to my last OD and things like that. 7, 12 I kind of know when I'm there but I'm really good at controlling it because when I did overdose...or at least I think I'm good at controlling it. 10, 12, 14, 18 You've got to be careful. 19 I'm just really aware of my inner self and when I'm at that point where it could happen. 15, 18 Then I go well, I've got all these dogs I've got to take care of. 19 I'm loyal to them and my last dog sat through the OD with me.  I always felt kind of bad about that but we both made it through somehow. 8, 11, 18 I don't know if that makes sense. 12 I just need that spot. 6 AS: So let's go back to graduating from high school. 7 DH: I graduated from high school, took off to the Cities and it's kind of all somewhat of a blur. 7 I got some little job at a photo place. 11, 20 I just got an apartment and started living down there. 5, 9, 11, 12 I was hanging around with some Cloquet people. 9 At that time we were using drugs. 5, 6 At that time it was cocaine that was the big craze. 16 AS: Are we like in the 80s right now? 12 DH: I graduated in '78. 7 Yeah I pretty much worked at Maidl Photo for quite some time. 10 I just continued to be a partier. 9 I'm trying to think, by this time I had already been through one, two, three, I think three treatments before I was eighteen. 12, 13 I don't know if there was four. 12 Every time that I started to get to the point where maybe things were getting out of control or I'm like missing work now the answer I would always think would be, ""Go to treatment."" 5, 12, 13, 18 Now looking back I don't think that was the answer.  I think that was ingrained in me because of my experience. 18 Then 1981, I think, I went to Twin Town.  That was when it was mixed.  I'm still working at the same job. 11 From Twin Town I went to a halfway house and did the sober thing for awhile. 6, 13, 14, 18 There's just all these little groups of treatment people in my life. 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 I'm starting to think of them all.  I'm never one of those people that's been totally sober like I always smoked pot and I always will I'm sure. 6, 9, 16, 18 That doesn't go over well with the AA crowd.  Especially back then.  There might be a little more, I don't know what it's like now. 12, 20 I still think they're pretty strict on it. 10 I'm just going to chronic smoke too. 6 I went to Twin Town and then went to a halfway house. 6, 13, 14, 18 I was always the type of person who got really connected and hooked up. 18 I would do well and make friends. 16, 20 I can't even remember.  After the halfway house I moved in with somebody. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 18 I went to Jane Dickman.  It used to be Jane Dickman and Team House. 6, 13, 16 They were affiliated like sister, brother house or something. 6, 13, 20 I think all this time too I didn't know if I liked boys or girls. 7, 11, 12 I had a lot of boyfriends in high school. 7, 16, 20 I think I started having my first attractions towards women. 12, 14 Of course I always fall in love with straight women. 12, 14, 18 A lot of them want to try it though too.  There's a few stories there too. 9 I think at the time I had a boyfriend at that time. 7, 20 I moved in with somebody from the halfway house. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 18 Eventually just back to using again at some point. 6 I think she moved back to New York. 7, 15 I'm trying to think where I was working at that time.  I think I was still at the photo place.  I worked there a long time. 17 AS: Through all this you kept your job? 11 DH: Yep, I did.  That's what I mean a responsible user. 6, 13, 16 I always knew the way to get out and just go to your employee assistance program and now I'm going to treatment. 12, 13, 16, 18 Everything is kind of a blur when I'm thinking about it like this.  All of my relapse crises are over women too. 12 It seems like there's usually a woman involved so now I'm single. 6, 12 There's always a woman involved in it. 18 Sue will back that up too I bet.  Now I'm thinking of all them too.  Some of them were f'ing crazy. 20 So then I think I moved out on my own. 7, 15 I'm still working at the photo place.  Sue went back to New York.  I was using. 6 I wasn't using hard drugs at that time. 5, 6, 9 It was just pot and alcohol. 6 Alcohol can tend to get me in trouble.  That's one of the reasons I don't drink now because I'm a drug user and the alcohol, I'll get to the point after being intoxicated day after day that I go ""I hate drinking and I like drugs so where's the drugs?"" 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 16 Then you're back at it.  I'm a super binger too. 16 I might have a few but I try not to get drunk. 5, 8, 14 So then I got some other job in St. Paul. 11 I'm working in Eden Prairie at control data. 13, 18 I was always a workaholic. 18 So anytime I wasn't using I was working two jobs or three jobs. 6, 11 So I definitely still have that issue too. 9, 13 I have two jobs and I have for like ten years. 11, 14 I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 10, 12 AS: You work two jobs now? 11, 12 DH: They all kind of roll together. 8 HDC is like one of the mental health agencies in town and they have a homeless project. 5, 12, 19 I just do outreach for them.  AS: You do outreach in both of your jobs? 11, 12 It's the same people. 9 My thought process on it is that my job at CHUM, it's never a forty hour a week. 11, 15, 16, 17, 18 This stuff doesn't ever end.  AS: What does CHUM stand for again?  DH: It used to be Churches United in Ministry but now the synagogue joined so they can't use the church word anymore so it's just CHUM. 6, 12, 13, 16 So now, during this time my mom got cancer. 10, 12, 14 She was diagnosed I think it was, I have a hard time remembering dates. 9, 13 September of '86 maybe. 5 Then she died in July of '87.  It went super fast. 16 At that time I took a leave of absence. 18 We knew it wasn't good from the start. 10, 16 We had prearranged that my mom didn't want, my mom and dad had gotten divorced around eighteen. 7, 10, 14 I always felt like I kind of pushed that. 11, 18 I kind of felt bad. 11 As I look back on it now I was a little brat to my parents. 12, 20 It's like, ""Why was I like that?""  Maybe part of it's because they're both dead. 9, 16 AS: That you feel guilty now about that? 12 DH: I try not to feel guilty just because I know that it's useless. 6, 12, 13 AS: How many other siblings did you have?  DH: Three, two brothers and a sister. 20 AS: Were you kind of in the middle? 7 DH: I was the oldest. 20 I laid the ground down.  AS: Don't you think some of that might have to do with the fact that your dad was alcoholic and your mom was so dependable. 6, 14 You're kind of a combination. 14 I could go either way. 18 Right now I'm on the whatever side. 9, 12 AS: Or are you finding balance?  You're keeping a better balance.  DH: I try.  That can be a challenge for me too just because I do tend to work a lot.  Last night I was trying to be home at seven thirty by all means and I didn't get there until eight thirty.  Then my mom dies. 14 It had been prearranged that my sister and I would be guardians for my brother. 7, 10, 20 My dad was drinking heavily. 5, 11, 14, 16 At that time I would call my dad homeless, precariously housed. 6, 10, 13, 14, 16 Sleeping on Grandma's couch. 16 There was a bar in town called The Northeastern.  Me and Sue can joke about Jerry.  I don't take it personal when she says it.  AS: Is Jerry your dad? 14 Old friends can joke. 16, 20 There was a homeless guy on the street one time who said, ""God I knew your dad. 14, 16 I used to drink with him."" 5, 6, 13, 16 It would get to the point where I'd be like, ""Shut the fuck up.""  He was my dad. 14 Oh my God.  Thank God he's gone. 8, 11 He used to drive me nuts. 5, 6, 13, 16 Then I moved back to Cloquet, duh, to live with my brother. 7, 15, 20 My other brother Mark moved out of the house. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 I'll slow down a little bit. 10, 20 I got some job at the match mill. 11 AS: The one that just got bought? 8 Diamond Brands.  I didn't know that. 12 I don't pay attention.  I probably hated it.  AS: You got a job at the match factory? 11 DH: Then I'm living at my mom's house with my brother. 6, 13, 14, 20 Then things went on, I'm working.  Thinking back on it I did start using then at that time. 6 My friend got married in August. 7, 20 She got pissed at me.  We talked about this recently, it was because the coke was flying around.  I was weepy because my mom's been dead a month. 14, 16 One of those, not a good situation. 10 I didn't know how to deal with it. 12 I had this little kid too to deal with it. 20 Both of my parents are dead. 16, 20 My dad was suddenly. 14 AS: Your dad died before your mom? 14 DH: No, it's coming shortly. 18 When you know someone's going to die, I grieved all that time. 12 I remember the day she told me she had this lump. 16 I like bawled from Duluth to Minneapolis listening to the same song the whole way. 18 It was making me cry. 10 I was just worried about what's going to happen. 15 I cried a lot from September to July.  When she died I was all cried out. 14 Then I moved in with my brother. 7, 15, 20 I pretty much told my dad, ""Screw you. 10, 14, 16 I'm done with you. 8 This is your responsibility and I'm here.”  I loved Jerry. 14 He was a good guy too but just a drunk. 5, 8, 10, 14 That's probably why I work with drunks, one reason, or can tolerate them. 5, 8, 14 Fast forward, going through all this grief stuff.  I tried to do everything like my mom. 14 I love dumplings and I remember trying to make them and it didn't work out and I started bawling. 14 Then dabbling with use on and off through that whole thing. 6, 13 Then having this new responsibility now too and really being responsible for Steve. 12, 16, 18 The one thing about Steve was that I was fourteen when he was born. 14 He was this cute little baby and I took him everywhere. 20 When I moved to the cities every year, every summer he'd come down. 7, 14, 15 I spent a lot of time with this kid.  It was already kind of like he was partly my kid. 9 Then of course he's been this football kid, active in everything, As.  Then he starts to be a user. 6, 13 I'm working shift work. 8 Not really knowing how to deal with that. 12, 18 February of '88 my dad is super drunk and falls down some stairs at someone's house and ends up in the Emergency Room. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16 To make a long story short he's brain dead. 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 We made the decision to unplug him. 14 It was kind of too soon.  It's like six months later. 11, 16 My little brother, I felt so bad for him and my grandma. 11, 20 They're both dead. 16 I worked at the match mill for awhile.  Then I got hired at USG. 5 I kept trying to upgrade. 5 It's another mill in town.  Then eventually ended up at Potlatch which is like the mothership. 5 They all want to be there if you live in Cloquet.  Then my partying started again, mostly cocaine use. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 I could do it for a long time, go to work. 17 You could call in sick in those days. 15, 16 You could go to work loaded in those days. 16 People got loaded at work.  It's just the way it was. 18 Then I also moved my girlfriend up here after my dad died. 7, 14, 15, 20 Nobody really knew or it was something that wasn't talked about. 16, 18 There was really no ill feelings about it. 15, 18 I would say everybody was good about it. 10 There was still some, I had some of that shame.  I wasn't this real comfortable lesbian.  I wasn't comfortable telling a lot of people. 9, 15 AS: People weren't really telling. 15, 18 DH: No one was really open at that time. 8, 18 Eventually I got into trouble again.  The relationship too because of the drug use was having some issues. 5, 6, 12, 13, 19 I had actually moved out of my mom's house by then. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 We had bought another house. 6, 13 I'm trying to think how things went down.  My sister, if you look at the AA model she's the hero. 20 At some point there was an issue. 13 I think my brother Steve, I don't remember clearly how it went, he started partying and stuff. 9, 14, 20 He had an accident. 13 He was found in the morning as a John Doe.  They didn't know who he was at first. 12, 14 He took off on his three wheeler at two in the morning in the winter drunker than hell. 5, 8, 14 It turns out my cousin... let me stop for a minute until they go by. 15 It's an issue right now. 12, 13 I don't know why. 12 I wouldn't' say depressed, I don't know how to explain it. 10, 12 It isn't depression really. 10, 18 [Conversation about the weather]  AS: So you were talking about, you'd moved out of your mom's house and your sister was the hero. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 What do you mean?  What happened? 15 DH: She had been going to college at UMD. 7 She always had an issue about me being a user. 6, 13, 18 She's a mean drunk and didn't really like the way me and Carol were doing things, the woman I was living with. 5, 8, 14, 18 Carol was a very positive influence on him.  He'll tell you that too.  Really a pretty level headed person. 10, 14 Drugs and alcohol too but was a musician. 6, 9 That's how she was making her living at that time. 10 She travelled a lot.  I think at some point there was some issue that we ended up moving out, buying a house, and my sister moved in with my brother. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 Then the accident happens. 13, 15 They were living together. 8 I'm getting lost. 11 We didn't buy our house by then, we were renting. 6, 13 Carol and I were renting.  Anyways, Steve has this accident and we're all at the hospital. 8, 13, 18 At first they didn't know if he was going to live or die just because it was a really serious head injury. 11, 12, 14, 18 He ended up making it. 10 There was like this big argument about where's he going to go to rehab. 12 Julie didn't want him with the lesbians.  Things like that.  I think he had to go to a rehab center for awhile.  This is where things get a little fuzzy. 20 Steve goes to rehab.  I think he actually was staying with Carol and I. 7 He had to kind of learn a lot of stuff over like talking and eating. 10 I think he lost the vision in one eye. 11 He can't smell anything.  He's had complications since because of that. 10 Then another really stressful time. 7, 18 We've already been through these two deaths and we all have the addictions gene or whatever. 12, 14, 18 My brothers are drinkers. 5, 20 My sister is a drinker. 5, 20 Pretty much I'm just the pot smoker these days. 6, 16 Julie still, there's stories about her. 9 I think she's getting better now but up to even three years ago it's like oh my God just terrible that I take pot and Klonopin. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 Then what happened? 15 At some point Carol and I started having problems because I was partying quite a bit. 9, 12, 14, 20 There was a little house. 6, 13, 20 By this time we had bought a house and Steve moved in with us there too. 6, 7, 13, 15 He's living with us.  He's partying. 9, 14, 20 I think at some point she just got sick of all that. 15 I wasn't a super good drunk. 5, 8, 10, 14, 16 I don't know how to explain it. 12 Drinking doesn't look good on me. 10 I'll put it that way. 18 I think eventually she moved out. 5, 7, 15 I took it really hard. 9, 18 My brother is still there at the time. 20 I really started hitting it hard. 9, 18 There's a little house attached to the garage that we rented out. 6, 13, 20 My renter was a cocaine dealer. 16 I'm like, ""Billy never pay me the rent in cocaine."" 16 This has been going on for a long time, sneaking over to Billy's or whatever. 17 Billy also worked at the papermill.  Part of the thing being back in Cloquet too, eventually, not eventually but right away being gravitated to that group. 5, 12, 18, 20 I think at first I tried to be super responsible and the mom and take care of business. 14, 16, 19 Then I fell into it again.  After shift work at midnight or seven in the morning people go out drinking when the bar opens at eight because that's their morning. 5, 8, 9, 11 I just remember kind of being at the mill and I was definitely in a cocaine psychosis. 9, 16 Did you work the night shift? 8 DH: Rotating shifts. 8 Just kind of getting to the breakdown point with the addiction. 12, 14 That, ""Okay I can't go to work.""  I knew how to play the game to get through that. 16 Then I went to the mothership: Hazelden.  I'm like, ""This is going to be it.""  Looking back it's like that whole thing that was ingrained in me that you're an addict and you've got to go to treatment. 12, 13, 14 I don't think that anymore.  I go to Hazelden.  I always loved treatment. 12, 13, 14, 18 I loved to connect with those people. 9, 14 Tatum O'Neal was there when I was there.  I have her lip prints in my big book.  She got pissed at me recently because I posted a picture on Instagram of when we were on the Lily Unit.  I'm like, ""Whatever Tatum.""  I didn't say we were in Hazelden, I just posted the picture.  There were like six of us in the picture.  AS: And you could see that it was her? 6 DH: I went and tagged her.  I think I did.  She'll just have to get over it.  Then I went to Hazelden.  It was actually Christmas. 7 I remember being there on Christmas.  Then I went to Fellowship Club which is still there today. 10, 16 Did super well. 16 AS: Is that the St. Paul sober house? 6, 13 The one on Watson off of West 7th. 8 Kind of by the old brewery down there.  I think I was at the halfway house four months. 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 I had my house in Cloquet still. 6, 13 I was on worker's comp. 19 At some point they talk me into, ""You can't go back.  You've got to stay.""  I really didn't want to come back to Cloquet either. 18 I just decided to get an apartment down here. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14 AS: In Duluth you mean?  DH: In the Cities.  I'm sorry.  In the Cities.  Like a block from the halfway house was this fourplex that everybody that went through the halfway house moved into. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 18 Oh cops, I like him.  AS: An officer just drove by. 5, 8 DH: He's waving away. 18, 20 AS: And waved at us.  DH: They're pretty nice most of them. 10, 18 Susan Phillips at your little meeting. 18, 20 She's like, ""Oh Deb.""  She's the one with the shaved head. 8, 14 She's like, ""I just see your cop pictures and I go it's a thing I know Deb because..."" 6, 12 She's very active in holding the police accountable for the brutality. 8 I mean so am I.  I try to portray good interactions with the police because I do interact with them in a good way quite often. 8, 10, 11, 18 They're very helpful to me and I want people to see that. 6, 9 It helps the homeless cause I think too. 6, 13 AS: It does because they know you're paying attention to everybody. 12, 14 This is what happened at Hazelden too. 15 I'm not a person that, I think, I was the president at Fellowship Club. 9, 10 I had a good friend, a lifelong friend that was in treatment there too, like a leaving Las Vegas alcoholic she was. 6, 10, 12, 13, 17, 20 She never did quit drinking. 5, 11, 16 I would visit her while I lived at the halfway house. 6, 7, 13, 14, 18 Actually it was the day I was going to graduate I get called in by my counselor. 14, 16 She's like, ""Deb,"" she was from Texas.  ""I've got some bad news. 15, 16 You know we're not going to be able to graduate you tonight."" 12 Basically because I'm talking to people that are still using. 6, 9 AS: Because you were talking to people? 9 DH: And spending time with her and stuff like that. 10 I'm like, ""She's my lifelong friend. 10, 17, 20 I'm not going to abandon her.  No, she's not a threat to my sobriety."" 12 AS: For that reason you wouldn't graduate?  DH: Yeah and I think there was a few other people too that had left the house that I was associating with. 6, 9, 13, 14 That was frowned upon.  Then they told me I had to get up and resign my presidency too. 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 I'm like, ""You're fucking kidding me.""  This is kind of obviously a sore spot with me. 6 I never talked about like when my parents died I eventually ended up going to see a therapist who really was an amazing lady. 5, 6, 9, 16, 18, 20 I saw her for quite a few years. 14 I go call her because I'm in an uproar.  I said I was just going to leave then. 18 It's like, ""Screw you guys I'll just leave. 18 I don't care about your f'ing medallion."" 19 Then they held the thing, that would be against medical advice and your insurance won't pay. 7, 14 I did the whole bullshit that they wanted me to do. 18 The next day I came back super high and I'm like, I demanded them to accept me. 7, 9, 12, 16 I'm still the same Deb that left here yesterday. 14, 16 It's like I'm the type of person that keeps in touch with everybody. 15 I've usually had relationships later with counselors, they've become friends and stuff. 16, 19, 20 I thought it was such bullshit. 17, 18 It's just bullshit. 18 It doesn't help anybody.  AS: It almost drives you back to your addiction. 5, 12, 14 I think treatment's a lot more gentler these days. 12, 13, 16 That was like '95, we're talking Hazelden too.  They really think the only way is abstinence. 18 I don't think they really believe in harm reduction in all. 5, 14, 18 A little bit now? 12, 20 I don't really pay attention but I know I've had a few interactions with Moyers over with the wet houses. 6, 9, 12, 13, 18 I don't know what he really thinks about needle exchange, we've never talked about that. 10, 12, 16, 17, 18 He doesn't agree with the wet houses. 6, 9, 13 I think I pulled it together rather quickly after getting high and getting right out of there. 7, 8, 11, 12 I got kicked out of the house then of course, trespassed, barred, whatever. 5, 6, 13 I think if I stayed sober so many days then I could come back and I could get my medallion and stuff like that too. 16 I think I did do that.  I still had a connection to the house, I did. 6, 13 I had a dog at that time that everybody loved Harry. 14 He was kind of famous.  Me and Sue used to joke that we were going to do the harm reduction books like: ﻿When Harry was Homeless, Harry Does Harm Reduction, Harry Does Street Outreach. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16 ﻿He went everywhere.  Just do a kids book or something.  I don't even know where I was working. 12 I was working for a lady that, when I was in the halfway house, she'd come and get people for day jobs. 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 I stuck with her.  She rehabbed houses and things like that, painted. 6, 9, 13 I stuck with her for awhile.  She knows how to deal with harm reduction. 5, 12, 14 We were always relapsing and oh we didn't show up for work. 18 AS: She understood that.  DH: Sort of, she's even paid me when I didn't do a damned thing because I'm so high and just goes, ""Oh Deb."" 7 I guess I've always dabbled in it but at the same time I've always, there's been a few short periods when maybe I was precariously...I'm trying to think at what point things fell apart. 5, 9, 10, 11, 18 I think I remember now. 12 I worked and lived in this duplex with other Fellowship people. 7, 9, 10 We were tight.  Everybody went and had coffee.  It's like the bullshit AA thing. 18 It works for some people. 9 I still have some good friends from that time. 10, 16, 20 They are totally AA people. 9 I'm losing my train of thought. 17, 18 At some point, I lived in that house for eight years and pretty much the same people lived there too. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14 I don't know what year it was. 12, 14 AS: Were you in St. Paul, Minneapolis?  DH: St. Paul.  I like St. Paul better.  I love Minneapolis too. 14 I've lived both places but I think I like living in St. Paul better, I don't know why. 7, 12 Quieter, a little bit. 20 Eventually people in the house started using. 6, 9, 13 The whole crowd, people would start relapsing. 9 People even died I think.  You know how it is. 12 One of my Cloquet friends, I know Sue probably talked a lot about Lisa. 12, 16, 20 Lisa and I had gone out to Colorado and we stayed with her brother Joel who is the one who ended up committing suicide a short time later. 8, 14, 18, 20 Joel was kind of scary on that trip.  He's kind of one of these neo-white-Nazi dudes. 19 He was like talking the homosexual thing. 12 Me and Joel, we were a couple at one time. 11 In the early 80s we did a lot of drugs together. 5, 6, 8 I think he had recently gotten divorced. 7 He had a lot of back pain so he was addicted too. 6, 12, 14 They had cut him off.  AS: To pills?  I think he lost his job. 11 We didn't know. 12 With this supremacist attitude that can get kind of scary. 10 He's got rifles.  Even Lisa was concerned about him.  I'm like, ""Shit is he going to shoot me because I'm a lesbian?""  We got through the trip.  Me and Joel went out together one night. 8 Very fitting we saw the movie ﻿Blow. 10, 15 ﻿That was all of our experience together, a lot of it. 8, 18 We went out to dinner and had a great talk. 20 We come back to Minnesota and I don't remember at what point but it was within two weeks he killed himself. 14, 15 He shot himself. 11 Then I come up for the funeral.  Of course it's a really tragic thing. 18 At the rendezvous after the funeral which is one of the Cloquet drinking bars that everybody would go to and a lot of people were doing drugs. 5, 6, 9, 11 That was just the crowd.  I was kind of trying to do this AA thing and stay sober and off hard stuff. 9 I did stay sober there.  I drove home to Minneapolis that day. 5, 16 The whole way my palms were sweating. 18 I knew. 16 Just thinking about, ""When I get back I'm going to use."" 6, 13 I knew my neighbor could get me something because he was using heroin at that time. 6, 16 AS: Had you used heroin by this point? 6, 13, 16 DH: I had in the early 80s with Joel a few times but cocaine was really my thing. 16, 18 It really was. 18 It was back when it was like good cocaine, not like what you see these days. 6, 10, 14, 16 I don't even know. 12 Can you get the good cocaine these days? 10, 14, 16 Probably not.  You'll have to investigate that.  I don't hear about it. 9 I just hear about meth and heroin and crack. 6, 9, 16 Some people still smoke crack. 9, 16 Rick wasn't home when I got to St. Paul.  I pretty much just paced the porch. 10 It's just that whole feeling that you know you're getting it. 12, 15 I asked him if he could get me some drugs. 5, 6 By this time I kind of missed out on the whole starting to do volunteer work with Sue.  AS: In Minneapolis?  You did some of the Women With a Point Stuff? 12 I had been working with Patty, just doing my own thing.  When Sue started Women With a Point I started going down to shelters with her and doing street outreach out of the back of her car. 12 I missed that whole part. 9 Eventually I got a little job, front desk job, at Mary Hall Catholic Charities and that's kind of what got me going. 11, 20 I worked there for a long time. 17 I decided to go back to college at some point. 7, 14 I'll have to see where that fits in. 6, 15 I missed a whole section.  See what I mean here?  I was working for Patty and decided to go back to school. 7, 14 AS: Who's Patty again?  DH: She's the one who redid houses and stuff. 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 I started to go to St. Kate's for social work. 19 Then I was working at Mary Hall.  I had a couple of incidences too doing needle exchange where I ended up in a hotel with somebody shooting up just because it's like, ""There it is."" 6, 10, 11 Sue would get super pissed at me. 16 ""Get out of that hotel room. 14 Get out God damnit Debbie.""  I don't know I was always pretty impulsive. 10, 12, 18 I think I still am sort of.  Going to college. 7 That's when we took the trip.  I go to the funeral.  I'm waiting for Rick to get home for the drugs. 5, 6, 15 I just proceed to go on like a four day bender. 16 I was doing street outreach at that time for People Inc. 12 I think I had been kind of falling apart. 9, 11 I had been drinking a lot. 5, 11 Not really falling apart just drinking a lot. 5, 9, 11, 18 I was kind of in the setup mode to use. 6, 13 Rick came home.  We got some coke.  Even though they were using heroin. 6, 16 I was doing needle exchange so I had all the stuff we needed. 10 I just went on a four day binge that ended up, Sue came over and pretty much saved my life. 10, 16 I don't know if you heard this story. 9, 12, 15 I had been communicating with Sue because she's in the, ""God damnit Debbie,"" mood.  ""Here goes Debbie again.""  I've done some crazy things. 20 She told me some of this when we met at your deal. 16 Stuff that she's never told me regarding that incident. 16 I think we had been communicating.  Apparently I was going to go to the Employee Assistance Program or something on Monday, whatever day it was. 16, 20 We were supposed to do something together that morning and she hadn't heard from me. 8, 9 She called Dave, her husband, and said, ""What should I do? 14 I haven't heard from Deb."" She calls me Debbie. 9, 16 She's about the only one that can. 8 Or Frybrain. 13 Did she tell you that, Frybrain? 13 I was proud of it at one point.  Dave just told her, 16 ""What if something's wrong and you didn't go?"" 11 She came over and pounded on my door, no answer.  This is the stuff she's told me recently. 16 I think she was getting ready to leave and then the neighbor came out and said, ""Deb's fine. 11, 18 She's sleeping on the couch."" 16 [Interruption]  DH: The neighbor came out and said I was sleeping. 16 Well I wasn't.  Sue said I was shallow breathing, turning blue. 10, 20 AS: Had you used heroin? 6, 13, 16 DH: We were doing speedballs.  At this point they were heroin users, my neighbors. 6, 13, 16 There was no more coke.  I could remember during that four days you can't go to sleep or anything. 16 There was Jamie giving me a shot of dilaudid in the neck. 11 I can remember this really well. 18 Then just getting up and just starting over.  I don't know how it would have gone on if I didn't OD. 12 I don't know. 12 Like I said, my poor little dog sitting there with me. 20 Sue called the ambulance and they Narcaned me.  This is when that wasn't really… 18 AS: What year is this? 14 DH: The anniversary is coming up too.  I think it was 2001 or 2002.  Then I was super pissed. 16 Some of my co-workers that I was doing outreach with threw me under the bus. 12, 19 Specifically Brett Byfield.  My neighbor, his girlfriend lived in public housing. 6, 7, 19, 20 I had went with her to public housing to get some drugs. 5, 6, 19 She's not a client or anything. 10 That's how Brett looked at it.  I don't even remember how it all went down.  Then I couldn't go to Dorothy Day for awhile.  The executive director.... 18, 19 AS: To do outreach? 12 Eventually they fired me at People Inc. 5 I played their game.  I went to treatment again for fuck's sakes. 12, 13 Then I OD, I'm in the hospital. 8 It was Memorial Day weekend. 15 Then they start to say, ""You tried to kill yourself.""  They're wanting to sign releases for my sister. 11, 20 I'm like, ""Hell no.""  All my co-workers deserted me. 12, 19 The people who were calling me were my homeless people. 9, 16 I mean I had a few.  My ex came down to see me. 6 A few people that were supportive. 9, 19 AS: How long were you in the hospital? 8, 17 DH: Nine days. 16 I got shipped up to the psych ward because they said I tried to kill myself.  AS: On what evidence were they basing that?  DH: Just the OD and thinking I was depressed or something. 10 At that point I inside of myself woke up to how I used drugs. 5, 6, 9, 13, 16 I'm like, ""No I was not suicidal but it's suicidal.""  I play that whole scenario out if I get a trigger or something.  I do, that shit's all over the place. 18 If I ever killed myself it would be with heroin. 14, 16 That would be the easiest way to do it. 18 That's just where I'd go.  That'd be my choice. 6 That was a super hard time for me then. 9, 16 The job made me go to treatment mostly because they wanted their paperwork done. 11, 12, 13, 18 It was like 2001 because it was the terrorist attacks.  I was in treatment right after that. 12, 13 There was a bunch of flight attendants from American in treatment at the time. 12, 13 It was really sad. 18 That time I went to Pride Institute.  I thought, ""I'll try the gay one this time, see how that goes."" 6, 9, 17, 18 My leaving Las Vegas friend, Deborah, I got her to come to treatment. 12, 13, 20 Then we were roommates. 14 She's had a million treatments. 12, 13 She did the Jellinek thing at Hazelden. 9 Do you know what that is? 12 The intense six month. 16 It costs thousands of dollars.  It probably costs a hundred thousand these days. 16 AS: Is that how they detox you? 19 DH: Back when I was there the detox was called Ignatius. 19 Then I think I was on the Lily Unit.  Then Jellinek was the long term for the chronics. 6, 9, 17 I did that, went to Pride Institute, went back to work, got my paperwork done and then they fired me. 5 I was kind of depressed for awhile. 10 I was still going to school. 7 I was like, ""Fuck, I fucked this up.""  At the same time the executive director at Dorothy Day said, ""Deb you're good with us. 10, 18, 19 Just right now you've got to stay away because of Brett."" 12, 18, 20 This asshole pushed it I guess.  There was support that way. 18 Do you know Monica? 12 Did you meet her? 18 She's at Simpson?  DH: She was the executive director at Simpson. 18, 19 Now she's doing something.  She's had a lot of jobs in the homeless world. 11 She's an icon down there.  Monica Nilsson.  AS: What did you say about Monica saved your life? 10 DH: Me and Sue were at the May Day parade a few weeks ago. 13, 15 Monica walked by so we said hello. 16 I looked at Sue and said, ""The person who saved my life and the one that gave me a second chance."" 8, 10, 14 She hired me at Simpson. 5 I asked her down the road, ""When you hired me did you know I had had this incident?"" 5, 12 Then I'm like, group hug.  That was just kind of funny. 9 I just kind of did outreach and worked in shelters in Minneapolis for awhile. 12 Always smoking pot. 6, 18 AS: But you stayed away from heroin? 16, 18, 20 DH: Yeah and I have stayed away from all hard drugs ever since. 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 20 That's a long time now. 12, 17 AS: That is a long time, like sixteen years. 14, 17 DH: Is it that long? 17 Oh my God.  Wow.  I never thought of it that way. 16, 17, 18 It's not that I don't get triggered I just know where I go and what stops me. 5, 12 I'm that person who needs some kind of security and I don't want to lose it. 9 I am very grateful that I made it through the last one. 8 AS: Was that the last one? 8 What do you mean by the last one? 8 DH: I mean when I ODed.  It doesn't seem so long ago, wow. 6, 13, 17 AS: The way you talked about it I thought it was much more recent. 17, 18 I've never really thought about that it's that long ago. 13, 16, 17, 18 It almost makes me go, ""Was it 2011?""  Then I just worked.  I super got into homelessness. 16 Outreach was my thing.  I've always poured my heart into it. 5, 9, 18 I don't have kids or I don't have a family I've got to go home for. 12 I've always been pretty available. 10, 18 Then I worked in the shelter for awhile in the cities. 7 I really missed the street outreach. 12, 18 Have you heard of Charlie Parr the musician? 9 DH: He did outreach in Minneapolis and he was known as Jeff Parr at that time. 11, 12 He had moved to Duluth and I just said, ""If you ever leave your job,"" he was doing outreach for the Homeless Project where I work part time now. 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 18 I said, ""Let me know."" 12 Then in 2005 he left to go do music. 9, 14 I applied for his job, HDC. 11 I didn't work there long because their idea of outreach was, ""Oh you can do it from eight to ten am on Tuesdays."" 12, 16, 17 They're a mental health agency and the boss was a controlling asshole. 6, 12, 18, 19 I can't work for you.  I went to work at the Dom Yono which is like the soup kitchen in town.  They have a couple programs like a clothing program. 11 At that time they had a cooking program where you can learn a trade like a culinary. 10 They have a kids cafe.  I worked in the social service. 19 I still really wanted to work at the shelter and do outreach. 12, 18 Eventually I got a little part time job at CHUM in the shelter. 9, 11, 20 I think I also did an internship here.  When I came up here I was still going to St. Kate's .  Then I was going to go to Scholastica but they wanted too much money. 8, 10, 18 I did an internship at CHUM though.  Then I got a job there. 11 I've just been there ever since. 10 They let me do my thing.  There's some things about the shelter that are totally punitive that drive me crazy. 5, 19, 20 I don't have a lot of control of it. 18 I can argue a lot and I do advocate a lot to the point where my boss says, ""You're a pain in the ass."" 6 It's like that's my job. 11 I'm kind of getting to the point where I don't feel that they do harm reduction enough to the point where it satisfies me. 5, 14 AS: At the shelter?  Even though they say they do.  Some of the staff we hire for the shelter, they're mean.  [Off the record statement]. 12 As far as the heroin use, have you talked to the needle exchange yet in Duluth? 6, 10, 13, 16 AS: I interviewed Mary McCarthy, the executive director and my students interviewed Maggie and Jameson. 18, 19 DH: I think we kind of find that it's hard to work with them a little bit. 9, 20 Right now, I have all this Narcan and I don't have barrels and points. 12 I've been trying to get them from them.  I need to get them somewhere.  I need to start passing it out.  I finally got a hook up.  AS: Talk about your job. 11 When you say outreach what does that involve?  DH: We've developed a collaborative over the years that I've been here that involve the...homelessness used to be, it's still really bad here, but it used to be visibly much worse. 6, 13, 14, 16, 18 Since they built the San Marcos which is actually having its ten year anniversary this year. 7, 14 AS: Greg told me about that yesterday. 16 DH: Did you talk to Greg Anderson?  I'm glad.  He's an awesome person.  I love that guy. 14 I was thinking that you should have talked to him.  I was just thinking that yesterday. 16 We kind of built this collaboratively where people who are homeless and chronically on the street using the Emergency Room, ambulance, fire department, going to detox and having nowhere to go. 6, 9, 12, 19 We just all work together. 8 What it's developed into is I would be kind of the one making the contact. 8, 10 You're on the street.  We have twelve agencies that meet once a month that include the hospitals, probation, the courts. 8, 16, 18 AS: That's different from OARS?  I used to go to OARS but I dropped off just because I don't know. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 16 I still get all the notes though which is cool. 17 AS: What you're talking about is a coordinated effort for the homeless where people are talking about the people who are chronically on the street. 6, 9 DH: Because I work at HDC I work with everybody but at my CHUM job I get kind of a monthly list of referrals from the police. 8, 11, 16 It's just this ongoing list.  He counts up the police contacts. 8 DH: Dave, Officer Dave the one that wouldn't talk to you. 8 They're usually for drinking in public. 5, 11, 19 They might get fifth degree assaults.  It's proven that all these minor things and they can lead to a felony.  Then people are really... 9, 18 You're the person on the street, you've signed this release that it's covered by all these different agencies so now we get to talk about you. 5, 11, 12 It's more for coordination for care. 19 I can't get medical records. 7, 14 You go to the ER and tell them one thing, you go to detox and tell them something else. 19 Now we can all kind of coordinate on what the real story is. 14, 15 I worked a lot with Dave, the police in general. 8 I wouldn't say work with them.  I don't tell on people. 9 It's not to get them in trouble it's more to try and help them.  The frustrating part at the end of the day is that there's no housing. 6, 9, 16 You can do all these things with people, or adequate shelter either. 9 AS: How big is the shelter here?  How many beds?  DH: We'll take anybody.  I had to laugh the other day when they told me, I think the legal capacity is like twenty four or something. 16 We have like seventy to eighty people there some nights. 9 In the winter, yeah.  AS: Is anybody working on housing or on another shelter? 6 DH: We actually have a meeting Monday because there's a guy in Duluth, Charles, he works at the county right now. 7, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19 I don't know much about it. 12 I'm going to find out on Monday. 16 It's some kind of a shelter he's going to open up west, out west.  He's been kind of secretive about it.  I don't know why. 12 Me and Dave the cop are going to go talk to him on Monday. 16 I will like that for me because as an alternative when I'm doing my outreach at night on the weekends there might be another option instead of just CHUM where a lot of people are kicked out of or can't go to. 9, 12, 14, 15 I kind of heard a rumor that he wasn't going to take super drunk people and stuff like that. 5, 8, 9, 14, 16 I don't know. 12 The ones that get kicked out of CHUM or can't come he doesn't want them either is kind of what I heard. 8, 9 At CHUM it seems like they do kick out a lot of people. 6, 9 I never kick out anybody. 16 AS: So CHUM has a shelter.  DH: Yeah, that's where I work.  AS: That's the twenty four people one. 9 It's always full. 14, 18 There's three bunk rooms for the guys and three for the women and then a common area where there's mats on the floor and then overflow too. 8, 10, 12, 14 I'll give you a tour if you want.  It's not that much to see though. 6 It's your typical dirty shelter.  AS: Is there an issue with homelessness and heroin here? 13, 16 DH: Yeah there is but it's hidden.  I tried doing some outreach at the Clear Path Clinic. 12 I found it really difficult partly because of the way people go in and out of there. 9, 10, 18 You never know what time they're going to show up. 12, 16 I see it more as the counselors. 6 I did spend a fair amount of time there talking with people. 9, 10 I think just because I've been doing this so long that people know me. 9, 12, 17 It's word of mouth, it gets around.  They seem to not want to tell the clinic that they're homeless. 6 AS: Maybe it has to do with their medical care. 7, 14, 19 DH: That outreach part has been difficult. 9, 10, 12 That's why I thought if I could get some Narcan. 17, 18 I know a good number of people that are using heroin but they're not like camping out in a tent. 6, 9, 10, 12 They're hiding out in a drug house. 5, 6, 13 Some of them are in tents I guess.  They tend to not come around. 14 Sue just shared that harm reduction thing that the minister, did you see that? 5, 6, 14 One thing she said in there is that stigma makes people go underground. 9 That's exactly how I see the homeless population. 6 If you're homeless and using heroin you're underground. 6, 16 The drinkers aren't. 5 You just gotta build the relationships and get people to trust you. 9, 19 I do have a few people that will help me out to distribute. 9 I always like having that face to face contact. 18 You've got to.  Then you know who they are. 12 I'm seeing almost more meth use. 6, 13 Definitely the heroin. 16 I probably only see a portion of the heroin just because obviously no drugs discriminate but you know there's a larger group that's, I hate to say the word normal because that's not what I mean. 5, 6, 12, 16 Do you know what I mean by that? 12 Like just you or me going to use the exchange. 6, 10, 13 A lot of functioning addicts that are going to work everyday and then doing their heroin or whatever they do. 9, 14, 16 I think heroin users can function. 6, 9, 13 I don't think meth users can as well. 6, 13 I think my story's a little boring actually. 7, 15, 20 There's a lot of it.  I haven't really gotten into too much trouble with using in this town just because it goes back to that whole OD. 6, 18 I'm just scared to be. 5, 19 I know where it goes. 12 It's a healthy fear. 10, 19 That doesn't mean  I wouldn't want to do it once in awhile.  Sometimes I think about it.  It's that whole thought process. 17, 18 I've got the type of personality where one hit's not enough. 15 Damnit.  I wish I could be one of those people that just used occasionally. 6, 9, 13, 16 I'm getting a little bored, I wouldn't say bored at CHUM. 5, 20 We've got some changes coming up now where Dave is leaving again. 6, 12 I'm getting a new officer that I work with. 8, 16 They hired a new social worker. 5, 16, 19 It's going to be interesting. 17 I told Dave if this pick this lady officer. 8, 16 I said I won't even want to work on the group anymore.  I'm kind of getting to the point in my career or my life where I feel like I'm not living up to some of the principles, just the things I believe in. 10, 15, 19 Sometimes I even think we're criminalizing homelessness by what I do, my little job, the police contacts. 8, 11, 20 I don't know. 12 I'm frustrated that everyone needs to have an SPMI diagnosis to get certain kinds of housing. 6, 17 AS: What's SPMI?  DH: Serious or persistent mental illness. 12 AS: To get housing? 6 You have to have these forms signed to be eligible for some programs. 11 Then the other side of it too. 9 It's just like Hazelden.  Everybody that goes to Hazelden you get on anti-depressants. 10 I see that in the homeless world too. 6 Let's get everybody an arms worker and a case manager. 17, 19 It's helpful to a point. 9 They have to have a diagnosis to get all that. 6 That kind of drives me nuts. 5 I just go, ""Just do what you do everyday."" 16 A lot of people tell me I make a difference. 9 I guess I could say that I have.  Now my hands are tied in a lot of ways just because of the bureaucracy. 17, 18 They have this new, for a couple of years now they have what's called a coordinated entry for homelessness. 11, 12, 14, 16 The whole United States is using this model. 6 Anyone that's homeless has to do this coordinated entry.  What it looks at is vulnerability.  People with higher vulnerability technically would go to the top of the list and get in quicker. 7, 17 Which makes sense in a lot of ways. 18 I've seen in work a little bit. 6, 20 One of the problems for me is I can no longer help people directly apply for housing. 6, 9, 12, 17, 18 Then people don't keep in touch. 9 They're on this list but they change their phone number every week. 8, 15, 16 Anyone I do it with I use my phone number. 6, 8, 13, 16 I can't do direct housing apps with them anymore. 6, 18 You've kind of got to wait until their name gets pulled. 11 Certain scores get you certain supportive housing. 6, 17, 19 I don't know. 12 Then people get denied because they've got criminal history. 8, 9, 15 They're mentally ill and they're addicted. 12, 14 Why don't we lighten up on the criminal shit? 8, 18 They're going to win in the end anyways. 17, 18 Why make them wait three months to get housing or six months just because you deny them. 6, 11, 16 I don't know. 12 I don't know what it is right now. 12 I'm kind of feeling jaded in a way. 15, 18 AS: I would think there would be a pretty high incidence of burnout. 7, 10 DH: If you look at what I do too, I worked with Street Works for awhile too.  I left out that whole thing and Gail, I left out that whole thing. 14 Gail actually gave me my first outreach job. 7, 11, 12, 14 I left out that whole thing. 14 When I went from Mary Hall to Seton Services and Gail was my boss.  We were doing harm reduction outreach at that point with youth. 5, 12, 14 It was for youth escaping prostitution.  I think I was using through that time too. 6 I don't remember what happened. 15 I think I went from there to People Inc.  I went from youth to adult outreach. 12 It was hard doing outreach with homeless youth and having them outside in the winter. 9, 12 It was awful. 11 When I moved back to Duluth I actually moved in with my ex. 7, 15 I left out that part too. 9, 14 We were just going to live together platonically. 8 This is one of things I think is kind of telling about me is I'm fifty six years old and I've only lived with one person my whole life and it was her. 7, 10, 14, 15 It adds up to like twenty five years worth. 14 AS: Of living with her?  I don't have an interest to move anyone else in in that capacity. 15 I just look at it that I'm loyal.  She's since got married and stuff. 7, 10 It didn't go well, four years ago. 13, 14 I don't think I went off the deep end that time.  But I had been on Adderall.  I was super skinny. 16 I wish I could get back on it for awhile and lose some of this weight. 9 At the end of that too I think I was in Adderall psychosis when I look back on it.  I think after awhile it didn't work for me.  It made me kind of crazy. 14, 20 I quit taking it. 11 I like it.  I do like it.  I still have one bottle.  I'd like to take it for like thirty days just to see if I could fit into my summer clothes. 6, 7, 15, 16 I didn't feel addicted to that. 12, 14 I used it as prescribed. 6, 10, 13, 16 AS: Why did you get on Adderall?  DH: I got tested for ADHD.  Mostly because I wanted a prescription at the time I did. 10, 18 I don't know if I believe in all that prescribing either. 10, 12 I have Klonopin.  I don't abuse it. 6, 13 There's a time I did abuse it. 6, 13 I know when Lisa died I was into that phase. 12 We didn't talk about that either.  That was a super hard time, as you know, for Sue and for all of us. 9, 12, 16 I was using pills pretty heavily at that time. 6, 10, 16 I stay away from all of it all. 18, 20 I don't abuse the klonopin. 6, 13 My new favorite thing is wax, the old hash oil. 16 Three or four hits at night of that stuff and I sleep really well. 16, 18 I don't use it during the day, maybe on the weekends. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16 I just don't beat myself up for any of it anymore.  AS: How would you describe harm reduction? 5, 14 Just to wrap up.  DH: Definitely just really meeting people where they're at. 9, 18 It's kind of like loving them up, trying to show them that they have worth because everyone does.  No expectations really. 18 After I've been with someone or know them in a helping situation. 12 I have very little expectations. 20 At some point there has to be that want, that contemplation to change.  AS: They have to want that.  DH: Yeah, yeah.  Then I start having this much.  I tell them that.  AS: This much expectation?  DH: Yeah, like you have to participate this much. 9 Maybe it's more I just ask them to participate even if it's just a little. 9, 20 I think that's pretty much what it is. 10 If I was running the shelter people wouldn't be getting kicked out for thirty days for stealing a sandwich. 8, 9, 16 AS: That's what happens? 15 DH: Yes, there's a couple that have. 11 They're super mentally ill. 12, 16 AS: They get kicked out for that?  They're supposed to find housing for thirty days? 6, 16 DH: Yeah or they end up out here.  AS: What do you mean out here?  DH: On the street, sleeping out here. 16 I think harm reduction is pretty simple. 5, 10, 14 Things like the needle exchange, that's important. 9, 10 People need to support those.  I'm a little worried with this administration in here. 20 I don't know. 12 I think RAN was saying, I don't interact with them much and I should more. 18 I feel like they aren't inclusive it doesn't seem. 6 AS: Are they a part of what you would call this partnership? 9, 12 I would say that the majority of the people in the CIG group, a very small percentage of them are using heroin. 6, 9, 16, 18 They're either using meth or… 6 AS: What's the CIG group?  DH: We call it all the agencies that meet. 18 Community Intervention Group. 19 How appropriate, cig.  Not to say that they don't dabble in it.  I think there's a lot of synthetic use too still. 6, 13 That causes a lot of problems. 6, 12, 13 We just had a guy intubated for like eight days. 16 They finally filed to commit. 14 I struggle with that too.  After doing this for so long, I'm like it's the only thing that works for some people. 9, 17 Not even, it's just to give them a break.  Just take a break.  I don't know. 12 I've always had trouble with the system doing things to people. 9, 18 What I see out here is people that are maybe really mentally ill and get committed. 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 It's just to keep them safe and get them help.  What happens is they get off their commit, they come out here and pretty soon they're right back there again. 10, 12, 15 We really need some places. 18 I think even with that crowd you need a shelter that's just going to let them walk in and walk out. 16 It doesn't matter.  AS: Is that what San Marcos does?  DH: Yes.  San Marcos, they even discriminate against drug users I feel. 5, 6, 13 They have the drinking side which is like a Waukegan or a wet house. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13 They can have thirty two on that side. 9 The other side of the building has forty units with single room occupancy. 9, 14, 19 There's a ton of people probably using drugs in there. 5, 6, 9 It's not really, if they know you use drugs coming in it will be an issue getting through the process. 5, 6, 12, 13, 17, 18 It just came up the other day. 16 It's like, ""Well, he's trying.""  These people still deserve housing. 6, 9 There are some grants being written right now for more outreach to substance abuse users. 6, 12, 13 Part of this is the OARS group, they're involved.  I think there's two going on right now. 12 I don't know where they're going to find the housing. 6, 12 It's like get people into housing no matter what they're using or what their mental health is and then start getting them hooked up with services. 6, 9, 12, 19 Get them inside first of all. 9, 14 I don't know where the units are. 12, 19 We'll see. 6 I've kind of been rebellious and dropped off all meetings because I question authority I guess. 5, 11, 18 I'm so sick of the bureaucracy. 15 I go, ""Oh I just do what I do everyday."" 16 There's good and bad to that. 10 I probably have a strong voice in that. 17 People get mad at me.  I stand up for it.  When necessary I would still do it.  I remember we went through this, I haven't been to the Summit to End Homelessness for, this is the fourth one and I haven't been for two years. 5, 14 The first one I got so pissed. 8, 14 It's like everybody went through the whole day and at the end they came up with bullet points. 14, 16 Outreach wasn't on there.  I wish Duluth would have even like safe spot camping like Oregon has where people can just go. 6, 9 More like inreach than outreach. 12 This town you've really got to rely on tips. 18 For a lot of years I would walk the trails. 14, 16 It's fruitless to do that.  There's so many woods and trails and hiding places that you've just really got to rely on tips. 18 AS: You get tips about where to go find people. 9 DH: Yeah, to really go looking you can just waste a whole day looking and not find anything. 16, 18 When you mean outreach you mean you go looking for people? 9 DH: Yeah, I go out in the woods and stuff.  AS: Like that picture you posted of the tents when it was pouring rain this last week. 15 Yeah, I think it's funny because people like my dog pictures more than they like and pay attention to...I didn't even talk about the dog thing. 9 Somewhere along the way I started working with animals in this. 18 My first one was in St. Paul which I did get in trouble for. 8, 14 I had gotten Rusty out of the pound and I put him in my name.  When he ended up there again it was an issue, it's against their rules. 13 DH: I had bailed this dog out of doggy jail so the dog was in my name.  They felt it was a liability to them because the dog was living with these folks but was bailed out in my name. 11, 12 The funny thing is HDC, on my HDC time I can't take dogs home but it's always on my HDC time. 9, 18 So I just say, ""No, I'm on CHUM time.""  AS: What does HDC stand for?  It's the Human Development Center. 12 They're HIPPA, they're a mental health agency. 6, 12, 19 We are too I guess but we don't have a lot of the records.  AS: So you're rescuing homeless people's dogs? 9 Yes, somehow I started taking pets home. 8, 11 I don't know when I got the first one. 12, 14 2005 some homeless guy had him in his backpack.  He was just this beautiful little puppy. 20 It was like twenty below and he's drunk. 5, 8, 14 Bless his heart, Benny and Joy a couple were out here. 9, 11 I asked if I could take the dog home.  The rest is history. 15 I think Benny's eleven now. 12 The real Benny died.  I fostered a ton of dogs. 5 I had my two originals just together for a long time. 8, 17 People are out here, they have pets, they can't access shelter. 9 I'm like, ""Are you willing to foster your pet?""  Yeah, I've developed a little bit of a network too. 20 Obviously I can't take every one. 8 AS: So you'll take care of them until the person can find a home. 19 DH: Yeah but you never know if they're going to come back really. 12, 16, 18 Most of the time they do.  Now I actually have five. 7 I think I'm going to have a permanent four.  Then this little Yorkie that I just took home the other day who's kind of driving me nuts. 5, 14, 16, 20 AS: The one who's not potty trained? 6, 8 She's in the cage.  She was last night too because she peed on my bed the first night. 14 You're just going to stay in the cage.  The owner told me she let her dog go to the bathroom in her bathroom. 14, 16 Which I don't really know what that means. 12, 18 I'm like, ""On the toilet?""  They're like, ""No on the floor."" 14 Now I got to take that one out on a leash. 8 I'm carrying a Chihuahua up and down the stairs because that guy, well that's a long story. 15, 17 He's really struggling with meth and he's living in a condemned house. 6, 13, 18 They're just condemning it right now. 12 Somebody gave him five thousand dollars to get things back in order and it was gone in a week. 8, 11, 15 He knows that his little dog, it's this little eleven year old Chihuahua that came from a puppy mill. 12, 14, 20 She's had like ten litters.  I really didn't want her forever. 18 He knows he can't have her. 12 I kind of look at her and go, well really is she a trouble? 18 She just lays on the couch and doesn't really do much. 18 Then I start to feel kind of tied down because of all these animals.  AS: They just hang out at your house while you're working? 6, 13 I've got two cats.  The ex, I moved two blocks from her just to haunt her. 7, 15 No, we're still friends. 16, 20 The new person, there's an issue with her and me. 13, 16 I don't know if she feels threatened or what. 12 She doesn't have to obviously.  Carol comes over and lets them out everyday while I'm at work. 16 I'm flexible.  I work twelve hour days. 15, 16 I can go home.  AS: Five days a week? 15, 16 AS: Do you give yourself weekends? 15 I don't work twelve hours every single day. 15, 16 I'm trying to now just so I can have my weekends off in the summer. 7, 12, 15 If I'm not busy, if I'm just at home I usually will always answer my phone for the police or the hospital even on the weekends. 8, 15, 16, 18 Sometimes it's just a quick question or something or with that coordination thing going on.  I don't mind.  If I'm at home and somebody really needs something I don't really mind if I'm not doing anything. 18 The weird thing about my siblings is none of us ever got married or had kids, all four of us. 7, 8 I think that's super strange. 7, 16 I do see my brothers. 6, 20 They live in Cloquet.  They remind me of Felix and Unger in a way. 18 They're good guys. 10 My sister I don't see her a whole lot. 6, 20 I don't know how to explain. 12 She's always been kind of judgemental of my drug use. 5, 6, 12, 13, 18 I think she's coming around a little bit. 20 There's been a number of times where basically she's got drunk and I'm at her house. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 19 Sometimes with co-workers. 12, 19 I stay there when I go to hunt for stuff.  She starts shit. 18 It goes way back to when we were kids and the fact that I did drugs. 5, 6, 18 I want to say it was three Christmases ago she flipped out on me. 13 She's kicked me out a number of times at like eleven at night.  I'm like, ""Really?""  I just draw a line with them now. 5, 9, 12 I won't be around her when she's drinking. 5, 11 I even told her, 16 ""No drinking at Christmas."" 5, 11 If you're coming to my house. 6, 13 She didn't come.  I don't care if they drink. 5, 19 Just don't get super drunk. 5, 8, 14, 16 Let's have a few and get along. 17 I don't fight, she does.  AS: I think I probably have to wrap it up.  DH: That's okay.  I probably do to.  I haven't even been to work yet today. 16 CHUM is like that though.  They don't care. 19 AS: You do some incredible stuff watching out for the people that nobody else is watching out for. 5, 8, 9, 17"
"12","Espuche_Nancy","Chris Johnson Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 26, 2017  At the Home of Amy Sullivan Minneapolis, Minnesota Chris Johnson -CJ Amy Sullivan -AS CJ: I'm not an addiction specialist but you can't be involved in this problem as much as I have without learning something about it. 10, 12, 14 The typical model of putting someone in someplace for however long and you take away their job. 11, 17 AS: Thirty days, sixty days. 16 CJ: Yes, they feel better.  Then, ""Well that works then. 9 Look they're feeling better."" 15 It's sort of like, I liken it to someone who treats compulsive hoarding by just cleaning out their house and saying, ""Oh look isn't it nice to have a pretty house now."" 6, 10, 12, 13, 18 Without dealing with the underlying compulsion.  Why with that pretty house did this person feel like keeping every newspaper? 6, 10, 13, 15, 16 Why did they attach emotional significance to having every ﻿City Pages ﻿even with coffee and other stains on it? 11 AS: We're just going to clean you up and get the drugs out of your system. 5, 6 CJ: Without dealing with the underlying, what sort of mental anguish were they escaping from. 12 That also explains why certain people are unique. 9, 17 You look at their history and say, ""That was going to happen."" 15 Severe physical or sexual abuse. 6, 12, 13 A person with that little self-worth, every minute is an anguish. 15, 20 That person is looking to escape that constantly.  Some people do get better with intensive therapy. 9, 12 They get into a new situation where they can find an answer and they don't feel that. 16 Sometimes you can't.  Sometimes that person tragically—let's say they were eight years old when all this happened or just high school, these experiences where you're trying to develop a sense of worth and trust in the world and you permanently destroyed it. 7, 14, 15, 18 A person like that, a high percentage much higher than the average population, that person is a higher risk for developing chemical dependency. 7, 13, 17 The stress, the anguish they're escaping is just them every day. 7, 16 I think the traditional treatment community doesn't get it. 12, 13, 19 I think they do what's typical, what they can build for.  When it doesn't work they come back and build some more.  It's in their interest to have people relapse because that just fills their beds again. 5, 9 I'd like to say that medicine would have higher ideals but my experience has been not really. 7, 12, 14, 17, 18 AS: That medicine would? 12, 14 CJ: That medicine looks out for what's their long term health. 12, 14, 17, 19 AS: You would hope that that would be the case. 9, 17 CJ: My experience has been I've found that that has been compromised. 14, 18 Have you seen my talks? 6 AS: I saw you at the Saving Lives.  AS: In September.  That's when I met you and a lot of people came up to you at the Convention Center in September, Downtown Minneapolis. 9 It was put on by Hazelden and the DEA.  CJ: I just did a panel, was I just sitting up there with a bunch of people or did I have a whole hour? 9, 15 AS: I honestly don't remember but I remember being impressed with what you said. 8, 10 Why don't you just say some of those things but if you've already got the text or video of things that you would want to share with me you don't have to repeat them right now. 12, 18 CJ: They recorded it.  If they send me a recording I can forward a link to you.  I sent you my articles right? 5, 12 AS: No. CJ: Really?  AS: No. CJ: You saw my CNN article right? 12 AS: No. CJ: I'm sorry.  AS: It's fine Chris. 11 We're just meeting each other. 18 It doesn't matter right now. 12 CJ: People request me to talk, I'm like here's some of my stuff.  This was just going to be an interview.  I'm going to pause this for a second. 6, 13 People say their best things in the first couple of minutes. 11, 14, 15 [pause recording] 6, 13 CJ: If you're not familiar with some of my opinions on this my guess is you just saw me as a panelist. 8 AS: I saw you apologize on behalf of all doctors. 12, 14 You talked about quite a lot.  CJ: Did you see slides? 6 I don't think so.  CJ: I don't think you did.  I think you got me as a panelist.  If there's no slides and it was the convention center, are you sure it was the convention center?  Then I did not speak with my slides.  It was put on by the law enforcement. 8, 12, 13 I was one of a group of seven.  AS: Law enforcement and Hazelden. 8, 12, 13 CJ: There were seven people up there. 9 CJ: I got a ten-minute spiel. 15 AS: I can tell you why I'm interested in this and how this all came about. 14 Oral history is my area. 8, 15 I looked at the 1970s, a tragedy at a Girl Scout camp in the 1970s where three girls were murdered and had been sexually assaulted, three little girls. 5, 7, 11, 12, 20 I went back and interviewed survivors because I was at that camp that night as a survivor myself and grew up with no knowledge with what PTSD was or anything like that. 12, 20 When I did finally learn that and work through all those things as a women's history student I had an epiphany one night that this was what I needed to write my master's and my dissertation about. 10, 12, 15 I went and I found women who were now, some of them, were willing to talk. 12 I learned a lot about trauma and how things change. 10 Of course historians look at how things change over time.  I saw a parallel to what's happening with heroin and opioids with a shift in thinking about it and a little bit of a decrease in stigma in some respects and a demographic shift from who were the main users and how are they being treated differently from previous users. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 I wanted to just document people who are active in this world right now for an oral history collection of interviews. 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 Then I was approached by an editor at the University of Minnesota Press who asked if I was interested in talking to him because he saw I was doing this project. 5 We started talking and he said, ""Well why don't you think about it as a book and let's talk about it.""  That's kind of how this has come about with chapters that look at different sectors of what's happened since 1980. 14, 15 I'm not sure exactly what year I'm going to start with but up to the present. 5, 10, 14 I'm interviewing doctors as well as treatment specialists. 12, 13, 14 I'm very interested in looking at what places like Hazelden are doing with this.  I have a historian's eye on it and understand the history of why the Minnesota Model came to be. 15, 17, 18 I understand that but I think with the opioid epidemic and meth I'm not sure it's helping everybody in the way that it could be. 6, 13, 17, 18 CJ: You understand that the Cochran Club Organization looked at twelve-step recovery and found no evidence that it did anything. 17, 18 No evidence.  Honestly it shouldn't surprise you. 8 It's a religious based program. 13 AS: I'm very interested in your childhood, where you grew up. 14, 20 Tell me how you want me to start.  AS: I want you to start by saying your name and that you give me permission to record this interview.  CJ: My name is Chris Johnson, I'm an emerging medicine physician working at urgent care with Allina Health. 12, 14, 19 I give you permission to record this interview.  AS: Thank you.  Now we can kind of start.  What was your childhood like, where did you grow up? 10, 14, 20 I'm also as a writer, not just as a historian, I'm more of a narrative driven person. 5 I would really love to hear some basics about your childhood and how you got into medicine. 9, 12, 14, 18, 20 CJ: My childhood, there was some significant family dysfunction in my childhood. 9, 11, 12, 14, 20 My parents were and are, one of them is not alive anymore, they're both very bright. 12, 20 Both my parents went to Harvard. 20 My mother was an economist, majored in Econ at Harvard and my father was English. 5, 16 That's where they met.  AS: He was an English major?  CJ: He was an English major.  He did not have a very functional career. 9, 15, 19 He was a bit disorganized, very disorganized. 20 He couldn't decide what he wanted to do after Harvard. 14, 18 He apparently got into Columbia Law but stopped Columbia Law after two years then got into the PhD program at Tufts University for English, never finished that either. 14, 16, 20 Things started off looking well then lost interest. 11 Ultimately ended up being an opera singer.  He was a good singer, he was in the Harvard Glee Club, that was always one of his passions to sing. 10, 16, 18 My mother, she didn't have the traditional female skill set.  It was maybe reversed. 5 She was math, she was about the mathematics.  She will say she is a failed mathematician in the sense that she couldn't do math like the real Harvard math people. 9 She could do pretty well. 10 She went to the PhD program at MIT for Econ, the best Econ program in the country. 19 After that got a job teaching at Stanford, Economics. 11 I don't remember things much before California.  My early memories of life are Palo Alto. 10 My mother was there as a Stanford Econ professor.  My father was singing in the San Francisco Opera. 16 How old were you by that point?  CJ: Do you even remember things at age four?  AS: Four is when you moved? 7, 15 CJ: I think I moved when I was like three. 7, 15 I don't remember.  My earliest school memories are in Palo Alto, California. 7 I remember saying goodbye to my dad every day, he had rehearsal which I guess was in the evenings or something like that. 9, 10, 14, 16 I'd see him the next day. 6, 16 I realized later the marriage was kind of breaking up at that point. 14 Part of the going away in the evening wasn't just for rehearsal. 9, 18, 20 In any case, that family life that at least my brother and I. 10, 12, 17, 20 I have one younger brother, he's one year younger than me. 14, 20 The last time we were together as a family would have been 1979 in California in Palo Alto. 8, 12 My mother did not get granted tenure at Stanford which is not all that unusual as an Associate.  You go there to begin and then you go off and hopefully you become famous and publish. 9, 14 Then if you can come back when you're famous.  She did not get tenure and she was snatched up by the Federal Reserve in Washington D.C. to be an economist there.  That's when my family moved to Washington D.C. My mother, my brother, and I moved to northern Virginia right outside of Washington D.C. A town called Falls Church, Virginia. 7, 8, 12, 15, 20 At that point it was single mom. 14 My mother worked as an economist for the Fed.  We lived in a small single family home. 7, 12 My brother and I went to regular old public school in Fairfax County Public Schools. 7, 19, 20 Eventually it became clear, the story initially was my father was going to rejoin the family, he was going to get more and more important opera parts and then maybe try out for The Met in New York. 5, 9, 12, 15, 16 There's lots of banks in New York. 16 She could be an economist at a bank in New York.  That was the vision.  It turned out later it wasn't going to happen. 15 I won't go into that, that's not for the book.  In any case, I grew up with my younger brother in Falls Church. 17, 20 AS: How old were you when you moved? 7, 15 AS: You were born in 1970? 14 CJ: I was born in '70. 14 From that point on it was just going to finish elementary then junior then high school. 7, 12, 14 Then I went to college at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. 7 Neither my brother nor myself were as smart as they were. 20 I applied to Yale, I went to public school. 7, 19 It worked out.  Now I'm actually very proud that I haven't gone to a single private school in my education ever. 7, 14, 15 Public school the whole way. 7, 18 People will say, ""Oh yeah.  UVA, so tough.  The mean streets of Charlottesville, Virginia with Monticello and Jefferson. 5 It's a tough environment. 12 Dodging bullets on your way to art history class."" 7, 15, 18 At UVA I was actually a government major. 7, 12 It wasn't medicine. 12, 14 I sort of had this kind of a social justice part of me that was always kind of there. 9, 18, 19 I thought maybe policy or law was a way to manage big problems. 5, 12, 13, 17, 18 I'll admit I wasn't a great student. 20 I wasn't the best student.  I did things that didn't make a lot of sense.  I was government/foreign affairs; it was more foreign affairs. 9, 12 Wouldn't it be great if people could just get along on a national level? 9, 17, 20 I concentrated on the Soviet Union.  I was so stupid; I didn't take Russian.  What do you plan on doing with your great theories about improving relations if the nation you're studying and their government structure, which was the Soviet Union with a central committee, but I didn't speak any Russian. 12, 15, 20 While I was there then the whole thing fell apart. 9, 11 That's when the revolution happened again and the Communist Party went away. 15, 18, 20 Now technically it's back in a different form.  The same sort of centrist is back.  I won't say that I had a great deal of direction in how I proceeded with my academic career at UVA. 15, 18, 19, 20 When I graduated I considered with a degree in government you choose academics or you choose law. 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 I paralegalled for a little while. 20 I mean like a year. 14 In the Washington D.C. area. 8 That was a pretty serious recession at that time. 10, 11 That was when Clinton got elected.  Jobs were tough to come by.  It was not a very happy time of my life. 10, 18 You graduate college in 1992, I think I just got out of a break up. 7 It was bad.  On top of all that there's no jobs. 11 Especially for young, undergraduate degree in D.C. Paralegal work was all I could get not even full-time paralegal work but temp paralegal work. 14 It was enough for me to learn about the law. 10, 13 I realized very quickly even though I was not doing law type work, I learned about the process of law. 10, 13, 17 Some jobs I got to interact with lawyers quite a bit and learned about what was it that made them interested. 10, 11, 13, 18, 20 You realize that it's just the process of filing this and being sort of a champion, usually it's one company suing another company. 14, 17 Your contract said this, you owe us this. 19 It's the company defending themselves against the Department of Justice. 9, 12, 14 You violated this anti-trust whatever.  If you didn't really enjoy the process of it and that sort of confrontational, it wasn't for you. 17, 18 The whole idea of fixing big problems on a national scale, a bit naive. 12, 20 I thought well maybe if I can't do national level problem solving maybe I can do it on individual levels. 5, 12, 17, 18 I did like science.  If I was a physician, I could fix problems on a patient by patient level. 12 I'd only taken some introductory science at UVA, I didn't do well. 14 I was a goof off.  I was one of my high school valedictorians, I was at the very top with the 4.0 plus something. 7, 14 I used that as a reason to goof off for first semester in college. 6, 7, 13, 14, 16 I had the 2.2 GPA to prove it.  It was that time I took Chemistry and it was impenetrable to me.  When you only study one day a week lots of things were going to be impenetrable. 15, 16 The poly exclusion principle of up and down arrows for the electron orbitals. 20 I thought, ""Who can understand these orbitals and quantum theory and stuff."" 17, 18, 20 Then you realize later on when you took it again, one goes up one goes down.  You just count.  You don't have to figure it out.  They figured it out you just have to do your little exercise. 5, 20 In any case, the idea came to me that maybe that science wouldn't be as bad if I actually studied. 5, 7, 17 I went back to school. 7 I did part time work. 9 I actually worked retail, I worked at Circuit City. 7 Circuit  City existed at that time.  I worked at Circuit City as a sales associate.  I took the science classes part time at a nearby university that was just a commuter. 5, 7, 9 George Mason is not well known outside the D.C. area; George Mason University is in northern Virginia. 8, 11, 12 It has a fairly large student body because a great many of George Mason students are commuters. 9, 20 They're getting more education while they live and work. 14, 15 I took the Chemistry, the Organic Chemistry, the Physics, some math, Biology.  I did very well because when you sort of get this idea when you studied, ""Oh, it isn't that hard."" 9 When you've got purpose.  I treated it like a job. 11, 12 I had a leg up over the eighteen or nineteen year olds who were kind of goofing off like I was years earlier. 14, 15 AS: By this point you're twenty-four?  It took a couple years to get it done. 11, 14 You can't take Organic Chemistry until you take Biology and regular Chemistry.  That set you back.  It took like two and a half years to get that done. 8, 14 I studied for the medical college admission test. 7, 14 I aced that.  I found out I had aptitude for science so I did it.  I applied to medical school and got in. 7, 14 CJ: I went to the Medical College of Virginia which is in Richmond, Virginia which is the home of Phillip Morris Tobacco and former capitol of the Confederacy. 14 They really never got over that. 16, 18 They still haven't gotten over that.  It's not Martin Luther King Jr. Day there it is Lee Jackson King Day.  As in Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and the civil rights guy. 8, 12, 16 Civil War, Civil War, Civil Rights.  It's actually not called the Medical College of Virginia anymore; it's called the Virginia Commonwealth School of Medicine. 7, 14 There was always a relationship between those two but they just made it more explicit. 18, 19 What I'm saying is if you go looking for the Medical College of Virginia you're going to get redirected to VCU. 5, 14, 18 I went to MCV from 1996 to 2000.  After 2000, in that last year, I decided I wanted to do emergency medicine. 12, 14, 18 Hennepin County Medical 14 Center was at the top of my list of places to go.  Hennepin County Medical 14 Center was one of the top five, certainly top ten training programs for emergency medicine in the country. 8, 12, 14, 17, 19 I was a good medical student. 7, 10, 14 I wasn't top ten percent but I was top quarter.  On the board exams I was top ten percent in the board exams.  I knew my stuff. 16 I was lucky enough to match at Hennepin. 8 That's what brought me to Minneapolis and I haven't left. 14 I did my emergency medicine residency in Hennepin County, graduated 2003. 7, 9, 12, 14 Then practiced full time emergency medicine at St. Louis Park Methodist Hospital. 12, 14 That's sort of the arc of how I got here.  AS: How did you get into this work around addiction or opioids? 6, 12, 13, 14 CJ: How did I get into work with opioids? 6, 13 AS: How did you get into that?  CJ: It began at Hennepin County in the sense that we saw a lot of chemical dependency there. 13 They had sort of a program where you keep a look out for known people that are suspicious for this or that behavior. 9, 11, 12 But you kind of blow it off a bit in the sense that it’s a county hospital with a county population. 8, 10, 19, 20 You’ve got lots of minorities. 16 Not just minorities but people from terrible family backgrounds, absent fathers, prison fathers, single moms, mothers are gone, grandmothers are raising the kids. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 Lots of pathologic family structures that lead to dysfunctional behavior. 9, 12, 15 I saw a lot of abuse of drugs like heroin. 5, 6, 13, 16 Also drugs like oxycodone, OxyContin, Vicodin, all that stuff. 5, 6, 8 Coming and looking for pain pills. 6 I was like, this is so absurd, “When I get out of here then I’ll get back to doing what I’m supposed to be doing.”  Then I went to Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park.  They’re the patients from St. Louis Park, from Minnetonka, and Edina.  You realize, “Oh.  Suburban people are looking for oxycodone, OxyContin, Vicodin, Dilauded. 9 It isn’t just the inner city.  It is the suburbs, it’s everywhere.”  AS: Was it pretty soon before you realized that? 10 CJ: It was within the first year. 14 You couldn’t go a shift without seeing it. 6, 8 Someone who had a “chronic pain exacerbation.” 6 They’d have a diagnosis of chronic pain. 6 You’d look at their chart they’re on oxycodone plus OxyContin plus oxycodone for breakthrough.  They would come and say they were helping a friend move and helping a friend move is apparently the most dangerous thing you can do because apparently the friend will drop the other end of the couch, you’ll pull your back out and now you’ve got a pain exacerbation. 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20 AS: They might have on their record chronic pain as a diagnosis? 6, 14 CJ: Yes.  AS: Then they come in for pain exacerbation. 6 CJ: Right.  AS: Which means they’re just looking for more meds.  CJ: Something flared up their...something stronger, something to temporarily boost them up now. 5, 12 Something flared it. 5 Chronic pain exacerbation became the bane of my existence. 6 It was the bane of everyone’s existence.  It got to the point where you couldn’t go a shift without it. 8 Usually you’d see more than one. 6 It was almost comical how often it was helping a friend move. 15, 20 You can see where if you’re trying to generate sympathy. 6 They’re just being a good friend. 10, 20 “I was trying to help my friend. 20 I didn’t want this.  I would otherwise be stable and fine. 11, 12 I was just trying to be a good friend.” 10, 20 Granted you can’t disprove whether than actually happened or not. 7, 15 It was a story that could generate sympathy. 15 AS: The fact that it got passed around and repeated.  CJ: It was repeated so frequently by that population.  It was suspicious.  It was certainly suspicious. 8, 17 What happened is maybe a year, two years of this, you’d see the same patients back again with another exacerbation for something. 5, 6, 14, 15 This time maybe they were in a car accident, someone rear ended them, it wasn’t their fault then either. 5, 13 “I didn’t ask them to rear end me.”  They don’t have an accident report. 13 “No we didn’t call the cops.”  Whatever incident was immune to disconfirmation.  They were there for flare up.  At that time the flare ups are treated, we were being told that pain is a disease, pain is the fifth vital sign, opiates aren’t really that addictive. 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18 They were getting multiple doses of Dilaudid in the emergency department. 9, 12, 17, 19 They would be there for about three or four hours. 15 After about three doses you’d ask them, “Hey can you go home now?” 12 Maybe you got an x-ray if they looked like something really serious might have happened. 11, 15, 18 Usually you didn’t have to.  They get two or three doses of Dilaudid.  Either they’d say they could go home or they’d get admitted.  They’d go home with another prescription or they get admitted, they’d stay for three days and then they’d go home with another prescription. 10, 16 Then they’d be back.  You would see that this was, the patients weren’t getting better. 6 They keep cycling through.  It was frustrating for us as doctors because they’re often very demanding patients. 9, 12, 14 They require a lot of nursing staff to keep going in there.  You’ve got other people to see. 6, 9 You’ve got the heart failure patients, you’ve got the COPD patients, you’ve got the septic patients, you’ve got febrile seizures. 9, 14 You’ve got other things to do.  The patients weren’t getting off their meds, they were staying on them and they were coming in with more flare ups. 7 What clinical progress are we seeing with them? 6 It was frustrating for the doctors. 12, 14 This is not interesting medicine. 12, 14, 17 It’s making my job harder to deal with this other stuff. 9, 10, 11 Invariably they can be very demanding patients that are difficult to get along with but you must be nice to them so they give you a good performance review. 9, 10, 14, 18 They became very stressful; you want to get customer satisfaction surveys to go very well. 7 The hospital wants to make sure you make everyone happy and they pay their bill on time and pay their bill in full. 8, 14, 18 It wasn’t good for the hospital in the sense that when these people get admitted they wouldn’t be compensated for the second or third day. 8, 9, 10, 14, 16 They might be compensated for one day. 16 The hospital’s losing money with these prolonged admissions of people who won’t leave but they won’t take the step of just kicking them out the door. 8, 9, 10, 17, 18 No one’s benefiting. 8, 15 The patients aren’t getting better, the doctors are frustrated, the hospital is losing money. 8, 10, 12, 14 I decided, I think it was 2005, I’m going to do something about it. 14 At that point I decided to contact the pain clinics in the area. 6, 8, 14 I spoke to the Britton Center, I went to MAPS in Edina, I went to United Hospital and spoke to Dr. Hesse.  I spoke to Dr. Belgrade. 5 I spoke Dr. Matthew Monsein.  I independently set up interviews with all these medical directors on my own and started talking to them. 7, 14, 18, 19 AS: On your own time?  CJ: Just on my own time and did it.  I found out later it was weird.  Most people don’t do that. 9 What’s this thirty-five-year-old doctor doing investigating pain clinics and figuring out what the hell are we doing wrong? 6, 11, 12, 14 This doesn’t make any sense.  AS: But they talked to you.  CJ: They talked to me.  They were happy to talk to me. 18 No other ER doctor, no one else asked them. 8, 12, 14 I told them what we’re seeing here. 6, 16 They said, “You need to have some sort of a policy, some sort of universal way of approaching these patients.” 18 That’s when I went to Methodist Hospital which was Park Nicollet, now it’s Health Partners. 12 It was Park Nicollet at that time.  I contacted risk management and said, “Hey look. 12 Everyone’s seeing this problem. 6, 12 The hospitals are furious. 8 It’s in everyone’s interest to get a committee together.” 8 We put together this chronic pain committee at Park Nicollet. 6, 8 Then I spent the next four years from 2005 to 2009 meeting every few months. 11, 14, 16, 18 I was a pain in the ass to them. 6 There’s no money to be made. 8, 10 AS: You’re just asking them to come before work or after work.  CJ: Or in the middle of work to meet and talk about this and what should we do and put together this. 7, 8, 18 It’s not making them money. 8, 10 It’s not going to make Park Nicollet money. 8, 10 AS: Who were the people who were on this committee? 9 CJ: Risk management was there; the director of the hospital service was often there. 8, 12, 18, 19 AS: You pulled those people together from the hospital. 8, 9, 11 CJ: From the hospital, the clinic system. 8 AS: You were trying to work within the hospital setting that you were in to make a change. 8 CJ: To make a change, to have a universal policy that we could all abide by.  The pain doctors said, “This is entirely appropriate.” 6, 12, 14 I brought that to them.  It took four years. 14 A few months go by and nobody does anything and then you see another chronic pain patient. 6, 11, 16 Then I fire off another angry email, “Oh hey. 11 Just checking on how we’re doing.  Just saw a patient.  Could have used this policy.” 6, 13, 16 After four years we eventually did come up with this policy about opiates and how we use them for chronic pain and how we would not do IV opiates for chronic pain exacerbations unless we found an objective new injury. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16 AS: That’s the Dilaudid that you’re speaking about?  CJ: The IV Dilaudid I was talking about.  You stay there.  CJ: If you have chronic back pain you came with a back pain flare. 6 Usually we just did IV Dilaudid but we’re not doing that anymore unless there’s a new kidney stone, okay. 8, 16 You’re back flared up again, no. 5 You’re going to get two tablets of whatever it is you normally take. 16 Two Vicodin or two Percocet.  You’re not going to be admitted for pain medicine. 6, 12, 14 If you feel you couldn’t go home safely, like “Oh I can’t walk.” 16 You’ll be admitted.  You’re still only going to get two more tablets, whatever your scheduled dose is.  You’re not going to get hooked up to the IV, here you go.  If you want to stay because you feel unsafe we’ll keep you because you’re unsafe.  You’d be amazed at how few people wanted to stay in the hospital when that was the policy. 8, 9, 18 They left. 14 They got up in a huff and stormed out of the ER with amazing speed for someone with that critical amount of back pain they were in. 6, 9, 14 That dramatically changed how the hospital functioned, having that policy. 5, 8, 9, 13 It didn’t change how difficult it was in the ER because the patients would still come in looking for this. 10 It helped the hospitals because they wouldn’t be admitted. 8 AS: You were still on the front lines dealing with people and having them be mad. 9 CJ: The hospital would never put out signs in the waiting room saying, “This is how we treat chronic pain.” 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16 They never did that. 16 They want you to register.  Once they register you they generate a bill.  Once they generate a bill they get money. 8, 10 They didn’t want to turn away any customers.  They didn’t want anything that would dissuade them from registering.  That’s not their reasoning.  “We don’t want to miss anything.”  AS: Something else could be wrong. 11 CJ: What happened is admissions for chronic pain went down to almost zero. 6, 15 These patients weren’t interested in coming in for what they could do at home. 14 AS: Can you describe who these patients are?  What’s their kind of demographic?  CJ: They’re middle aged, they’re in their forties. 7 Thirties to fifties.  Twenties is more like, it’s hard to have a chronic pain diagnosis at twenty. 6, 9, 14 Late thirties to early fifties would be it.  AS: Men, women? 12 CJ: More women than men even. 12 AS: Middle class? 7 CJ: Middle class people. 7, 9 AS: Mostly white in St. Louis Park? 19 CJ: Yes.  You’d still get minorities.  It was never Hispanic. 16 Hispanics hardly every have chronic pain. 6, 9 You have African Americans, but I don’t any more than just their normal percentage of the population. 16 AS: I’ve read something about this, I can’t remember what it is.  CJ: African American doesn’t mean you don’t have the chronic pain and all that stuff. 6 You’d see very few Asians, very few Hispanics with the chronic pain diagnosis. 6 It was mostly Caucasians. 12 That was the demographic.  Once the pain policy went into effect the admissions went almost to zero. 6 They would still come into the ER.  We don’t want to dissuade anyone from registering.  It didn’t make the ER jobs easier because you’d still have unpleasant conversations. 11 You used to do that.” 6, 13, 16 The truth is even after that I would see chart of my partners, even with this policy, they didn’t want the argument. 6, 9, 12 They would just be here, IV some more to go.  AS: Say that again?  CJ: Even some of my partners in the ER. 9, 12 AS: Would choose not to follow the policy? 10 CJ: Would just ignore the policy and would do what was easy.  AS: They didn’t want the conflict.  CJ: They don’t want the conflict; they want to make sure they still get a good performance review. 10, 14 AS: They don’t have to follow it. 10 CJ: There’s no teeth behind it.  There’s no punishment if you don’t. 12 AS: It’s a recommendation. 12 CJ: If you wanted to show the patient you could show a little letter. 18, 20 There’s nothing forcing you to follow it. 10 There was no punishment if you didn’t. 12 There’s no enforcement, there’s no teeth. 8, 12, 13 It was very much ignorable.  I only came across this because patients would come in, I wouldn’t do that, and they’d say, “Hey the last time I was here a month ago I got this.” 13, 16 I go, “Really?”  Then I would look it up.  Sure enough.  That’s exactly what happened. 15 AS: Did you confront your colleagues about this?  CJ: That’s a tough thing to do.  They’ll say, “This person was in tears.  They gave a good mechanism, I thought something was really wrong.” 10, 11, 17, 18 What are you going to say to that?  AS: That’s you questioning their decision as a doctor. 12, 14 You’re jeopardizing a partnership and a friendship to bring that up. 9, 12, 16, 20 AS: That is intense.  CJ: Hold on one second.  [pause]. 6, 13 People are reluctant to approach their physician partners and say, “What the hell were you doing?” 9, 12 They also didn’t want to get a negative performance review. 14 They don’t have any exceptions for that.  That would still go in your file.  There were still incentives to get it done.  Make them happy, get them out. 18 CJ: Around 2009.  Granted some partners were very good about that. 9, 10, 12 They knew what would happen. 15, 16 It gets that conflict over easy but then you’ve incentivized them coming back. 14 At least half, more than half did use the policy. 6, 13, 14 There were certainly handfuls of those who would not do it. 8, 17 AS: How many doctors are we talking about? 12, 14 CJ: The department group that I was in was probably about twenty docs. 9, 12, 14, 19 To staff all the shifts, it was around twenty docs. 8, 14 Most of them were good about it. 10 None of them went through the effort that I went through but they were all frustrated with how things were going. 8 They were frustrated.  They were good about it. 10 They would be frustrated with their partners when they wouldn’t do the policy because they knew they could expect to see them back. 6, 9, 12, 16 AS: The repeat behavior ends up proving that the policy might be necessary, it might be a useful thing. 6, 13, 18 CJ: It wasn’t enforced, there were no teeth behind it, it wasn’t universal. 8 It didn’t stop anyone.  All it takes is one or two, the patient’s like, “I might get it. 17 Might as well go in and see.” 6 For a patient who is dependent on these medicines. 12, 14 That’s the most important thing they’ve got to do that day. 9, 16 They have nothing they’re going to do.  There’s this asymmetry.  As a practicing physician you’ve got all these other patients.  You’re responsible for them. 16 This person’s going to try to take up all your time, is going to wear you down, is going to make things unpleasant, get the nursing in here to try to make it not worth your while to fight them anymore.  That would happen a lot. 15 It would also be especially compelling when they would bring their kids in.  When they bring their children in the pain doctors that I met over at the clinics had a word for that. 5, 6, 12, 14, 20 They were called props.  When you bring the kids in it sends that added message.  “You’re not only making me suffer but how am 10 I going to take of my kid in this pain?” 6 You’re harming them too.  That’s extra pressure they bring. 10 AS: You’re in a compassionate field.  CJ: Your default is to trust.  Your default is to care for and relieve suffering. 19 AS: Do you need to stop?  This person forgot that I was doing this.  2009 ongoing there was still that battle.  We had support but it wasn’t great support. 20 What I had hoped to see with that policy was the number of chronic pain patients go down to like zero. 6, 9 The word would get out.  That policy became my department policy but became department policy for all of EMPA, which is the largest emergency medicine group in the Twin Cities. 9, 12, 14, 19 It’s not large, large but it’s like six hospitals. 8 It became their policy.  Then it became the policy for the American Emergency Physicians, Minnesota Chapter.  This goes to show you that look, if you have a policy without enforcement who cares? 8, 12, 13, 19 Drunk driving is against the law but what happens? 5, 8, 13, 14, 15 We tell you not to do it again.  We penalize your license. 13 You’d have to be caught drunk driving twenty times before anything happened. 5, 8, 14, 15 Who cares that it’s against the law? 13, 19 Behavior doesn’t change.  The policy really never changed behavior that much. 13, 16, 18 The only thing that policy did was it helped the hospitalists because these patients wouldn’t be admitted. 8 Even with this policy the patients kept coming in.  As you can see, deaths haven’t changed. 6, 13, 18 The curve for opiate use and overdose and admissions, nothing changed really. 6, 13, 18 AS: It wasn’t saving lives.  CJ: It was doing some minor thing for hospital function but no real change was happening. 8, 9, 15 AS: Was it your intention to save lives at that point? 10 What that in your awareness? 9 CJ: I had thought there was a multi-pronged benefit to this. 15, 17, 18 The chronic pain patients weren’t getting better so this would help them. 6 The doctors were being extremely frustrated and burned out with all this so it’d help them. 12, 14 The hospitals were losing money so it would help them. 8, 10 I thought all would benefit. 15, 17, 18 It turns out really only the admissions, that’s all that really happened from this. 15, 18 They were still coming in, the doctors were frustrated, the patients weren’t getting any better. 12, 14 AS: They were just finding other ways to get their drugs. 5, 6, 18 CJ: Right.  After doing that, it was 2012 they were still having these meetings. 18 “Is there something else we can do?”  We’re having occasional talks about the chronic pain committee. 6 But a lot of these chronic pain committees after these policies went into effect was how do we make sure patients are comfortable coming out of anesthesia? 6 Making sure the chronic pain patients have enough pain medication after surgery so they’re comfortable. 6, 14 What are we talking about?  Why are we not talking about we have to get this massive population off these medicines? 12, 14 We’re talking about making sure they’re safe and monitored after surgery. 5, 10 Basically, there was some safety regarding that but mostly it was make sure the customer’s happy. 12, 18, 19 If you look in terms of how things are practiced. 17 If you think the ultimate paradigm is make sure the customer’s satisfied with their experience. 18 You will find that explains much of medical behavior. 7, 14 AS: The patient customer, together the two words. 8 CJ: The buzzword in the industry was the patient experience. 18 You want the patient to have a good experience. 10, 18 You just take the term customer and replace it with patient. 17 The customer experience. 18 Just swap them out.  The patient experience is the word in the industry for measuring how well you’re doing. 18 It is not patient outcome.  That is not the measure for how things are going.  If you’re measuring patient outcome with pain meds and opiates we’re doing terribly. 6 There’s more and more prescriptions coming out, more and more people becoming dependent, more people going into treatment. 9, 10, 12, 13 People are dying.  If you’re measuring it by outcomes you’re doing awful and you’ve been doing awful for years. 11, 14 I talk about this in the articles, I’ll send them to you so you can review them. 14 If you look at what governs how medicine is practiced in terms of what would make the most business sense you will find that is a streamlining paradigm to understanding how medicine behaves. 12, 14, 17, 18 AS: How’s that for you as a physician?  CJ: I feel that there’s been a great bait and switch. 20 We have the Hippocratic oath, we got the little white jacket, the health of the patient is the paradigm of everything. 19, 20 There’s no data saying even back surgeries are helping. 13 Back surgeries however make half a million dollars for one procedure.  It is cash money. 8, 10 Hospitals have spine centers.  Look at what’s serviced out there. 19 Is it mental health? 12, 19 Why do you think there’s heart and vascular centers everywhere? 9 Stents pay money. 8, 10 There’s actually very little data that stents do anything. 7, 13, 20 If you’re in immediate heart attack it helps. 9 It helps a small like three percent of the population that has what is called Severe Left Mane Disease which is the main artery coming out of the heart. 9 Unless you have Severe Left Mane Disease for your heart or if you’re in the middle of an acute infraction but if you just have chest pain from exertion relieved by rest that’s typical anginal pain. 6, 7, 9 A stint isn’t going to do anything.  It isn’t going to make you live any longer. 17 The only thing it’s says is it might improve your pain for about two years and then there’s no difference. 6, 14 Vascular centers and stents make huge dough.  You can throw a rock and hit them. 14 You can’t find a mental health clinic. 12, 19 You won’t find these other services which are neglected because they don’t pay. 19 AS: They’re nothing about technology.  CJ: As I’m doing all this chronic pain stuff I’m also observing this about how medicine is functioning and it increasingly looks like is the patient what they’re really thinking about or are they thinking about them? 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 They’re thinking about them.  The patient care is the means through which to maximize what’s benefitting them. 15, 19 It’s not like doing a stent doesn’t involve patients.  It isn’t like their number one outcome is what they’re thinking about.  AS: It’s for profit. 15 CJ: If it’s not for profit it’s for revenue. 15 Some hospitals are not for profit. 8, 15 AS: Of course they are technically.  You’ve probably studied this.  You just don’t have shareholders but you have business interest that you answer to and high salaries you try to pay. 7, 20 They know that very well. 12 If you look and see what you see all over the place is what’s paid for which is cancer centers, imaging centers, heart and vascular centers, neuro centers, even eating disorders, those pay. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14 AS: Even the addiction treatment centers and the recovery centers. 12, 13, 14 CJ: Those pay and you can hire cheap labor.  AS: People will keep coming back.  CJ: They don’t get well permanently.  I’ve seen the data especially with the opioids. 6, 13 I’ve seen it get worse and worse and worse. 6 I thought there would be this human cry from the medical profession, we’ve got to put a stop to this. 7, 14, 17, 18, 19 As you’ve seen it’s been very tepid. 6 You’re not seeing people up in arms. 6, 9 “Oh it’s so sad but you don’t want to cut off the people who need their medicines. 9, 12, 14 You don’t want to have them suffer.”  AS: They’re starting to feel like bad people now. 9, 12 CJ: It’s always these measured tones of “We’re not really doing that bad a job. 5, 8, 11, 18 You can’t make these people go through that.” 9 If you look at from a standpoint of you want to keep your customer happy that makes sense. 13, 18 That has been spurring my research not into just pain but also into medicine as a business. 6, 12, 14 I’ve done quite a bit of reading on that. 20 I think the American system is fundamentally broken. 8, 12 If it really had the patient in mind the opioid epidemic would have been fixed a long time ago. 13, 17, 18 It still isn’t.  AS: It’s rising.  It’s not even falling yet.  CJ: What do you see in the news? 6, 15, 16 You see we need more funding for treatment. 6, 12, 13 It’s a very consoling answer because medicine creates the problem and sells more medicine to solve the problem. 12, 14 AS: By medicine do you mean medication assisted treatment? 12, 13, 14 CJ: Medicated assisted therapy which is better than leaving untreated but they’re not doing what I advocate when I do all my talks. 12, 14 Stop writing for these medicines in the first place. 12, 14 Cut down drastically exposure. 5 Just like you have to smoke more than one cigarette to become addicted to tobacco, more exposure equals higher risk. 7, 12, 14, 17 You need to drastically reduce the amount of pain medicines that you are exposing the populations to. 5, 6, 12, 14 AS: This is just something that physicians can do.  More people are overdosing on prescription pain pills than heroin. 6, 9, 10, 16 CJ: Four out of five people who abuse heroin now started on pills. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 You understand how it started with OxyContin right? 12, 17, 18 You’ve done all the research knowing that the opioid and heroin epidemic was not an accident. 12, 13, 16 This was engineering, this was engineered by deliberate pharmacy campaign in the mid to late 90s with the introduction of OxyContin to persuade the medical community that chronic pain is an undertreated epidemic characterized by needless suffering. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 Opioids are safe and the risk of addiction has been greatly exaggerated. 12, 14, 20 What were these long acting opioids used for primarily beforehand? 6, 13, 16, 17 Hospice patients mostly. 12 AS: Hospice and surgery recovery in hospital. 8 CJ: Acute injury in hospital and hospice patients but not back pain. 6, 8 Back pain doesn’t suddenly cure. 6 Back pain’s an ongoing thing. 6 You don’t take oral heroin ongoing for back pain. 6, 16 That’s what happened. 15 You can’t get rich on hospice patients.  You can make billions if you suddenly for every arthritis patient and every back pain patient you get them on these medicines which those things don’t go away, bulging disk and what have you. 6, 12, 14, 18, 20 It’s just the back version of arthritis.  Those things are lifelong. 10, 17 It’s a perfect drug for pharmacy. 5, 6, 17 They don’t want to do antibiotics which you take for two weeks and are done. 8, 15 They want you to invent a drug that you’re on for the rest of your life. 5, 6, 10 Lipitor, number one drug of all time. 5, 6 There’s not great data that says Lipitor helps anyone in the average population. 13, 20 It’s multi billions.  They pay physician leaders.  Cardiologists or the pain specialist at the Beth Israel Hospitals and Harvard recruit and pay the physician leaders at some of the top departments. 6, 9, 12, 19 Have them sort of fudge the data or find ways to manipulate the data. 13, 18 Spread the message down to the rest of us. 10 We don’t have time to go back and reduplicate all these studies. 5 We have to function with a level of trust like we do in all society. 9, 12 We trust that they’re giving us good information. 10 Porter and Jick.  AS: It wasn’t even a study.  CJ: It wasn’t a study it was a paragraph.  AS: It was a paragraph in a letter to the editor.  CJ: It was a five sentence paragraph. 5 It was an observation.  Observations are useful in that they often can lead to studies. 6, 13, 18 AS: That was a level of trust, coming back to the idea of trusting you colleagues with what their research is.  You reach a level of professionalism and you want to respect their opinion.  Of course you’re not going to go back and recheck everything.  CJ: Are you going to do every study about every condition?  You can’t be a sceptic because you don’t have time.  You’re taking care of people in pain. 6, 9, 11, 19 CJ: You have to trust that there is a code of ethics and rigorous scientific skepticism and that the population you’re intending to use these medicines for, chronic pain patients, you’ve tested it on that population. 6, 12, 13, 14 With Porter and Jick they tested on hospitalized patients briefly. 8, 19 AS: And said who was addicted? 12, 14 Who got addicted? 12, 14 One lady.  CJ: You got morphine after a fracture and you were likely to be okay.  We knew that. 16 It’s suspicious.  That letter to the editor was 1980.  Suddenly sixteen years later? 14 Now it’s evidence that opiates aren’t addictive? 14 AS: For Purdue Pharma.  CJ: That could only change the medical culture if they could coopt and manipulate physicians and they did that, paid them well. 7, 14 I’m very critical of my own profession that we are as vulnerable as we are to having our mission compromised by money. 8, 10 I can reach no other conclusion based on what I’ve studied and learned. 10, 13 That’s what happened. 15 The culture was changed. 13 Pain became the fifth vital sign. 11 The risks of opiates were exaggerated.  The prescriptions if you’ve seen the numbers went from like eighty million in 1992 to over two hundred and fifty million now. 6, 10, 12 You can just watch in lock step as the number of prescriptions went up. 10, 17 AS: So did the deaths. 18 CJ: So did the deaths, so did treatment admissions. 12, 13, 18 Which tells you another thing. 15 I say this in my lectures.  Traditionally addiction is a moral issue. 12, 13, 14 Here’s where I strongly disagree with the recovery community that uses terms like character defect and moral inventory. 6, 13, 17, 19 What an extraordinary thing that as marketing and sales changed and sales increased. 5, 13 At the same time, you had a dramatic increase in the number of immoral people in this country. 5, 9, 19 AS: Which huge character flaws. 13 CJ: With huge character flaws. 13 Who knew? 16 What a coincidence.  Right when you started throwing all these prescriptions and here’s five tablets, here’s thirty. 10 AS: And now we blame parents, parents blame themselves. 12, 20 It’s a perfect storm. 17 You can blame poverty.  There’s all these things that you can blame without having to look at what actually happened. 7, 15 CJ: Everyone should recognize too; the reasons these medicines do anything is your brain has a receptor for it. 12, 13, 14, 17 Your body makes morphine.  That’s what endorphins are.  Endorphin is just a contraction of the two words endogenous, meaning made from within, morphine. 10, 19 Endorphines or endorphins.  Your brain makes these chemicals. 13 In physiological doses, not pharmacologic doses.  Your brain doesn’t want you to be that happy all the time. 13, 18 AS: You’ve got stuff to do.  CJ: Giggling like an idiot all the time isn’t good for survival. 10 You need to be worried about is it too damn cold?  Do we have enough water? 16 Am I going to get eaten?  The state of the brain that helps survival is what evolution selected for. 13 It’s not giggling like an idiot all the time or that’s where we’d be.  AS: Or blissed out.  CJ: If you’re blissed out you’re not worried enough.  That’s not good for survival. 10 AS: You’re bait.  CJ: The brain doesn’t actually want you to be that happy all the time. 7, 13, 18 It wants you to be happy in selective situations and rewards them. 18 It doesn’t want you to be happy all the time. 18 What these chemicals do, you realize “I can be happy all the time. 13, 18 This is awesome.  I’m happy all the time.” 18 The brain pushes back. 13 The brain realizes, the brain wants homeostasis. 13 That’s a term in medicine that means the brain wants stability. 12, 13, 14, 17 It doesn’t want to be there.  The brain pushes back. 13 The brain stops reacting so well. 13 You take that medicine the next time, “That was nice but it wasn’t really quite as nice as the time before.” 11, 12, 14, 18 The reasons these medicines work is they cause an increase in dopamine in your brain’s reward center. 6, 12, 13, 14 That’s simplified but it’s a basic enough chemistry for most purposes. 15 It causes the release of dopamine, you feel euphoric, you feel awesome, “Why I shouldn’t I feel like that all the time?” 6, 13 That’s what leads people to keep going. 9 I can be happy all the time, who wouldn’t want that. 18 The brain pushes back. 13 Suddenly it doesn’t release so much dopamine.  It down regulates its receptors.  The morphine is there but there’s no receptor for it to bind to. 10 That’s what happens when people use it for a while. 6, 9, 13, 15 When you start to alter the brain’s chemistry you alter its receptors, you alter its circuitry, you’re in real trouble. 13, 15 Now when you stop using the medicine all together the brain says, “Alright this is not good. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14 This is not good. 10 I don’t feel good.” 10 Because the normal physiologic morphine, you’ve kind of switched it off. 10, 16 The brains notices, “Where the hell is my morphine?” 10, 13 Because you’ve stopped making it. 10 Just as a body builder who takes testosterone their testicles shrink. 8, 17 The body says, “Why am I wasting all this metabolic energy making testosterone when I’m just getting it from the environment.” 8, 10, 12 So the testicles shrink.  Same thing happens in the brain. 13, 15 It realizes if it’s getting all this from the environment there’s no reason to make it myself. 12 When patients who are using these medicines and take it for a long time have completely distorted their brain chemistry you can’t just stop it because once you just stop it they feel awful. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 I can put you, me, you put all of us on it for around the clock for two months you will not feel good if we suddenly say no. 10, 11, 16 That is enough to change your brain chemistry. 13, 15 That’s the issue. 13 It’s not even just an issue for chronic pain. 6, 13 Obviously chronic pain, guaranteed, since chronic pain never goes away you’re going to be on these medicines for at least three months. 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 That’s plenty of time to change your chemistry. 15 Now you’re on it for good. 10 AS: Then your pain comes back and you feel bad. 6 CJ: It doesn’t feel like I’m addicted it just feels like my pain came back. 6, 12, 14 I’ve got to get back on.  Withdrawal is painful. 5, 6 People coming off heroin say they feel awful, they’re in pain everywhere. 6, 11, 16 Being on these medicines for chronic pain almost guarantees they’re going to be on it for life. 6, 10, 12, 14 Three months is plenty of time. 11, 16 It even is concerning when they have an acute injury like a surgery or something like that.  Even if you have a knee replacement or have this bad fracture. 12 It’s not like the brain says, “Oh well I’m not going to adjust to these medicines because look you broke your bone.” 8, 12, 13, 14 It will still start to change over time.  AS: Your brain will. 13 CJ: Your brain doesn’t care that your leg is broken, therefore I won’t respond to these medicines in a normal homeostatic reduced responsiveness over time way. 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 Even if you do have a fracture don’t take these medicines for two months. 11, 12, 14, 16 Take it for two weeks and then realize it’s going to hurt while you heal. 15 Then you go back to the customer service thing. 19 AS: It’s been three months and I’m still hurting. 11, 16 CJ: I didn’t pay for this.  How expensive health care is makes it worse too because when you’re paying so much for healthcare, you expect “I should have zero suffering in this.” 14, 19 AS: But that’s a cultural construct about pain and money. 6, 8, 10 If we have more money we’re paying a lot for something we should be getting something really good. 8, 10, 14, 18 It’s understandable in our cultural context. 17, 18 CJ: You’re a paying customer and medicine in general has encouraged this. 12, 14 AS: Then the hospital calls you and refers to you as the customer. 8, 16 CJ: We sell you the idea that your health is a commodity to be bought and paid for. 19 That we can provide you as the health care industry rather than something that is primarily and always has been your own. 18, 19 Health care can maybe be about fifteen percent of your health outcome. 5, 19 The other things are diet and your ability to keep active.  If you don’t keep active your body ages and gets worse.  AS: Where we ever got the idea that we can’t be in pain, that we can’t have pain. 6 CJ: And you should have a great night sleep every night and you should always have sex like you’re eighteen. 12, 16, 18, 20 These are all things that are kind of a denial that the human condition is to age and things don’t go so well. 19 They’re meant not to go well on purpose.  For evolution to work you can’t have infinitely long lived organisms. 7, 17 That’s how mutation and evolution changes over time and the genes happen. 6, 15 You have to have temporary organisms and beings and humans otherwise change won’t happen. 15, 19 Evolution builds in the temporariness which is insulting to us as conscious beings.  I’m so awesome I should be here forever.  I should be able to do what I want forever until I decide I’m done. 14 That contributes to this issue. 13 You hear things like life is too short to be in pain. 6, 9, 10, 18 I’m like, “Life is too short for me not to be ecstatically happy all the time and for there not to be wizards and magic like Harry Potter.” 18 CJ: In a fourteen-billion-year old universe and I get like eighty, maybe if I’m hopeful. 5, 9, 14 Yes.  You get a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of an instant.  Yes, you can justify.  The truth is evolution and life don’t care. 10, 19 When you try to manipulate your brain and you try to manipulate your experience usually things don’t go well. 13, 18 AS: I’m going to pause for a second. 6, 13 I need to use the bathroom. 6, 13, 14 [Pause] 6, 13 AS: Okay.  We’re back.  CJ: When I speak about selling medical assisted therapy as consoling to medicine it’s because you still get to sell more medicine. 7, 12, 14 More importantly you don’t cross pharma. 9 In other words, prevention. 10, 19 Reducing the amount of prescriptions, reducing the market share for these medicines there is very serious opposition to them. 5, 10, 11, 12, 14 AS: For reducing the opiate prescriptions? 5, 10, 14 CJ: Right.  Instead of two hundred and fifty million prescriptions go back to like eighty million. 10 Cut it by like two thirds.  That’s a lot less many.  AS: The resistance is from pharma.  CJ: It would also be from the physicians who just write these medicines. 12, 14 AS: When you say medication assisted treatment are you talking about things like methadone. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 CJ: What I’m saying is methadone, Suboxone that’s why you hear politicians mostly talk about that. 6, 8, 9, 12 Access to treatment. 12, 13 They don’t talk about reducing prescriptions on the other sides. 5, 9, 10, 14 I’m saying that it’s a politically expedient answer, to increase funding for medical assisted therapy which does say lives. 7, 12, 14 AS: We’re going to open more methadone clinics.  CJ: We’re going to address the opioid epidemic by increasing access to treatment. 5, 9, 12, 13 AS: But we’re not going to restrict…  CJ: We’re not going to turn down the faucet.  AS: I absolutely agree.  And reduce exposure of the population. 5, 14 AS: It’s a total ruse. 6, 13 CJ: Which is my focus.  AS: Your work is on reducing the opioids. 5, 6, 13, 14 CJ: There’s no reason to put people on these medicines. 9, 12, 14 It’s oral heroin. 16 There’s nothing wrong with heroin. 11, 16 You understand heroin is used in the United Kingdom every day in hospitals. 6, 8, 13, 16, 17, 18 It’s called Diamorph for diacetylmorphine.  Perfectly fine. 11 You have a kidney stone you’re going to get two milliliters of Diamorph and you’re going say to the heroin, “Thank you.” 8, 16 But then they’re going to stop.  Don’t take it again.  You use heroin for acute injuries. 6, 13, 16 Dilaudid, we use that all the time, Dilaudid is actually stronger. 6, 7, 13 AS: Fentanyl.  CJ: Fentanyl is even stronger.  This is what infuriates me.  When patients that are on these medicines find that they're not working and need more and are looking to get more. 12, 14 That's called aberrant behavior.  They're violating their contracts. 19 Having these medicines over time do less and less is exactly predicted by homeostasis and what the brain physiology is supposed to do. 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 It isn't the patient breaking the promise.  It's the body doing what's it's designed to do which is respond less and less as the environment changes. 6, 11, 12 It wants to keep a constant environment. 12 They look at that like you've violated your contract. 14, 19 You've committed a crime. 14 Pain contracts have been around for a long time and haven't done a damn thing. 17, 19 CJ: These pain contracts. 6, 19 These agreements haven't done a damn thing. 12 In my view they're a way for physicians to cover themselves. 18 It also always them to not think about it. 18 AS: Think about what they're doing.  CJ: They don't have to think about what they're doing so the patient actually just does their contract. 7, 19 They just go, ""Here you go.""  They don't have to think about it.  The contract has taken over the management of the patient. 12, 19 The document now runs things. 8, 12, 14 That is negligent.  AS: We're getting into Foucault territory.  CJ: It is negligent in my opinion.  You're now letting this document run the care. 8, 12, 14, 19 If they fulfill their little obligations, you give them another ninety-day supply of oral heroin. 5, 13, 16, 20 ""Well this contract says their okay. 19 I'm doing what the contract says now too."" 12, 19 All the while they're going to get worse and worse and worse.  They're getting into higher risk situations with these contracts. 7, 17, 19 Having a contract didn't prevent any people from becoming dependent. 9, 10, 19 They just became dependent with a contract. 19 AS: Where do you see this going? 6 CJ: We didn't finish.  Crossing pharma is a big deal.  Pharma has among the most powerful lobbies. 10, 17 AS: I understand what you're saying now. 12, 17, 18 Crossing pharma.  Like breaking down.  CJ: Like having major policy changes to dramatically reduce the number of pills that are flowing. 5, 6, 10, 14 They don't want that.  AS: It's probably not going to happen is it unless it's legislated. 15 CJ: Or the whole U.S. healthcare system blows up. 10, 19 Here's the thing.  Other countries, Britain for example, they've got the same group of people. 9 They're getting big like we are, they're getting over weight, they're getting arthritis, they've got back pain. 6 They don't die like we die.  They don't use these medicines for chronic pain like we do. 6, 12, 13, 14 AS: Now Purdue, they're going globally.  CJ: They're going to see if they can. 6 They don't have the same customer driven healthcare. 5, 19 They're going to have a harder sell if they know these medicines, they can see what happened in the United States. 6, 9, 12, 14, 15 ""Let's change so we can develop the same problems that are in the United States now."" 12 AS: That's comforting at least.  CJ: I hope. 9 In the British and the National Healthcare Service in Britain they have more data driven stuff. 5, 13, 19 They have the acronym is NICE which stands for National Institute of Clinical Excellence or something.  Their job is basically to see overall is the science being followed. 6, 10, 11, 19 In some cases, the science isn't clear but they do the best they can to make it sort of data driven. 5, 13, 17 They also have fewer surgeries.  They have fewer stents placed.  Can you believe it?  They don't die any younger from heart disease than we do. 9, 20 Even though they have like half or fewer of the stentings than we do. 14 They have more data driven. 5, 13 The prescribe opiates like we used to back in the 80s. 6, 10, 13, 16 AS: They can watch what's happened. 15, 17 CJ: That's how they're functioning right now. 9, 12 They don't have much incentive to change and develop this problem. 12 Given how their systems function either with a single payer or with the National Health Service they don't have an incentive to cause these problems. 6, 9, 12, 13 The tax payer takes responsibility for the patient from the time they're born to the time they die. 14, 17 It's in the tax payers interest not to cause opiate use disorder and treatment admissions. 6, 12, 13 That is not in their interests.  They have different economic incentives.  They can try to export it but the United States being as customer and business oriented as we are we are more vulnerable to that.  Honestly I think the opioid crisis is kind of a litmus test. 8, 13, 14 If the U.S.  healthcare industry can cause this problem and permit it to exist and hurt this many people, and kill this many people in flagrant disregard of the science and the oath. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 Does it deserve to exist?  AS: Does the system as it exists deserve to exist?  CJ: You could make a very strong case that if you can create and permit to persist the greatest public health issue that kills sixteen to nineteen thousand Americans per year then either one of two things. 13, 14, 17, 19, 20 Either you blow the system up or actually tell the medical schools stop telling the kids to take the oath. 7, 10, 14, 15 That is not what their loyalty is.  Get rid of that cognitive dissonance. 14 AS: That's chilling.  CJ: Get rid of it altogether. 8 So you're not conflicted.  You're in the business of healthcare. 19 You're not here for the patient's best interest.  You're here for the business of healthcare. 19 Then at least you'd be consistent.  AS: Who are you speaking to?  Are you going around?  CJ: That's my take on the responses to the opioid epidemic so far. 13 They've been easy.  Improve access to treatment. 9, 12, 13 AS: They're kind of lazy.  CJ: They don't cost anyone anything.  They won't jeopardize.  Pharma contributes more money to political campaigns than any other industry. 8, 10 You're going to say no to that money. 8, 10 ""Who's running against you now? 8, 12 We've got a friend here. 20 How would you like this much money?"" 8, 10 AS: What about the comprehensive, the CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. 10, 14 Did you look at that very much?  CJ: It was more focusing on the backend on treatment. 6, 12, 13 AS: It's a band aid.  CJ: I think there was one study I saw where the mortality of a person in medical assisted therapy per year is about one percent. 7, 12, 14 If you're in medical assisted therapy, you're on Suboxone, you're on methadone or something, your risk of dying per year is one in one hundred. 7, 8, 12, 14 Now it's like five times higher if you're not in treatment. 7, 12, 13, 17 One percent is three times higher than if you never developed the problem at all. 7, 12, 16, 17 It depends on your age. 15 If you're in the thirty-five to fifty your average mortality is like three per thousand percent.  It's still three times more likely to die if you're on medical assisted therapy than if you never develop the problem. 7, 12, 14, 16 I'm saying let's never develop the problem. 12, 16 Your mortality if you're even younger like in your twenties is even lower. 10, 20 Granted you have car accidents and stuff like that but your mortality when you're younger in your twenties is even lower. 10, 13, 14, 20 Your five times more likely to survive if you never develop opioid abuse disorder. 6, 13, 16 All of this tells you is what you already know which is prevention is better than treatment. 10, 12, 13, 15, 19 AS: Prevention is better than the cure which is what doctors have been saying for a long time. 12, 14, 17 CJ: It isn't so simple as diabetes and just saying, ""We'll just get you on insulin."" 10 If you become a diabetic.  You're sedentary, you get overweight, you develop insulin resistance, then you develop Type 2 diabetes. 9, 10 You get on regular insulin.  I guess if you keep tight control of your sugar you can live a pretty long life. 10, 17, 18 I don't think quite as long as you never develop. 11, 16, 17 It's kind of seen like ""Oh that's too bad but we got this."" 6 That's not true, medical assisted therapy should not be seen as just getting on insulin for diabetes in terms of your risk. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17 AS: Your risk for?  CJ: Dying.  The other thing is this.  It's not like insulin or glucagon. 13 By the time you get to medical assisted therapy for opioids. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14 You've probably lost your marriage, you've lost your house, your kids won't see you, you've got legal action. 6, 11, 13, 14 That's not true when you're diabetic when your blood sugar keeps going up until eventually you're on pills and then maybe going to insulin. 5, 15 You haven't lost your life prior to that treatment. 10, 11, 12, 13 The person who gets to medical assisted therapy has probably lost a great deal. 7, 11, 12, 14, 20 If you never develop the problem in the first place you can avoid that. 12, 14, 16 That is my big talk.  Prevention.  Focus on patient outcomes not patient satisfaction.  Don't do what's just business savvy actually obey your oath and do what might be unpopular with a patient temporarily with their long term interest and their outcome. 7, 17 AS: Are you talking to doctors? 12, 14 I've spoken around the state.  I speak in communities. 19 I’ve spoken in Montevideo. 18 I've spoken in St. Cloud.  Most of my talks are local.  I did testify in front of the FDA Advisory Committee.  I did speak at the Fed Up rally in D.C. in September.  I give my talk all over.  I speak to disability adjustors, like insurance companies. 10 Is there any reason why we're still doing this?  AS: Is there some way to get at this...? 18 CJ: Payers, I've spoken to Medica. 14 Payers have some stake in the game.  AS: I wonder is there some way to get at this to put it on your policy brain which you said you chose not to do it. 13, 14, 18 It seems like you actually are moving in that way. 6, 7, 18 CJ: It came full circle back to my political science. 14 AS: That's what I was thinking.  CJ: This sort of overarching sort of ways to benefit people. 9, 15, 18 I couldn't have done that at age twenty-three.  AS: Of course not.  We have to have our life. 10 CJ: Treating one patient at a time and doing my medical career for as long as I have and understanding how the problem happens. 7, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 Now I can come back with authority and experience. 18 AS: And evidence.  CJ: And street credit. 5 This is what needs to happen. 15 I can tell them you're going to do this and this and this for a year. 14 We're going to be here in five years because nothing is going to change. 14 AS: Chris do you think it's possible to use the insurance companies to quit paying for these long term prescriptions? 6, 10, 13, 14, 17 Is there some pressure in our own system the way it currently works or are they just as culpable as pharma and hospitals? 8, 9, 10, 18 CJ: Insurance companies, you want to get stakeholders involved with an interest in having this problem not happen. 10, 12, 15, 20 Obviously patients and families have a stake in not having this, that's their lives. 17 That's their homes they're going to lose, their jobs they're going to lose, their families they're going to lose. 9, 11, 17 They have a stake in it.  The medical industry doesn't have as much of a stake in it. 7, 14 Saving lives and saving people, honestly the more people get on medical assisted therapy, people who go into treatment that's business. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 People in chronic pain going to the pain clinic that's business. 6 AS: The idea of reducing it isn't... 5, 14 CJ: Health care is paid for with consumption of health care services rather than outcomes. 14, 19 There's always this incentive, there's always going to be a problem when you're looking to reduce consumption of healthcare. 5, 12, 14, 18, 19 That is business that's not happening. 15 I'm not saying it's a good situation. 10 AS: I'm just feeling sad and cynical. 14, 15 CJ: Until like the president's daughter dies. 9, 10 AS: In a way those things don't even seem to matter. 6, 18 Deaths of icons.  CJ: Prince is dead. 16 AS: Prince and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  CJ: Heath Ledger.  AS: Heath Ledger.  CJ: I mention all of them in my talk by the way. 12, 18 AS: Not to mention all the sons and daughters and parents of kids. 12, 20 CJ: I've been to these meetings where the doctors who are pain doctors who have been prescribing these opioids still say, ""It's terrible but you can't take away the meds. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 Some of these people really need them and if you take that away from them they'll probably commit suicide."" 9, 18, 20 That's what they say.  AS: It always circles back to the pain. 6, 18 CJ: Yes.  Listen, it's oral heroin. 16 I show people the slide. 9 This is what heroin looks like, here's what oxycodone looks like. 16 It's basically the same. 19 The ring structures. 15 Their receptor is the same.  There is no separate heroin receptor in the brain. 13, 16 AS: Your purpose for saying that is to kind of bring heroin, because of its negative connotations, into the discussions of recognizing... 16 CJ: If you say, ""Oh some people really need their opioids and they're in pain."" 6, 9, 13, 18 They need their heroin. 16 You might as well just say they need their heroin. 16 AS: You could explode the stigma. 9 CJ: Trying to destigmatize what heroin but you're also trying to stigmatize this dichotomy that they think they're being responsible. 9, 14, 16 AS: My kid wasn't a junkie.  CJ: ""I'm responsible because I'm using opioids in the form of OxyContin for their chronic pain."" 6, 13, 16 I'm like, ""You're just giving heroin for their chronic pain."" 6, 16 AS: When you say the oral heroin to other physicians what do they say? 16 The same thing you just told me? 16 CJ: They don't like me saying that.  They like to just call it opioids and use more scientific names and sterilize it and clean it up. 6, 13, 16 They feel like they're doing responsible medicine. 12, 14, 16 All they're doing is oral heroin for conditions that life just creates because life is life. 10, 16 Here's the other thing.  Have they really helped people? 9, 18 Not if you look at the disability rolls.  If you look and see are people ""getting their lives back."" 6, 9 Then you should see massive decreases in people with chronic back and joint pain who are back at work now that they're on their opioids. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 You absolutely do not see that. 6 In fact, disability claims have done nothing but gone up.  These patients will almost universally say they're helping.  AS: But they're still in pain and they can't work. 6 CJ: Right.  When they come off the medicines... 12, 14 AS: They actually are in pain. 6, 7 CJ: They're withdrawing. 5 Then when they take their medicines they feel like it's helping them. 12, 14 But they're not back at work.  In terms of being engaged in life. 10, 17 AS: And healing.  It is giving emotional consolation so yes they say they're helping but especially because we're paying for their disability. 14 Healthcare and insurance, they're paid for collectively. 14, 19 We're paying for that. 14 We have a stake in helping you get back to work and pay into the system.  We have a stake in the fact if you're not back and work and doing all this other stuff we're not getting what we paid for.  AS: We don't see it that way. 6, 18 Can you talk a little bit about how you got involved in the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation? 20 One of the other docs on the board, Reznikoff, I think it was after I gave a lecture in 2012 at Park Nicollet. 14 I don't know who heard it. 9, 12 Somebody somewhere either heard that talk that I gave and told the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement or ICSI about me. 9, 12, 16 ICSI invited me to be on their pain management group. 6, 12 I participated in their document they produced. 9, 12, 14 I think it was 2010 or something.  Then they reconvened in 2015.  I went back and did it again.  Charlie was on this ICSI group.  He learned who I was through ICSI. 10 Then he approached me later.  He was already on the Rummler Foundation and said, ""Would you like to be on the board of the Rummler Foundation?""  I met Judy and Bill.  They told me their story and I told them my approach. 15, 16 I've been on their board.  It's been a good relationship. 10, 19 I'm not sure how helpful I am to them. 9 In the sense that a lot of their board meetings are about financials. 18 A lot of what I do is advocacy and message.  I'm not good with money. 8, 10 I'm not a fundraiser. 5 AS: They're raising money to get more Narcan kits. 8, 10 CJ: They've been very good about; they bring me speaking opportunities. 10, 19 Can you go talk to this group?  I also point out when they do their Narcan.  Narcan is catching it, if you're at Narcan you've lost so much already. 11 Granted let’s save your life and help you get back and give you a chance to get that stuff back. 10 Let's stop it upstream so a person never needs Narcan. 16 While I applaud Narcan and medical assisted therapy and helping people who've developed a problem. 7, 9, 12, 14 My main message is medicine had no business causing this problem in the first place. 6, 12, 14 We are not helping people we're harming them. 9 We have no accountability and we have a system that is geared to continue to have business proceed as usual. 5, 14 In what I view as a very egregious violation of the Hippocratic Oath.  That's the message that I bring.  AS: I think that's a helpful message for them even. 9 We need those voices. 17 CJ: A lot of the meetings do tend to be about, like any board meeting. 18 AS: It's not that exciting.  CJ: Is the organization functioning? 9 The organization needs finances to function. 9 Where's our finances?  Where are we getting them from?  Where's our donors?  How do we get this?  All of that is very important. 9 They don't just spring up out of nowhere. 12 I'm bad at that.  I'm not good at that. 10 In that sense I'm not a good board member. 10 I look at a page of figures and I'm like ""Sure.  Is that good? 10 I don't know."" 12 AS: Boards need all kinds of people. 9 They need people they can count on to go and speak articulately, be on message for them. 9 That's important. 9 CJ: I have been told I'm a good speaker. 10, 16 You're a very good speaker. 10 What do you see happening in the next few years in this environment? 6, 12, 14, 15 You just said a few minutes ago you don't think it's going to change anytime soon. 13, 15 What would like to see? 6 CJ: I chair the Department of Human Services Opioid Prescribing Workgroup. 9, 12 I told that right? 12, 16 AS: No. CJ: The Department of Human Services has an Opioid Prescribing Workgroup that was, I forget who set it up. 9, 12 AS: That's Mo. CJ: I'm sure I brought cat hair with me.  [Talks to cat].  I chair the Department of Human Services Opium Prescribing Workgroup. 9, 12 We've been at it for over a year now. 12, 14 We're coming up with our recommendations for chronic pain. 6, 12 They are going to reflect the things that I've said to you.  We've got, Charlie Reznikoff is on this too.  The recommendation that are going on the commission are going to be for policy. 12 They're going to reflect the fact that you have to reduce exposure. 5, 14 Whatever it is you're doing, stop the patient after two weeks, whatever it is. 15 Tell them ""You're going to hurt.  That'll be okay.  Your body will heal.""  Healing is another way that things get better. 18 The body heals.  AS: Nerves have to readjust.  CJ: Your brain stops responding enough to the nerves. 13 Remember other countries live and function without it. 9 That's going to be the message.  The question is then, after this what kind of buy in are we going to get from the medical community? 7, 14, 19 You need everyone to do the same thing at the same time.  Sort of the way the ACA mandated insurance companies to stop discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. 9, 10, 13, 18 AS: And women. 12 CJ: One insurance company couldn't have an epiphany of conscience and decide it's not right that these people with these expensive things that they can't get insurance. 9, 12, 14 We're going to just start doing it.  What happens when one company decides to do that? 14, 15 All the sick people go to that company. 9, 14, 15 Right?  Their premiums don't remotely cover the cost of their care. 10, 19 That would be an insurance company to go broke. 8, 14 You had to have a piece of policy that said everyone at the exact same time had to pick up these expensive patients.  Granted you also had to mandate that people have to buy in. 9, 13 They're trying to get rid of that.  ""You do that we all go broke."" 8 That's why I think they need to stop this nonsense.  Single payer, you take it right out of their check just like in Canada or Britain. 12 You don't get the option and it's going to happen. 15 The idea behind the ACA was they recognize you can't have one conscientious insurance company that just is going to do it by themselves. 14, 17 They would be destroyed.  You have to make them all do it at the same time.  That is the idea with a policy.  If everyone sort of gets on board at the same time, ""We're not doing as many meds.""  At the same time, we can decrease the exposure, we can decrease the number of prescriptions, decrease the number of pills that are getting to the population. 10, 14 That will bring the numbers back down.  AS: What's your target area for this committee, this policy? 8 CJ: We haven't finished yet.  We have to finish these recommendations, they have to go to the commissioner, there's going to be a public comment, a revision process. 8, 12, 17, 19 AS: To do actual legislation?  CJ: That's what we're going to find out.  AS: That is awesome.  CJ: Nothing might happen. 15 It might be like, ""Those are nice recommendations."" 12, 18 AS: For the state of Minnesota.  That would be your first.... 14 CJ: We need to track the number of prescriptions. 10, 16 Are we reducing the number of prescriptions? 5, 10, 14 What's happening with that? 15 Then watch it over time. 17 Are the prescriptions going down and with it are we seeing treatment admissions going down and the deaths go down? 6, 10, 12, 13, 18 AS: I would think you would.  CJ: Considering the relationship that was very clearly evident when the problem started. 9, 12, 19 You would like to see as the sales went up these other problems followed, as the sales go down the other problems go down. 6, 10, 12 You'd like to see that relationship hold. 6, 19 There's nothing special about heroin. 16 It doesn't become popular.  There's no special sauce that changed. 13 The reason heroin is popular is we created this whole new market for it with the pills. 5, 16 AS: And it's cheaper and it's easier to get.  CJ: A person who then became dependent on the pills, whereas a forty-five-year-old woman with back pain would never just go to heroin for their back pain. 6, 14, 16 You put them on pills for five years because that's medicine from a doctor and a pharmacy. 12, 14 They look the same as aspirin.  You put them on that for five years and then say you're taking those away now that now fifty-year-old woman their brain's desperate. 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 They will go to heroin. 16 They can't feel like that anymore.  It is not tolerable to their brain to continue feeling like that. 13, 15 AS: Then kids who start playing around with the pain pills then aren't afraid of heroin. 6, 16 They don't have the same exposure and their not as afraid.  It's not as shifty and dark. 8, 17 CJ: Say they've snorted the pill.  They know how it feels. 12 ""I can manage it.""  It's that halfway point that allows people to get over it. 9, 10, 14, 18 They would never go straight to recreational heroin. 16 AS: Although there are kids who are because of the way that it's being explained to them. 18 It's not any different than the pain pills. 6 CJ: They're sort of this halfway house that allows someone to get over that psychological... 6, 10, 13, 14, 18 AS: There was a lot of stigma in my generation. 9 I'm going to turn fifty soon.  Heroin was like no.  CJ: Heroin was inner city, jazz musicians. 9 AS: It was Jim Morrison and The Doors died.  CJ: It was with blacks usually in poverty.  AS: To me it was like death. 18 You saw the skull and crossbones when you thought of it. 8, 17, 18 CJ: The rock n' roll musicians it was the typical hard partying, the Janice Joplins, the Jimmy Hendrixes, the Kurt Cobains. 5, 9, 14, 18, 20 Now it's different.  AS: It's different because of the opiate pain killers. 6 CJ: Prince was a Jehovah's Witness.  They have their own beliefs.  What is true is that he didn't drink and smoke and do all these typical rock n' roller things. 5, 14 His parties were clean. 9 They didn't have alcohol. 6 His brain was no less vulnerable just because it wasn't that type. 13 That's why this problem has unfortunately drawn the attention. 5, 12 It has hit that segment of the population. 12 AS: Middle and upper class white people. 7, 9, 19 CJ: Middle class professionals with kids going to the good schools. 7, 10 The high school football hero. 7 Thank you.  CJ: Is there anything else?  Did I forget to cover something?  AS: Are you good? 10 Are you getting cold?  CJ: I'm fine. 11 AS: I'm getting cold.  Any last thoughts? 17, 18 CJ: People wonder do I have a brother or family member who got addicted to opioids. 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 The answer is no.  AS: I kind of assumed that because you didn't tell me.  CJ: Honestly I'm just filled with righteous anger. 5, 8, 12 AS: That's a motivator.  CJ: I really feel this naive crusader in me that wanted to break policy things and right wrongs. 11, 12, 18 I thought I'd go to medicine to do it one at a time. 12, 14, 17, 18 Then as I learned in medicine, I'm not sure if I'm doing that. 10, 12, 14 Don't get me wrong. 11 Most people in medicine absolutely are trying to do the right thing. 9, 12, 14 They want to do the right thing. 12 We straighten out fractures and we intubated people in respiratory failure. 9, 14 That is the goal of most doctors. 12, 14 They still do great things. 20 The motivations that people who create that climate don't do it with the patient's best outcomes in mind. 9 When you hear these stories about patients being held in ERs for two days because there's no mental health bed for someone who's suicidal. 9, 12, 16, 19 There's a reason for that.  The ER doctor who sees them puts them on a hold because they're trying to do the best thing for them. 6, 12, 14 But the reason they can't find a bed for them but they can get a heart attack patient up there in thirty minutes is a matter of economic priority and who is invested in that and where does that come from. 9, 14, 15 That comes from the level above the level of doctor and patient. 12, 14 Anyone who tells anyone that what your health outcome is just you talking to your doctor. 12, 14, 15, 19 Nonsense.  It is never ever been you and your doctor. 12, 14, 16 What determines that outcome is also a matter of economic investment and priority prior to that doctor ever getting there. 12, 14, 17 That doctor who wants to do the best for their patient can get the acute heart attack up to the cath lab. 9, 12, 14 They can do that right away. 12, 18, 20 That same doctor is going to put their patient on hold and they're going to sit there for two days. 12, 14, 16 There's no medical outlet. 7, 14 There's no place for them.  We've decided this is not valued. 14 AS: Mental health and addiction are treated the same. 12, 14, 19 CJ: I sympathize with hospitals that are put in the position of losing money on some types of healthcare and having to make up for it by doing other stuff. 8, 10, 19 You'd like to think that healthcare that provides a service and a value should always be in the positive. 18, 19 Like you're doing something good. 10 You shouldn't lose money for doing a service that improves the health of someone. 8, 9, 10, 19 Hospitals are in the business where providing the service causes them to lose so they have to make up for it here. 6, 9, 13, 19 Don't think that doctors and hospital people are a different class of human that are removed from incentives. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 19 There's a reason you need a federal act to stop patient dumping. 8 Do you know what the Emergency Medicine Treatment and Active Labor Act is? 12, 14 AS: No. CJ: EMTALA.  That was the act that stopped patient dumping.  That's why you can go to an emergency room and you have to be seen. 6, 14 AS: Any emergency room you go to now. 12, 14 Right because there were places that said ""You can't come in here."" 14 You could turn them away. 18, 20 CJ: They were poor patients they found that had appendicitis.  We're going to send you to county. 14, 19 They do a lot more than we do.  AS: Now I remember this but not the name of it.  CJ: That's what George Bush said, or George W. said.  That's what Mitt Romney said, ""We do have a universal health care system. 19 We have emergency departments."" 9, 12, 19 That's what they meant.  You had to be seen. 6 AS: That was their big Reagan era contribution to healthcare. 19 CJ: Understand if doctors and other hospital healthcare people weren't sending off the poor patients you wouldn't have needed that law. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 If they were doing what their oath said.  They were trying to maximize return on their time so they sent away the patients who weren't paying. 5, 14 They were forced by law to not do that. 8, 13 Don't think that you've got this different class of animal human in the healthcare industry that doesn't pay close attention to that. 7, 9, 10, 19 AS: What do you want to do in the next few years? 14 Where do you see your work and your career going? 6, 15, 19 CJ: I've moved to urgent care because the hours are better. 7, 15, 19 It doesn't pay as well.  I sleep at night better. 16 Would I go back to emergency medicine? 12, 14 Probably not full time. 14 The burn out in emergency medicine is really high. 7, 12, 14, 18 It's not what your body was meant to do.  I don't have children so I don't need tons of time. 5, 14, 20 This public health work I do does give me purpose. 19 I feel this is a good mission to be on. 10 It just so happens that this problem I began work on over a decade ago is now the number one public health problem in the country. 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 That's why I'm front and center on it, at least in this state.  Since it hasn't stopped I'm imagining that the work for me to do here is going to continue.  AS: For the meantime you'll stay in urgent care? 19 CJ: I'll just keep doing that unless I get to the point where the work I do public health wise, speaking educating, helping systems develop policy, that itself becomes compensated to a point where I could do that. 14, 19 At some point does North Dakota need help?  I haven't talked there.  Wisconsin do they have a problem? 12 I don't know of anyone doing my job in either of those places. 11, 12 AS: In this way. 18 What's the name of the opioid group that you're working on? 13 CJ: The Department of Human Services? 9, 12 DHS is the Opioid Prescribing Workgroup.  I'm also on the board on the National Organization of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.  AS: I'm excited about your Opioid Workgroup.  Let me know if you need any help with that. 12 CJ: I think you've got a system of incentives that are poorly designed to solve this as they are constructed now. 11, 12 With people, many of whom are well meaning, but are operating in a system they didn't set up. 9 The people who can control how the incentives are set up don't want to change. 9, 18 That's our system right now. 12 AS: Thank you.  Thanks so much.  That was really great. 18, 20"
"13","Espuche_Nancy 2","Julie Hooker Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer February 2, 2017 Julie Hooker -JH Amy Sullivan -AS JH: Where can I go, what can I do?  I find help for the him but the beds aren’t open and they won’t be open for three weeks. 15 This guy’s using heroin daily and he could easily die between now and then. 6, 12, 16 That’s what we went to go tell the Lieutenant Governor, that we can’t as clinicians stand by.  Part of the reason why there’s a three week waiting list, this is why I went to her, we have a system set up in Minnesota and many states for people with public assisted medical plants, PMAPs they’re called. 7, 9, 14, 15, 19 The PMAP will pay for treatment but all the beds in the cities are filled and we’ve got waiting lists but in Wadena they’ve got an open bed. 5, 7, 12, 13, 15 They’re dying for people to come there because they’ve got open beds and clinicians ready to serve. 9 The PMAP won’t pay for it because it’s out of the seven county area, thereby funneling everybody back into the cities which creates the three week waiting list. 7, 8, 15, 19 My talk with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, was can we take a look at that system and stop that?  If I can get somebody a bed in Wadena and they’re willing to drive down here and pick him up. 5 AS: They’ll come get them?  They’ll come get them.  The only way that it works, you think it’s great because this guy’s got insurance. 9, 18, 20 If he didn’t have insurance, if he comes in without any insurance at all now the county will say no because he has an open case here in Ramsey County so we’re not going to fund. 12, 17, 19 They might Hennepin and Ramsey but you have to work at it.  AS: Which is what I had to do to get my daughter into Tapestry.  So you know. 12 AS: I tried to do all kinds of things.  I tried to get a friend in St. Paul to let her sleep on his couch and say she’s homeless. 16, 20 I understood it but at the time to me that was not lying.  That was just getting my daughter in treatment. 12, 13 These are the barriers that I witness, we witness every day. 16 Part of my solution because the system is so broken. 8, 9 Even though somebody really could benefit from an in-patient treatment bed this is what Resurrection Recovery was kind of created for. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 We’re an intensive outpatient treatment with intensive case management services and we have referrals for housing, transitional housing. 6, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19 We’re purchasing our own house. 6, 13 That’s what my bookkeepers are doing today. 16 We’re doing some year-end stuff to submit to the bank for our loan. 14 We will buy our own house because we’ve been trying to refer people to some of the GRH housing. 6, 9, 13 Have you heard of that? 9 AS: What does that stand for?  JH: Group residential housing. 6, 9, 13 The county will pay for those. 19 Even if somebody has health insurance. 19 Health insurance won’t pay for your housing but even if somebody has health insurance I can request that the county pay for the housing and I’ve never had them turn me down unless somebody has an open case in another county. 6, 16, 17, 19 AS: What constitutes an open case? 17 If they’re receiving food stamps or general assistance.  AS: I could see how those could get really complicated and just stop someone from getting treatment if they aren’t living… 6, 12, 13, 18 Why not a one payer system?  AS: Instead of each county dealing with all of it. 14, 19 You’re a Minnesotan, how about that?  Not a Ramsey County resident. 9 How about we got to a one payer system for the entire state of Minnesota.  AS: When you think of how many of us have to work in other counties, we drive home to another county, we might even drive to another sector of the state. 5, 19 But for poor people they’re not supposed to be allowed to have that kind of flexibility. 9, 10 It drives me crazy. 5, 20 Because this system is so complex and is creating more barriers for people. 9, 13 I’m on the ground floor with this and I have people in here sitting in that chair crying because nobody will help them. 9, 14 I just can’t sit by and say, “Well sucks to be you.  Okay I’ll see what I can do. 6 Somebody will call you in a few weeks.” 15 If you’re still living, if you still have a phone, if we’re still able to contact you, if you’re still in the city, if you’re still in the state. 8, 16 I’ll be just a little bit political here for a second. 20 We had a number of people coming from other states, specifically Illinois because Illinois doesn’t have as easy access to chemical dependency services as Minnesota does. 9, 13, 19 We have this huge influx of people that are non-native Minnesotans, not people living here or paying taxes here who immediately get put on county assistance and their treatment is paid for. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 They get a bus pass, they get their housing paid for, all of those things. 6 That’s great. 20 It’s so nice that we’re that magnanimous but what about the people who live here who have paid taxes here, whose families are here who are paying taxes here and I can’t find a treatment bed for them. 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 I just can’t reconcile that, I can’t.  If we’re going to open our door that wide for people from other states why close it on the people that live here now. 9, 10, 12 My solution would be the one payer system which everybody tells me is never going to happen. 9, 15, 16 AS: One payer for health care? 19 JH: Yes.  AS: Nationally?  Wouldn’t that be wonderful. 18 AS: I just wondered about the scope of your dream. 5 JH: Let’s start small.  Let’s start with Minnesota.  [Break in Recording]  It is our revenue generating business so that we can purchase houses and do things. 6, 9, 13 Then I started a nonprofit called the Continuing Care Center which does all the case management. 12, 15, 17 I have a MN Sure navigator so he helps people sign up for health insurance. 9, 11, 19 That office is in this building but in another office space. 19 All the clients that come to us are basically, have you heard of Maslow? 9, 10, 19 Maslow’s 10 Hierarchy of Need, the pyramid.  Almost everybody who comes here, their basic needs aren’t even being met.  As a substance abuse and mental health provider it’s proven a fact that they don’t a place to live and they don’t have any clothes, a winter jacket, and they don’t have an ID. 6, 12, 13, 19 “I lost my Social Security card and all my clothes were in a backpack and it got stolen.” 11, 14 Rather than just say, “Well just stop drinking and everything will be fine.” 5, 11 It was just so overwhelming in the very beginning. 11 I didn’t know what I didn’t know. 12 AS: In the beginning when you started this? 11 JH: Yes.  JH: Two years ago. 13, 14 AS: Just two years ago. 13, 14 Partly because I worked in the field for quite a while.  I have a master’s degree in Human Services.  I’ve worked in Community Services. 19 I’ve been homeless.  I’ve been an injecting heroin user. 6, 13 I’ve been incarcerated.  I’ve lived and people like us often make the best counselor because we can be relatable to people and not say, “Will you tell me why you’d this?” 7, 9 If somebody asked me that question, then I say you’re not ready to hear the answer if you have to ask the question. 9 It doesn’t make any sense.  It was just two years ago. 13, 14 I have a business partner and the two of decided, he doesn’t work here but financially we put this place together. 8, 9, 14 He works for Health Care for the Homeless which is inside the Dorothy Day Center through West Side Community Health. 9, 19 His employer is West Side Community Health. 19 He’s stationed at the Dorothy Day Center. 8 The two of us together were saying “What can we do to help this population now and in real time?” 8, 12 In patient treatment beds were so hard to come by, still are, with the bottlenecking of everybody with the PMAPS and the seven county metro area and the empty beds in Wadena. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 This is kind of the beginning step to changing that system. 11, 17 When people come in and I say, “It’s a three to four week waiting list and I can get you started here today. 9, 15, 16 I can get you in touch with case management services so that we can get some of these things moving.” 12, 17, 19 AS: Your model is to provide services immediately and to try to hold on to them, keep them for these three weeks before you can actually get them. 7, 15, 19 I’ll put out the call for a bed and we will continue to help the client call. 10, 14 AS: You’re kind of that bridge then that I was wishing for a few years ago. 13, 14 That many parents end up wishing for because we can’t have our children in our homes. 5, 14, 20 We’ve reached that point where it’s dangerous and destructive for everybody. 11 Are you familiar with TAM then? 8 JH: The Addict’s Mother. 14 AS: Oh yes.  I’m on that page.  We’ll backspace here.  Initially with my history, I’d been free from addiction if you will for over twenty years but for the first ten I didn’t want anything to do with people like me. 9, 12, 14, 15 I tried to work in the corporate world.  AS: I’m going to make you pause for a second. 6, 13 You have to say on here that you give me permission to record this starting when I started the recording.  You have to say your name and say that you give me permission.  Go ahead. 14 JH: Hi, I’m Julie Hooker and I do give permission to Amy to record whatever I’m saying today. 16 AS: We are at Resurrection Recovery in St. Paul.  Julie Hooker is the founder and director of this treatment and support center. 12, 13, 18, 19 I’ll have you sign this release form later when we’re done. 11 It’s great that you actually started this talking about what you’re doing here because on the way over I was thinking, “I think what I want to do is have her start with what she’s doing right now.” 7, 12, 18, 20 I’ve usually been starting these with your childhood and going backwards. 14, 20 You’ve kind of given a good idea of what it is you’re doing now but why don’t you start from the point where you tried to work in the corporate world and then let’s talk about your career in treatment. 10, 12, 13, 15, 19 Then let’s go back.  The other option would be you just tell your story as things come up. 15 It doesn’t matter to me if it’s chronological.  If I start with trying to work in the corporate world I’ve already bypassed the many “unsuccessful” attempts at recovery.  AS: Do you want to just start with your childhood and your addiction story? 12, 14, 15, 20 Where were born and where did you grow up? 10, 14 I’m a native Minnesotan. 14 I’m a blond haired, blue eyed Swedish Norwegian girl, Lutheran, ate lutefisk and lefse at Christmas every year. 5, 7, 14 AS: Where did you grow up? 10 In the Twin Cities area but we moved around a lot. 7, 8, 15 My dad was in social work. 14, 19 My mom was a stay at home mom. 14 I’m the middle born of six children. 5, 7, 14, 20 We were upper middle class. 7 There wasn’t a lot of drama. 5 There was a lot of love and affection. 14 I didn’t have that sometimes typical upbringing of neglect and abandonment and abuse. 6, 12, 13 There was a lot of alcohol growing up. 6, 10 I started drinking eight, nine because Dad always drank with a can of Grain Belt 5, 11, 16, 18 Beer between his legs and drove. 5 “Give me another beer honey.” 8 He was nice when he drank. 5, 16, 18 He was fun and he was friendly and he’d give us whisker rubs and he was not mean. 20 He was more fun.  I’d be like, “Can I have some money Dad? 8, 10 Can I get you another beer Dad?”  The reward for going to get him another beer was the first sip out of the can. 14 I had learned that that was a reward for doing something good. 10 AS: What year were you born? 14 I didn’t know that that was unusual. 12 AS: That’s powerful. 10, 17 I graduated high school at seventeen. 7 My dad got me a keg of beer. 14 For a party. 9, 20 That kind of upbringing that it wasn’t a scary or negative thing when people drank. 5, 9, 16 It was fun and everybody had a good time. 10 AS: There was no violence or despair or negative consequences? 6 Back then here in Minnesota you could, I remember doing this, I was probably fifteen.  You could go to the bar with your parents and drink as long as they were with you. 5, 17, 20 I learned how to shoot dice and play pool. 10, 14 It was a kind of different view on especially alcohol. 6 AS: Did you understand your tolerance then pretty easily? 10, 17, 18 My parents started serving us wine at dinner when we were in our late teens if it was a special occasion. 20 [Phone Call] 8 Yes, I guess.  I have recollections of drunkenness in my teens. 5, 8, 14 I never really saw it as being a negative. 16, 18 I’ve never had a DUI. 16 I don’t get drunk and have somebody beat me up. 5, 8, 14 Historically it just wasn’t that big of a deal.  The big deal I guess it was in the early 80s with cocaine. 16 In 1975 I graduated from high school. 7 In 1978 I went to Oregon on a vacation.  I stayed for twenty-three years. 14 True story. 15 I just fell in love with Oregon. 14 I ended up on this kind of hippie commune.  We were growing pot. 6, 10 It was a cool thing to do. 17 I’m kind of a hippie at heart. 9 AS: Whereabouts in Oregon?  That commune was in a place called Harlan, Oregon which is halfway between Corvallis and Newport in the coast range. 7, 14, 16, 18 I don’t know how well you know Oregon. 12 Kind of at the Northwest base of Mary’s Peak which is the tallest peak in the coast range. 7, 16 Twenty miles as the crow flies from the coast inland. 16 I lived there and then I’m a musician so I was playing in Lincoln City. 7, 9 AS: What do you play?  JH: Piano, guitar, dulcimer.  Old Joni Mitchell fan.  Who else plays the dulcimer besides Joni Mitchell. 9 It was there that I met the man that would be my husband. 14 We ended up doing cocaine together and growing marijuana. 8, 10, 14, 16 We ended up moving into town because I missed running water and a washing machine, a toaster, flushing toilets. 8, 16 AS: How long did you last on the commune? 17 JH: Almost two years. 14 That was a long time. 17 It was probably one of the most fond memories I have of my entire life. 10 It was phenomenal. 12 Even then things weren’t out of hand.  Everything was manageable, life was good. 10 Moving back into the city and being in a relationship that was a little toxic to begin with, that toxicity grew. 19, 20 There was a lot of betrayal and a lot of abandoning the principles of the vows we took.  AS: You got married? 7 We got married and were childless for the first eight years of our marriage. 7, 14 I couldn’t have any children. 5, 14, 20 I had to have surgery to make it possible.  Once had my first child my focus was no longer on my husband, it was on my child. 14, 17 Therein lies the problem. 12 He was not happy with sharing me. 18 It got really sick and toxic. 15, 18 I think from that, we had two children together, right after the second child was born it was very, very ugly. 5, 8, 12, 14, 20 We were living in separate rooms in the same house. 6, 13, 14 We divorced and then that’s when things just went kind of south for me. 7 I was just looking for some kind of validation.  When you split up like that it feels like I’ve done something wrong even though I don’t think it’s wrong for me to put all my energy into this baby that we just spent tons of money. 8, 10, 11 It’s day four, five o’clock come home honey kind of thing. 8, 16 It was after the divorce and the very first guy that I hooked up with was a career heroin addict. 14, 15, 19 Very first guy. 14 I was enamored. 5 I just thought that was cool. 17, 18 AS: With him or did you try it right away? 12, 18, 20 JH: Almost right away. 12, 18, 20 A little hesitation. 20 It went from no big deal to oh my gosh now this is a devastating thing. 12 It’s really hard to get out of once you’re in. 9, 18 I’ve heard many heroin addicts and myself included say, “The very first time I did it, it was like, where have you been all my life?” 9, 10, 14, 16 That’s exactly what happened to me. 15 It just felt wonderful. 11, 18 He said it felt like a warm hug. 11 I went, yes that’s what it does.  AS: You don’t have to have a person there to hug you.  Because people leave. 9, 18 Whether they’re there physically or not. 6 AS: How old were your kids at this point?  One and three, babies.  I don’t think she was even one yet.  Very quickly spiraled into selling cocaine and heroin so that I could get more heroin. 16 I smoked some of the cocaine and shot some of it too. 11, 14, 16 How did this happen? 15 It really was kind of that. 18 It wasn’t headstrong. 14 I’m a mom, I’ve got these little kids. 14, 20 I worked like hell to be able to have children and here I am going “What the hell is happening to me?” 5, 14, 15, 20 My house got raided in a drug raid. 5, 6, 13 AS: Was he living there?  Well he stayed there but he wasn’t living there.  He got charged with frequenting when it was really mostly his business. 12, 18 I got charged with possession with intent to distribute.  I immediately went to jail.  The kids immediately got taken out of the home.  My husband and I had been divorced for quite a while and we had joint custody. 7, 14 Thank God we had joint custody because otherwise the kids would have gone into the system.  My husband had remarried right after our relationship. 7, 12, 14, 19 He was forty I think and she was seventeen.  I’m not kidding.  AS: How old were your kids when the raid happened? 15 JH: About five, six years. 14 The worst part of it was about six or seven years. 9, 14 AS: The kids are six and eight.  It was terrible. 11 There were syringes around.  It was Hooker’s home for the homeless and soup kitchen.  Whoever wanted to come over came over. 14, 18 AS: Hooker being your last name?  JH: Yes.  Actually there’s a little funny story. 9, 15, 20 As things progressed and got worse and worse prostitution became a viable option.  I’d been arrested for that.  I will never forget the first time when I went into court and they call your name and they read the charges. 14, 16 They said, “Julie Hooker, prostitution” and the courtroom erupts in laughter. 14 Even the judge was covering his mouth.  My attorney started laughing.  He was a trick.  This is so humiliating and you would think would this not be enough.  I was charged with that.  Actually it was the only misdemeanor I’ve ever had.  All the rest are felonies because of the drug charges. 5, 6 In Oregon at that time they were just starting the drug court thing. 5, 6 I didn’t have any priors.  I didn’t even have a parking ticket.  I’d never been arrested. 16 I was a good, upper middle class, white, Midwestern girl. 7, 10, 19 How did this happen? 15 AS: By this time, we’re in the mid-80s?  Yes, mid to late 80s.  I went to jail that day. 16 The kids were terribly traumatized.  It was a SWAT team that broke in. 8 They had masks and guns and they used a percussion bomb to shatter my living room window. 6, 13, 14, 16 JH: I don’t know. 12 AS: They couldn’t just knock on the door.  That was the late 80s.  I had a neighbor that happened to. 15 It was frightening to be the neighbor. 12 It’s frightening to have it happen. 12, 15 My kids, for years I couldn’t talk about it without crying I still tear up a little bit. 14, 20 The kids were sleeping in a bedroom. 5, 14, 16 I was in the living room and I’m buck ass naked laying on the floor when this all happens. 14, 15 I’ve got all these masked, gun toting guys come in.  A guy’s got a gun to the back of my head and a knee in my back saying, “Don’t move.” 14, 15 I remember turning my head and seeing my daughter standing in the hallway. 6, 14, 18, 20 Oh my God it was horrifying.  I don’t have any violence. 6 I don’t have any guns.  The kids witness it and then they try to hand the kids teddy bears.  They came in with teddy bears.  The whole thing is like what the hell is wrong with you? 11 AS: It’s a teddy bear that gives comfort, not other adults.  JH: I’m handcuffed.  They threw a towel over me.  I couldn’t even hug my kids.  AS: To get you out of the house? 6, 13 For fear that I might try to hand them something. 10 I’m not kidding.  It was horrible. 10 The kids leave and I remember one of the officers was saying, “Take them to child protection services.” 8, 14, 18, 19 I said, “No, I’ve got joint custody.  You’re calling their dad. 14, 16 Here’s his number.”  They said, “Isn’t he a drug addict too?” 5, 6, 14 I said, “You sure didn’t do your research.”  He had some issues but he didn’t have issues like I did. 12, 13 The assumption was there that he must be too.  I had to fight with them.  They did bring the kids; they didn’t have to go into child protection. 14 AS: They did take them to your husband? 14 Yes, but he was married to that other girl. 7 They’d been married for quite a while and they had two little kids. 7, 20 They were living in subsidized housing where they couldn’t have two more kids. 6 Because of that they got kicked out of their house and were homeless and living in the shelter. 6, 13 I’m sitting in jail.  AS: With an addiction. 12, 14 Look at how many lives are just shattered all because of that. 5 What I know today is in other countries if something like that is going on, the percussion bomb and the SWAT team and the guns and all that stuff doesn’t happen. 12, 15, 16 It’s let’s pull you in, let’s sit down with a team full of people, a doctor, an addiction specialist, a mental health specialist and find out what we can do to help you. 9, 12, 14, 19 That’s what happens in other countries. 15 Here it’s still this war on drugs and that was literally a war on drug addicts. 5, 6, 14 AS: It was, it still is.  It still is.  AS: That was at the high point of that. 7 I was in the middle of that. 7 Consequently, that history informs who I am today. 15, 16 Having experienced that informs how I do treatment today. 12, 13, 16, 18 I’ve been working in the field for quite a while and every place that I have worked I’ve been called into the office saying, “Julie you can’t say things like that. 14 Julie that’s not how we do things here.  Julie she has to provide a UA today. 16 You can’t tell her to just go ahead and go. 14 You must toe the line.” 9 I have never been a firm supporter of the urine drug screen policy. 5, 6, 16 Let’s see what we can catch people doing kind of thing. 6, 9 That doesn’t matter to me.  What matters to me is what can I do to help you with what’s happening in your life today. 10, 15, 16 Not you have a urine drug screen today and people panic and come up with lies. 5, 6, 9, 16 AS: And bring in other people’s pee. 9 I had people who would go heat it up in a microwave and hand it to me. 9 It’d be hot.  One time there was a whole bunch of bubbles in there.  I’m like, that’s like Mountain Dew.  JH: Yes.  I said, “If you peed those bubbles out you’d be screaming.”  I just went through so much of that.  Working in the system of abstinence only and a punitive approach flew in the face of my personal belief system having experienced what I had. 18, 19 I’ve been through six different treatments myself, all abstinence based. 12, 13 That was the only indicator of wellness. 14 AS: You never were in a medication assisted? 14, 16 You never did methadone? 6, 8, 16 I refused to do methadone because I used to sell heroin and I was the girl in the parking lot at the methadone clinic. 6, 7, 8, 13, 16 You could come out with your carry outs and I’d trade you a little piece of heroin and I had the juice lined up in my fridge for backup. 9, 16, 20 That was a joke to me.  I understand how it can work, I do. 17, 18 There was no Suboxone at that time. 8 To me at that time methadone clinics were no different, it’s just the federal government was your dope dealer. 8, 12 AS: And you had to pee for them.  You had to stand in line in a humiliating way at a very, very early time in the morning. 9, 18 People would drive by and see this line of people. 5, 6, 9 AS: It’s set up to be humiliating.  It’s a punitive system. 19 Of course when we are humiliated we are going to stop the behavior.  In one of the treatments I was in, this is back when the field and clinicians thought this was the way to do it. 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 Back where they put you in the center of the room and everybody in the treatment group would tear you down. 12, 13, 14 I had a sign that said, “master manipulator.” 11 I had to wear that sign and everybody would tell me how manipulative I was. 11 AS: What kind of therapy was that called and where did it happen? 12, 15 JH: Oregon.  It was all over everywhere.  AS: I’ve heard about it. 9 You have to tear them down and build them back up.  Start from scratch.  Get rid of all the ego.  It didn’t work for me.  AS: It could also for some people, particularly be even more traumatizing and humiliating. 9 I already felt shame. 11 Ten times what they could give me.  You don’t even know what I feel. 12 I just described to you an incident that still makes me cry and my kids are in their thirties.  It’s so powerful that history that I carry with me informs why I do what I do today. 10, 15, 16, 17 You’re still thinking that punishing somebody is going to change their behavior.  It’s not going to work that way. 18 Let me do what I do, let me try to help inform.  I’m a huge believer in Dr. Gabor Mate back when I first read him I went, “Oh my God. 14 I keep getting in trouble at every place that I work for having a belief system like he does.  AS: What do those POs say back to you when you say that?  We’re shifting. 8 It depends on how old they are. 15 AS: If they’re younger they’ll cooperate with you? 20 A little bit more. 20 Not always because they’re in a box that says you have to follow these rules or else. 10, 13, 18 AS: Because what if their guy goes and does something really horrible? 10, 18 Does that reflect poorly on them?  AS: They’re in a punitive system as well. 19 So let’s lock them up.  Let’s just lock everybody up.  When I work I try and be the biggest advocate for the client so we don’t do urine drug screens here, we never will. 5, 6, 10, 16 It creates a barrier and I want to reduce barriers. 5, 14 If I say, “Here.  Go pee in this cup for me.”  I just created some anxiety. 10 AS: They start feeling nervous about everything. 15 I don’t even use and when you tell me I have to go pee in a cup I feel nervous. 6, 13 It’s because it’s requesting a bodily fluid to prove what?  It doesn’t prove wellness.  I know people who are still using who are getting well. 6, 9, 12 Little by little they’re getting well. 20 I know people who have stopped using. 6, 9, 12 AS: But what’s in their pee is inconsequential.  It doesn’t matter what substances people are using. 6, 9 It’s why people use substances in the first place. 6, 9, 13, 14 I believe that it’s trauma related that it’s trying to relieve some kind of pain. 6 For me it was really kind of the abandonment, not being good enough for my husband. 10, 12, 14, 18 Did he really love me? 14, 18 When you start questioning am I enough?  AS: Do you believe that his assertion that this goes back to in utero?  I’m not convinced of that because I don’t know on a cellular how much recall. 12 AS: That seems a little extreme to me. 6, 20 A little overreaching. 20 AS: But just living in the world regardless of what happened in utero can be traumatizing. 15 Whether you’re twenty-five or five.  JH: Exactly.  AS: That’s kind of what I was thinking about after that.  You did by and large have a very loving childhood? 14, 20 JH: Yeah and then I felt guilty because… 11 AS: Why did this happen to me? 15 Why did I become an addict? 14 That only happened to people who had terrible tragedies. 9, 11, 15 I didn’t have a terrible tragedy. 11 What excuse do I have? 6, 13 I went through all kinds of stuff.  I went to six different treatments. 12, 13 AS: Were they all in Oregon?  JH: Yes.  It was always unsuccessful completion. 18 I did have one that was a successful completion and I’d only been there for two weeks and it was a thirty-day program. 15, 16 They came in one day and said, “Julie you’ve been doing so well that we have elevated you.” 16 I went, “Oh my insurance ran out.”  Then just tell me that.  Don’t come in and say I’ve done really well because you don’t even know me. 12, 18 AS: They would say that because your insurance ran out?  Yes, then I’d have to leave. 18 At that time Oregon had a cap on services. 19 Once I reached the cap then they couldn’t get paid for me anymore. 14 Of course I’d made great strides. 20 AS: During those, what’s the time frame between your first treatment and say your last? 12, 13, 14, 15 And did your last one actually stick? 7 No I used after that too. 6, 13, 16 AS: So you were in jail?  Go back to that.  I was in jail a number of different times.  I started off with a…  AS: When the raid happened and your kids end up back with their dad, what happens there? 14, 15 After jail I get out, I was there for sixty, seventy days something like that. 16 Got put on probation with a no use contract for sixty months probation. 6, 11, 13, 16, 19 AS: Five years. 14 The funny part is in the raid itself there was very little, there was scrapable substances found. 6, 9, 20 Less than a gram.  Had they come the day before there was a lot. 16 They got me on an informant, controlled buy...even though there wasn’t anything at the house that day... 6, 13, 16, 18 It was an informant, controlled buy. 18 AS: What does that mean controlled buy? 18 The police give an informant money to go in and purchase. 8, 10 Yes.  The police will give an informant money to go in and purchase the substance. 6, 8, 10 They even let them do the substance quite often. 6, 11 AS: As an extra treat?  As a reward because if there’s nothing in it for you what’s in it for you?  I’ll reduce your sentence? 5, 14 That doesn’t matter to most people. 9 If I get to keep the money or do the drug. 5, 6, 8, 10 It’s a really criminal element in criminal justice. 8, 12, 18 It happens in the FBI, all over the place. 15 The first time that I got out of jail. 14 I will never forget this. 16 The other thing I want to work on in the criminal justice system. 8 I get out and they let you out extremely early in the morning so they don’t have to feed you.  If they feed you then it’s another day they’ve got to pay for. 16 They let you out really early in the morning. 18 I got a bus token.  I was told to go see the PO. 6, 16 The PO’s office doesn’t open until eight or nine.  I’m out at five o’clock in the morning.  What am I supposed to do?  It’s dark. 17 What am I supposed to do?  AS: You can’t go back to your house? 6, 13 I don’t have a house. 6, 13 I’ve been in jail.  I lost everything. 11 I lost everything ten times over. 11 There’s a saying, “Go to jail, lose your shit.” 9, 18 That’s just what happens unless somebody had been there to take call of all my stuff. 15 It’s gone. 8, 11 The landlord came in and took all the stuff. 14 I lose it all. 9 You have tons of friends when you have it all in place and the minute you’re not there they’re gone. 8, 11, 15, 16, 20 I have no place to live, I have no support system in place, I have no money, I have no job. 8, 10, 11 I’m not even a mom anymore. 14 I have no responsibilities.  I went to the dope house where I knew I could find some people that would let me in. 6, 9, 13, 16 This perpetuates.  Number one, the system itself is flawed in that you shouldn’t let people out at that time in the morning with a bus token. 9, 13 My house got raided March first. 6, 13, 14 When I got out it was hot and I had clothes from winter.  It’s Oregon so it’s not that big of a deal.  AS: You got out like in June?  Sixty days you said? 16 JH: May, June, something like that.  A couple of months. 11, 16 It’s warm now. 12 Another time I went to jail when it was warm and I got out when it was cold and I had flip flops and it was forty degrees outside. 9 The system doesn’t set you up for success.  It sets you up for failure. 14 There were no social services in place. 19 Nobody came to see me in jail saying, “What can we do when you get out? 6 How can we help you?  What can we do to support you?  What are your goals?  Can we help you get the kids?  What do we got to do?”  None of that’s in place. 8 I’m trying to figure it out all on my own.  All while feeling like a worthless piece of you-know-what because I just screwed everything up. 12, 15 Look what I just did to those kids.  Not just in that instance but over years. 14 Look what I just did.  It perpetuated everything.  AS: They kept cycling back on it.  It was a monster that kept eating itself.  JH: I’d just get arrested again.  One time I’d gotten out really early in the morning and I was supposed to go see my PO at eight or nine or whatever. 6, 18 I didn’t because there’s hours in between. 15 What am I supposed to do?  Go sit?  A girl by myself in the dark and go sit and wait in front of a building until somebody comes? 7, 17, 19 I didn’t go see my PO right away like I was supposed to. 6, 12, 18, 20 I was out on what they call the stroll.  It was probably noon.  A police officer pulled up and went, “Get in the car.” 8, 11 I hadn’t even been out of jail for six hours when I got arrested again for failing to appear with my probation officer. 8, 15 AS: Just that morning?  Just that morning.  AS: Then how long were you in? 17 JH: Thirty days. 16 I lose track. 9, 16 They had what they called the Graduated Sanction Program where you...the whole system is...meanwhile while you’re there you have nothing.  AS: I’m getting too smug.  What’s a Graduated…?  A Graduated Sanction Program is where a sanction is a [slaps wrist] “Bad girl don’t do that again.” 7 It can start with fifteen days and then it graduates to thirty the second time. 16 AS: Graduated means it gets longer and longer. 17 JH: Meanwhile no treatment. 12, 13 AS: Nobody’s offering you treatment for anything? 12, 13 What they offered was I could get out of my cell if I chose to go to AA. 5, 20 So sign me up. 11 Or Prison Fellowship to get out. 10 AS: That wasn’t treatment. 12, 13 That’s just sitting around.  This is part of the problem that still people think that AA is treatment. 9, 12, 13 Still people are being remanded to AA. 9 AS: Today? 16 Yes!  I have a guy in my group, he just graduated, who had to have signed cards because it was a requirement of his probation that he go to Alcoholics Anonymous. 7, 11, 12, 14 I argued with his PO saying “That’s not treatment. 12, 13 He’s in treatment. 12, 13 Support can come in many different forms.  He’s got support here.  He’s in a support group.”  You can’t tell me that I should go to synagogue every Saturday. 13, 16 I’m not Jewish.  How can you tell me that I have to go to AA?  What if I’m not feeling it? 15 There’s still a lot of that.  In fact, I was told that I had to go to AA or NA meetings. 16, 18 “Okay, alright. 12 But I couldn’t have any contact with other felons.  The NA meeting is filled with people like me. 5, 9, 18 I’m just violating the condition by following the condition. 10 It’s ridiculous. 14 AS: You end up getting a felony?  JH: Multiple.  I got charged with child endangerment, endangering the welfare of minors times two. 12, 14 AS: Did you get your children back? 5, 14, 20 They were just with their dad so I never had any legal… 14, 16 AS: Did the endangerment happen later? 12, 15 No, in the raid.  AS: Those were the felony charges.  The possession is a felony, intent to distribute.  AS: So just to understand. 17, 18 You got a felony for child endangerment. 12, 14 And the endangering the welfare of a minor.  AS: But only served sixty days? 16 Because I got that dropped. 5, 11 AS: The child endangerment? 12, 14 JH: Yes.  As part of a plea agreement to “Don’t sell drugs ever again.” 5, 6, 9, 12 AS: You said, “Sure.”  JH: Sure, no problem. 12 Child Protective Services never opened a case. 14, 16, 17 Had they opened a case then we’d be in a whole different story. 14, 15, 17 Then I’d have to follow their guidelines. 9, 10 We work with people who work for Child Protective Services. 9 Those things didn’t interfere with my ability to get the kids back.  That was only between me and my husband, ex-husband which when the girls were teenagers he called saying, “Please take them back. 7, 11, 14 Please!”  What happened, I had an accidental overdose. 13, 15 I had an accidental overdose. 13 I was shooting some heroin, we were with a gang of thieves going from town to town boosting from stores and buying heroin. 6, 9, 16 Just this terrible life. 10, 11 I’m caught up in this system and there doesn’t seem to be any way out. 6, 18 Apparently, obviously I went out, but apparently I did too much heroin and we were in an apartment building and the next thing I know I’m in a stairwell being revived with Narcan. 5, 9, 11, 12, 16, 19, 20 In 1996, December 28, 1996 it happened again but I’ll tell that story in a minute. 15 AS: Who revived you?  JH: Paramedics. 14 Somebody called paramedics. 14 They pulled me out of the apartment room that we were in and put me in a stairwell so that they couldn’t be identified. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14 This isn’t uncommon.  AS: Who put you there?  The other people I’m with. 9 AS: Just put you in the hallway and called the cops? 14, 18 Thank God they did that.  They call it a dump and I have been part of where we just dump somebody off in front of the Emergency Room because the fear is we’ve all got warrants or we’re doing criminal activity, we’re all going to jail. 8, 9, 10 We can’t get caught up in this whole thing.  I was revived by Narcan and yay.  I didn’t stop my drug use. 5, 6, 13 What happened December 27, 1996, a similar thing. 15 Still running around with people. 8, 9 Still not being a mom, still not working. 14 I had another overdose.  I was with a bunch of people. 9 We were in this motel and I remember going, “No, no, no, no.”  I knew what it felt like. 11, 16 That split second, you can’t take it back.  I thought I was dead or whatever. 16, 17, 18 I woke up on my own about twelve hours later. 15 I was still purple all around on my face.  I remember I was on the floor and my ID was next to me on the floor, on the carpet. 14 There was a Mexican motel maid kind of kicking at me saying, “You have to pay for another day.” 16 I woke up going, “What happened?” 15 My ID was left. 14 They thought I was dead. 16, 17, 18 They didn’t call.  They left my ID so I would be identified. 14 I had been part of that whole thing for a long time and that day I went, “I can’t.” 9, 16, 17 They left me for dead with my ID. 14, 16 AS: And you survived.  I remember when I woke up.  Some people call it divine intervention. 9 I didn’t see any bright lights. 6, 12 I didn’t hear God talk to me. 9 I woke up to a motel maid kicking me telling me I had to pay for another day. 15, 16 That experience transformed me. 17, 18 I got up and gathered myself and I called the only person that I knew I could call. 5, 14, 16 That was my ex-husband. 14 I said, “Take me to detox.” 19 In Oregon you can go to detox for any substance. 6, 19 Minnesota what the hell is wrong with us, you can’t. 11 You can’t go to detox. 19 You have to go to a hospital base but detox itself is alcohol only. 6, 8, 19 Unless you go to Hastings.  You can go there but the detox here in town. 19 AS: It’s just for alcohol? 6 JH: Yes.  That’s a problem too. 12 I shared that with the Lieutenant Governor. 5 Detox should be the funneling to an in-patient treatment bed. 12, 13 Save them now. 12 Reach out now. 12 Window of opportunity is this big. 19 If you miss that, we’re gone. 8, 11 AS: It might just be an hour. 15 It might be less than an hour that they’re willing. 15 I was fortunate because Oregon, they’re a little more progressive I think in a lot of ways. 18, 20 I went to detox. 19 Normally you can only stay ten days. 16 We were on a first name basis. 14 I pushed the button, “Hi it’s Julie.”  They go, “Hey honey. 8 Welcome home.”  I stayed for like three weeks because I kept saying, “I can’t go out there out there. 15 This is what I need.  I need to earn an honest day’s work. 8, 16 I need to be in a safe surrounding with other people who are supportive.” 9, 19 So they turned me on to a relatively new concept for Oregon then. 16 It was called Oxford House. 6, 13 Oxford House is a national organization. 6, 13 I have to credit the Oxford House group, organization for providing me with exactly what it was that I said I needed. 5, 6, 13 I went and interviewed at interviewed at an Oxford House. 6, 13 It was about thirty miles away from where I was living in Salem, Oregon. 18, 20 Moved in and I had two thousand hours of community service to do. 15, 19 I was lucky to do that. 8 I’m an articulate, well-educated woman. 14 I talked my way into that. 18 Otherwise I was going to jail.  I wasn’t going to shovel shit at the zoo or pick up trash on the freeway. 18 I came off and was very manipulative and said, “I want to give back to the community from which I took so much.” 19 It was all bullshit at the time, truly, but I don’t know what inspired me to do that but I wrote a proposal and the judge agreed. 5, 12, 18 I got these two thousand hours. 15 Oxford House is a non-profit. 6, 13, 15 Cool I live here.  There’s other Oxford Houses. 6, 13 I’ll go volunteer to do this, that, or the other.  What I ended up doing was I was part of the first Women’s Oxford House Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 Then I became part of the very first World Council for Oxford House. 6, 9, 13, 14 I started opening Oxford Houses. 6, 10, 13 I’ve opened thirteen altogether. 8 I even opened one here in St. Paul.  It fell apart. 9, 11 I was part of the state organization. 9 I was the national chairperson and the state chairperson all for Oxford House. 6, 13 That’s how I stayed, I started doing service work as they say. 19 Some people say, “It’s picking up trash and it’s making coffee at the AA meeting.” 9, 10, 18 There’s some truth to that because being of service to others takes you out of your own ego and your own misery. 17, 19 You start seeing things a little differently. 6, 20 That’s what Oxford House did for me. 6, 13 I was involved with Oxford House; I still am peripherally. 6, 13 AS: Did they use AA as a model? 6, 13 It’s different isn’t it?  They use abstinence and they suggest support group meetings. 6, 13, 18 It is based on the Oxford Group which was… 13 AS: Pre-AA.  JH: Yes.  They are abstinence only.  If people use in the house they do have to leave. 6, 9, 13, 18 It’s self-run and self-supporting. 8 For somebody like me who doesn’t like to have somebody tell them what to do it was perfect. 17 At that first house that I lived in the house voted and said, “Julie we want you to be treasurer.” 6, 7, 13, 14 I’m like, “Do you know who I am?” 12 I never took a penny. 16 I had a group of people trust me with something. 9 I never took a penny from them. 16 For me it was that somebody gave me an opportunity. 19 From then on I became president of the house and then I got to do other things. 6, 9, 10, 13 It just gave me something to do and an opportunity to start organizing things and getting involved in things. 19 It grew from this one small house to a national consideration. 6, 9, 13, 20 That was phenomenal for me. 12 After a few years of starting different Oxford Houses, women’s. 6, 12, 13, 14 I started a couple men’s too. 11, 12, 14 AS: Did you start them around the country? 19 JH: Nope. Just in Oregon.  I did one in Green Bay, Wisconsin and I did one here.  Eleven in Oregon.  There was a fund, Ecumenical Ministries administered the fund. 5, 12 It was a revolving loan fund.  We could borrow five thousand dollars to open up the house and then we would pay it back. 6, 13 That would keep the fund going.  That was phenomenal. 12 Oregon had that insight, foresight.  They have today next to Washington state I think they have the third most Oxford Houses in the nation. 6, 13, 16 AS: Is the equivalent kind of a sober house except that the people who are living in it are self-supporting? 6, 9, 13 That’s the big difference?  It’s self-run, self-governed under the umbrella of a 501(c)(3). 8 They elect officers. 8 It’s the inmates running the asylum. 8 So many people said that would never work. 9, 16 The beauty of it is that it’s exactly working.  AS: You also had life experience at a commune. 10, 18 I knew how to get along with people. 9, 16 AS: You knew that this could work. 16 I knew from the minute I walk in the door that this was a really cool deal. 15, 16, 17, 18 The self-run nature of it and the democratically, you voted on things. 8 A majority had to agree. 18 In fact, to vote a new member in it had to be eighty percent, not just a majority. 16, 18 It had to be eighty percent.  We got into the whole democratic process. 17 It just turned me on.  I got very excited about it.  After a few years my probation officer, Peggy Banister, was like “Julie you’ve completed your two thousand. 7, 8, 14 You’re done.”  I still didn’t stop.  What started as a real manipulative move on my part turned into be the one thing that changed my life. 9, 10, 13, 15 Who knew? 16 AS: We know what we need. 12 Even though it might look manipulative or seem manipulative some part of you knew that you picking up trash was not going to go anywhere. 6, 8, 9, 16 You needed something bigger.  Something that meant something.  AS: I’m not sure I’d characterize it as manipulative.  It may seem that way to you now. 6, 12, 18 I look back and I wasn’t being altruistic and going “I just really want to help people.” 9, 18 I want to get these hours off my plate so I can get on with this thing. 15 That created this life and now it’s been over twenty years where I haven’t had to resort to that kind of behavior. 10, 12, 14 Along the way I found healing. 18 I did some independent counseling. 19 I had to fire a few people along the way. 9, 18 I found a woman, her name was Janet, who got me, who understood me, who didn’t ask me dumb questions.  She was phenomenal at helping me heal some of those tragic things that had happened, the betrayal, the feelings of insecurity and I’m not good enough and I’ll never be enough and I’m too fat and I’m too ugly and I’m stupid. 10, 12, 15, 16 All that negative self-talk that we have that perpetuated this drug use. 5, 6, 13 I started my eighth or so Oxford House my ex-husband called and the girls were starting to have their periods. 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 18 He’s like, “Please.”  AS: Were you living in an Oxford House this whole time? 6, 13 JH: Yes.  You’ve got to live in them to teach how it works. 9 If you come in from the outside… 9 AS: When you say you started them you actually would go live in it? 7 JH: Yeah I’d go find them.  I was part of the housing coordination. 6, 9 I would go to Ecumenical Ministries and I’d apply for the loan and then I’d go find the house. 6, 12, 13 I’d talk the landlords into it.  I went to community forums and neighborhood association meetings. 18, 19, 20 AS: To convince people that it was okay to have you live there. 9 Partly because we were women it was easier than doing it with men. 12 It was much harder with men. 9, 12 When my ex called and said, “I can’t take this anymore.  You’ve been sober for a while.”  [Break in Recording]  AS: Your daughters hit puberty.  JH: Dad calls and says, “I can’t do this anymore.” 14, 16 There were no Oxford Houses for women with children. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 I’ve been used to this communal living for so long. 6, 13, 14, 16, 17 AS: Were you seeing your girls during this time? 6, 7, 11 AS: You were back in their lives.  I couldn’t be when I was out...I was hiding in the bushes at their school. 7 I did some goofy stuff.  I was a working girl and one of the strolls was in front of one of their grade schools. 5, 7 When all of that was no longer part of my life there was no barrier. 9, 10, 17 I was in their lives again.  They didn’t live with me.  My fear was how am I going to do this? 10 AS: How could you personally deal with this after?  JH: I’d been living communally.  How am I going to take care of these kids by myself on my own in an apartment? 5, 9, 11, 12, 19 That was scary to me.  They’re teenagers now. 12 I’ve got to buy tampons now and you’ve got hormones. 8, 12 AS: And you’re the only adult.  JH: Yes.  I opened the first women and children’s Oxford House. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 It made perfect sense. 17 It was a transitional thing for me. 17 It was the first women and children’s house in the state of Oregon. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 I think they have six now. 12 It’s still a tough thing to do because there’s so much trauma and so much work to be done on families that are broken. 8, 17 When you put them all together it gets a little… 8, 20 AS: It's like a women’s shelter. 12 Yes, but it’s self-run and self-governed. 8 But the thing about that and the thing about Oxford House is they have chapters. 6, 13 There were five different chapters in Oregon.  There were only three when I first started. 14 We developed chapters four and five. 14 With the chapters its five or six houses together and their presidents meet monthly. 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18 There’s a greater organization to come in and support. 20 We had the support of the chapter to come in and help us.  It wasn’t just in my lap.  I don’t know how to figure that stuff out. 12 We did have the support of the chapter.  My girls and I, I wished I would have thought of it, there was an article in the paper written about it. 7, 11, 17, 18 Do you still have it?  JH: Yes.  AS: I can still get a copy from you.  They’re interviewing me kind of similar to this and only one sentence out of the two hours I spoke with them did I mention that I had prostituted. 5, 12, 15 The headline is: “Julie Hooker Prostitute and Former Boozer blah blah blah.” 9, 14 I was on the front page in the newspaper. 15, 16 AS: You’re kidding me.  Yes, and I’m humiliated.  AS: Of course you would be.  That’s a horrible thing to do. 10 It was sensationalized because it’s supposed to sell.  AS: It was supposed to be celebrating the opening of the women and children’s... 5, 10, 12, 14, 20 I do have to have a copy of that.  That’s horrifying.  It talks about how the system is failing and there isn’t enough support and everything.  I’m like “Why would you do to me what you just did?”  Number one I’d never been interviewed before. 16 I didn’t know to watch what I said. 12, 17 I just was really naive. 18 I’ve learned a lot since then. 10 It could have devastating me and sent me the other direction because it was very traumatizing. 5, 18 AS: And what about what it would do for your girls and their friends? 7, 11, 16, 20 What it did do to my girls. 7, 11 What it did to my brother. 20 My brother read it in the paper and called my parents. 20 “Guess what she’s doing now.” 12 It was a nightmare.  It’s the whole stigmatizing thing. 9 Fortunately for me I was well enough at the time to say, “Okay bring it on.  I’m not ashamed of where I come from, what has happened has made me the woman I am today and I’m not ashamed of that. 14, 15, 16 You want to play that game wow. 17 You stoop to that okay whatever.”  After opening the women and children’s house it was great for my kids too because they had to learn how to cooperate with others. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 20 They had chores.  We had a board with a chore coordinator. 14 You’ve got to do this.  They’re like, “It’s not fair.” 9 I’m like, “Well welcome to cooperation.”  AS: You didn’t’ have to be the only bad guy.  It was that it takes a village kind of thing where we all loved and nurtured one another in that setting. 5, 14, 17 It was beautiful in that sense but not without drama. 5 It was beautiful in that sense.  I guess we did that for about a year. 14 Then I wanted to come back here to Minnesota because my parents were aging and they had, in my opinion, suffered enough with sleepless nights wondering if I was... 5, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 Because I had gotten well and had been doing so well I thought, “I’m going to come back here and I’m going to reinvent myself here in Minnesota. 17, 18 I was off supervision. 16 I didn’t have any ties left back there to repay. 14 I’d done everything that I needed to there.  The kids and I moved here in 2000. 7, 15 We left that behind and started fresh here. 14 Still I didn’t want to work with people like me. 9 I started an Oxford House and that’s how the kids and I when we first moved here, I stayed at my parents in Rochester for a little while. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 20 While I came up here because I had heard there was an Oxford House in St. Paul. 6, 9, 13 I was still involved nationally.  Paul  Molloy who’s the founder, he says “You should talk to Oxford House such and such. 6, 13 Here’s the address.” 5 I’m like, “Okay.”  I went and talked to them.  They’re kind of like, “Huh?”  It just didn’t have the same effect here because there were so many sober houses in St. Paul that were run differently because the inmates couldn’t run the asylum. 6, 8, 9, 13 That democratic process was not going to work in a house with people like us. 6, 9, 13, 17 Trying to break that, we’re talking the Hazelden huge billboard.  To come in and try to fly in the face of that model was not successful.  Although I did open a house, a women’s house. 6, 12, 13 Then almost as soon as I moved out it shut down. 7, 15 I just kind of said, “I’ll go in a different direction then. 18 Minnesota may not be the place to grow this model.” 10 Although it works really well in North Carolina, huge. 9, 18 Louisiana, my friend Mari Walker is going crazy in Louisiana. 20 Oregon and Washington, Texas.  Those five states.  Just among those five states I think there’s a thousand maybe, Oxford Houses. 5, 6, 13 It’s phenomenal. 12 AS: Do you think it was a political thing here, the reason it didn’t work?  Do you think it’s because of the influence of sober house industry? 6, 13 JH: And Hazelden.  The Minnesota Model…  AS: Their model is one that says you need to be monitored all the time and you’re not to be trusted. 5 You can’t be trusted.  It is kind of the Minnesota Model of treatment. 12, 13 I did my master’s thesis on it.  Ninety-five percent of treatment centers in the United States as of five years ago were abstinence only. 12, 13, 14 AS: You did your master’s thesis on the Minnesota Model?  JH: Not on the Minnesota Model but on abstinence versus harm reduction model. 5, 14 I know that harm reduction is not the antithesis of abstinence. 5, 12, 14 It’s a bridge.  Most people don’t see it that way. 6, 9, 18 “They’re just going to keep doing it if you provide them with clean syringes.”  The same thing happened with handing out condoms. 15 “They’re just going to have more sex if you give them condoms.” 12 No they’re going to have safe sex if you give them condoms. 12 I think that’s why it was really difficult. 10, 18 I used to have this spiel down because I said it all the time. 6, 13, 16 It was in the Ronald Reagan administration who made it law that this revolving loan fund shall be available in every state to provide the model for Oxford Housing. 6, 13 Oxford House started in 1978 by Paul Molloy in Silver Spring, Maryland which is a suburb of Washington D.C. Paul was a chronic alcoholic, politician, worked in the House or Senate or whatever drunk. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 He beat his wife. 20 He wasn’t a really nice guy. 18 They were living in a halfway house and the halfway house lost its funding. 6, 11, 13, 14, 18 They were all going to get kicked out of this house. 6, 13 Paul in his infinite wisdom.  He calls it he stumbled into it because he was drunk. 5, 8, 14, 16 He stumbled into this idea of a democratically run, we can do it ourselves, let’s not close this place, let’s do it ourselves. 8, 9, 10 That’s how Oxford House started was this guy’s vision. 6, 13 A bunch of drunks could get together and vote on whether they were going to purchase an electric can opener or get the hand crank one. 5, 8, 14 They had to vote on it.  That’s a true story. 5, 15 He said they had a debate for forty-five minutes over whether they were going to purchase one or a hand one. 8, 15 That’s the democratic process. 17 I think that model was supposed to have been open to all states.  Ronald Reagan made it law. 13 When I came here I quoted it.  I used to have the spiel down perfect and I don’t remember it now. 6, 12, 13, 16, 17 I came here and I spoke to somebody in the Department of Human Services about it. 9, 12 His response was, “I think we may have had something like that but I don’t think it’s in operation anymore.” 13 I went “That doesn’t even make any sense.”  So because I couldn’t access any money through any kind of revolving loan fund that’s when I went to Oxford House and said, “What do you guys got in the bank? 6, 8, 9, 10, 13 Will you help us open this house?” 6, 13 I talked to the landlord and brokered a deal. 5, 8 AS: Were these rental houses? 6, 9, 13 They’re all rental houses. 6, 9, 13 Oxford House cannot own. 6, 13 It’s a transient population. 17 AS: The loan is for an initial down payment of rent? 12 First and last month’s rent. 16 AS: But people pay rent to live there? 9 You have to pay to live there.  AS: The benefit is you’re living with other sober people and making your own rules. 9, 10, 13, 15 You’re being supported.  AS: It’s the same community support that seems to work. 6, 19 Yes, and it’s lacking.  We have a little bit of it with this GRH but with GRH housing it is run by somebody. 6, 8, 20 If that person is kind and gentle and considerate then that transition can be wonderful. 9, 17, 18 If that person is not, I can think of a place now that’s transitional GRH housing for men where the guy who runs it is just a jerk. 6, 8, 12, 17 He’s mean to people, threatening people. 9 “If you don’t tell me who did this I’m going to kick you all out.”  That kind of...  You lose power; you don’t have power in that GRH housing because it’s not democratically run. 6, 8, 9, 17 It was autocratically run. 8 Minnesota believes that that system has been working for them and that’s what they want to continue.  I disagree and I really support the Oxford House model. 6, 13, 18 But guess what?  There’s no money in it for anybody. 8, 10 There’s no money in it. 8, 10 There’s nobody running it. 8 They run themselves. 8 It’s hard to fight against that system here. 9 I just recognized that pretty early on. 10, 17 I’m not fighting this battle right now. 12 I started to work in the corporate world.  I was working for an inventory service company that did inventory and probably traded companies. 10, 14, 19 I’m good at it but I hate it. 10 I absolutely hate it.  What happened was almost everybody that I work with would come to me at one point or another and say, “This is what’s happening and I don’t know what’s going on.” 12, 15 AS: In their own life? 10 In their own lives.  Then I was like, “What are you doing?”  AS: People should pay me for this.  I decided to go back to school to become a licensed alcohol and drug counselor which was a great idea at the time. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 20 I’m still pleased that I did it but it led me to become face to face with a system that I can’t work in, this punitive abstinence only system where I was in trouble almost every place I worked. 19 I would get called into the office saying, “Julie you can’t do that.  Julie don’t tell people that story.” 9, 15 You know what I mean? 12 “Julie don’t.  Julie stop.  Write Julie up.  Julie’s a malcontent.”  I was like, “Oh my gosh.  You’re questioning yourself.  Meanwhile I’ve still got Gabor Mate over here.  I’d been reading In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts and I’m like, “I know that person he’s writing about. 12 I love the way he’s responding to that person.” 14, 18 Relationships are everything.  This whole notion of abstinence only and the punitive nature does nothing to repair the disease, it perpetuates the disease. 19 I left, not really left the field, but started working in mental health. 12, 14, 18, 19 In the mental health field there’s more harm reduction and a little more compassion. 5, 12, 14, 19, 20 I don’t know how else to put it. 12 I went to work for South Metro Human Services, they call themselves something else now. 12 I worked on an ACT team which is a sort of community treatment where we go to people out in the field. 9, 12, 13, 19 We meet with them. 18 They don’t come to our office.  I was their first LADC that they had hired. 5, 14 I got to try and do some of this, they call it integrated dual diagnostic treatment IDDT, it was truly integrating the two. 12, 13 It was there that I saw my approach, the way I’ve always been my entire life was not only accepted but encouraged. 10, 12, 18 I went, “Well how do we do this in the field of substance use treatment?” 6, 12, 13 My business partner and I over many cups of coffee and lots of lofty dreams narrowed it down to let’s do this. 5, 9, 16 He’s working for Health Care for the Homeless.  He’s working with this very damaged population with great need and lengthy substance use, chronic. 6, 13, 20 AS: Like the Portland Hotel Society.  Exactly like that.  AS: His name’s Eric?  JH: Eric Bacon.  Just the two of us starting having these conversations.  He’s an AA guy.  He’s an abstinence only but he’s in that little bridge where he says, “Okay maybe.” 5, 20 He’s supportive of the Minnesota Model and whatnot. 19 I am too but I’m also flexible in there are multiple paths. 17 There’s not one size fits all. 15 AS: There are people who know that they can’t touch anything because touching the one thing, the one beer, leads them back to meth. 6, 9, 12 Then there’s people who’re like “I can drink a beer every once and awhile. 5, 9 It’s not going to be a big deal.”  I am one of those people. 9 I was told, “Julie don’t tell people that.” 9, 16 AS: When you would say that at work?  JH: Yes.  “I had some champagne on Christmas Eve.”  “Julie don’t tell people that. 9 You cannot say that.  Are you sure you’re okay?”  I’m like what in the world?  As I had said earlier, it wasn’t ever really problematic for me. 12, 15, 18 The problem arose with other substances and the trauma and the betrayal and all those kinds of things that happened to me. 6, 12, 15 I don’t drink. 5 I don’t call myself a drinker. 5 I can drink and not have to have ten. 5 I can have a glass of champagne. 11 I don’t run and go look for some heroin. 8, 16 Early on I was in AA and NA.  I had a sponsor.  I was doing the deal because that’s all I knew and that’s all I was told. 16 I scratched the cornea of my left eye. 14 I don’t know if you’ve ever done that but it’s so painful. 6, 12 It’s very, very painful. 6 I went to the doctor and said, “I can’t have any pain medication because I’m an addict.” 6, 12, 14 I had a couple of years at this time of sobriety. 11, 12, 14 I’d been taught  You were a heroin addict. 14, 16 If you take that opiate medication you’re going to run right off.” 8, 12, 14 The doctors gave me a shot of Tordol which is just liquid ibuprofen. 11, 12, 14 I’m thinking it’s a shot so it must be good. 10, 11 It didn’t do anything for the pain. 6 It was horrifying.  I actually considered going to get some heroin because I knew that would relieve the pain. 5, 6, 7, 9, 16 What is happening here? 15 This is not cool. 17 My sponsor said, “Don’t do it.”  If you do it, you’re going to have to change your clean date. 13 I said, “I don’t give a shit.” 18 I called the doctor and said, “This isn’t working. 12, 14 Please give me something to relieve this pain because I can’t take it anymore. 6 I don’t want a bunch.”  He gave me ten Vicodin.  I didn’t take all ten at once.  I didn’t crush them up and snort them or shoot them.  I took them as prescribed, they relieved the pain. 6, 10 I had two left over a couple of days later. 11, 14, 16 I didn’t even take them all.  It didn’t reignite the dragon as I was told. 5, 13, 16 My sponsor fired me because I refused. 5, 6, 13, 16 She said, “You have to go to home group and tell everybody you’ve relapsed.”  I said, “I did not relapse.”  AS: But it’s really common. 18 It’s still the same today. 16 This was years ago. 13, 14 Even then I went, “This is not right.” 12 It didn’t happen. 15 What you said was going to happen didn’t happen. 15 I like to question things.  I’m a person of faith but I’m also a person of science.  If you can defend a position I’ll listen to you but if you’ve just got some knack and you can’t defend it, shut up.  That’s what she’d been told. 16 When I questioned it she fired me because I refused to go and humble myself before the group and say, “I relapsed. 5, 6, 8, 13, 16 I’m sorry.”  AS: Did you go back to that group?  I never went back to any. 16 I sought support elsewhere.  I understand support. 17, 18 I’m a communal liver.  I’ll probably be her when I’m eighty.  I’ll find a bunch of other eighty-year-old women; we can all live together. 8, 12, 14 I can find support but that wasn’t support to me.  That was adhering to a strict set of rules as it was in almost any treatment center I’ve ever worked in. 12, 13 Adhering to these strict set of rules. 13 That just doesn’t work for me.  When Eric and I opened this place we talked at length about what the curriculum would be, how we were going to do it, and what role we could play in bridging the gap between coming to us for an assessment and finding an inpatient treatment bed. 10, 12, 13 What we have found is that many people didn’t actually need that inpatient treatment bed. 7, 9, 12, 13 What they needed was the support that we have to offer, referrals for housing resources, but immediate engagement in some kind of program. 6, 12 AS: The minute that they walk in. 15, 16 And I’ve seen so much success with that. 6 This business is only two years old. 14 Last year we had forty-three percent growth. 10, 14 It’ll be even more than that this year. 14 AS: How many people can you serve? 9 Sixteen at one time but if we have more than sixteen then we’ll split and we’ll just have two different groups. 12 AS: Have you stuck at sixteen right now? 12 Yeah because we’re not ready to jump off yet because this house. 6, 13 We’re going to start our own housing which will not be strictly GRH. 6 We will accept some GRH beds but we’re going to have beds available for people who have self-security disability. 9, 12 There are seven hundred and thirty-three a month. 16 We’re not going to take six hundred of that.  We’re going to take three hundred.  We’ll take a percentage.  You can have a safe supportive place to live. 19 Minimal outside involvement. 9, 12 We’re going to go on a case by case basis. 17 I don’t believe in kicking people out for continuing to use. 6, 9, 13 I just don’t.  AS: How will you screen?  Case by case. 17 AS: What are your thoughts about screening? 17, 18 How’s it going to be like an Oxford House versus a sober house? 6, 13 There still has to be, if we’re going to accept GRH funding then there has to be somebody that runs the house. 6, 8, 12, 13 AS: GRH is?  JH: Group Residential Housing. 6, 9 It’s funded through the county, through the chemical dependency treatment fund. 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 AS: You will need someone on sight?  For this first house. 6, 13, 14 I have bigger plans.  I want to head in the direction that the overriding theme of this whole conversation today has been about the supportive nature of communal living. 14, 16, 18, 19 It sounds to people, you just shake your head and go, “There’s no way it will work.” 9, 14, 18 I beg to differ.  I have seen it work. 6 It’s still working.  I can’t even tell you how many there are now. 12 AS: Isn’t it fascinating how that if the idea is not present within your little realm and you haven’t actually seen it work how long you can convince yourself that therefore it must not be able to work? 5, 6, 7, 10, 17, 20 “We already have that here.”  Or “That will never work. 16 We tried an Oxford House in St. Paul.” 6, 13 JH: I’ve heard those stories too. 9 AS: Things are changing in the treatment world really fast. 12, 13, 17, 18 One thing I’ve heard and I’d like to know what you think about this that insurance companies are starting to look a little bit askance at how many times people are going into treatment, how much it costs and how high their rate of relapse is. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20 They’re not happy. 18 They’re losing a lot of money. 8, 10 They might start looking more favorably on programs like what you’re offering.  Do you think?  That’s kind of the goal although we didn’t come to that conclusion as a business model.  It has revealed itself to us.  AS: It reminds me of what’s happened with midwife assistant births. 15, 20 I was one of the first wave, after the 60s, in the 90s to use a midwife. 6, 13, 14, 20 I didn’t have a doula that came a little later. 20 I don’t even know the difference. 12 AS: A doula is someone who is just a labor support person.  To have a midwife assisted birth or to have a birthing center costs four thousand dollars or three thousand dollars but to go have that same baby in the hospital a natural birth costs fifteen. 8, 20 The insurance companies were like, “Let’s do it.” 10 It’s kind of reminding me of that system.  Very similar.  I think what will happen ultimately is it’s not like this was a novel idea that I just came up with and I’m that brilliant. 15 This is just the experiences that I’ve had in my life have led me to see that this is a viable option. 6, 10, 18 We have to operate within that little window of opportunity. 19, 20 The minute somebody calls. 15, 16 Right now if somebody were to call me and say, “Can I get a chemical health assessment?” 12, 13, 19 I’ll say, “Can you be here?  I’ll do it today. 16 If I can, I’ll do it today. 16 Or first thing tomorrow I’ll make room for you.” 14 Because I know that there’s that much. 12 For people that say, “I’ve got to have in-patient treatment.” 9, 12, 13 I say, “The beds are three to four weeks out. 15 I get that.  Can we get you started here?  So you can have access to services.” 9, 19 Sometimes those people end up not going to in-patient treatment because they’re receiving what they need immediately. 9, 12, 13 It’s intensive.  It’s four days a week. 15, 16 We have, this is the mental health room, we have two LICSWs. 12, 14, 19 We do the mental health diagnostic assessments. 12, 13, 19 They will do individual therapy with people and then they do group therapy every Tuesday. 9, 12, 16 Then we have the specialist with the LIDCs on board and integrating the two.  Our non-profit which is right down the hall. 12, 15 The guy that was just leaving today. 16 He got out of group at noon and was down there for two hours. 15 He got help doing whatever he was doing down there.  Getting some stuff done.  In house. 6, 13 AS: I don’t want to take the rest of your time.  I wanted to ask what is your assessment of what’s happening with the opioid epidemic. 12, 13, 15, 18 Is it going to get worse before it gets better?  Can you talk about what your take is on that and what we’re doing and not doing?  I have six years working in methadone. 6, 8, 14 I’m very, very familiar with the rules and regulations surrounding methadone. 6, 8, 13 I worked in methadone because I understand that population. 17, 18 Although I was never on methadone myself. 16 I understand the population and I can support that modality. 17, 18 Not permanently but as a tool.  I worked in methadone in six years. 14 While I was working in methadone my boss one day said, “Hey can you go to this meeting? 16, 18 The meeting was the Opioid Coalition. 18 It was at Fairview Hospital.  It was run by a woman named Mary Kay Bergstrum. 8 This is probably five, six years ago. 13, 14 I said, “Okay.  I’ll just be a representative for the company I was working for.” 5, 10, 14 I went to that meeting and went, “These are my peeps. 18 Yes.  I like this.”  Pharmacists, doctors, service providers, other methadone providers all focused on the opioid epidemic. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19 I had been a volunteer with Minnesota AIDS project handing out syringes. 5 I worked out of the ambulance and drove around and we passed out kits so people could have safe injecting materials. 5, 9, 13 I would walk around the park and handout condoms and syringes to people. 9, 16 I’d already been doing some harm reduction things. 5, 14 Meeting a group of people who had similar ideas was like, “Yay. 9, 18 We can get some stuff done here.”  Through that organization and through where I was working I met Lexi Reed Holtum.  This is probably six years ago; it was shortly after Steve died. 13, 14, 18 She was a warrior by herself.  We were at a sheriff’s conference or something and she just had a little table and she was on fire. 20 I was like, “I know her. 12 I just bonded with her right away. 12, 18, 20 She started attending the Opioid Coalition meetings. 18 I put her in touch with my dear friend Sarah Gordon who works with… 9, 20 AS: I know all these people. 9, 12 JH: Sarah and I are dear friends. 16, 20 Sarah and I met years ago because I was working in methadone and I wanted to do syringe exchange through methadone which thank God I’m doing now. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 There was some political reasons because I was a malcontent.  Hepatitis C and HIV instant testing at these sites where we have people, this population is highly prone to these diseases. 7, 8, 9 Sarah Gordon and I have been friends through that process. 16, 17, 20 Sarah was coming to the Opioid Coalition, no she wasn’t but Lexi had said, “We’ve got to try to introduce a bill and get this Steve’s Law.” 14 It wasn’t called Steve’s Law at the time.  The Good Samaritan 911.  “You know how to craft legislation?” 12 I said, “I don’t know how.” 12 But Sarah said, “I do.”  I said, “Well Sarah you and Lexi got to meet.” 18 Me and Sarah and Lexi all got together and then this spark turned into a flame turned into meeting Senator Chris Eaton and hearing her story and meeting Star Selleck. 8, 9, 15, 18 AS: You know her too? 12 I know these people. 9, 12 AS: We know all these same people. 9, 12 I can’t believe that you sat down right next to me. 12 There are other places I could have sat.  It’s very serendipitous.  I know all these people. 9, 12 AS: I’ve interviewed, I’m going to or I have.  Do you know Sue Purchase? 12 JH: Who doesn’t know Sue? 12 AS: I didn’t know Sue. 12 I talked to her for an hour today. 15, 16 JH: She’s in Colorado.  AS: I’m going to go there and interview her.  She’s phenomenal because she has twenty years of this thing behind her. 12, 14 She started syringe exchange in Minneapolis. 10 AS: Women with a Point. 12 Sue is phenomenal. 12 Mention my name.  We’re dear friends. 16, 20 She would carry syringes out of the back of her Subaru and I’d meet her at the park and we’d pass out syringes in Loring Park. 18 All of these very powerful women all ended up kind of at the same place at the same time. 10, 12, 17 Steve’s  Law was created in those conversations. 14 I became part of the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation. 9 I went to Congress to testify.  I sat in the bleachers waiting to be called on because I have a historical, I was saved by Narcan. 10, 15 I was happy to share that. 18 It was pretty phenomenal. 10, 12 AS: It was really powerful. 10, 17, 18 JH: Mishan Jenkins, I’ve sure you’ve met Mishan.  AS: She’s who I walked around with to talk to the Senators. 16 We were called the Narcan Girls walking around the halls of the Senate Office Building. 16 Going Senator to Senator saying, “Will you support this bill?”  It didn’t pass the first year. 14 We had to make some adjustments. 12 AS: It must have been the second year that I was involved. 14 It didn’t pass the first year because Sheriff Richard Staneck, although he’s a supporter, was not supportive of the letting the drug addict go free. 5, 6, 9, 14, 19 Have you ever met him?  He’s fricken huge.  He’s like six foot seven.  I was in an elevator with him and I’m like trauma.  “Oh my God I’m going to jail.”  AS: You were having your PTSD?  A little bit. 20 I have some stories there. 9 He’s a friend to the cause but he challenged quite a few of the points. 6, 13, 14, 20 The first year it did not pass. 14 Then we got the bipartisan support with Dan Schoen. 9 The powerful stories of the women, it broke my heart to hear these testimonies before Congress. 8, 9, 10, 12, 17 You’re a parent. 20 AS: You can’t deny a mother’s grief when it comes to this.  It stops you a little bit in your tracks. 16, 20 JH: Hearing the stories. 9 Star Selleck, we call each other twinsies because oftentimes in pictures we look like each other. 7 Somebody will respond to a picture she’s posted going, “Julie you look great.” 20 Star will go, “That’s me.”  The same thing happens with me. 15 We’re doppelgangers, not in person. 9 She’s a lot larger on the bottom than I am but our pictures. 9 It’s funny. 9 When Star and I first met, we met at public television did a thing on the opioid crisis. 13, 14, 19 AS: I’ve seen that. 6 We were in the audience for that one. 8 We sat next to each other and just bonded immediately.  She’s a nurse and she told me the story of as a nurse she knew what her son needed when he died on her kitchen floor. 14, 15, 16 The powerlessness she felt as a nurse she knew exactly what he needed and didn’t have it. 11, 16, 17 Powerful stories like that helped create the Steve’s Law as we know it today. 9, 12, 14, 16 I have two Narcan kits here.  I do the trainings.  Back when Dr. Satterlee was the open prescriber. 10, 16 It’s somebody new now. 12, 16 It was Dr. Satterlee initially. 16 That was the other thing, when Lexi was looking for somebody to have an open prescription I got Dr. Solum who was a prescribing physician at Valhalla Place Methadone Clinic, said he would sign on. 8, 10, 11 AS: What clinic did you work at?  I worked at STS to begin with and then I worked at Valhalla Place.  I got fired from Valhalla Place. 5 It’s the only job I’ve ever been fired from in my entire life. 5, 10, 11 That’s okay.  It messed me up quite a bit but I still stand behind, I have a point here and I’m not going to remain silent. 20 AS: Was it about all the drug testing? 5, 6 JH: Yep.  I’ll just briefly tell you a quick story. 15, 19 I had a client, I’d been in methadone for a long time and I’d had clients follow me from STS to Valhalla Place. 6, 8, 10, 17 I’d been working with them for years. 14 This is profound because it doesn’t happen in this field. 15 I had this phenomenal relationship and I understand this client very, very well. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 This client is traumatized and has significant trauma behind bodily fluids and things that have happened in bathrooms. 10, 11, 14, 15 I know this. 12 Every time a UA would come up she would just go into crisis mode.  The law states, the FR42 says you have to have at least eight a year. 13, 14 The methadone clinic, the state says once a month. 6, 8, 16 The Feds trump, pardon the expression, that law. 10, 13 She only has to have eight a year. 14 I would let her go and not have to UA because it would re-traumatize her every single time.  The thought was… 17, 18 AS: How long had she been on methadone? 6, 8, 17 JH: Years.  She was being re-traumatized over and over.  I think partly why she clung to me was not because I was saying, “You don’t have to UA today.” 9, 16 But because I was saying, “I’m not going to traumatize you again.”  She would come in and say, “I’m using but I’m not going to UA. 6 AS: She was willing to admit to using to go ahead and get in trouble but didn’t want to do the UA. 6, 14 Because of the punitive nature. 19 There was another kid…  AS: She’s not being dishonest. 8 There was another kid who had something similar, a young guy, who had some horrible events happen to him. 10, 15 Having to provide a urine drug screen that was witnessed, that was his thing. 5, 6 He couldn’t have anybody come in that room with him if he had to pee in a cup because of things that had happened to him. 14, 15 He would literally roll up in a ball and cry.  The belief was that he was hiding something and he wanted to go in there by himself so that he could bring in adulteration urine. 6, 18 What little you know of me today, I couldn’t sit by. 12, 16, 20 I didn’t get into this field to do that.  AS: Especially given what we know about trauma, sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress disorders. 6, 7, 12, 13 Why can’t we integrate that?  That’s a whole other story. 15 I understand that when people are using other substances adding methadone on top can be dangerous and deadly. 6, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 I get that.  I truly do.  There has to be another way. 18 AS: There has to be some exceptions to the rule. 13 I made those exceptions.  AS: And then you got fired? 5 Not just for that but that was over a long period of time. 17, 18 Write ups for those kinds of things.  I wear it like a badge of honor today. 16 At the time it was…  AS: I’m sure it just killed you at the time. 14 It devastated me.  I am the one true thing that’s working here with this movement and I’m being deemed a malcontent. 5, 12, 15 What the hell is happening here? 15 AS: Often people that are forward thinking, we get in trouble. 9 We push the boundary.  It’s been most of my life. 10 As funky as that was when it happened it laid the groundwork for this to become the reality because in essence I can’t be the square peg in the round hole. 15 I’ve got to make my own way and follow it through because there’s a part of me that says this is real and true and this is good, let’s move towards this. 5, 9, 10, 15, 18 This is the beginning of that bridge, bridging the gap in treatment, having treatment available today right now. 11, 12, 13, 16 Outpatient chairs are available all the time.  They’re always available. 18 The worry is they’re fine when they’re here for three hours and then they have to leave. 11, 15, 18 AS: How do you keep them?  We have a case management services organization who says, “Come in. 12, 17, 19 What do we need?”  AS: After group, how can I help you?  He was here for two hours after group getting help. 15 That to me is the essence of why we do what we do because we bridge that gap.  Although I can go into the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and say, “These are barriers.”  Change doesn’t happen overnight. 15 I know that and we’re talking and it could be a decade before things really change. 12, 14, 18 What are we doing in the meantime?  I don’t know that it will work or not but can we try this? 12 Can we try that?  We know what doesn’t work and we keep doing it. 12 That drives me crazy. 5, 20 To go back to your question about the opioid coalition and the opioid crisis. 13, 14 That’s been an ongoing thing.  I’ve watched it happen. 15, 17 I’ve over the years lost, personally I’ve lost nine friends during my addiction which was devastating. 11, 12, 14, 16, 20 I go to the vigil every year and I call out their names as a way of honoring. 14, 16, 18 Then I hold hands with Chris Eaton and Mishan and we just love one another. 14, 17 My goal here is we have, I have people coming in all the time. 9 I just had a kid last week, twenty-four-year-old, Caucasian, middle class, white kid. 7, 14, 15, 19 Started on some pain pills. 6 Couldn’t get anymore, got cut off abruptly and found heroin. 16 That’s kind of what killed Steve Rummler too. 14 AS: It’s what kills a lot of them.  It kills a lot.  He came in last week and I said, “Here’s what I can do.” 15 I gave him some options.  These are my people; I know what options you have. 9, 12 “What do you want to do?”  He said, “I want to get stabilized on methadone so at least I’m not sick. 6, 8, 15 Then I want to do treatment.” 12, 13 I said, “Okay.  He’s living with mom, he’s not working, he has a girlfriend who’s living with her mom. 7, 14, 20 They have a son who’s been taken by the state.  This is not uncommon.  AS: My expression is because I’ve heard all this before. 9, 10 My challenge to him was maybe some longer term support. 5, 17 I said, “You can recycle through these.”  “I need in-patient treatment.” 12, 13 What does that mean to you?  What’s going to happen at in-patient treatment? 12, 13, 15 You get out of mom’s house and eat different food for a month?” 6, 13, 14, 16 AS: And not have to think about…  Not take action, not think about it.  AS: Which actually could slow down your progress when you get out. 7, 10 My challenge to him was, and he’s doing it right now, he’s at a methadone program. 12 I know if he’s not stabile then he’s not going to be able to participate here. 9, 12 He’ll be off and running. 8 I stay in touch.  I’ve called him twice already to stay in touch with him.  Once he feels stable, meaning he can make it twenty-four hours without being sick or close to it, to come here. 9, 10, 12, 15 Then from here we’re going to help him find a place to live, find some employment, help him find some purpose and meaning to his life to empower him to get up off mom’s couch. 10, 12, 14, 17 She’s doing his laundry for him, cooking his meals for him. 5 Yelling at him because he keeps using. 6, 15 I can’t fix her.  I got him sitting here.  I’m going to help empower him to do exactly what I did. 17 AS: And what a twenty-four-year-old man should be doing. 14 JH: Yep.  What’s happening? 15 AS: Parents are part of the problem right now. 9, 12 JH: Right now for him in that case. 12, 17 AS: In this era, in this generation of parents we are definitely part of the problem. 9, 12, 20 JH: The enabling.  AS: When I was nineteen I couldn’t imagine having to live at my parents’ house for more than a month. 6, 13, 16, 20 JH: I couldn’t wait to get out.  AS: I loved them, everything was fine but it was nothing anyone did. 11, 14 You were gone. 8, 11 You wanted independence. 18 I wanted to see who I was. 6, 18 AS: They don’t even want their driver’s licenses now. 5, 12, 13 When my daughter turned eighteen she was still kind of lounging around.  I said, “You’ve got until spring.  You’ve got to figure it out.”  Spring came and she was not making any progress. 10 I said, “It’s spring.  Guess what?”  “I don’t have any place to go.”  “Why don’t we get a job? 11 Let’s do that.  You have until this time to get a job. 11 You better get off your butt and go look.”  There was a lot of, people call it tough love, it’s not tough love at all. 9, 14 It’s just straight up love. 14 I love you enough to say no to you. 14 AS: To teach you how to be independent.  That’s what my goal has always been. 18 I did well and then I did shitty and then I did well again. 18 Let’s keep going with the well.  AS: How are your girls today? 7, 11, 16 My youngest daughter is a buyer for Macy’s.  AS: How old is she?  And the thirty-three-year-old has two children, both out of wedlock. 5, 14, 20 One when she was fifteen, sixteen.  She struggles with some alcohol and marijuana use. 6, 13 She’s coming around.  I don’t enable.  I will support but not in the way of “Here’s some cash honey.” 8, 18 I’ll bring some groceries over every now and again. 12 I’ll put some gas in the car.  I’ll always be there to love and support and guide. 14, 18 She’ll say, “Will you please take off your counselor hat for once?”  I’ll say, “It’s permanently affixed to my head.” 14 AS: So you have grandkids.  I have grandkids, yes.  The gift there is that they’ve never known me like that. 11, 12, 16 My kids did but they’ve never known me like that. 11, 12, 16 That’s a gift that it stopped.  They say recovery is possible.  We do recover.  One last thing and I kind of brought it up to you….  AS: I’m so glad you just remembered because I almost forgot. 5 You know Gloria Englund? 12 AS: Yes.  JH: Gloria and I were in the bathroom just before I came back and sat down with you. 14 I saw her out in the hallway and went to the bathroom. 14, 18 You know, women we’ve got to go bond in the bathroom. 12, 14 She pees in one stall; I pee in the other.  “How are you doing Gloria?”  “Oh great Julie.” 20 She got locked into that stall.  She was going crawl out from underneath.  I go, “Gloria stop.  We’ll help you get out.”  She was going to crawl underneath.  “It reminds me of being stuck in the birth canal.”  I was like, “Oh my God.  Gloria you’re just so bizarre.”  We started laughing about that and we somehow or another came up to doctors. 8, 12, 14 I don’t know how it shifted from that. 8, 12 She had said something to me, “Are you still being treated poorly?” 12 It reminded me.  It keeps happening. 15 All these years of sobriety or recovery or whatever it is you want to say. 12, 14 AS: Twenty.  I’m a taxpayer and a voter and a productive member of society. 12, 14 When I was fifty, I’ll be sixty this year but when I was fifty I went to have a colonoscopy. 14 I don’t think I showed you but I have really significant scars on my arms. 11, 18 These are abscesses and tracks from injecting. 13, 16 These will never go away. 16, 18, 20 You can tell they’re old.  They’re not fresh.  There’s nothing fresh about them.  AS: They’re white and they’re not… 19 That’s arms.  I have some on my breasts and on my legs.  I went in to go have a colonoscopy.  I told the prep nurse, they want you to have the IV in this hand because you have to lay on this side. 9, 10, 16 I said, “You won’t get a vein here.”  “I’m a professional.”  “No, trust me.  You won’t get a vein there.  This is how we’ve got to do it.”  I’m explaining it to her.  She goes to tell the doctor and it pisses him off. 12, 14 AS: That you need to turn the other direction? 18 JH: Yes, no.  That I have to use this hand instead of this. 6, 13 Now my hand is hanging out over the edge of the bed where the guy who’s monitoring my, it’s fentanyl and versed that they give you to calm you down. 18 AS: It is fentanyl?  Yeah it’s fentanyl and versed which are pre-op drugs and anti-anxiety. 5, 6, 10 He’s already mad at me and I can tell.  I’m like, “Whatever.  Shut up.”  I feel kind of some of what he’s doing.  I remember moaning a little. 20 I like I felt that. 11 He said, “If you think you’re getting some more fentanyl you’ve got another thing coming.”  This is a true story. 5, 15 I’m laying there going, “What the hell?  What is happening right now?” 12, 15 I’m compromised.  Really?  AS: He thinks you’re drug seeking during your colonoscopy? 5, 6, 17 JH: Yes.  I’m thinking, “Then you’re really much less educated than you come off. 14, 18 If I want drugs I don’t have to come here and have you do this. 5, 6 I’ll go buy some” Good  Lord what is your problem? 12 Really?  I’m so mad at him.  AS: Didn’t you know that was the new thing to go get a colonoscopy? 12, 16 JH: I’ve heard, I won’t mention him by name, but I did have a doctor who worked at the Valhalla Place who was prescribing methadone physician. 9, 10, 12, 14 He and I would chat quite often. 11 He said, “You know, I just hate when those drug seekers come into the ED. 5, 6, 12 I’ve been working in the ED for years. 14 First thing I do is get them the hell out of there.”  I would say, “Richard why not help them? 9 Why would you just immediate disdain?”  This is just a few years ago. 13, 14 It’s still very common.  I wrote a letter of complaint.  My daughter was there to drive me home, I was sedated. 5, 13 I was telling her. 15 She was like, “Mom this has to stop.”  Stuff like that happened a lot. 15 I wrote a letter, nothing happened. 15 I didn’t even get a response. 13 Basically like, “Shut up you drug addict.” 5, 6, 14 I’m well enough to where I can take that but I’m mad as hell.  AS: It’s like the stigma of incarceration that you did your time but you still pay for it the rest of your life. 9, 10 That’s a whole other story because that did happen to me too because I have felonies. 15 That was a nightmare in and of itself.  It’s just one thing after another.  I went on a cruise with my brother. 20 We were up on the deck on the last day. 14, 16 It was cloudy and I got sunburnt like really bad on my legs, so much so that they were swelling. 18 I worry about a clot.  I went to Regents.  AS: Why would you get a clot?  When you have swelling like that and the skin swells then you can get a blood clot because the swelling constricts the veins. 14 I’m worried about that.  I know my veins quite well. 11, 12 I’m worried I’m going to have some kind of clot. 14 I go to the emergency department, it’s bad. 9, 12, 19 It’s a pretty significant burn. 10, 11 The guy comes in and he’s looking at my legs.  I do have scars on my legs as well which are much more pronounced now that my legs are all swollen. 12 He can see my arms and he says, “I’m going to go get my attending.” 6 I went, “Oh God here we go again.”  The attending comes in and looks at my burns and then looks at me and says, “I hope you know we’re not going to prescribe any pain medication.” 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 I said, “I’m here for the burn.  What I want is some cream to help my burns.  I wonder why you would think that was my first reason?” 14 I went and got a burn on purpose?  What is your issue here? 13 I’m just flabbergasted.  I could name a dozen other times where something similar has happened. 15 AS: You’re a middle aged white woman. 7, 19 JH: Well educated. 14 AS: They’re kind of going to this extreme.  These aren’t fresh.  AS: They’re not pink.  I can see sort of if they were fresh. 6 AS: And if you looked strung out. 8 Then the reaction should be, “Honey what can we do to help you? 8 Let me offer you some resources before you leave here today. 16, 18 What are you injecting? 13 Is it heroin? 16 Let me send you home with a Narcan kit.  Do you know where you can go to get help?” 12 They still don’t with me.  Not with that doctor but with another one I got a rash, a really bad rash, just external, no bumps just weird discoloring on both ankles. 8, 12, 14, 18 I thought “What the heck is this?” 17, 18 Three days later it was still there and maybe I should go have it looked at. 5, 16 She didn’t even look at the rash.  She just looked at my arms and my legs and started scolding me.  I wouldn’t even let her.  I was so mad at this point.  This is probably the tenth time it’s happened to me. 15 Okay lady now we’re having it here. 12 I stopped her and I said, “I have eighteen, nineteen years free from addiction. 12, 14 How many years do I have to have before you stop treating me like this? 13, 14 Thirty?  Do I have to be dead?” 16 I remember saying that.  “Before you stop treating me like this.” 13 She was mad.  How dare I question her?  She went even so much as to humiliate me.  The rash is here on both ankles but I’m in a gown.  She comes over and lifts, I’m totally naked, she lifts up the gown.  She asks me first, “Do you have it anywhere else?” 8, 14 I said, “No it’s just here on my ankles.”  She comes and lifts the gown in a humiliating fashion until I pull it back down.  I was so mad.  How many years do I have to have? 14 My goal is here, I’m a huge advocate for change and faces and voices and recovery, I’m on board. 17 I do with the groups, I’m the one who comes in to do the advocacy training. 8, 12 You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. 12 You have the right to be thought of as capable of changing. 12, 17, 18 Those kinds of things.  I have a room full of people who don’t know that, who’s doctors talk to them the way they talk to me. 9, 12, 14, 18 Only their fresh and still immersed in the…  AS: In the shame.  JH: They can’t fight back.  I refuse to let their voices not be heard. 6, 9, 13, 17 That’s my big goal, a very lofty one.  It’s hard to change. 9, 14 AS: Little by little the acorn said. 20 I want to be heard in that respect. 9 One of the things that both my parents, my dad is eighty-six and my mom is eighty-three. 14, 20 The two of them will look at each other and go, “What?  That kind of thing, having become who they always knew I could be. 16, 18 AS: They say that to you.  The person that they always knew I could be. 16, 18 The people who in my opinion have the right to judge or question me are the people who support me the most. 9, 12 They don’t judge or question.  They say, “Oh my God.  You have emerged.  We always knew you were there.” 16, 18 What I’d like to see happen. 6, 15 Other people’s families may not have that same insight or support. 9, 17 Many people’s families are not. 9, 17 I want to help be the advocate and the supporter, this is a safe place to be.  This is a safe place where you can come in and say, “Bobby showed up last night with a rock and we smoked it.” 14 “Okay, let’s talk about that.”  Instead of saying, “You’re out.  Get out.  Come back when you’re ready.  You’re not done yet.”  That’s what I heard. 9 AS: I’ve heard that. 9 My daughter’s heard that. 9 What is done? 8 Dead?  People say, “You have to hit rock bottom.” 9, 14 Rock bottom, I kept digging a deeper hole. 9 There was no rock bottom, only death. 9, 14, 18 That is a ridiculous way to look at what is happening here. 14, 15, 18 The way to look at it is with love and compassion. 14, 18 The old tools aren’t going to work with the opioid epidemic. 13 AS: They’re not working because people are dying. 9 The really cool thing that has happened in the last decade and the most significant because I remember when it happened. 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 When Hazelden said, “While maybe we should look at some Suboxone because our recovery rate for people…” 5, 8, 9 They had so many people die. 9 Steve Rummler was one of them.  You know that right? 12 He went to Hazelden, they got him off every medication he was on. 14 Told him he couldn’t be on any medications. 14 That was the problem. 12 Sent him home with no medications and an opioid addiction. 12, 13, 14 He tried and couldn’t.  The easiest thing for him to find was heroin. 16 He bought heroin for the first time, did it, and died the same day. 14, 16 I’m not blaming Hazelden, I’m not.  Please don’t hear that. 9 That model.  AS: I agree with you one hundred percent.  It’s dangerous, especially with opiates. 11 Although we can and do recover, it took a long time for my brain to heal. 13, 17 It took a long time and it was really only through diligence and perseverance and going to do things outside of myself for other people that helped me stop obsessing on that warm... 9, 17, 18 They just out of the blue in the last ten years, Dr. Mars Sepala bless his heart, he dipped a toe in the water. 9, 14, 16 How did he put it?  They were going to do research.  “Let’s at least research because our addressing the opiate dependence problem is maybe not as… 5, 12 AS: It’s kind of an emergency.  You think?  AS: Thank you.

"14","Evanson_Robin","Jeff Kazel Narrator Sara Ludewig Sam Aamot Interviewers May 19, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Jeff Kazel-JK  Sara Ludewig-SL Sam Aamot-SA SA:  First we'll have you state your name and tell us you give us permission to record this.  My name is Jeff Kazel, and you have permission to record the interview.  SL: We're at the Duluth Building for Public Safety.  Today is May 19th, 2017. 16 SA: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your childhood, or your background, before we get into the work you do here? 14, 20 JK: Okay.  I was born in New York and came out to Duluth when I was in Kindergarten. 14 I grew up in Duluth. 20 I ended up going to college here in Duluth. 7, 14 I joined the army—served in the army for a couple of years and then came back. 8, 11, 14 I eventually got into law enforcement here. 5, 8, 12, 13 SA: Did you go to college? 7 I went to College of St. Scholastica.  SA: Do you want to talk about starting off in the Building of Public Safety?  What you were doing right away when you got here? 12, 18, 20 JK: Well, we haven't always been here. 18 This is the new building. 16, 19 We moved up here in 2012. 7, 15 We were downtown before.  SL: Can you tell us about the OARS program?  What it does, how it got started?  JK: I wasn't one of the founders, but I joined the OARS group in 2014 when I became the commander of the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force.  The group was put together to look at ways of combating the issues we were experiencing with the opioid epidemic in this area. 8, 12, 13, 18 SA: Is the Lake Superior Task Force for a bigger area? 8 Our task force is now—we just merged with another task force in January of this year. 8, 12, 14 Our area of operation is from all of St. Louis County, Carleton County, Lake County, and Douglas County in Superior [Wisconsin]. 8 SA: Did you merge with that task force because you felt like that would better serve your mission? 8, 11 JK: There were many different reasons.  Some of it was grant funding and the criteria that task forces needed to continue to get funding. 8, 14 They were our northern partners and it was the right thing to do. 8, 9, 12 Now that we're finding that our contacts with north and south St. Louis County are a lot--the fact that we did the merger was probably a really good thing. 10, 18 SA: What do you do on a typical day? 16 What are you doing with OARS?  JK: With OARS we normally meet once a month. 16, 18 I'm part of the law enforcement and more of the proactive side of the OARS group. 8, 9, 12, 13 We deal with the enforcement side and trying to reduce the amount of drugs that are coming up to this area. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 We realize that just enforcement alone wasn't going to be enough. 8, 12, 13 That was part of our reasoning to going to the OARS group and trying to look outside of the box, and more than just enforcement action. 8, 9, 12, 13 It comes down to economics.  You guys have taken economics in college, I'm sure, and it's supply and demand. 7, 9, 13 We deal with the supply and people that are sending the supply, but we never really looked at the other side of the equation—the demand. 9, 13, 16, 18 By going to OARS we brought in lots of partners that deal with the demand side. 9, 12, 16 We talk about reducing—we have a pool of addiction here in this area, specifically this area. 5, 8, 12, 14 That's why we had so many people coming here to sell because they know that there're people that are going to buy. 9, 12 We talk about reducing the pool of addiction. 5, 12, 14 Turning off the tap of people going into that pool. 9 Getting into the schools and talking to young kids and say, ""Hey, do you really know what that pill does? 7, 12, 18 And what could happen if you become addicted to it?"" 12, 14, 15 The fact that a prescription for Oxycontin is no different than a [unclear] of heroin down the street. 10, 16 It's the same stuff.  Getting that message out to reduce the tap—turning off the tap—of people going into the pool of addiction. 5, 9, 12, 14, 20 But also taking people out of it. 9, 11 The people that are addicts that are overdosing continually throughout the year—looking for a way of getting those people out of the pool of addiction. 9, 12, 14, 18 If we reduce it at that end we are going to make it a less attractive area for people. 5, 8, 9, 14 SL: What year was OARS started in Duluth. 14 JK: I'm not the person to ask.  Like I said I didn't found it.  I think it was like 2013, but I'm not sure.  SL: When did you get involved with it?  JK: I got there in 2014.  Is there anything that has changed since you started in 2014 until now? 12, 13 JK: I think we've morphed into—it used to be more informational, and partners getting together and saying, ""Hey, this is what we're seeing. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16 This is what's happening."" 15 When I got there that was great, good to have that information, but we realized that we needed more than just information. 10, 20 We needed to start moving on the demand side and reducing the demand. 5, 9, 14 Myself and a few other members that joined the group really started working on getting the word out about what's going on. 18 I started digging into the statistics specifically for this county. 19 I think it was the 2015 report from the Minnesota Department of Health. 9, 12, 13 That came out and I looked through it and I was like, ""Wow, this is—we know we have a problem, but I've never really been able to quantify what it is."" 12, 16, 18 When that came it was like, okay, this is our issue. 13 We are number one in mortality rate of opioid related mortality in the state. 13 We've been number one or number two for the past five years. 14 That right there says a lot. 12 SA: Do you find that opioid addiction and the drugs coming in here—is that the largest problem in the area? 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 I know you said the mortality rate is the highest, but does that influence a lot of issues? 7, 12, 13 When you're dealing with drugs—earlier I said it's economic—when there's big money involved and it's underground or black market you're going to have people willing to commit crimes to get money for this type of [unclear]. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15 Yeah, it drives other forms of criminal elements in the area. 5, 8, 12 SL: Is there anything that you wish people knew about OARS, or the opioid epidemic in the Duluth area? 8, 9, 13, 16 JK: I think we are doing a good job of getting the information out. 10, 11 We have an awesome core of people that are willing to do presentations and talk with the media. 5, 9, 10 We are working on a forum for the legislation to come to Duluth to talk about some of our problems. 12 Looking on the legislative side some changes in the laws would help us out. 6, 9, 13 The OARS group is more proactive.  SA: What does it look like when you are dealing with the demand side and getting people out of the pool? 9 JK: We're right in the middle of a grant process. 7, 12, 17 We've applied for state grants and federal grants that are coming up later in the year. 8, 14 We're hoping to get it.  The program that we proposed—let's say we've had an individual that's overdosed on the street and they call 911.  We get a police response that shows up, and we have Narcan on our officers now. 8, 12, 13, 17 A lot of that was credited to OARS and the work that they did. 5 But they give the person Narcan, and part of our protocol is that person goes to the hospital. 8, 9 So as it stands right now that person will be treated, stabilized, and most likely will just be released. 12 And nothing really happens. 15, 18 What we're finding is that people are overdosing again. 9 Sometimes it's the police that are giving them Narcan and it's multiple times. 8, 17 They're overdosing and [unclear] unresponsive.  We looked at that and said, ""Yeah, that's just a loop that needs to be changed."" 13 In 2014 they came up with the Good Samaritan Law, and it made it easier for people to call 911 and they can ask for help for someone who is overdosing, which is really—what they problem and the cost is it left a loophole in the law. 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 We are no longer prosecuting people for a fifth degree amount of illegal substance like we were in the past. 6, 9, 17 But, the good thing is that more people are calling. 9, 10, 16 The bad thing is in the past we were prosecuting those people and they were getting into the system and the system was saying, ""Hey, you need to get into treatment."" 9, 12, 13 Those people aren't getting that referral anymore. 9 They're not getting that step into treatment, pushing them to get out of that pool of addiction. 12, 13, 14 So we said, ""What can we do to go after that?""  We proposed a project coordinator where a patrol goes to an overdose and if they distribute Narcan to somebody who is an OD if not that same day then the next day we track down that person and say, ""Okay, we know you overdosed. 5, 12, 16 Here are some of your options.""  The sooner we can do it the better. 8 Once that person is stabilized we say, ""Hey, we know that you're having issues. 12, 13 There are some things that you can do to get out of this state.""  Having that person, having that direct contact with resources we've found has been very important. 9, 18 The other issue that we have is the wait. 13 Say you have somebody that says, ""Yeah, I've got a problem and I want treatment."" 12, 13 You get a Rule 25 Assessment on the person. 12 Well, you're looking at two to three weeks before they can get into treatment. 12, 13, 15 What does that person do in two to three weeks? 15 SA: Change their mind.  JK: They change their mind.  Right, so the other part of the project with our chemical treatment plan is they want to have some extra beds for individuals that say, ""I want to go to treatment and I need help."" 5, 9, 12, 13 It's a safe place to get somebody that's ready to go away from the other ailments that are making them go back to the pool of addiction. 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 So, you've got the two week, three week waiting period for the person [unclear] and get them to treatment. 12, 13, 15, 18 That's kind of the progression of that.  That's between the police department, the county, the treatment facilities. 8, 9, 12, 13, 19 They all come together at OARS and put this plan into play. 8 SA: What would you say is the hardest part of your job in terms of working with these populations or this issue? 9, 11, 13, 17 JK: I would say the hardest part is dealing with the individual on the street as far as for officers. 8, 9 And if we have a death. 18 We've done many forums and we talk about the issues. 12, 13 And more and more of these forums we have family members of people who've passed show up and they'll hold signs up. 9, 11, 12 We've brought several of them up to speak and to talk about what's been going on.  It's really hard to look at a mom in the eyes and say, ""I'm sorry."" 9, 14, 18 It's not an easy thing to say, ""I'm sorry that you lost you're kid because he wasn't aware that this was the risk he was taking when he did this."" 11 For me that's the hardest part. 9 SL: Would you talk more about the educational programs you're doing in schools and at these public fourms you've talked about? 7, 14, 15, 19 What do they look like?  We just sent some of our school resource officers to the new D.A.R.E. program. 5, 7, 8, 16 There was a lot of controversy about the old D.A.R.E. program, and there were some details that didn't work.  This is the new program. 16 They do have statistics that show that this is much better.  We're doing a good job of getting the information to the kids. 10, 11 We do forums for just about anybody who asks for them.  We do find that there are high school kids that will show up. 7 They want to know. 12 I guarantee you that you go to the high schools and junior high schools and you ask them about the pills in their mom and dad's medicine cabinents and getting them to understand that the pain pill that mom got for her knee surgery and the heroin that's being sold down on the street are the same thing--that's huge for a kid to [unclear]. 6, 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 SA: Do you find you travel around the area more or are you staying in Duluth? 7, 8 JK: Well, with the new task force we're going all the way up to the Canadian border. 8, 16, 18 We're traveling a lot.  SA: Do you find you have a most vulnerable population?  Maybe in the rural areas? 8, 20 I haven't really dug into that yet, but I'm sure there're probably some correlations with who's being [unclear]. 18 But what I've seen is the movement is more of a younger crowd, which is really scary. 6, 12, 15, 18, 20 A good example: 10 we conducted a drug [unclear] operation where we arrested some people. 5, 6, 9, 14 A nineteen-year-old kid we ended up arresting for buying heroin. 14, 16 He talked to us and told us a little about what was going on, and what he said is that when he was seventeen he played high school football and got hurt—hurt his leg—and ended up having surgery. 7, 16, 20 He was prescribed painkillers to get through the incident, and two years later after the pills dried up and he couldn't get them on the street he came over to this area and bought heroin to feed his addiction. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 Last winter, or last fall, a fifteen-year-old girl, high school cheerleader, we ended up arresting buying heroin. 7, 14, 16 We actually stopped her right before she shot up. 7, 11, 12 It's scary.  SA: Any other stories you're comfortable sharing that have made an impact on you? 9, 18 JK: Our task force has done an incredible job. 5, 8, 11 Statistically we've doubled the number of search warrants than we've done in the years past. 14 We're well above the numbers that we've had the past few years. 14 They're really stepping up their game and handling the law enforcement side [unclear]. 8, 9, 12, 13, 18 We're trying to make this the most hospitable place to conduct business. 14 I think we've done a good job of doing that. 10, 11 That's kind of what [unclear] out there.  SA: Are the arrests mostly people buying or selling? 9, 12 JK: Selling.  And that's the big thing.  People get confused that, oh, we're just arresting people that are users. 6, 9, 13, 16 Sometimes they get caught in the mix when we do a search warrant on a house because there are people selling [unclear]. 6, 9, 13 But our main focus are the people who are taking advantage of our pool of addiction. 9, 11, 12, 14 And that's what it is is pure greed.  It's sickening because the people who are doing it are not—the majority of them are not using the product that they're selling. 6, 9, 14, 15, 18 They're here to make money and take advantage of people. 8, 9, 10 Here they double or triple the amount they would make anywhere else. 8 SL: What sort of community organizations does OARS pair with? 19 How does the police department work with other organizations in Duluth? 8, 9, 12, 19 JK: We work with everybody.  That's part of our mantra, I know. 9, 12 We're always looking to work with the community. 18, 19 When you have problems and you can bring more people to the table that have skin in the game it makes things a lot easier. 9, 12 This organization recognized that a long time ago. 13, 17 Bring partners to the table to go after the big problems. 9, 12 OARS—you've got an awesome relationship with St. Louis County Public Health and Human Services and the treatment facilities in these areas, the doctors—we've even got a dentist. 8, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 The school pharmacy—I forget [unclear]. 7 Anybody who really has skin in the game. 18 When we find new people it's like, ""Hey, this is what we're working on. 9, 16 These are the proactive things we've done so far.""  If we see something that's in that vein we invite them to the group and say, ""Hey, you'd be a perfect fit to bring what you bring to the table."" 6, 15, 17 SA: Because it does require everyone coming together and pooling those resources. 8 When you're dealing with a problem as complex as this one is you really need to get as many people as you can on deck. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 SA: What does a typical day look like for you? 16 JK: Like I said I'm a commander of a task force, so pretty much business for me is dealing with the arrests that we make, [unclear] the reports, evidence that's brought in, paying bills for all the different expenses that we incur to go out and enforce the laws, purchasing Narcan. 8, 10, 13, 14 We're running out of Narcan, so we actually solicited to a group that purchased Narcan for us in the past--there was a church that stepped up last year that donated fifteen hundred dollars for Narcan kits. 7, 8, 14 They stepped up and did that so hopefully we can get through this summer until the grant comes in. 7, 9, 14 I do a lot of presentations. 5, 10 Getting the word out to the public about what's going on [unclear]. 19 Grant writing—that was, you know, as a police officer [laughs]. 8, 12, 15 I do a little bit of everything. 20 SA: Any other instances like the church giving those funds?  Have you connected with churches? 14 That's pretty incredible. 5, 10 JK: We haven't really. 18 And that's an area probably we need to look in more. 8 They came forward to us originally.  They said, ""Hey, we'd like to do something for you.""  I said, ""Hey, this is a need where you can definitely make a big impact."" 9 They stepped up last November [unclear] and then again just recently [unclear].  It's incredible. 5 SL: How would you say the opioid epidemic in the Duluth area compares to what is happening in the Twin Cities or southern, rural Minnesota? 8, 13, 15 JK: Like I've said, the mortality rate here is high. 7 We only have three percent of the whole population in the state and I think we account for eight or nine percent of all opioid deaths. 13, 18 Obviously there's an issue here. 13 I haven't quite wrapped my finger around what that is. 11 The community here is—we've got a large pool of addicted people. 9, 12, 14, 19 People that are out there that are selling the poison—it's spread through the different avenues of [unclear]. 10 Once that's out there, once they know that I can sell the exact same thing in a big city and get four times the amount that's what they're doing. 12 My whole goal is to look at it as an economical problem and do what we can and double down on what we can do for [unclear] but if we can slowly start moving people away from the pool of addiction the demand is not going to be there anymore. 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 The risk of coming out here and getting arrested is just not going to be worth it for people. 9 That's kind of how we look at it.  SA: Anything else you'd like to add?  JK: We're really hopeful for the grant. 9, 18 A lot of good work has happened so far with OARS and our task force and other departments that we've met along the way, but there's still a lot of work to do. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19 It's a work in progress.  SL: I think that's all we have.  Thank you so much. "
"15","Fairbanks_Adam","Robert Levy Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 13, 2017 Robbinsdale, Minnesota Robert Levy-RL Amy Sullivan-AS AS: Tell me anything about your upbringing, your childhood, your parents, or your siblings. 14, 20 RL: I am an only child. 14 I was born in Manhattan, but I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. 14, 20 My parents were older when they had me. 20 My mother had had several miscarriages before she had me and she desperately wanted to be pregnant. 7, 10, 18 By the time she gave up, of course, was when she got pregnant with me. 7, 10 My dad had three children from a previous marriage. 5, 10, 14, 20 His wife had died tragically when she was very young from a very aggressive form of breast cancer. 10, 20 They were much older -- it took my father some time to remarry and it took some time to have children. 5, 14, 16, 20 When I was born, the youngest of my half sisters was eighteen and the oldest had graduated from college already. 7, 14, 20 They were all much older than me and really did not have a lot of impact on my upbringing. 18, 20 I grew up alone as the child of two psychiatrists in New York -- both my parents are psychiatrists. 8, 12, 14, 20 My childhood was great. 14, 20 My parents both loved me a lot. 14, 20 They both have their own intricacies and quirks, but really, they were great parents. 18, 20 They gave me too much, but not way too much, let’s be honest. 8, 18 [laughs] 15 I went to a private school growing up and I had great friends. 7, 10, 16, 20 It was a happy childhood. 14, 18, 20 My mom did get sick when I was fourteen years old. 14, 15 She had always had trouble walking. 16, 18 We always thought it was a bum knee but she ended up getting diagnosed with a mass, and then that progressed. 17, 18 By the time I was an early teen she had a lot of trouble walking and had a lot of pain from muscle spasms. 6, 16 As I got older, the disease continued to progress until the point when she became quadriplegic. 5, 20 She actually died in March of last year and eventually succumbed to her MS. 5, 7, 14 [multiple sclerosis] 17 My dad is still alive and well. 14 He is eighty-five and lives in Los Angeles with his third wife now. 12, 20 They are doing great. 20 AS: Is she in her eighties?  RL: He married a younger woman, she is in her seventies. 7, 20 [laughs] 15 AS: Besides being raised by doctors, what motivated you to go into medicine? 12, 14 RL: That’s a great question. 20 I don’t have a single memory of ever thinking I want to be doctor, but I always wanted to be a doctor. 12, 14, 18 When I was a little kid, my mom tells a story about telling some friend of mine to take two cookies and call me in the morning, or something like that. 14, 15, 20 Always, as a little kid I wanted to be a doctor. 12, 14, 18, 20 Both my parents, to a lesser extent my father, really my mother, persuaded me not to become a doctor. 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 They were both psychiatrists that changed a lot and were some what disillusioned with the way modern medicine was dealing with psychiatry. 8, 12, 13, 14, 18 They really did not want me to be a physician. 18 I really always have wanted to be one. 18 It was one of the great desires of my whole life. 10, 20 I have a very vivid memory of being in seventh grade taking biology class in school and thinking, This is the first step. 5, 7, 11, 14 I have to do well in biology so I can do well in high school so I can do well to get into college so I can do well to get into medical school. 7, 14 I remember thinking that.  AS: You’ve always wanted to be a doctor, but you’ve wanted it for so long you’ve forgotten what it was. 12, 14, 17, 18 RL: There was no one moment. 8, 12, 14 Ever since I can remember I wanted to be a doctor. 12, 14, 18 If you ask me why it is because I’ve always liked talking to people, hearing their stories, and helping them. 9, 18 As germane as that sounds, which is what everyone says when they want to be a doctor, that’s why I wanted to be a doctor. 12, 14, 18 AS: Well, those are the types of people we want to be doctors. 9, 12, 14 Can you talk a little bit about how you got into addiction medicine as a specialty, and if you want to precede that with your own experience with addiction? 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 RL: Sure.  I am pulling this number out of thin air, but I would approximate that close to the majority or a large minority of addiction doctors have some sort of personal experience with addiction; either with family or friends or themselves. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 I am one of the ones that has that experience of addiction. 8, 12, 14, 18 That is why I talk about how great my childhood was because when people hear you have an addiction they assume your childhood was terrible. 9, 11, 12, 14, 20 I can say that I was never really bullied. 16, 18 A little bit, but never badly. 16, 20 My parents never abused me. 6, 13, 16, 20 I had a great childhood. 14, 20 I also cannot blame my parents. 20 My parents also got concerned. 20 They said, How did we screw up?  And I said, You know, not everything is about you guys! 12 AS: That’s hard to remember sometimes. 9 RL: It’s true though. 5 I am an addict for my own reasons. 14 I can believe the genetics, potentially, and it is a little sketchy because we don’t have a complete family history. 6, 12, 15, 20 In high school, my friends and I drank and experimented with marijuana. 5, 7, 12, 16, 20 It was excessive sometimes, but we never got in trouble with the law, we never missed school, and we never cut class. 7, 13, 16 It was pretty controlled. 10, 18 We were in New York City in the early nineties to mid-nineties and the laws around alcohol consumption were not very strict. 6, 12, 13 If you had some sort of photo ID that you were over the age of twenty-one you didn’t have to be legit; they would sell you alcohol, and they didn’t particularly care. 6, 9, 19 It was easy to get and we fooled around with it.  When I went to college I actually cut out a lot of drinking; I really didn’t drink much because I was always focused on my studies. 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18 I really wanted to be a doctor and so I was focusing on my studies. 6, 12, 14, 18 I did go through a period when I smoked marijuana pretty regularly for about a semester. 10, 18 I almost failed a class -- I got a B minus, not that I almost failed a class. 7, 14 That was the worst grade I ever got and I was like, No more marijuana. 5 I stopped.  I think I smoked once after that.  What did happen was during the last semester of my senior year, I fell and broke my ankle very badly. 8, 14, 15 I was living with a group of guys and dating this girl at the time. 7 It was a very bad fracture and I remember getting my first dose of morphine at the ER [emergency room]. 14 All this anxiety and this tension and this stress in my life all evaporated. 7, 10 It was really miraculous. 18 AS: What was bad, the pain you were in? 6 RL: It wasn’t just the physical pain. 6 It was bad but what was worse was the fear, the anxiety. 10 I have always had anxiety, but the anxiety went away. 10, 18, 20 Growing up I was always anxious too, but I dealt with it. 18 It was an intramuscular injection of morphine.  I remember that very, very clearly.  And that, in addiction medicine, is called salience. 12, 14 We can talk about that, but that is a bad sign when someone remembers it very well like that, it is memory salience. 11 I remembered it very clearly. 5, 14 All of that anxiety disappeared for a short amount of time, and it was really wonderful. 5, 10, 18 I was also in a lot of pain and the pain went away too, which was really nice. 6, 18, 20 Anyone who has been in bad pain knows that. 6, 12 It didn’t go away completely, but it got much better. 18, 20 My ankle was dislocated and had multiple fractures so I had a lot of pain. 6, 17 What I remember was not as much the pain as the anxiety and being free from it. 6, 10 It was miraculous.  I was in Northfield, Minnesota and I was still living in New York at the time so I had to fly back to New York the next day. 16 They relocated my dislocated ankle in the ER and gave me a splint and some crutches and told me to go see an orthopedic surgeon because I was going to need surgery to repair my ankle. 6, 9, 14, 16 This is over spring break.  I remember flying home and I actually screwed up the prescription. 7, 10 I had a prescription for Vicodin and Ibuprofen. 10 I meant to put the Vicodin in my carry-on bag and my Ibuprofen in my checked bag and I flipped them.  I put the Ibuprofen in my carry-on bag and that was a very tough flight because I was in a lot of pain. 6 When I got home I took a Vicodin and I remember thinking, Ah, that’s much better.  AS: What year was this? 14 RL: March 15, 2001 was when I had the fracture.  AS: You’re a senior in college, so you’re twenty-two? 7 RL: Twenty-two, yes.  I was born in 1979. 14 I was born February 5, 1979. 14 After that traumatic experience I was at home and I actually didn’t take much pain medication after that. 6, 7, 14, 18 Then I had surgery, and my parents being doctors and knowing how terrible hospitals are elected to have outpatient surgery, and it was pretty extensive surgery. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20 I trusted my parents when it came to medical procedures and I still do, my dad at least. 7, 14, 20 I had an anesthetic block on my leg.  When I woke up I remember there was no pain. 6 It was fantastic.  I didn’t take any medication, went home, and went to bed. 14 I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like they were still operating on that leg. 7, 15 What they did not tell me was when that block wears off all the pain relief goes away very quickly. 6, 18, 20 You go from having total pain relief to having no pain relief. 6 I was in some serious pain. 6, 11 I remember taking oxycodone and not getting much relief and not sleeping well. 11, 16 I was scared after that, of the pain. 5, 6, 19 I took a lot of oxycodone during my recovery phase.  At the same time, I didn’t notice any sort of euphoric effects, but I did notice I was more chatty and talkative when I was on it as opposed to when I was off it, but I didn’t think anything of that.  I went back to college after two weeks. 7, 15 When I went back to college, basically everyone was graduating. 7, 19 All my friends and the people I lived with were graduating. 7, 9, 16, 20 My girlfriend broke up with me, I wasn’t particularly fun to be around because I couldn’t do much. 7, 8, 9, 20 My friends were like, well, he’s kind of lame, and can’t do much, and frankly, yes, I was feeling sorry for myself. 15, 16, 20 I was ostracized and I was feeling sorry for myself. 15 I felt like I had, as I call it now, a lot of life pain for the first time. 6, 10, 11, 12, 14 I had had bad things happen, like when my mom got sick there was a period of time when we were worried my mom was going to die. 14, 15, 18 I had had life pain, but nothing prolonged for so long. 6, 10, 17 I still have intermittent, pretty bad pain. 6, 10, 17 I was scared that the pain would come and get worse and come back to the pain it was after that first night I had been operated on. 5, 6, 14, 19 I would take some Percocet, and I noticed that when I took the Percocet the pain of my situation, which isn’t that bad, but hurt at the time, would also go away. 6, 18, 20 The joke among medical professionals is that occasionally patients come in requesting Percocet for life pain. 6, 7, 10, 14 Most doctors say, Too bad, it doesn’t work. 12, 14 My point is that it does work.  It actually works really well. 7, 9, 18 Narcotics treat life pain for a short period of time very well. 6, 10, 18 It treats all types of pain: existential pain, spiritual pain, physical pain, all pain because they work on the brain where pain is processed. 6, 13, 17 I started taking it for my life pain, essentially. 5, 6, 10, 11 Another important factor for me was that I was only taking two classes at the time. 7, 9, 11 When I take narcotics I am one of the relatively rare people where it has what we call a paradoxical reaction. 9 It did not make me sleepy. 16 It almost made me feel like I had drank a bunch of coffee. 5, 16 It made me more alert.  I started to do better in school, actually. 7 I started taking them to help me do better in school. 7, 11 I was taking them pretty regularly. 10, 11 Also, because a lot of my parents’ friends were doctors and they knew I had this terrible pain and this terrible surgery, they would keep prescribing me narcotics. 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20 I took narcotics pretty regularly my last semester of college. 7, 10 I took the MCATs [medical college admission test], I remember I had taken a bunch of Vicodin for worried about being in pain during the MCATs and for thinking I would do better on the MCATs. 6, 7, 14 Lord knows if I did or not, I did well enough to get into medical school. 7, 12, 14 AS: It was covering two different parts of your life: your fear of pain, and your desire to succeed. 6, 9, 10 RL: Yes, and the anxiety of taking the tests, right. 10, 11, 12 My anxiety got much better, and that’s probably why I was doing better in school. 7, 10 I took a year off because I had to rehab my ankle; I couldn’t go directly to medical school. 7, 14, 18 I still had to learn how to walk again. 10, 16 The first half of that year I stayed in New York and mostly rehabbed my ankle and lived with my parents. 7, 12, 14, 20 I didn’t take that much pain medication because I wasn’t in pain. 6, 14 All of my high school friends were still around. 7, 16, 20 They had gone off to college but they had come back and were all doing things. 7 They had internships and stuff like that; all the things children of upper-middle class people do in New York. 5, 7, 9, 14, 20 They were all around, I had a great physical therapist, and I had a trainer at the gym. 6, 20 I was getting into great physical shape and I was on a diet. 6, 20 I was feeling pretty good, and I would only very rarely take a Percocet. 10, 15 Then it was more so because I had been too long on the elliptical, I couldn’t run yet, then did an intense physical therapy session, and then on the subway ride home it hurt pretty badly and I would take a Percocet. 6, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18 That was probably like once a week. 15 AS: You were able to stop whenever? 16 RL: The point is that I really never stopped. 16, 18 I still would take it weekly. 15 AS: But you could take it a whole week and you wouldn’t get sick? 15 You wouldn’t get withdrawal symptoms? 5 That fun didn’t come until later.  [laughs] 15 AS: Is that possible for people? 9 To keep using them intermittently and not experience any withdrawal symptoms? 5, 6, 17, 18 RL: Yes.  It is possible.  Most people who get surgery and have intermittent severe pain can take narcotics intermittently and have no problem with them. 6, 9, 12, 17 At that point, in my professional opinion, although it is always hard to be your own doctor, I was abusing narcotics but not addicted to them yet. 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 Or, in the DSM-V [diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition], for those listening and judging me I would have opioid use disorder - mild at this point. 6, 12, 13 That would be the diagnosis. 6 The second half of my year off I spent hanging out in Aspen [Colorado] with a buddy of mine who was a snowboard instructor. 12, 14 I did odds and end jobs, snowmaking, I worked at a gym for a while, and hung out. 10, 11, 12 It was pretty lonely out there and I would take a Vicodin or two every couple of days because I was bored. 5, 8, 10, 11, 16 I thought it would make things more interesting. 17, 18 Again, I always had plenty. 18 My surgeon and other doctors would write prescriptions for huge amounts of it because I would tell them I take it rarely and I didn’t want to bother them and I was going to Colorado. 10, 12, 14 They would give me one hundred and fifty of them just to make sure I had enough, but I did it from a couple of doctors so I was progressing at this point. 11, 12, 14 They were all good friends of my family and things like that. 10, 12, 16, 20 “We don’t want Bob to suffer!  It sounds reasonable” and stuff like that. 18 AS: You had some good, legitimate excuses. 6, 10, 13 RL: I went out to Colorado and started dating my girlfriend who would become my wife. 7, 20 I was also going to medical school interviews. 7, 14 I would take a Vicodin before all of my interviews because it would help with my anxiety and I wanted to do better at them. 10, 18 I would take it for that.  We are talking once, twice, maybe three times a week. 5, 15 Then there was a time when medical school interviews were over. 7, 14 I was accepted to a few and the one that I eventually went to. 5, 8, 12 I had this period of time where I didn’t really have anything to do and I was hanging out in Colorado and I stopped taking them again for a couple of months. 11, 16, 18 The first year of medical school I almost never took them. 7, 14, 16 Occasionally on the weekends to have a good time I would take them. 10, 15 The interesting thing was that living with my fiance at the time, the same person, and I never told her that I was doing this. 16, 17 I never told anybody; I was hiding this. 16 I think I did at one point tell one of my high school friends. 7, 16, 20 I was like, Hey, have you ever taken pills to have fun?  He said, No, and I said, Do you want to try it?  He said, Not particularly, so I thought, Okay, I get it. 9, 17, 18 I was taking it once a month on Saturdays. 11, 16 Second year comes around and my fiance starts at NYU [New York University] and is commuting. 14 I was living on Long Island at the time and I would come home and be totally alone for a percentage of the night. 8 I would start taking them after school to help with the anxiety of being alone, but in my mind it was to have a good time. 7, 8, 10, 11 I did that for a while too and the use escalated. 6, 13 Third year was a very intense year and I cut way back. 14, 18 The other really interesting thing was that the medical licensing exams have various steps and you take your first step of that exam after the second year of med school. 7, 14, 17, 18 I got married between the second and third year. 7, 14 I remember taking a couple of Vicodin before my wedding, but I did not do it before taking step one. 11 I can’t tell you why that is.  I can tell when I was high and when I wasn’t now because my memory was different. 7, 12 My memory is much clearer when I wasn’t taking the drug. 5, 6, 11 The wedding is a little fuzzy but I clearly remember taking step two. 11, 20 The MCATs were fuzzy, I have very little memory of taking the MCATs now. 11, 12, 20 It is directly correlated to how much opioid I had taken. 18 I remember the subway ride, I remember things around taking step one and I don’t remember taking drugs for that. 5, 6, 11, 18 I did okay on step one, but not as well as the other one I had taken.  [laughs] 15 I get married, third year comes around, and I use it very rarely again. 6, 7, 13, 14 Part of me knows it’s not a great idea to take drugs then see patients in a clinical setting. 5, 6, 12, 20 The fourth year comes around and you have to start picking what sort of specialty you want to do. 5, 14 You have to start making life plans. 10 My mom is getting sicker and my parents are starting to have marital discord. 14, 15, 20 It was a stressful time and I found myself taking more, again, because of the stress. 7, 11 That was what I told myself. 16 I find myself taking it after rotations. 11 Fourth year was the time, I don’t remember why, where you could argue that I go from mild to moderate opiate use disorder and from moderate to severe opioid use disorder because I started taking it every day. 6, 11, 13, 14, 16 It was sometime in my fourth year right as I was making the decision about what to do. 5, 10, 12, 14 I distinctly remember sitting in a hotel room with my wife, I still have the paper, and doing a pro and con list of doing family medicine or anesthesia. 12, 14, 20 I chose to do anesthesia, I took my anesthesia sub-bi and I was so nervous that I took a Vicodin everyday before the rotation because I could do better. 16 At this point it is actually clear that I’m not doing better on it, but I still am under the impression that I am. 7, 10 My dose has gone up a little bit, I’m not taking the one Vicodin, I’m taking one or two or a Percocet. 8, 11, 20 I would break them in half and eat half of one and now I’m eating a whole one and I’m doing it every day. 8, 12, 14, 16 AS: Is one stronger than the other?  RL: Not really. 18 People believe that hydrocodone is weaker than oxycodone but it’s really not, they are all the same. 18 I go to taking it daily at some point at the end of my fourth year of med school. 5, 7, 11, 14 It’s strange to me because I was really using it infrequently the third year and my fourth year it really escalated quite quickly and I can’t place my hand on it. 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 18 Hearing stories from other addicts, some people can and some people can’t place it. 9, 14 I am one of those people that just can’t. 9 There isn’t just one moment. 8, 12, 14 What I do know is that I matched at a very good anesthesia program and my first year of anesthesia was a rotating schedule and you aren’t in the operating room much. 10, 12, 14 You are doing a lot of other things: medicine, cardiology, the ICU [intensive care unit], pediatrics, emergency room, and a bunch of other rotations. 12, 14, 19 It is called a transitional year, but I went to a program where everything is integrated together. 8, 14, 17 I reverted back to only using it occasionally again that year. 6, 14 I experienced withdrawal, but I didn’t know it at the time. 5, 12, 18 The interesting thing too, I forgot about this, I had to take a drug test before my job. 5, 6, 11, 17 I knew I had prescriptions but I didn’t want to throw any of these doctors under the bus. 10, 12, 14, 16 They prescribed them over the phone or I would go pick them up at their house, this is not super legit, it is some kind of sketchy stuff. 6, 8, 10, 13, 16 I stopped and I had withdrawal. 5 I thought I had the flu and I was super sick, but I remember I thought it had to be a week before I peed in the cup. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 That isn’t true, you don’t need that much time, but I didn’t know. 5, 12 I peed in the cup, passed the test, and didn’t return to regular use right away. 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 Eventually, towards the end of that last year, I started using it to have fun on the weekends or for anxiety and it very quickly went back to daily. 6, 10, 14, 15 Also, when I was on-call I would get nervous and I thought I was a better doctor when I was on them and I would take them while I was on-call. 12, 14, 17, 18 I practiced medicine while I was under the influence of these opioids. 6, 12, 13, 14 I didn’t get caught, and the fortunate thing is that as a resident you always have supervision. 9, 16, 18 I can’t comment because I really don’t know what my practice of medicine was really like, but I do know that someone was always watching over me. 8, 12, 14, 17, 18 And I was never under any academic problems when I was under residency. 7, 9, 12, 16, 20 Second year of residency starts and I do a lot more anesthesia and I find anesthesia a lot less fulfilling than I thought I would. 5, 7, 9, 14, 17, 18 I have a lot of respect for people who do it but it was not my calling. 9, 16 I’m more of a people person, I wanted to listen to the stories and meet the people. 9, 18 Anesthesia is really cool in medical school because you get to do procedures and give out drugs and see things happen. 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 17, 18 Once you start to do that regularly it becomes, at least for me, routine and then boring.  I would sit in the OR [operating room] bored all the time. 14 At the same time I am running out of pills. 8 Most of my doctors, or suppliers, frankly, are in New York. 12, 14 I am far away from New York. 18, 20 I would go back to New York for vacations and hit these people up for more drugs and they would give them to me because I am so-and-so’s son. 5, 6, 9 AS: Now it has been a few years. 14 It has been four or more years since your surgery. 14 RL: It has been five years. 14 AS: Five years and they are still willing with no questions asked? 14 RL: Yes.  Well, I was starting to get questions.  I don’t think ‘no questions’ is fair. 9 I was starting to get questions.  I was starting to get heat.  Some people stopped. 9 Some people started really questioning me and my supply was dwindling and my needs were increasing. 9, 13, 18 I needed more and more and my supply was dwindling and I couldn’t go back as much. 13 In the place I was living my doctor, I got the impression, was not going to be willing to prescribe for me. 10, 12, 14 I never asked him, for whatever reason. 16 One day it happens I was basically out. 15, 16, 19 Like most drug addicts, I was hyper careful about my supply and I was down to my emergency supply. 5, 6, 13, 14, 19 I went to work and I went into withdrawal for the first time at the hospital and that was really terrible. 5, 8, 11, 14, 18 Having to do rounds and have withdrawal is no fun. 5 Then I had to go to work and do the anesthesia.  AS: When you were in withdrawal and doing your rounds you were sweating, shaking, and feeling sick? 5, 15 RL: Sweating, shaking not so much, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, not looking healthy, having a runny nose, yawning, tearing. 8, 19 It is full on withdrawal. 5, 14 AS: And you are managing to do your rounds?  RL: Yeah, I mean I am taking Ibuprofen. 11 Every addict has their ways of dealing. 14, 18 I am doing what I can and managing as best I can.  I know I wasn’t because my attending was kind of like, 12 Get your shit together. 8, 18 I got nervous.  I remember the first time thinking, Well, fentanyl is a narcotic. 14 It’s right there and I know how to use it. 6, 12, 13 At the time I thought of it as borrowing, but it was really stealing. 17, 18 I stole fentanyl for the first time. 14 Like a good anesthesiologist I injected it because that’s how you use fentanyl as an anesthesiologist. 6, 10, 13 The one thing I am grateful for is that I had a family friend who was in a position of leadership at a medical institution where they had an addicted anesthesiologist who contaminated a bunch of fentanyl with Hepatitis C. 7, 12, 14, 20 It gave a bunch of patients Hepatitis C and I knew that story, so the one thing I am grateful for was that I was very, very careful to never cross contaminate anything. 15, 16, 19 At the same time I was dividing fentanyl for me and my patients, and really it’s all for your patients. 18 I’m not trying to defend that.  I started using fentanyl and it is not long after that that things really started to fall apart. 6, 9, 11, 17, 18 My appearance started to fall apart. 9, 11 My personal life started to fall apart. 9, 10, 11 My wife was just saying, You’re always so distant. 18, 20 My friends were like, What is going on? 16, 20 Once you really start using intravenous fentanyl it is a big jump. 6, 18 The withdrawals are a million times worse. 5 The cravings start and they are really bad. 18 They had started before that but they got really bad. 18 I had a three month run. 8, 16 It was only three months before one of my attendings noticed that I had essentially -- anesthesia has actually done a really great job in trying to discover when anesthesiologists or nurse anesthetists start using, because they have the highest rate among medical practitioners. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20 I was the poster child. 14 I was taking more bathroom breaks, I was volunteering for call, I was wearing long sleeves -- I had to wear long sleeves because I had track marks at this point. 5, 11, 14, 16, 17 I normally do not wear long sleeves and I was doing it all the time now at this point, and it wasn’t because I was cold! 12, 16, 17 AS: They have known things to watch for. 11, 12, 17 People are aware of this?  RL: These are known things, yes. 11, 12 People are aware of it.  At this program there was a person that was supposed to be watching it. 8, 17 He did the best he could, but these people have a lot of residents and I wasn’t working with him at the time. 9 At the time the person I was working with and I had a good relationship, frankly. 10, 19 She was someone I really respected and she knew more about my personal life. 10, 16, 18 My parents had also divorced at this point. 7, 20 My dad had gone off to live with someone else and my mom had moved away to live closer to me and help care for me, so I had a lot of stress with that. 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20 My aunt had also died.  There were a lot of things that had happened that had escalated it. 15 I didn’t go into any of that and I’m sorry.  AS: That’s okay.  This is all during this three month period? 16, 18 RL: Preceding it.  That leads to the build up.  It sounds very sudden, but there actually is a boiling point of things in my life. 7, 10, 18 I had no other way of dealing with my anxiety. 10, 18 Actually, I was seeing a therapist. 6 I was always seeing a therapist. 6, 18 I was lying to him and or her, there were two I saw, about what I was using. 6 I didn’t tell them I was taking pills all the time. 11 I didn’t tell them I was taking fentanyl. 11 I was just trying to deal with my anxiety. 10 AS: Did they ever suggest medication for your anxiety? 10, 14 RL: I honestly cannot remember. 8, 10 At some point before all of this I had started on Zoloft.  Someone started me on Zoloft but I don’t remember when.  But, of course, it didn’t help because I was taking opiates. 11 I knew anxiety was a problem so I took it. 10, 12, 16 At this point most of my anxiety is of opioid withdrawal. 5, 10, 13 When you take fentanyl you withdrawal all the time. 5 And, of course, the only way to not withdrawal is to go into treatment or take more opiates. 5, 12, 13, 18 Eventually I get intervened on on May 3, 2008.  AS: By colleagues?  RL: By my attending.  She said, Can you come talk to me in my office? 14 I knew something was up. 16 I was on-call, and it was a Saturday. 16 Salience; I remember this very well.  I was really bad at that point. 18 I had just finished my cardiac rotation which is where you have a lot of access to narcotics and I was going to outpatient where you have very little access to narcotics and I was hoarding a bunch at that call. 9, 11, 14, 20 It was the first time, she later told me this, but it was the first time that a patient of mine was under anesthesia at that time and woke up and was in a lot of pain, which is the last sign that someone is using. 6, 11, 14, 16 Even though I had charted and gave him a bunch of narcotics he still woke up in a lot of pain. 6 She said that that was when she knew. 16 There were all the other signs, but that is when she knew. 11, 16 It had never happened before. 15, 16 She called the program director and she agreed that that was what she should do. 18, 19 She did it alone but she didn’t do it alone. 8 She did all the right things, she got everyone involved, and everyone knew. 12, 16 They had their protocol and they did it.  She said, I think you use anesthetic drugs. 5, 6, 13 I didn’t hide it, I started crying and telling her how I had desperately -- and I had -- tried to stop so many times in the past. 14, 15 But first you denied it? 14 RL: Yeah, of course.  I sat down and she was like, Are you using anesthesia? 6 And I was like, No, no, and she didn’t say anything.  If anybody is listening to this or reading this that is a great way -- to just not say anything. 18, 20 It is really effective. 18 She just didn’t say anything and I started to sob and sob.  It was true, I had tried to quit so many times. 5 I knew I had a problem. 12, 16 A couple weeks before that I had started Googling ‘how do you stop injecting drugs?’ 5, 6, 11, 13, 15 and I got all this stuff on detox and was like, okay, no. 19 Seriously.  I desperately tried to stop.  I had tried tapering, substituting, I had stolen Naloxone and induced my own withdrawal. 5, 8, 14 I tried a lot of things.  AS: So you were ready to be discovered? 5 RL: Super ready.  I was ready before I stole the fentanyl.  Maybe I didn’t do a great job through this whole story because it is kind of stream of consciousness but -- AS: It’s been fine. 11, 15, 20 RL: I was really done pretty much when I entered med school. 5, 7, 10, 18 I had thought, I don’t want to do this anymore. 17, 18 Sorry, when I entered residency. 5, 7, 9 I didn’t want to do it anymore and I still felt compelled to because the withdrawal and the anxiety. 5, 10, 11 And I didn’t want to lie to these people; my friends, my family friends. 9, 12, 16, 20 I don’t want to fill these prescriptions under false pretenses. 5, 10 It was against every ethical and moral thing I stood for.  And it still took me like fifteen months to come to the point where I was like, Okay, it’s time. 11, 16 AS: When people say addiction hijacks someone’s brain and their core self, that would also be your experience? 9, 12, 13, 14, 18 RL: Absolutely.  AS: It is a matter of privilege and circumstance that you were allowed to do those things without being caught. 10 Someone with lesser resources would be shoplifting or robbing people or accessing the street corner. 9, 15 RL: Clearly, yes.  Absolutely.  I have never done heroin, but I describe myself as a heroin addict sometimes. 14, 16 When I am at AA [alcoholics anonymous] meetings I don’t say I’m a fentanyl addict -- well, actually these days people do know what that is, but before they did not. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18 And to say that is to imply that there is something different between me and them, and there’s not.  I want to make that very clear.  For all intensive purposes I am a heroin addict, I just never did heroin. 14, 16 I did morphine, which is essentially the same thing. 5, 10 Fentanyl was the opioid I liked the most, but I took all of them if I had the access. 9, 13 I took morphine and pills. 10 In street and AA meetings I identify as a heroin addict and I did it intravenously. 14, 16, 18 There were times when I came close to overdosing. 9, 10 I remember in the bathroom of the hospital a couple of times. 8, 11, 14 There were ultra potent derivatives of fentanyl and remifentanil. 6 Super potent fentanyl derivatives. 6 It is super terrible, really terrible. 11, 16, 18 AS: Let’s go back to that day. 16 She intervenes on you.  What else does she say?  RL: She says I know you are using drugs. 5, 6, 12 I break down.  She says it’s okay, I’m going to drive you home. 5 I have someone else to come in and cover for you.  The other resident is going to deal with the pager. 9 I had this pain pager that dealt with the acute pain. 6 She said, I’m going to give someone else the pager, there are no cases right now. 12, 17 I am going to take you home in your car.  I gave her the keys to my car. 15 She made me change so I couldn’t bring drugs home from the hospital. 5, 6, 8 She drove me home and my wife was there, she told my wife what happened. 5, 15, 16, 20 She made my wife look after me. 20 She called someone else and someone else picked her up.  My wife was great and she looked after me. 20 I remember waking up in the morning and having my eyes closed and thinking, 5, 9, 10 Please, god, let me wake up in the call room. 11, 14 If I wake up in the call room this is all a dream. 5, 14 A terrible, terrible dream. 5, 11 I opened my eyes and for the first and only time in my life I supremely disappointed to find myself in my own bed. 10, 14 I was like, Shit.  I knew it was coming so I went through withdrawals and it was terrible. 5, 11, 16 I also had this sense of peace because I was like, Okay, now everyone knows. 12 Excuse my language, but fuck it, everyone knows at this point. 6, 12, 13 Whatever is going to happen, all the fear and anxiety about what is going to happen when I run out, I am going to find out. 8, 10, 15 The other thing I did that night, I forgot to mention, the night I was intervened on, the attending and my wife were like, Do you have any drugs in the house? 5, 6, 12, 13, 20 For whatever reason I was completely honest. 8 I showed them where all of them were and they threw away all of them. 18, 20 That doesn’t mean there were any in the house. 6, 13 I actually found a couple of pills in the house that I didn’t know where they were. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 They had fallen behind the dresser or something like that. 5 So, I had no access from the first time, which was the day that I broke my ankle. 8, 9, 14, 16 From March 15, 2001 until May 3, 2008  I was always in reach of a narcotic. 18 And that was the first day that I was not. 14, 16 It was scary.  At the same time it was liberating.  That withdrawal, although it was really bad, in my mind was not nearly as bad as the other ones because I was never thinking about how I was going to get more, what I was going to do, how I was going to hide it. 5, 8, 16, 18 I was like fuck it, it’s out.  I do remember distinctly thinking how I was never going to be happy again. 16, 18 I do remember that.  The only thing that made me happy was drugs. 5, 6, 18 I was going to have to learn how to live life with never being happy. 10, 16, 18 It was about the closest I got to being suicidal. 9, 10 I was actually never suicidal, I just knew I was going to have to live without ever being happy again, which is not true. 5, 7, 16, 18 AS: No, but it’s what you thought at the time. 17, 18 RL: It is what I thought at the time. 17, 18 I remember distinctly thinking that I would never be happy again. 16, 18 The chair of the department comes and talks to me on that Monday. 9, 12, 16, 19 He let me alone on that Sunday. 8, 16 AS: At your home?  RL: At home.  He told me he was going to put me on medical leave and have the addiction point person come talk to me, and he offered support. 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 The addiction point person came and said, I want you to meet with this addiction doctor. 12, 14, 18 I got you an appointment and it’s on Wednesday. 12, 16 It was Monday at this point. 16 I was like, Okay.  I continued withdrawal and spent a lot of time in bed, watching T.V. and drinking soup or whatever else I could get down. 5, 8, 11, 17 By Wednesday it was getting better. 16 This is the longest I have been without narcotics for like a year and some. 14, 17 It was getting better, still not super happy and some underlying anxiety. 10, 16, 18 I talked to this guy and he was great. 20 He did the whole intake.  I was going through withdrawals and he was like, You know, it looks like you’re still in mild to moderate withdrawal. 5, 12 I thought it was the worst thing ever. 17, 18 He was right. 12 He said, I’m not even going to give you any buprenorphine, I don’t think you need it at this point. 10 You’re past the worst of it.  He was right. 12 I didn’t like that statement, but he was right. 12 He got me started in intensive outpatient therapy. 11, 12 According to ASAM [American Society of Addiction Medicine] criteria, it was technically partial hospitalization treatment and I had to go into that. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 It is the highest level that is not inpatient treatment or the lowest level that is inpatient treatment. 7, 10, 12, 13 It is kind of in that gray area. 8 I would go everyday from eight until one Monday through Friday. 16 Then we would have a group meeting on Sunday. 16, 18 I did that and met with a bunch of other people in the community. 9, 19 They got me hooked up with doctors in recovery very early. 12, 14 I was interviewed on Monday and the meeting which was the AA meeting for doctors in that town was Monday night. 12, 14, 16, 18 They were like, You should go!  And I was like, No, I’m not going to go.  The addiction point person was super persistent and he called someone else who was a medical student in recovery and he said you should go to this meeting. 7, 12, 14, 16, 18 Leah, my wife, told me she would drive me. 5, 16, 20 So she drove me to this, what I now know is an Alano Club, but it was a clubhouse. 5, 6, 12, 13 I went into the wrong damn meeting. 11, 18 I did not go to the doctor’s meeting, I went to a different meeting. 12, 14, 18 The Thursday meeting became my home group because it was a great meeting. 16, 18, 20 I remember my first AA meeting. 14, 18 Everyone was telling my story. 15 AS: The wrong meeting became your home group. 11, 18 RL: It was the wrong meeting. 11, 18 I was like, These people are doctors? 9, 12, 14 Then as they were telling their stories I learned that they weren’t doctors. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 I’m at the wrong meeting. 11, 18 They all look great and a lot of them look very professional, but the dude sitting next to me was clearly a mechanic that had just come from work. 20 He was working a shirt that said like Rusty’s Auto Repair with some grease and a little rag. 20 AS: Right.  You know your people. 9, 12 RL: I think he said something about a transmission and I was just like there is no way that guy is a doctor. 12, 14, 17, 18 [laughs] 15 The point was that they were fantastic and that’s actually where my love of non-medical AA came from. 7, 14 It was my first meeting and these people’s stories were all the same. 9, 14, 18 Yes, they didn’t work in hospitals, but this guy was fixing cars and he was intoxicated. 8 The other guy was a salesman and he couldn’t sign his signature because he was shaking so bad from his alcoholism. 6, 11 This is the same as my story, just twenty times over. 15 It was great. 20 I felt at home. 11 I felt at peace. 11 I felt like, Oh my god these people all did it. 9, 11 Some were worse off than I was and they were doing okay.  Maybe I could do this too.  I started IOP [intensive outpatient program], I eventually got hooked up with the Kaduceus group, they were very important, I’m not going to lie. 5, 9, 11, 14 There are certain things that are unique physicians and other healthcare providers and professionals. 17, 19 One of them was like, You have to tell the state.  You have to tell the state what is going on because if you don’t they are going to find out anyway and it is worse if they find out and you don’t tell them. 18 Lots of fun!  At the same time the hospital doesn’t officially agree. 8 The department did everything by the book and so they alerted the hospital administration. 8, 9, 12, 19 They do their own official inquiry.  I am new in AA and all of that. 16 Yes, I was deposed.  AS: You had your own deposition.  In rigorous honesty I tell them everything, which my sponsor later was like, You know, that’s good when you are in the room, but maybe not with the opposing side’s lawyers. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 [laughs] 15 Long story short is that they put me on FMLA [family and medical leave] and paid me salary and benefits for six months. 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 When that ran out they ‘allowed’ me to quit. 10 They were not going to take me back.  I was hoping I could just switch and do family medicine there, and the family medicine program was all set to take me and the hospital was like no, you’re fired. 5, 8, 12, 14 I was like, Oh right, I did all that stuff. 12 Initially I was super pissed at the hospital but they did what they had to. 8, 16 I had admitted to them that I showed up intoxicated, stole from them, and practiced under the influence.  They terminated me. 17 Actually, they didn't terminate me. 17 They said they would give me a week to resign and if you don’t we’ll terminate you. 11, 15, 17 The distinction is important because in medicine on your credentials it asks if you have ever been terminated and I can honestly say, No, I’ve resigned, I was never terminated. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 I have enough things to say to on those credential application things. 5, 9 One of which is why did you ever have a break in your training, which I’ll talk about.  I alert the state and I’m five days away from graduating from this partial hospitalization. 8, 9, 16, 18, 20 The state comes back and says, You’ve got to go to inpatient treatment and you’ve got to go to one of these places that deals with physicians. 12, 13 I said, But my addiction doctor said I have to do outpatient and my insurance is not going to cover this. 11, 12, 14 They said, Medically you don’t have to. 14 If you want to keep your medical license you have to. 7, 13, 14 I had a long and difficult conversation with my parents because it was expensive, I was in residence, and I had no coverage. 9, 10, 17, 20 Also, under the influence I had bought this really big house that was way too much house for me because I thought it was very important. 6, 9, 13, 17, 18 We were never super broke because my parents were always able to help us out, but we were way over extended and I didn’t have thirty thousand dollars laying around. 8, 16, 18, 20 My mom footed the entire bill. 14 I am really lucky. 8, 18 I went to the Hazelden Center in Springbrook, Oregon which is where they housed all the physicians. 6, 13, 16 I went there because over the phone they said it would be a twenty-eight day program. 8, 16 Every other place I went to said for physicians it is ninety days. 16 I get there and on the third day they said, For physicians it is ninety days also. 16 It is funny because the doc, the treating physician at the time, who is a wonderful guy, was used to people just blowing up. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18 You could see him preparing himself. 6, 10 At that point I was like, Whatever, I don’t care. 19 He was like, Really?  I am in a very privileged position because my mom was paying for all of this. 14 Instead of thirty thousand it was going to be forty-five thousand.  I have to get the fifteen grand and she is going to pay for it, but she is going to pay for it so that doesn’t matter.  Leah, my wife, is pissed that I’m not going to be home, but she said it’s better than using drugs. 5, 6, 20 I was like, Whatever.  Plus, it was a really beautiful time to be in Oregon. 18 I went in early April.  Even though I was only three days there I knew it was more intense. 16 Nothing against the treatment center I had in my hometown, but this was clearly better treatment. 12, 13 I knew I didn’t want to go back; I didn’t want to use again. 6, 13, 16 I thought if it takes more time it takes more time. 17, 18 I had met some good friends. 10, 16, 20 Some of them I’m still friends with. 16, 20 Some of them are physicians and some are not.  I was where the physicians were housed but my best friend in treatment was younger than me, I think I was twenty-nine at the time and I think he was twenty-two or twenty-three. 6, 12, 13, 16, 20 We became best friends. 16, 20 We are still friends. 16, 20 He ended up dying in a car accident sober, just tragically. 13 He grew up in Alaska and he moved to Minnesota to be in aftercare and I ended up getting a job in Minnesota, so we were close to each other and hung out and saw each other. 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 19, 20 He was doing great. 20 He was driving to work on an icy road and the car slipped off and flipped and he was killed. 5, 14 They did test him because his family wanted to know and he was sober when he died. 12, 18 It was just an accident. 13 Bad things happen even when you’re in sobriety. 12, 15 Anyway, I met some great people. 9, 18, 20 I did my ninety days of treatment. 12, 13, 16 You have to go back home and get plugged into AA and get a sponsor and stuff but I actually already had all that stuff. 7 I had done that partial hospitalization program and almost completed it. 7, 8, 9 I had already done aftercare through the same program and I already had a sponsor and I already knew all the AA meeting that I was going to. 16, 18, 19 I had all this time during the IOP to go to AA meetings everyday. 16, 18 I’m done with treatment, I go home, and I step back into all this. 12, 13 The state grants me back my medical license and I do get terminated from this hospital, so now I’m in this limbo. 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17 It is August or September and now the process to get another residency spot is passed. 6, 7, 9, 12, 17 I can’t get my stuff together in time anyways. 8, 17, 18 The one thing I really wish the hospital would have done would have been to just fire me in September, but they didn’t. 8, 18 They kept me in limbo and didn’t announce they were terminating me until the day before Christmas. 16, 17 I think administratively they just had to get all their ducks in a row and it took them that long, but at the time I thought they did it because they were being punitive. 14, 17, 18, 19 I don’t think that anymore.  AS: I thought you quit? 17, 18 RL: Okay, they sent the letter saying you have to quit or we are going to fire you. 5 So, yes.  Technically I quit.  They sent the letter saying you have to quit or we are going to terminate you the day before Christmas. 5, 16, 17 In that time between September and December I met with the family medicine department and the medicine department. 9, 12, 14, 19 I had already made the decision in treatment that I was not going to go back to anesthesia. 12, 13, 14 It was a bad idea because there was too much fentanyl lying around, and it wasn’t really my passion. 18 Looking back I had that piece of paper and I should have done family medicine anyways because it was more in line with what my goals were. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 Again, nothing against anesthesia.  I met with the addiction point person in the department of anesthesia. 9, 12, 14, 19 We had a couple of conversations on the phone and then met in person when I got back. 8, 11, 16 Everyone was okay with this and on board with this.  Then I met with the department of family medicine and I was like, I’m going to start family medicine and I’ve been accepted and it is going to be great. 9, 12, 14, 19, 20 They had a position for me, and they had actually just lost one of their residents for a drug related problem also. 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 They said, Perfect you will fit right in. 12, 15 Then the hospital sends the letter and I had to inform them that I could not join them. 8 I was really devastated because I was unsure if I was ever going to be a doctor again. 12, 14, 18 It is hard, there is all this stigma. 9 Now I am an addict. 14 I’m an intravenous drug using addict who resigned from their anesthesia job, has a gap in their training of at least six months and will be even longer because I can’t get a job. 5, 6, 11, 14, 16, 17 The earliest I can get a job as a resident now is in June of the following year, 2009. 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 To make matters worse, my wife is a very tolerant and loving person, and she put up with a lot. 20 At some point she was like, Look, I’m okay not making anesthesia money anymore. 8, 10 One of the main reasons I was an anesthesiologist was because you make a lot more money than family medicine. 8, 10, 12, 14 Not to say that my wife is monetarily driven, but of course it is part of it. 5, 8, 9, 20 She said, I’m fine with that, I’m fine with us moving, I’m fine with us selling this house, I’m fine with you being a drug addict, I’m fine with you going away, but if you are going to do all of this we are going to move closer to my family so we wanted to move to Minnesota. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 I can’t do the match process which usually happens in residency. 7, 9, 15, 17 I had to scramble which means I had to find a program with an open spot that is not through the match process. 6, 17 And now we were limiting it to Minnesota. 12 I was going to have to do pediatrics or something.  Nothing against pediatrics but I didn’t want to do pediatrics.  I was stuck with family medicine or I was willing to do internal medicine in Minnesota. 12, 14 I said, Leah, the odds of me getting a position are really small. 18 She was like, I’m going to move to Minnesota. 15 If you have to do residency somewhere else we will try to make it work but I’m moving to Minnesota. 7, 9 I was like, Well, shit. 18 I’m moving to Minnesota, too.  Part of my disease -- my pathology, not my disease -- was that too much of my identity was tied up in being a doctor anyway. 12, 14, 18 I thought this might be the universe’s way of telling me I shouldn’t be a doctor for a little while. 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 I thought, If I can’t get a spot in Minnesota I will find something else to fill my time, but I’ll be in Minnesota. 5, 6, 17, 18 I get the scramble list from a friend of mine in treatment actually because I hadn’t even signed up in time to get the scramble list. 7, 11, 12, 13, 20 There are two open family medicine spots and one open internal medicine spot. 6, 12, 14 I called the internal medicine spot place actually second and no one answered. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 The first place I called was the residency spot in North Memorial, the family medicine residency at the University of Minnesota. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 I didn’t get a voicemail, I got the program coordinator. 17 I just blurted out my history to her. 15 And she was like, Oh, okay.  Can you fax over your stuff?  [laughs] 15 I said, Sure.  So I did, and then I got a phone call a half an hour later from the program director. 8, 15, 16, 18, 19 I tell him my whole story and he goes, Okay. 15 Then we did a little interview and he asked me about my interest in family medicine, he asked me about Minnesota, about treatment, what I thought of it, and if I viewed myself as an addict, which I did at the time. 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 Then I got another phone call from the associate program director and another from the head of behavioral medicine at the program. 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 Then I got an offer faxed to me and I took it.  AS: Did the behavioral medicine have anything to do with addiction medicine? 12, 14, 15 RL: No, it was just the behaviorist.  Most family medicine programs have some sort of behavioral health component. 8, 12, 14, 15, 19 Most of them have a behavioral health lead. 15, 19 I think it is required. 5 North certainly does. 8, 17 They have a long history of integration with behavioral health in their primary care training. 15, 17, 19 It was just part of the interview process for every applicant. 9, 17 It was pretty clear they didn’t know anything about addiction. 10, 12, 14 But they knew enough that they thought, Well, this guy seems pretty smart, pretty motivated, and he says he’s sober. 6, 10, 16, 17, 18 AS: And they had an opening. 10 RL: They had an opening. 10 One thing I did not know was that they had an opening in the first year position and in the second year position. 10, 12, 14 Given my standing they could move me to the second year open position and take someone else they really wanted for the first year position, too. 14, 15, 18 It worked out very well for them.  AS: You already had a year? 14 RL: According to the American Board of National Medicine I had something like twenty months of actual training. 11, 14, 16 You also have to do twenty-four consecutive months at one training center so you had to do that. 11, 16 I had to do my second and third year here at North. 14 That’s how I wound up in Minnesota.  AS: How did you get into addiction medicine? 12, 14 When did you get into it?  RL: That’s a great question. 20 One of the things I loved about my treatment and about my treatment provider at Hazelden was that he, and my addiction doctor at the other treatment place was great, but the addiction doc at Hazelden really loved addiction and loved teaching it to other physicians. 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 It was part of his spiel. 9 When I first got intervened on, I initially thought that addicts are bad people. 9, 14, 17, 18 I’m sorry, I did think that.  Through treatment I thought, Well, other addicts aren’t bad people, but I’m a bad person. 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 That took a long time. 17 Part of Dr. Williams’ approach was teaching us about the disease.  He said, You’re not a bad person.  I know you did some bad things, I’m not going to lie. 12 This is what is happening in your brain. 13, 15 I found that fascinating.  My parents are both psychiatrists. 12, 20 I knew I didn’t want to do psychiatry. 16 I wanted to do something that was more medical and this seemed like a great intersection. 6, 7, 14, 18, 20 I was just utterly fascinated about it and I started reading about it in treatment. 12, 13 I had a ton of time, it was actually great. 7, 20 There was a ton of structure, I actually didn’t have that much free time in treatment. 7, 12, 13, 15 But, with my free time I did a lot of reading on it.  Also, I still loved medicine. 12, 14 I thought, I may not be able to be a doctor, but that doesn’t mean I can’t learn about it. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 I read about it, and I learned a fair amount even before I ever set foot in a family medicine residency. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 I set foot in a family medicine residency, I started seeing patients, and I loved it. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 I loved it from the very start. 14 I also remember being super grateful that I had a job. 11, 16 By the way, that persists. 18 I still, to this day, am super grateful that I am a physician. 16 It is a really wonderful way to fight burnout. 18 People talk a lot about burnout physicians.  I know how close I came to not being able to be a doctor and I am still to this day infinitely grateful that I was given that chance. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 And how privileged that position is, and it is.  I realized that no one knows the first thing about addiction. 8, 12, 14 They will go, This guy is an alcoholic. 6 He’s in bad pain we should just give him Percocet. 6 I’m like, That’s a bad idea.  They are like, Why?  I go, What do you mean, why?  They would say, He’s addicted to alcohol he’s not going to get addicted to Percocet. 6, 12, 14 I’m like, That’s not how it goes.  I was printing articles and showing them to my attendings.  They were saying, Oh, that’s interesting I didn’t know that. 12, 17 How do you not know this. 12 AS: Because there is no training.  RL: Because there is no training on addiction, especially back even in 2009. 12, 14 There was none. 8 And this is a very good and progressive group of doctors at North. 10, 12, 14 They said, We need to learn more. 10 Even as a second year resident, they started asking me to help develop a chronic pain program and develop screening tools and help us develop this because I already knew stuff. 6, 9, 14, 16 They forced me further to do more research and to do more stuff and I got super into it. 8, 16 I also was like, No one knows what they are doing. 8, 12 I was like, Why am I a second year and a third year resident telling attendings how to do this stuff? 9, 14, 15 The answer was because I knew more than they did. 16 That’s okay, but that’s when I started to develop my passion.  I was like, Look, addiction treatment belongs in primary care. 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 Not all of it, there is a time and a place for an addiction specialist, but like diabetes, the vast majority of addiction treatment I feel should occur in primary care settings. 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 Only when they are too complicated should they be referred to an addiction specialist. 5, 12, 14, 17 There is no way we are going to have enough addiction specialists to treat everyone who has an addiction. 12, 14, 18 Just like we are never going to have enough renologists to treat everyone with renal problems. 12, 16 We are never going to have enough endocrinologists to treat everyone with diabetes. 10, 14, 16 Family medicine has to do the bulk of this, but the bulk of the simple stuff. 12, 14 Frankly, the majority of addiction cases are relatively straightforward. 12, 14, 17, 18 The ones that we hear about are very complicated and do belong probably to a specialist. 8, 9, 17 I can tell you the mundane are mundane.  “You’re just a normal alcoholic, man!” 6, 16 [laughs] 15 That’s the most common visit I have.  They tell you this whole story and it is my story, it is me again, and I’m like, You’re an alcoholic. 6, 15 They think it’s the end of the world, and I’m just like, No, you’re just one of the thousands of people I’ve treated. 9, 12 It’s not exciting to me.  They are like expecting me to be really upset and I’m like, No, seriously, I do this all the time. 11, 18 This is super common. 16 I started and then I really wanted to work in integration of addiction medicine into primary care. 12, 14, 18, 19 I had a meeting with one of my mentors at North Memorial when I was a third year resident. 9, 12, 14, 18 I said, I want to do faculty, I want to do this.  And he said, If you want to do this you need to do fellowship. 10 You need the credentials. 5, 9, 14 We would take you, but to make policy change and to take to systems and things like that.  You need -- even though at the time it wasn’t Board of American Medical Association recognized -- you need a fellowship and the letters after your name. 10, 14, 17 At the time I was also going to a meeting of drug doctors and I’m not going to talk about it because it violates on the rules of AA too much, but there was a large meeting where a bunch of doctors in recovery meet regularly. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 I had become friends with a bunch of the doctors that meet regularly and one of the people there happened to work at the Hazelden location in Minnesota. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 They said, Look, we can create a fellowship for you and someone else. 10 They had two people in line. 9 They said, Why don’t you drop by when you are back in Minnesota? 5, 11 So I did and we met a couple of times. 11 He was a friend of a friend and we became very friendly and he eventually became my mentor in addiction medicine and I did the fellowship. 5, 10, 12, 14, 20 I continued to work with Hazelden part time and at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis/St. 9 Paul] part time. 9 In 2015 I left Hazelden to work at the University full time. 14 Since then I have, through a lot of luck and hard work, I have been sober since May 3, 2008. 9 I didn’t talk about this, but of course I had to be monitored by the state. 5 They knew and I had a medical license from my hometown and I had a medical license from Minnesota so I told them and had to be monitored. 5, 7, 13, 14, 16 For three and a half years everyday I would have to call and leave a random urine drug screen. 5, 6, 14, 16, 18 Sometimes I would have to wake up very early before rotation or after I was on call I would have to drive to a collection point and leave urine. 5, 6, 18 I had regular quarterly reports from work and from my sponsor. 13 I needed to have meeting attendance, I had to see a psychiatrist, I had to do aftercare again. 6, 18, 19 I don’t know why the state had me do that again because I had been sober for two years. 12, 14 They suddenly mandated that I had to do another aftercare program. 13, 19 I don’t understand that fully. 14, 17, 18 But I was still at the stage where I was like, Okay, whatever.  I did twenty-five two hour meetings with this group. 15, 18 It was great actually. 7, 20 You have remained open and cooperative in your own recovery because it’s humbling.  Would you say you are a more humble person now? 12 More grateful?  RL: Infinitely so.  I had strengths growing up but humility was not one of them. 10 I’m not sure you could call humility one of my strengths now, but I certainly have a lot more of it than I did. 8, 12, 17 I wouldn’t call it one of my weaknesses anymore.  AS: But you aren’t using your authority as a physician to bulk at or refuse to go to these things. 6, 13 Or is it that you aren’t allowed to do that anyway? 10, 18 RL: Good, good point. 10 I wasn’t able to because the state could always take my medical licence away. 7, 14, 18, 20 That was always the threat. 18 I was always compliant because I knew how good recovery was. 10, 16, 18 I had learned, frankly, when I was a patient at Hazelden, that I didn’t have all the answers. 10 Sometimes you have to listen to other people. 9 Still, to this day, I trust those people. 9, 16 That they know more about what is best for my disease than I do. 12 When I start to take control of my disease is when I start to run into trouble. 8, 18 When my sponsor says, You need to go to a meeting, I go to a meeting. 18 My new sponsor in Minnesota is not a physician. 16 My first sponsor was. 14 He doesn’t know anything about medicine. 12, 14 I prefer it that way. 10, 18 If he tells me I need to go to a meeting, I go to a meeting. 15, 18 If I say, I’m an addiction medicine doctor, what do you mean I need to go to a meeting? 12, 14, 18 I just go to a meeting. 18 I trust him.  AS: You say something or he hears something and he knows you need to go to a meeting? 9, 12, 18 RL: If I’m getting petty, or too anxious, or irritated while driving. 5, 14 That’s a big one for me. 8 He’ll be like, How was the drive home? 5 And I’ll tell him, Not great. 20 He says, You’ve got to go to a meeting. 18 And he’s almost always right. 12, 18 Sometimes he’s not but I still go to a meeting and it’s good. 10, 18 Yes, AA is very important to my recovery. 9 I acknowledge that. 12 I know that it’s not for everyone. 12 I feel sorry for those people because it has been integral to my recovery and my social group. 9, 19 I don’t hide my addiction either. 12, 14 I hid it long enough. 17 I was always open with the people at the University and at North Memorial. 9, 18 I was very fortunate in that they did not judge me because I know stories of people that have been judged. 9, 12 Now that I have a track record of successful employment it is harder to stigmatize and not hire me for things. 9, 12, 16 They have no basis to not hire me.  I was successfully hired before. 5, 14 I know I am lucky. 8, 12 I also teach residents now and I tell them in orientation about my own story as a part of wellness. 9, 12, 15 I say, Look, there are fourteen people in this room between the staff and the residents. 9, 14 Statistically two of us are going to develop a problem with substance use disorder. 6, 12, 13 Fortunately for you guys I have already taken one of the spots. 6 That’s how I usually start.  Only one of you now can take the other spot. 6, 12 I tell them my story and, like the person that was there for me at my other job, I say, I am always here for you guys. 11, 15, 18 It has come up.  We have had residents in this program that have developed addiction and we have gotten them help. 9, 12, 14 They have gotten their medical licenses and are successfully practicing. 7, 13, 14 Not all those stories go that way, it just happens to be at this program I sponsored someone in medical school who did not graduate medical school. 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 18 He relapsed and said he was done. 8 It is not always rosy, I’m not going to argue that. 18 I have been very blessed and very fortunate in my life in many ways. 10, 18 AS: How has the integration of addiction treatment in primary care been working for you here? 12, 13, 14, 19 RL: That is a great question. 20 It totally depends on what you define as success. 11, 15 If you set the bar at better than when I got here, it has succeeded very well.  I go to a lot of opioid and addiction forums in the state and I hear what doctors that practice are doing and I maybe have an ego moment that I have a lot of pride that none of my residents are going to do any of those things. 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 I will say that with certainty every year we graduate ten family medicine doctors and none of them will do these things. 8, 12, 14, 17 None of them are going to blindly going to prescribe benzos or narcotics to anyone with an opioid use disorder. 6, 8, 10, 13 They will at least have a conversation about risks and benefits and monitor them with drug screening. 5, 6, 15 They will at least do that at a very minimum.  AS: That adds up to a lot of patients every year who those people will be seeing. 6, 9, 14 RL: Yes, it does.  It is because of what the faculty and I have built here.  I guess it did start with me.  AS: What does it involve?  What are they required to do as a part of it? 5, 9 RL: That is a very long and complicated answer. 17 AS: How many hours of training do they get? 15 RL: That is a little like asking a family medicine doctor, 12, 14, 20 How many hours on diabetes and hypertension do you have? 10, 15 The answer is like, I don’t know, it comes up when it comes up. 12 AS: Okay.  What you’re doing is creating a space where this is considered part of your normal training. 5, 9, 16 Patients will come to you and some of them -- RL: Right.  And we do have formal didactics. 14 I just had a formal didactics with the residents on congestive heart failure. 9, 14 We also have one on alcoholism and opioid use disorder and chronic pain. 6, 13 AS: The fact is is that it is integrated into the program whereas there are many programs where it is not discussed at all.  RL: Right.  When I discuss a case with the resident, when a twenty-six year old male comes in for a physical, which happens, they say, His blood pressure is fine, his cholesterol is okay, he needs more sleep, his single partner and sex stuff is okay. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 I will say, Have you asked him about his alcohol use? 6, 13 Initially it was ‘no’ but now he would say, I screened him for alcohol use and yes, he’s drinking too much and we talked about that. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13 I asked if he has a family history of alcohol use, and actually, yes, he meets the criteria for alcoholism. 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 18 We talked about that and we talked about next steps.  AS: So it is just integrated into it.  RL: It is integrated into it, yeah.  You have patients that you know are alcoholics. 6, 12 When he comes back and his blood pressure is high and I tell him he needs to quit drinking and he comes back and he actually looks like he is in alcohol withdrawal and we talked about that. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 It changes the trajectory of the treating. 6, 13 It just becomes something that you are used to talking about doing, and it therefore becomes part of it. 6, 9, 13, 16 AS: And not one of these uncomfortable, hidden things.  The patient can still hide it, but if the doctor is willing to talk about it -- RL: I don’t want to say that it never happens because it does. 12, 14, 15, 16 Because these things are still difficult to talk about. 10 The thing that it does mostly is in established patients in our clinics that have chronic pain, that are on narcotics, that we start to suspect have narcotic depends, residents will shy away from that conversation because it is a very difficult conversation. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20 I am working on it.  That is something a primary care doctor has to do. 12, 14, 19 That is not something an addiction doctor has to do. 12, 14 Something that the person prescribing the opioids needs to do. 6, 10, 13 But, we look for it now. 12 We didn’t even look for it.  We have prescribed you a bunch of oxycodone, why is there all this morphine in your urine? 6, 10 We test it further and it comes back, Well, it looks like you did some heroin. 16 I never did heroin, doc. 14, 16 It’s in your urine. 6 Okay, I’ve been doing heroin for three years. 14, 16 You’re like, Okay, now we need to have a separate conversation. 12 It happens all the time. 15 AS: Right.  What about best practices for the future of addiction medicine and for primary care doctors dealing with addiction? 12, 14, 19 RL: I would say that a lot of the recommendations are already out there. 12 If you look at the American Academy of Family Physicians there are different classes of recommendations for screening. 7, 12 Class A is the highest. 7 At least to my knowledge at this date and time, there is only one Class A recommendation for screening and that is for drug and alcohol use. 5, 6, 12, 13 Everything we do is Class B, which is still very good. 10 You should still do it, there is still good evidence, but it’s not as good. 10 When you get screened for depression, cholesterol, high blood pressure, sexually transmitted diseases, Hepatitis C, or pap smears that’s actually all Class B. 7, 10, 12, 17 The only thing that is A is substance use disorder. 6, 13 Everyone does is with the same rigor that they do all the B stuff.  When they think about why, it just becomes part of what they do. 9 When they find a positive they know what the next steps are. 12 Part of the reason doctors don’t screen for addiction is because you will never convince a physician to screen for something where they say, Yeah, I got that. 12, 14, 16 They have no idea how to treat it.  They would just prefer to not ask the question. 10 No one wants to feel like an idiot. 8 If I asked you the question as a physician and they say, Yeah, I have that.  What do I do, doc? 14 And I’m like, I don’t know. 12 You would never ask that question. 16 I hope that they know at least enough to do it. 9, 12 There is a whole system called ESPRIT out there that is supposed to teach primary care doctors how to do that. 12, 14, 19 I would like to see that very tightly integrated with primary care. 6, 19 I would like to see a better understanding of medication assisted treatment; I would like to see more primary care doctors doing buprenorphine treatment and other things like Naloxone, Vivitrol, and Capral. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 Plus, better behavioral therapy and understanding of addiction as a chronic, relapsing disease of the entire family, and more help with the biologic, psychologic, housing, financial stressors that come with this disease like we do for a lot of other chronic diseases. 6, 7, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 We do this for diabetes. 10 We really do, especially inner-city clinics. 18 We just don’t with addiction. 12, 14 That’s all I’m asking is to pair it with these other diseases.  AS: Cancer, too.  There are mothers of addicts that have written about having breast cancer and being so supported and cared for, so much follow through that their addict children never get. 5, 10, 14, 16, 19, 20 RL: That’s what I would like to see. 6 A good idea about where to refer one to treatment. 10, 12, 13 An easier, immediate availability of treatment. 12, 13 That is a key piece that we really lack. 15, 18 Even with all the resources we have here in Minneapolis.  If I see someone that really needs to go to treatment I cannot get them in. 6, 12, 13, 18 Many studies have shown that that is frankly very tragic because you will never get better results than immediately. 6, 16 Right now when you are ready you need to go directly to treatment. 12, 13, 18 AS: The waiting of ten days, two days -- RL: Yeah. 15, 16 Forget it.  Even a day is too much. 16 Sometimes even twelve hours is too much. 15 If you have ever watched the show Intervention, which I am not going to comment on, the one thing they do really well is if you say yes, you are on a plane. 12, 17, 18 You don’t get time to pack even.  They pack you a bag.  You are on that plane and that is the way they do it. 18 That is actually the way to do it. 7, 18 No time to think about it, just do it.  I would like to see that. 6 I want to see a primary care doctor that says, This guy needs help right now, like you would if someone was having a heart attack. 6, 9, 12, 14, 19 You would get them a bed at the hospital immediately. 8 You are not going to wait two days on a heart attack. 9, 16 There needs to be enough knowledge in the primary care system so that every doctor isn’t like, Oh, you drank too much alcohol? 5, 6, 12, 14, 16, 19 You need a good -- It’s not like everyone with chest pain needs to come to the hospital for cardiac care. 6, 8, 10, 19 There needs to be enough knowledge in the primary care setting to when the one needs to go, but these thousands of others just need to be seen again in a few days when we will talk more about your drinking. 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 19 AS: How far are we from that?  RL: Far.  Not even close. 9, 10 AS: Besides someone like you happening upon this program, are there more people like you? 9, 15 RL: It is starting.  Medical schools -- yes. 7, 14 I am infinitely replaceable.  There are lots of people like me. 9, 16 AS: Are there people like this across the country? 9, 19 RL: Absolutely.  The American of Board of Medicine has many people like this. 9, 14 Some people way more than I am, even. 9, 18 There are people that are trying to develop whole health care systems like this. 9, 19 My former colleagues at Hazelden, everyone who is really committed to recovery is working on this problem. 12, 18 AS: In primary care? 19 RL: In primary care. 19 Particularly in primary care because they acknowledge that you need that basis. 12, 19 You need to have the same understanding of addiction that they do of heart disease. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 They need to know enough to know when this person needs help and this person needs something else. 12 AS: Right.  When to refer you and stuff.  RL: There is not a ton of availability of people that can train other people. 9 Time is tight and time is precious. 10 What are you going to sub out for addiction care? 12, 14, 19 Then you start getting into political issues. 12, 13 It’s not like medical students sit around not doing stuff for periods of weeks. 7, 14, 15, 18 Everyday is busy in medical school. 7, 14, 15, 16 You have to remove something if you are going to put something in. 15 The issue is what are you going to remove? 13, 15 You’re not going to remove my thing. 15 Everyone thinks their thing is the most important, including me! 9, 17 I’m addiction doctor and I think addiction is the most important. 9, 12, 14 If you have a heart disease, you do you need to know. 9, 12 AS: Did we make room for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]? 14, 19 RL: Yes, but I would argue that the training for HIV in medical school is not sufficient. 7, 14 AS: Still?  RL: Still.  AS: What about mental health? 12, 19 RL: It is definitely not sufficient. 9 I can make the argument that all training in medical school is not sufficient and that is why we do a residency. 7, 9, 12, 14 That is why you aren’t ready to practice once you graduate medical school. 7, 14 We need to build a foundation.  Is there enough of a foundation in HIV?  Probably.  Mental health? 19 Probably not.  We still have work to do.  AS: It seems to me there is so much that goes hand in hand with mental health and addiction. 6, 12, 14, 19 RL: Right.  Stigma, too.  The thing that we do really well that have foundations are that I have taken all the CPR classes, pulmonary, and renal. 7, 18 That we have a good basis in medical school. 7, 10, 14 And that is really important as a doctor. 9, 12, 14, 18 I am not trying to minimize that.  If one of those fails you are going to have big problems. 12 You need to know that stuff. 12 AS: Of course.  But you as a doctor are going to encounter people with addiction. 9, 12, 14 Very severe and very mild. 6 RL: Especially once you start looking.  Some people will go, Oh, addiction isn’t that common. 9, 12, 14 Then once you start looking and a student comes to a residency and they go, Oh my god, once you start looking for it it’s everywhere. 7, 9, 11 I’m like, Yeah, I know. 12 Most of it is this guy who drinks too much and has uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes because he drinks too much. 5, 10, 18 That is the most common form of addiction that we see. 6, 12, 14 Guy or woman.  Addiction is blind to sex and race and everything. 12, 14 You can treat the hypertension and diabetes as much as you want but until you treat their addiction you’re not going to make any headway. 10, 12, 14, 18 That is the most common case I see. 6, 17 AS: Two last things.  What is an ordinary day like? 16 And then kind of an extraordinary day? 16 RL: It is interesting because I have so many hats as faculty that I use in an ordinary day of practicing addiction medicine. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 At a normal clinic I will see anywhere from six patients in a half day to twenty patients in a half day. 6, 8, 14, 16 My clinic is integrated so not all of my patients are addiction patients. 12, 14 Even on a twenty person day it is still at most sixteen addiction patients and four will be hypertension and diabetes. 10, 12, 14, 16 Even though I have time set aside I still get general primary care, which is great. 19, 20 I like it that way. 18 Most of the preponderance of my patients that I see because of the way the clinic is set up are more severe. 6, 10, 18 They are almost all opioid addicts. 13, 14 Most of the run of the mill alcoholics get treated by my colleagues because it is more straightforward. 6, 8, 12, 14 If they get more severe then I will see them. 6 The ones in liver failure or the ones that are coming out of treatment and have bad neuropathy, I will see them. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 We will have discussions ranging from how their life is falling apart now because they relapsed to how great things are because they are finally sober again and their kids are talking to them again. 9, 10, 11, 12, 20 Little victories and little defeats. 20 People getting better and people getting worse. 9 People requesting medication that is not appropriate. 14 People telling me this other doctor that wanted to give them medication that was inappropriate and they said no and are really proud of it or things like that. 12, 14, 15, 18 There is always some confrontation like, I looked in your urine and it’s in there. 6, 18 They say, No, I didn’t do it.  There’s always some of that and some talk about what we are going to do moving forward and what the next step of treatment is. 12, 13, 18 Almost every day has some sort of discussion of someone that needs to step up treatment and needs to see me more frequently or they need to go to an even higher level of care, meaning inpatient treatment or more intensive outpatient treatment or something like that. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19 I’ve mentioned that AA isn’t for everyone, and that’s true. 5, 8, 12 I can’t get everyone to go to AA.  We then discuss, for lack of a better term, what sort of spiritual recovery are you having? 17 By that I mean what part of your recovery are you not focusing on yourself but you’re focusing on others. 6, 9 How is that integrated into your recovery?  If the answer is no I have the whole spiel about, You need that to really have a happy life. 10, 18 If I had stayed focused on myself my entire life, my entire recover, I would have used again I’m pretty sure. 6, 10, 13, 15, 16 I have had some really bad things happen to me when I was in recovery. 15, 18 It is by pulling upon my resources of friends and family that really helps me through that. 12, 16, 18, 20 And by getting out of myself.  Going and doing stuff that is not for me.  Even when I am in a lot of turmoil it is important. 9 That’s a pretty typical day. 10, 16 AS: And an extraordinary day? 16 Whether that is good or bad. 10 RL: Addiction does make chaos. 14 Even in an ordinary day there is a fair amount of chaos in it. 9, 16 I have patients show up hours early, hours late. 15 I have double bookings, and then I have patients showing up twelve at a time within twenty minutes. 15 I have to scramble.  People in early recovery --  AS: But you work with them and you’re flexible?  RL: Oh, yeah.  There are some patients that I set boundaries with.  I am not going to say it for everybody, but yeah, for the vast majority of patients I will work with them. 18 They are here to see me and I will see if it is physically possible, and it is for the vast majority. 6, 18 It can be stressful. 7 What makes an extraordinary day for me is a therapeutic breakthrough or a therapeutic collapse. 16 The thing that makes an extraordinary day is when I have a patient of mine that has not been doing well and we have a really difficult conversation where I say, I think you need to go to inpatient treatment. 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 Then they say, What about my kids?  I say, You are going to lose them. 9 I am going to have to report you to CPS [child protective services] or I already have reported you to CPS. 13, 14, 19 When they come back from treatment and they are sober, which happens, the change in them is remarkable and will make my entire week or month. 5, 12, 13, 15, 16 It is wonderful to see. 6, 18 Sometimes I don’t recognize them. 17 Patients that cursed me and told me how much they hated me. 16 They curse at me and yell at me and tell me some very, very hurtful things.  [laughs] 15 Seriously!  I just had this one patient three months ago tell me I was a terrible doctor and that she hates me and she can’t imagine that all my patients don’t hate me and she can’t imagine any reason why anyone doesn’t hate me. 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 The only reason anyone is nice to me is because they are afraid of me. 18 It was actually really hurtful and I had to destress and debrief with another colleague afterwards. 7, 18, 19 It really hurt especially because I had treated her for a while and she was not doing well. 12, 18 She came back to see me just a couple of days ago and she told me she needed to talk to me. 6, 11, 13, 16 I asked her why and she said it was because her case with CPS was ending and they were going to stop monitoring her. 14, 17, 18 She was taking narcotics from a pain clinic and I told her it was a bad idea for her. 6, 11, 16 They were monitoring her usage and she said, I know that as soon as they stopped monitoring me I was going to relapse, you were right. 12, 18 There is no way I’m going to stay sober. 18 She asked me to help her not do that.  The amount of courage it took her to do that really moved me. 7, 15, 18 AS: To come back to you.  RL: She never actually apologized, but coming back she didn’t have to apologize. 7, 14, 16 AS: The act of it.  RL: It was really an extraordinary day. 16, 18 AS: And you understand how remarkable that is, really, only because you have been in her shoes. 5, 17, 18 Would you say that is true? 5 RL: I think you can develop that working with addicts long enough. 14, 17 I would not say you need a personal experience. 18 Maybe it is easier if you have had one.  I am not one of those doctors that thinks that. 12, 14, 17 I think you can just have someone who is intellectually curious about addiction, as good of an addiction doctor as me. 10, 12, 14 Without any personal or family history with the stuff. 12, 15 You could still understand. 17, 18 But yes, it helps.  AS: It helps.  The other thing I was thinking about was what if a doctor didn’t have an understanding of a patient’s addiction and they went off on them like that, they might be barred from coming back to the clinic or something. 5, 12, 14, 17, 18 RL: They would certainly be hesitant to see that patient again. 6, 8, 17 They probably couldn’t see me again. 6 AS: Once you start to understand addiction and what people will say and do in the throws of it you can treat them differently and by treat, I mean both ways. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 RL: Yes, you can.  AS: That goes back to what we were talking about about integrating it into primary care because you can lose so many people who need help with addiction and primary care if you don’t know how to deal with their responses. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 The other thing is I have had patients that literally have threatened to stab me if I didn’t give them a drug. 5, 6 I have zero tolerance for that.  They will be disbarred from the clinic and they cannot come back. 5, 14 There is one patient in particular who straight out showed me a knife and said, I’m going to stab you if you don’t give me benzos. 9 I told him I would go get the prescription pad right away and so security came and escorted him out. 10, 12, 16, 18, 20 That has happened. 15 He was barred from coming back to the clinic. 5, 14 I’m sure he didn’t do well.  I was prescribing him suboxone and he called and said he needed his suboxone. 8, 10 I said, Not from me you don’t.  You threatened to stab me.  I’m sorry, but you can’t come back here.  AS: Unbelievable.  RL: I don’t know what happened to him. 12, 15 That kind of stuff does happen. 15 It has happened once since 2009. 15 That’s a remarkable day. 5, 16 AS: Is there anything else that you want to say?  RL: A lot of people have this misconception that addiction is exhausting and people must burn out. 9, 12, 14 Most people have this impression that in addiction medicine everyone knows the nature of their disease. 9, 10, 12, 14 ER doctors that I have a tremendous amount of respect for look at me like I am crazy for doing this because every single addiction patient they see is in the ER. 6, 12, 14, 20 They aren’t in recovery.  Take me for example.  I am a perfect example. 17 I was working here at North and I am still klutzy.  That has not gotten better with my recovery.  I tripped and fell down the stairs and I very badly sprained one of my toes.  I hobbled myself into the ER and said I needed an x-ray because I couldn’t walk. 16 I got an x-ray and the whole visit was an hour. 15 They told me to take Ibuprofen and go back to work. 16 They gave me a little walking shoe to walk in that helped the pain a lot. 6, 16, 20 That ER doctor had no idea -- even though I know it is in my chart -- that I was an addict. 12, 14 He had no idea.  None. 8 I did not appear to be an addict. 14 I did not request narcotics and I would have turned them down if he had offered them to me. 5, 20 There is nothing about that visit.  I was in scrubs for christ’s sake. 5 There was nothing about that visit that made it look like I was an addict. 14 In his mind I wasn’t an addict. 14 Then the person coming in demanding drugs for vague symptoms and screams at you and calls you all sorts of names, because they are in the throws of craving or in withdrawal or they are desperate, that is every addict for him. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16 His denominator for every addict is all those people that bother him. 9, 14 But I am not in that denominator because in his mind I’m not an addict. 14 That is a part of the problem with addiction. 9, 12, 14 Once you recover from it no one knows unless you tell them. 8, 12 That is part of the reason I tell people. 9 Because you would never know. 12, 16 I am a bigger person and so you might know that I struggle with some eating issues, and I do, but you would never know that I was an IV drug addict by looking at me. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 Because I used pharmaceutical grade fentanyl I don’t actually have track marks. 5, 6, 7, 13, 16 I have a scar, but it is very hard to see. 6, 9 AS: You’re point is that addiction medicine isn’t as terrible as some people think. 9, 11, 12, 14 RL: Patients do not do that because by the time they come to see us they know that they have a problem and they are there to work with us to get better. 6, 12 They are not the patients in the ER screaming for meds.  They are not that pain patient that every doctor hates to see. 6, 12, 14 By the way, on that note, that pain patient that you hate to see, you hate to see because he or she has an addiction problem. 6, 12, 14, 18 If you confront it then you have one painful visit and you can help them get over it. 6 If you don’t help confront them, every time you see them it is a painful visit. 6 Just get it over with, confront them, or discuss it with them.  Just get it on the table and then it is done. 8 That is the crux of recovery in a lot of ways. 18 Just talk about it.  Once it is out in the open they can yell at you and scream at you.  It can be a tough visit.  I do this a lot and my heartrate still goes up when I go into the room. 9, 14 Then we get to move on. 15 That’s all I’ve got.  AS: Thank you, that was really generous. 18"
"16","Falkowski_Carol","Mary McCarthy Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer April 14, 2017 Minneapolis, Minnesota Mary McCarthy-MM Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  We are at Cafe Southside in Minneapolis. 9 It is April 14th.  I am with Mary McCarthy.  Mary, do you give me permission to record this interview?  MM: Yes.  AS: Can you start with where you grew up and your childhood, early adulthood, your life? 10, 14, 20 MM: Sure.  I was born in Washington, D.C. It was kind of a crazy story so I won’t go into a lot of detail on that, but there was a lot of conflict in their relationship when I was little. 14, 15, 19, 20 They were breaking up and getting back together a lot. 8 In about second grade my mom got a job offer in Colorado Springs. 5, 11, 14 She worked for HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development], so we moved to Colorado. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15 He ultimately ended up leaving her at that point in time and she lost her job. 11 A whole bunch of things happened, which brought us to Minnesota. 15 The next year we ended up living in Minnesota. 14 It was third grade spent until sixth grade here. 5 Then we moved up north. 7, 15 She was in a series of not great relationship with, ironically, people who were addicted primarily to alcohol. 6, 9, 12, 14, 19, 20 At least that’s what I knew at that time, which was forty years ago. 13, 14, 16 My sister is forty-two now, and she was born during that period of time. 12, 14, 18, 20 My parental family background is two families of raving alcoholics. 6, 12, 17, 20 My paternal grandmother started off the day every morning with a screwdriver or a Bloody Mary and ended the day with gimlets and martinis. 5, 16 She was kind of buzzed perpetually.  My mom’s side of the family had a lot of alcoholics, primarily the men in the family who were also abusive at times. 6, 9, 12, 14 My grandmother had grown up in Chicago and left an abusive husband. 5, 10, 13, 14 She moved to Iowa. 7, 15 There are a lot of family secrets. 12 My mom kind of reinvented herself around the time I was born and continually thereafter. 14 That is a whole other story that we won’t record! 15 From an anthropological standpoint it is kind of an interesting story. 13, 15, 17 There has been a lot of abuse in them. 6, 13 As I mentioned those two relationships after I was born that produced my sisters were both with people who were struggling with alcohol and maybe other substances too. 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 19, 20 One of those individuals I don’t have contact with deliberately. 13 At the last count he had twenty-three children. 5, 14, 20 I’m not lying.  One story is there were a couple of families with multiple kids, like four or five, and at one point he had beaten them so severely that another mom had to take care of the kids while the other mom was in the hospital. 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19 A lot of that kind of behavior.  When I was younger there was a lot of violence because of the drinking. 5, 6, 11, 20 When I was thirteen I ran away from home and went to live with my dad. 14, 18, 20 At that point we were living up north on the reservation. 19 I went to live with my birth father and stayed with him for a year and a half. 14, 16 AS: Your birth father is from the reservation? 16, 19 My stepfather is. 7, 16 My birth father was out on the East Coast. 16 I moved back to Maryland and was in Maryland for a year and a half and then I came back to Minnesota and that’s where I finished high school and did all of that. 7, 14, 15 Ironically, after I ran away a lot of stuff changed. 13, 18, 20 The use didn’t change, but the abuse that I experienced changed. 6, 13, 14, 18 There were benefits to it I guess. 15 If you are familiar with the ACE Study [Adverse Childhood Experience] 8 I score an eight, roughly.  That kind of gives you a sense.  The fact that I operate and function is probably a pretty good thing. 9, 10 I smoke cigarettes, but that’s it.  Sometimes I think that is part of the reason it is so hard for me to quit. 9 Looking at trauma as we have in the last few years has brought that to the forefront for me. 14 Continued through high school a couple of episodes of drunken fights and things like that in my home. 5, 7, 8, 11, 14 I started to get to a point where I could stand up to it to some degree.  I had two smaller sisters that I was protecting. 20 In the meantime both of my grandmothers had died in that period of time, which was really traumatic as well. 5, 18 One of them I think was driving, or had only ever been the partner of someone who was drinking. 5, 9, 11, 14 She had kind of grown up with that as an adult woman, but I had never experienced something like that. 10, 16, 18 The grandmothers even though they had their issues didn’t seem to transfer that a whole lot. 5, 6, 12, 13, 17 AS: And they were important to your growing up. 9, 10 MM: Yes, but they both died when I was ten.  They died four months apart and it was traumatic. 9, 11, 16 I am actually the namesake of one of them. 7, 16 The drunk one, I hate to say it, I was her namesake and was her only grandchild. 5, 8, 14, 16 It was devastating for me.  Both of them at the same time.  I still mourn them to this day. 16 Ironically my stepmother, or my stepfather’s mother, within that same eighteen-month period of time was killed in a car accident on New Year’s Eve and everybody in the car was drunk. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 18 My whole extended family, all of the adults, were in the car when the accident happened. 12, 13, 15 It was a lot of trauma around use and drinking. 5, 6, 11, 13 I’ve gone through my stages of drinking too, but have never had an issue with it other than throwing up when I drink too much. 5, 11, 13, 16 I saw a lot of those patterns, whether it be of the abuse or anything, so I kind of tried to stop some of those. 6, 13 Interestingly enough we also are a very marijuana cultured family. 5, 12 Something I grew up with. 20 It was never, “Oh let me see if I can get my hands on it!” 6, 16, 17 It was never any kind of ideation like that. 16 I just had access to it and had a really clear understanding of it. 9, 14, 17, 18 As an adult I adopted it as an episodic habit and now actually use it medically, not legally medically, but for medical purposes and will probably smoke pot until the day I die. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 Being totally frank with you.  I think that that is a harm reduction technique. 5, 14 When I am working with clients I have especially those addicted to methamphetamine or other things I counsel them, and this is partly based on direction from our medical director and partly based on my own knowledge, that “smoke a joint instead and see if that gets you to the place you need to be rather than doing something different.” 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 I had two marriages. 14 My second marriage ultimately was with somebody addicted to methamphetamine. 6, 8, 12, 14 I did try that a couple of times. 11 I don’t know why. 12 It was the stupidest thing in the world because I can’t take Sudafed, so why would I ever think I could do something like that?  Growing up on the reservation you get to that place where, “you’re not going to tell me I can’t do something.” 19 There is, for lack of a better word, a machismo that goes along with that regardless of your gender identity. 17 Where we grew up was pretty notoriously known for being—they call it ‘little Chicago.’ 10, 11, 12, 13, 20 MM: On Leech Lake.  It is pretty well known in certain instances for the kind of activity that goes on. 10, 11, 12, 17 There are stories of Al Capone being there and having a cabin. 8, 9 My grandfather apparently toured him around and guided him and went hunting and fishing with him. 5, 16, 20 There are a lot of different elements and people are kind of in survival mode. 9, 12 That mentality and of course being in a very, very sick relationship. 12, 15, 19 “You can’t tell me I’m not going to do it!”  Hated it with a passion.  What I appreciate about that experience is I’m not talking out of both sides of my mouth. 9, 10, 18 I haven’t done a dance or had an issue, but I’ve had the experience. 13, 18 I can honestly say I know what I’m talking about from that standpoint. 8, 10, 12, 13 A huge majority of my extended family is dealing with addiction of methamphetamine. 6, 8, 12, 14, 18 With my stepfather—that’s the father of my youngest sister—there are twelve children. 5, 7, 14, 16, 20 Out of the twelve of us two are now gone, have passed away for different reasons. 8, 11, 12, 18, 20 Two are incarcerated in federal prison and both had raving addictions prior to that. 8, 12, 14 Two others had addiction and are in various stages of recovery. 12, 14 When it came down to it out of the twelve of us there were only two that could really claim sobriety out of twelve kids. 12, 18 One of the two of us drinks and I smoke pot, so some would question whether that’s true sobriety. 5, 6, 12 My point is that over half of us have gotten to the point where it has had a true impact on life overall. 5, 10, 14 Children have been lost when elements of addiction have come into play. 5, 11, 12, 14 When I see that impacted in my nuclear family—extended or otherwise—that’s a real frustration for me. 6, 12 Fortunately my birth children are pretty good for the most part. 5, 9, 10, 14, 20 They grew up with the same thing as I did as far as their understanding of marijuana and knowing it was around and not having a push one way or another. 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 I certainly did not ever sit down and smoke with my kids until they were adults. 8, 17 Once they were adults and were making their own decisions—that was a different situation. 10, 14 My oldest daughter is going to be thirty. 20 I’m not going to dictate what she does or does not do. 14 She’s a big girl now. 7, 12 One of my children is completely sober, one hundred percent, and has no desire to ever use. 5, 6, 13, 14, 20 It is just a spectrum of things.  I go from a standpoint of transparency and honesty and I’m not going to bullshit around. 8, 13, 17, 18 I may not be willing to admit some of the things I’ve done, but I’m not going to deny them or lie about it.  I have been an only child for the first ten years of my life and I was very secluded. 10, 14 My mother would go party and do things like that so I would spend a lot of time alone. 8, 9, 10, 20 Then I got these two sisters I ended up taking care of. 11, 19, 20 Not long after that I started having my own children. 5, 14, 17, 20 My youngest is now twenty and in the last year or so I have gotten to a place for the first time in my life when I have actually been able to worry about me, outside of the normal mom and kid stuff. 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 I’m fully responsible for myself and it is incredibly liberating. 5, 14, 16, 18 Now if I could just get the rest of them to stop taking my money, time, and energy I’d be in good shape. 8, 10, 11 Overall I’ve come out relatively unscathed and have learned a hell of a lot. 10 It has been quite the experience. 18 Now I’m working with my children. 5, 14, 20 A great example was my daughter was going to go pick up my alcoholic stepdad last night from the rez and bring him down. 6, 14, 20 She looked at my Wednesday night and said, “I can’t do it. 16 I talked to him and he is buzzed up and I just can’t deal with it.”  She loves her grandfather to death. 14, 16, 18 They are very connected, but she has now been able to establish that pattern and see that she can just go with him and have fun, but she sees the consequences and understands the impact of it. 6, 12, 17, 18 We talk about it.  We have talked about it with him now because part of it is unlearning our enabling behaviors of the past. 9, 10, 12 The interesting thing for me was when I was in my second marriage and working at DIS [Department of Information Services] in the HIV field part of my responsibility was doing training around HIV systems and we incorporated methamphetamine because it was such a big deal. 9, 12, 14, 17 We had expertise from Mia Weber who was at the Methamphetamine Resource Center, and she came to do the trainings with us.  As I was dealing with all this stuff personally I was also getting education professionally, so what is interesting to me is that my two lives have taught me —my personal life and my professional life—in this role have collided unbelievably over the last ten years or so. 10, 14, 15, 17 That’s kind of a benefit when we are talking about the opioid issue because I already have experience with the other epidemic crises in my opinion and have had those conversations and dealt with personal things that you have to reconcile. 13, 15, 18 I think it takes a lot of strength to do this work. 17 If you have any of your own internal baggage it hampers that.  I’m grateful that I’ve gotten to do some of that and can be more clear headed. 14 I also understand that the Native American community is overrepresented in this issue and because of my connections and my family I have a personal interest as well and desire to help the entire community. 5, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 Not only that, but I grew up in that environment and I understand how you move forward in that community trying to assist. 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 So many people try to silence the issue, for example the opioid response. 9, 13 Everybody is talking about the opioid response. 13 To my point exactly, “Fine.  Get somebody sober.  Then what the fuck are they going to do?”  Especially if they are dealing with issues of sexual orientation or identity or any number of things. 12, 13 How do you talk to them in a way that says sobriety is the way to go? 12, 18 And these are the reasons why.  All on top of the physiological effects it has on your brain. 13 So you already feel like shit and then you want to say, “Oh there is a better life” and I am realizing that as I talk to my younger children that are millennials. 5, 10, 14, 18, 20 In addition to the whole epidemic of abuse there is also this whole thing understanding that this ‘adulting’ thing sucks and what is the benefit? 6, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Why do I have to work my ass off to pay bills and accomplish nothing?  There is a whole different ideology going on with this group of people that are younger. 9, 20 If they get hooked into that messaging about using and it makes them ‘feel better’ I believe we are going to have an even harder argument because they are already saying, “This grown-up thing is fucked up. 6, 9, 10, 12 Why am I working my ass off to not accomplish anything or not have the things I want?  You have raised me in a society where I am going to get everything I want at least information wise and all of these things are right at the tip of my fingers, but this work thing means you don’t see progress all the time.” 6, 12, 14 If I hear one more person say, “I don’t like doing that.” 9 When did we ever get to say we don’t like doing something?  Are you kidding me right now? 12 AS: You see the generational difference as contributing towards the current epidemic particularly with opioids? 6, 9, 13 MM: Absolutely.  Across the board.  I think everybody is looking for their buzz of choice. 6 Part of it is about access and part of it is about history. 9, 15 With the extended family my stepsiblings grew up with my alcoholic stepfather, who I love to death, and their mother who would take anything. 6, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 She liked to inject anything.  We found a needle in their couch fifteen years ago before this was even on the radar. 10, 13, 14 That whole community of folks—there are a lot of people who are episodic users. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 I carried that woman, not literally, but in her wheelchair, to treatment, three different programs. 12, 13 I remember specifically being at the ER at HCMC [Hennepin County Medical Center] and saying, “What is your drug of choice?” 5, 6, 14 Because I let her get shit faced before I took her in. 18 That was the only way they were going to take her. 18 She didn’t answer the question so I answered for her and said that she was an opportunistic user. 5, 6, 13 Vodka is her drug of choice, but she will take anything. 5, 6 She said, “That’s right!” 12 My point is that when you get to that level where you just need to be inebriated it’s not going to matter what it is.  She was doing pills.  One of her best buddies that was using at that point in time was a woman my age that I went to school with and she's actually a couple years older than me. 6, 7, 11, 14, 20 She was on the verge of dying.  She is on an oxygen tank and has been for years. 14 My stepsister a year ago had heart valve replacement surgery and now has a pig valve in her heart. 9, 12, 13, 14, 20 She’s forty-two years old and has no teeth. 14 No one in that part of the family has teeth. 8, 9, 12 My twenty-two year old nephew is waiting to get dentures and is so emaciated and so out of it. 14, 15 Not only that but he can’t maintain sobriety. 12 He was in a halfway house here and got caught using K2. 6, 13, 14, 18 It’s not about making good choices, it’s not about going back to that to get the buzz, it is “this is what I have access to and what is available.” 6, 9, 10, 14 AS: What did he try to do after the halfway house? 6, 13, 14, 18 Right?  MM: He tried to come to my house. 6, 13, 14 Right.  AS: Going back to what you were saying about having support systems.  MM: Right.  I had a conversation with him and I said, “Why were you successful at treatment?” 12, 13 “Because I was at Moorhead in the middle of nowhere and I didn’t know anybody and I couldn’t get anywhere. 7, 8, 12, 14 We could go to the Y [MCA].  So I’d go there and work out wherever I wanted to.” 18 That’s not a realistic idea of what life is going to be. 10 I believe that that program is setting him up for failure because they were giving him access to things that he wasn’t going to be able to touch. 9, 14 Not only that, and here is a very key piece that I have been coming to, but he’s now sitting in jail. 12, 15 He blew a court date. 13 They had a warrant and he turned himself in.  My daughter used these words exactly, “He’s just going to stay there and bounce through all of his charges because it is housing.” 6, 13, 16 I think that is a key aspect of all of this. 15 People end up seeing these things as housing. 6 There are many people I know who have HIV who have gone to treatment to attain sobriety and they get released and are homeless. 9, 12, 13 If you are going to release someone and they are homeless how do you expect them to not get triggered? 5 DHS has changed Rule 31 a few years ago to include HIV training and education. 13, 14, 15 We had a conversation with them a few years after that and I talked to Rick Moldenhauer and I said, “Do they talk about sexual health in groups or any treatment?” 12, 13, 14, 19 “The programs might or might not.”  “When you get out of treatment one of the first things you probably want to do is get laid. 12, 13, 14 If you’ve never gotten laid without being high then that is a trigger for relapse. 7, 16 A light bulb went off in his head and he went, “Oh my God.” 14 We started doing HIV and chemical health systems trainings based on that. 13, 19 The training that was developed went along with the matrix model that the state uses in doing assessments and things like that so that people could understand the correlations between different levels of use and their sexual risk. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 That has not necessarily been successful in the long run because it is a whole other area of expertise that the counselors need to have around HIV and sexual health. 8, 12, 17, 19 And there is the reluctance to have those conversations, yet it has been identified.  All of those corollaries and those triggering factors relate back to it which is why I think there is such a deep connection in those two fields of work that go very hand in hand. 17 My background, interestingly enough years ago, was in the legal field. 13, 14, 17 I worked for a trial-consulting firm.  Prior to that it was with a computer consulting firm.  I have had a variety of administrative jobs more in business management. 11, 12 AS: Did you go to college? 7 MM: I did go to college. 7 I crashed and burned my first year, so then I supplemented and took classes here and there. 7, 12, 14 I was lucky because when I turned nineteen that was the legal drinking age, so after my first year of college—it had been recommended that I take a break after my first year to go and find myself because BSU [Bemidji State University] wasn’t letting me come back for a year. 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14 I was working full-time and going to be the next rock star at Pizza Hut and loving life. 10, 14 I was legal at the same time so I was partying like a rock star and it was fun. 9, 14, 20 It was a blast.  Then I transferred to Brainerd and hated it. 5, 17 I spent as much time as I could going back to Bemidji, and ultimately got frustrated and went back to Maryland to visit a friend. 20 She said, “You should move back here!” 15 So six months later I did. 11, 16 I went back to Maryland and we engaged with all of my friends that I had lived with there before and connected with my first husband and started having kids. 7, 14, 16, 20 That little, brief period of time. 18, 19, 20 AS: That was where you met your husband? 14 MM: I met my husband when I was thirteen and then we reconnected when I was twenty. 14 Then we started having kids.  I stayed there for about four or five years. 14 By that time we had gotten married and we had two children. 5, 7, 14, 20 The relationship completely fell apart. 9, 11, 19 It was the end of the eighties and the early nineties, so being out East when the job market collapsed. 5, 11, 12 I don’t know if you remember Reaganomics—it pales in comparison to the nightmare we are living in now—but at that time we thought that was the worst thing. 12, 17, 18 When George W. Bush starts looking good and even he’s saying it—fuck my life. 10 Anyways, I made a decision at that point that I knew I could come back to Minnesota and raise my two children, I was by myself, and I had family support and friends and other things. 5, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 We moved back here and moved to the cities because I knew it was going to be more marketable for me to get a job. 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16 From there we just rebuilt our lives.  My first husband subsequently followed us here and we ended up having our third child together, and then finally called it quits. 8, 10, 14 After that we tried and tried, but he had a hard time not having more than one relationship at a time. 9, 19 It doesn’t work when you have three kids.  Ironically, I had planned to be a stay at home mom, and when I found out about his shenanigans—I actually had been offered a position and I called them back and thankfully it was still open. 5, 7, 11, 14, 20 I had this amazing experience of working with a child-consulting firm that was very socially progressive. 9, 14, 18, 19 They only worked with personal injury plaintiffs and criminal defendants. 8 Basically whomever the underdog or one that was least advantaged in the situation was—doing things like jury selection, helping attorney’s prepare for trial, mock juries and things like that. 10 I learned a ton of information and made a lot of connections. 10 I also worked in a small non-profit in the same organization. 15 In small organizations people tend to go a little batshit crazy. 9, 18, 20 When you’ve been doing the same thing—they were stuck in founder mode.  They didn’t know how they were going to move forward. 12, 15 After a period of eight years I got totally frustrated and had to leave. 14, 18 It was really fun, but then these crazy women that I was working with that don’t think about five years from now—there was no business planning or anything like that. 12, 14, 18, 20 I finally got frustrated and interesting enough heard about a position in Hennepin County and HIV from two different people that I had a lot of respect for and both recommended me for the position. 9, 12, 17 I applied for it and ended up getting it, which is what got me into HIV.  This will be my sixteenth year working in HIV. 14 I started in 2001.  I have been here for sixteen years. 14 I spent my first four or five years working for the planning body, so I learned all about the federal funding and evaluations and things like that. 8, 10, 14 Then I moved to DHS where I was a training coordinator and a contract manager. 7, 15, 19 I started to see the program side of it and the government administration side and then was more familiar with that. 6, 8, 9, 12 Three years ago I think it will be now my mom passed away. 12, 13, 14, 18, 20 Some things happened over the course of that period of time that was just like the straw that broke the camel’s back. 8, 14, 15, 18 Interestingly enough this position I’m in right now had previously been posted, but they hadn’t found someone, so they reopened it and 10, 12 I was at that place where I knew I needed to start applying even though I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. 16 I have to start applying.  Completely impetuous.  It was week one of grieving after my mom died. 14, 15 Complete bullshit wrong timing, but it was the motivation I needed. 11, 18 I submitted my application.  AS: It is still called RAAN, right? 12 Rural AIDS Action Network?  MM: Right.  I submitted my application and ended up getting a phone interview and one thing led to another and the next thing I knew they were offering me the position. 8, 16 It was just one of those wow kind of things. 17 I was so desperate for change that I just jumped on it, not fully thinking through it. 14 It’s a really different thing because you have the livelihoods of eighteen people in your hands. 9, 17, 18 AS: Like their salaries and careers? 15, 19 The biggest stressor I have is ensuring that these folks get to continue to keep working. 7, 12 The good thing is they are an amazing team of people and if something ever happened I know they would be fine and continue on. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 AS: Could you describe the network?  MM: We are actually celebrating our twenty-fifth anniversary this year. 7, 14 I am super excited. 16 The organization was started by a woman named Linda Brandt who saw a need for services for people living with HIV in greater Minnesota. 9, 19, 20 She actively worked to start building these networks. 9, 19 The network model, while it may still not be exactly as she envisioned, I think we have retained it in spirit. 8 What I love about it is we are regional. 14 All of our staff with few exceptions live in the communities they work in. 19 They understand what is available and how to access programs there. 9, 17, 18 They also, for the most part case managers in particular, already know resources and services available. 9, 12, 17, 19 They have a broad array of experience that they brought with them. 18 Some of them were working in mental health in the past doing case management, some are experienced in the [Wyvern] system. 12, 17, 18, 19 They all have this different breadth and experience that they bring with them. 18 I just recently wrote a proposal where I figured out that even though we have some fairly new staff to the agency collectively we have over seventy years of experience working in HIV and providing services. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16, 18, 19 I probably am a little bit off in that estimate, but that’s what I can safely say and that makes me really proud to understand that we have the breadth of experience that spans twice what the epidemic has been around for, which I think adds value. 13, 17, 18, 20 It makes us able to be scalable in our responses that are related to the same group of people. 9, 13 I challenge that a lot of the clients that we work with are folks that other systems are connecting with on a regular basis; people that are dealing with substance use, people that are dealing with mental health issues, people that are homeless and experiencing a whole lot of other health related disparities. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 Part of our HIV work has included Hepatitis C, primarily testings, but we took it to another level because that was highly unsatisfying for staff. 7 We are really more actively working to connect people who test positive to care and follow them for a little longer, even though that falls outside of our grant parameters, because that is how we do business. 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20 We are about relationship building and meeting the needs of the individual. 18, 19 There’s nothing worse than giving someone a diagnosis that they are unfamiliar with and then just walking away. 6, 8, 16, 18, 20 I don’t know if it is statewide, but I believe it is, our positivity rate for Hepatitis C is thirty-nine percent, which is kind of off the charts. 12, 14 We are one of the highest in a community based setting that there can be. 7, 13, 19 We are getting results. 6 We know we are working with the folks that are impacted. 12 The wonderful thing is we are not testing people positive for HIV at that same rate. 9, 18 In fact our HIV rate is incredibly low, including the population of people that chooses to inject. 5, 9, 10, 18 Our syringe program we are not identifying people that are HIV positive, but we are identifying Hepatitis C. 9 We know that our HIV prevention efforts are being successful. 10, 12, 19 I don’t know if you are aware of this, and Maggie can confirm my statistics, but approximately fifty percent of people who inject acquire 9, 12 Hep C within six months of beginning to inject. 11, 16 My mother in law, or stepmother that I mentioned earlier that I took to treatment was Hep C positive. 8, 12, 13, 15 Not a big surprise.  She got tested in a methadone clinic, so it wasn’t great, but it was just another little extra-added layer because she chose to keep using, so of course her health wasn’t what it could have been. 6, 14, 19, 20 I’m pretty sure she never got treatment for it. 10, 12, 13, 16 I am digressing and going back.  AS: Where are the communities that you have offices? 19 MM: Right now we have offices in Mankato, St. Cloud, which is our central office and main location, Moorhead, Grand Rapids, and Duluth. 12, 14 All of those locations for the most part we offer prevention and care services. 9, 10, 19 They usually have a prevention worker and a case manager so we can represent both sides of the HIV spectrum. 5, 9, 10, 17, 19 Duluth and Grand Rapids are split where care is in Grand Rapids and Duluth is prevention. 10, 19 We are probably going to be adding some more here and there.  AS: How are you funded? 8 MM: We are funded primarily through federal and state grants. 8 A lot of it is federal pass-through money. 8, 10 All of our case management programs are funded in white funds. 8, 12, 17, 19 We get state money from MDH for prevention related work, which includes a small carve out for some syringe supplies. 8, 10, 19 That is the one contract where our syringe program is specifically listed under. 19 As long as we are using state funds they can pay for the supplies. 6, 17 As you know there is a ban on federal money being used for syringe supplies. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16 It is ludicrous. 14 They loosened it up a year ago where we can actually buy staff time with federal money for the syringe program, but we can’t buy supplies. 7, 8, 10, 13, 14 It is just goofy.  This DHS proposal that is out right now and due for submission next week is a grant that is based on the Cures Act [21st Century Cures Act, 2015] money that was released last fall. 8, 10, 12, 13, 15 It is an attempt to really respond to the opioid crisis. 13, 14, 18 The interesting thing, like I was saying before, was that group that we work with that is pretty much reflective of a bunch of different areas, and because of that a couple of years ago we were asked to start distributing Narcan, some people call it Naloxone, for opioid reversal. 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20 When we got that grand we started diving into that area a little bit more. 8, 20 They already have that exchange so it made sense and was a great fit for there. 10, 15, 20 The next year we added on statewide distribution, so now we have Narcan in all of our offices and all of our staff have been trained to distribute it and train others in its administration. 12, 14 Now we have been able to take that statewide and because of that DHS has recognized us as an entity to work with moving forward with the Cures grant money. 8, 10, 17 They have applied for over five million dollars a year and we have been targeted to receive a big chunk of that. 14 The intent of that would be to expand our intent services because my goal since I walked in the door has been to have services all over the state. 16, 19 Basically replicating the program we have in Duluth, which I think I am going to say publically is the gold standard. 19 I believe it is.  We have more hours than any other program that I am aware of. 15 We are open thirty hours a week on average. 15 We create an environment where people can come in. 9, 12 I provide socks, mittens, gloves, and blankets for everyone because staff will meet these clients where their needs are. 10, 14, 18 Some of them don’t have access to water because they are homeless, so when that happens we get them water. 9, 15, 16 AS: It is responsive to the particular needs of the clients in those areas of the state. 8, 9, 10, 20 MM: Yes.  And Maggie and James are really great. 18, 20 They just started it as an after school program, and it really does make sense. 7, 18 In the middle of winter there is a pot of water going for people to have hot tea. 6, 7, 9, 16 Sometimes folks have been roaming around all night, or whatever the case it. 12, 17 It is one place in their lives they can interact and not have any judgment passed on them. 12, 18 They can come in and have their needs met, sit down for a minute if they need to, get a cup of coffee, sometimes there are other treats. 15 The staff have collected and they have boxes of all the little shampoos and personal care items. 19, 20 We collect those from hotels when we stay and donate them back to the program because sometimes—you wouldn’t believe what a little bottle of shampoo or conditioner can do to somebody. 8, 20 We go to the dollar store and pick up little bottles of nail polish and stuff like that because sometimes that’s the most interaction where somebody has had where they are treated like they are any normal person. 12, 16, 18, 20 It is amazing. 9 What I love about it is when I go up there and work, whether I am covering or just hanging around, I am almost invisible. 14 They don’t recognize me as somebody that’s not there everyday because they get the same level of treatment and that is what they have been acculturated to. 12, 13, 16, 17 They are just as open and offer sharing with me than they are with any of the other staff. 18 It’s really interesting to see that dynamic at play because it proves to me that we have garnered a lot of trust. 5, 6, 17, 18 AS: Do you know how many people you serve? 9, 12 MM: Not deliberately—I walk around with this because I was so impressed. 10, 16 This is a survey that I just completed a few months ago. 7, 11, 13, 16 Apparently it is done pretty regularly, but they had missed it in ‘14. 10, 20 This page is talking about syringe distribution specifically in ‘14, but it was very limited questions.  That was page one.  It was just our basic detail and information.  This is just some demographics.  There is a specific page I am—right here it starts into distribution. 12 AS: 254,610 syringes out— MM: In one location in one year. 14 That’s Duluth.  AS: 1,584 participants. 9 That’s just Duluth?  AS: Twenty syringes per person average.  MM: That is a total estimate based on nothing other than a rough estimate. 13 AS: 204,000 [syringes] were returned.  MM: I’m really impressed with our numbers. 10, 18 We average three thousand dollars a month just in syringe supplies alone at that location. 8, 16 We know we are being affective. 12 AS: Of the people that come in, do you know how many go into treatment? 9, 12, 13 We track it anecdotally, and Maggie and James track it in their heads, but we don’t track it deliberately because it is not a principle of harm reduction. 5, 14, 16 It is understood, and this is where Maggie may be contrary to me, and I would go with what she says, it is understood that treatment for harm reduction participants is generally more effective and more successful with them because they’ve already gone through all the precontemplation and when they get to that stage of going into treatment they generally are more ready for that stage. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Part of it is that prep work that goes into that. 10 Tracking it can’t tell you one hundred percent.  What I can tell you is that I have a picture on my phone that I can’t share of a mom and her baby. 8, 14, 16 The mom was driven to treatment by Maggie, when she found out she was pregnant, the baby and her are both fine. 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 They are together. 8 The baby is thriving.  They came in on her first birthday to play with Steph. 14, 16 I am getting goose bumps.  Maggie didn’t know who it was until she heard her voice. 9, 12, 17 When she heard her voice and when she recognized her and knew who it was because she had changed so much and mom and baby were doing amazing. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17 We know of two moms and babies that have successfully been dropped off at treatment and are still together. 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 We hear outcomes here and there. 9 Steph stopped tracking the number of reversals that they were getting from Narcan because it was so depressing. 10, 16 In the first roughly three months that we were doing Narcan distribution there were seventy-five reversals. 11, 14, 16 That means that seventy-five people that might have died that we had a hand in reversing—those numbers were too staggering to keep track of. 9, 16 I think they had program fatigue.  Understand these folks—Maggie’s background is an artist. 12 AS: What do you think for the future?  Is there a point where you would consider tracking those numbers? 9, 16 MM: We absolutely need to.  It is not acceptable. 12 AS: Right.  It’s not that you don’t want to, it’s that you have limited staff.  MM: Absolutely not.  Part of it is that and part of it is as a staff we can’t physically track anymore of these. 6, 9, 16 It is too painful. 6 We hear these stories all the time. 9 AS: You need another person or two.  MM: You may have heard this before, but there are some fabulous program staff that are not necessarily the strongest people on the admin side, and that’s kind of how you want them. 9 In fact that was part of my conversation with Maggie this morning, “You guys need to shore up your admin stuff because you’re not reflecting what you’re doing.” 9 They had just found a stack of papers that had never gotten entered. 5, 16 I had said, “Your numbers are not accurate because we have been on an upward trajectory the whole program and we are down.  Your numbers are wrong.” 11 It’s that mom with the eyes in the back of your head thing. 14 I tell them all the time, “You guys!  I know, see, and hear everything. 6, 9, 12 If you think you are getting away with something I find out about it!” 18, 20 So the same with the numbers and then poof, two months later guess what? 11, 16 “Oh, we found the papers!”  AS: Can you talk about the current political situation and tell us what you are going to focus on?  MM: In light of the current political situation, particularly with so many people in power that do not necessarily believe in sexual health education and the importance of that, I have started thinking strategically that because the opioid response was one of those things that is so neutral and truly bipartisan because so many aspects of society have been impacted that we might have to step back our really visible HIV and Hep C work approach and really focus more on our opioid work from a political stand point moving forward. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 So far what I have realized is our composition did not change a lot with respect to the actual state of Minnesota. 14 We did not get much shift in the folks that were elected, so we have been in these environments for a long time. 8, 12, 17 Federally, I think we are going to have a much different impact because we don’t know what is going to happen and it’s just a crapshoot. 12, 15 AS: What about the Cures money? 8, 10 MM: The Cures money is going to explode and really help up approach the whole opioid epidemic. 8, 10, 13, 18 With that we will bring our HIV and Hep C work along with us because in my estimation they go hand in hand.  If I am trying to encourage people to keep medication on hand so they don’t overdose or someone they love doesn’t overdose then why don’t you get tested at the same time so we can see what other stuff is going on. 6, 9, 14 Part of that is being actively a part of a community and engaged in the response. 9, 13, 19 Again, that’s where the benefit of my staff being in these communities brings their own passion into their work in that community. 15, 19 To be honest some of them are reluctant with the Narcan stuff. 8 I think they feel uncertain about it and we have that same dynamic. 17 Our staff is very reflective.  I have people that are very progressive and really have a good handle on things in a larger sense and how those things interact with each other. 9, 10, 18 I have some folks that are from a small community and have the intent to keep doing that work in that community and don’t always have a broad view of the world for lack of a better way to put it. 12, 18, 19 That’s a very small portion; my point is we are very reflective and represent that breadth as well. 5, 10 I think that is important because it is a challenge if you have someone that is not capable of doing the work at a certain level, but there is also a time when those individuals are appropriate for a different aspect. 9, 13, 17 You know what I mean? 12 It is that give and take.  AS: Also for example if you know don’t someone who has been saved by Narcan you don’t understand. 10, 12, 17, 18 You almost have to be in direct contact with it to understand why that would be important to keep that person alive. 9, 17, 18 MM: Yes.  I think a lot of the people I am referring to who have that resistance are because they haven’t had that experience. 9, 18 AS: Exactly.  It’s not because of a lack of desire or of humanity or care for other people, it is just not understanding. 9, 14, 17, 18, 19 Like many people don’t understand harm reduction and needle exchanges as a link to health. 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 19 MM: I also think that you can’t challenge everyone’s personal biases and I do believe that some of it is “I don’t know if I want to work with those people.” 9, 12 Not understanding that we work with everybody. 14, 17, 18 I think there is a fear. 10 I don’t know what it is about folks who chose to inject, I really don’t know. 12, 18 I am confused as to why that is a different dynamic of use than other substances. 6, 13, 16 Some of these same people with consume shit tons of alcohol, and in my estimation that is just as bad if not worse because alcohol has killed billions of people in a variety of ways. 6, 9, 14, 18 AS: I see it as a hierarchy of stigma. 6, 9 I’ve been thinking about how there is a hierarchy of stigmatizing because even addicts stigmatize others. 9, 14 Alcoholics stigmatize addicts. 9, 14 MM: In sexual health the gay community totally stigmatizes the bi community. 9, 12, 19 From gender and orientation.  If you think about it, you’ve learned this since grade school, you always want to pick on somebody that’s lesser perceived than you. 5, 7, 10, 18 It’s a pecking order that we have learned very early on. 10 I was guilty of it myself.  I was always the fat girl. 7, 18 I remember in high school there was one girl that was fatter than me and I was fucking grateful. 7 I was like, “Thank God for this chick because otherwise I would be the biggest one.” 14 You know what I mean? 12 I was guilty of it myself.  I’m just saying.  I think being fat is still one of the most stigmatized things period, across the board. 9, 18 AS: One more thing.  Would you describe your typical day as the director of Rural Aids Action Network? 16, 18, 19 MM: Holy buckets.  Well here is the interesting thing. 17 We were on lean.  We run really lean and that is because I am all about not doing anything that we can’t sustain, whether it be for staff or client. 8, 10, 18 Even though I’m willing to take risks  I’m very practical when it comes to making decisions. 10, 14 We clearly could use a whole other level, like a middle management type of person. 6, 7, 12, 13 There are just a lot of things we don’t get done.  I’ve used this analogy before with one of the counterparts of this HIV agency. 6, 9, 13, 16 I was talking to a program manager and I said, “It’s an imbalanced conversation because generally it would be ED to program director talking but I don’t have a ‘you’ so you get me.” 14, 18, 19 My week or time frame could consist of anything. 15 I spend a lot of time in meetings, whether it be about HIV planning or other aspects of the HIV world—grant management, things like that. 10, 12, 18 I’m involved in a lot of meetings and committees about that. 18 The opioid response—I participate in a couple of harm reduction groups with chemical health professionals about our response. 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19 I spend a lot of time doing overall administrative functions, dealing with HR things. 9, 10 I have a leadership team that involves three other people. 9 We just had a retreat this week and went to the financial sustainability conference yesterday. 15, 16 Part of it is developing a team at the same time who are all coming along together because we are also de facto doing a succession plan. 8, 17 Who is going to be the next person to take over, and I have already identified that person.  I am doing development because I value development across the board and the staff. 12 We are always looking for opportunities that people can get involved in. 9, 18, 19 I am very much into relationship building so a lot of times it is projects like yours where we can be of some kind of assistance. 5, 19 Part of our mission is to educate and advocate for people living with HIV and I don’t feel like I can do that unless I am talking about that very actively with everybody. 9, 14 It relates to all aspects of life. 10 I just participated in an AIDS Action Day. 9 Some of it is reconnecting with other people in the community. 9, 19 It is interesting because I am very connected to the Metro community of providers and other folks, so I have the benefit of getting to work with them. 12, 15, 17, 19 I get to work with clients because of other work I have done in the past. 10 I don’t get the benefit of being able to be in one of those communities all the time, so I’m not super visible to everyone we are working with, but I hope to be approachable. 9, 15, 16, 19 It’s kind of like the best of both worlds.  I can literally be running from one end of the state to the other and meeting with people about various things and program stuff, or covering for them even sometimes. 8, 9, 18 Then at home a good chunk of the day can be spent on the phone. 8, 10, 14, 16 I don’t talk to family on the phone anymore. 8, 12, 16 The last thing I want to do is make a phone call. 8, 16 AS: Because you are checking in with six different offices.  MM: Right, or we are strategizing issues that are client related issues that come up. 10, 12, 13 There are programmatic related issues. 12, 13 We have reporting, so I oversee and am responsible for all the staff too. 6, 13, 16 I’m not responsible for all of them directly, but I supervise all the program folks and the Narcan stuff because so much of that is legislation related right now and it’s beneficial that I’m in the Cities because then I can just go to the meetings and do what I need to do. 12, 16, 18 I have my previous connections to other aspects of the world. 10 DHS was a phone call to me saying, “Do you want to distribute Narcan?” 8, 16 because I have this longstanding relationship with chemical health area. 8, 13, 14, 17, 19 Part of it is who I have been and what I can bring to it and I have this amazing team of people. 9 The case management coordinator for example has been with us for ten years. 12, 14, 17 We have two case managers that have been with the organization for ten years. 14, 17 They can give me the perspective and historical standpoint. 13 Then the leadership team helps guide my decision making on some of the bigger, problematic stuff. 10, 12, 14 This expansion of the opioid project was my dream child when I started working for the organization. 5, 13, 14 I said I wanted to be able to expand the work that we were doing and put some syringe exchanges in all of the offices. 6, 10, 18 We methodically started doing that. 6, 14 Our Mankato location is primed and ready to go and all we need are the funds.  We have the physical space; we have the go ahead from our landlord. 6, 14 That is the other thing— AS: The newest one is in Mankato? 8, 16 MM: It will be once we get everything going and get some funding that is tagged to be the next one.  We learned that diabetics are selling their syringes to folks that are using. 6, 10, 12 When you talk about the public health implication of it, it is staggering. 19 When you have nurses coming to you and saying, “Will you please open a syringe exchange?” 10 it illustrates the need.  That is one of the places I have had staff for ten years, so she’s got a long-standing history and is very approachable and that is one of the things that is beneficial about our regional model. 14, 15, 17 We connect with folks. 12 It is really popular because people like to do the work in other areas and they want to partner with us all the time and one of the things I am very clear with is I can do a one-time event or something, but I don’t want you tip-toeing in our areas and then leaving because you don’t come back. 8, 9, 18, 20 AS: What do you mean a one-time event?  MM: Well, like Minnesota AIDS Project will say things like, “Let’s do this, let’s do that.”  A great example is there’s a syphilis outbreak right now in Mille Lacs, I think I told you about that, and so we have been doing these weekly events on each of the districts on the reservation. 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 Minnesota  AIDS Project was involved as well and one of the proposals someone had was they do two events and we do two events to mitigate staff time and I said, “Absolutely not.  We are going to be at every one of those events because they are never going to come back out here and interact with this community whereas we are. 16, 18, 19 We will be at every one of them because that is an investment that we will make.” 12 That is about relationship building. 19 I went and did Narcan distribution at two of the events and I’m going to the fourth one next week. 5, 15 At the two events I gave out seventy kits.  One of them was to a person that took twenty kits.  The interesting thing was I was connecting with the actual people who are using and are connected to the using community. 6, 9, 17, 19 The Health Department has been talking to tribal folks and so the Health Department is a little removed and the tribal folks are very much removed, so they are having all these conversations that are going to result in nothing. 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20 What we are doing is building the relationships at the ground level and getting our name out there so that people know. 9, 12, 19 It is preemptive for the Cures money, so it is a colossal tax on my schedule right now, but I think it is a good investment in that relationship building and continuing to do that work, because we are going to continue giving out Narcan no matter what. 8, 10, 12, 19 We are also working with the drug courts on the SAMHSA [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] grant where they are doing care fares and testing with drug court participants, so that’s going to be super exciting to see how that comes out too. 5, 6, 9, 13, 16, 19 AS: You will have entry with all those people who have been— MM: For testing. 9 It is kind of a backwards way of doing it with the response. 13, 18 With the drug court they are supposed to be on contract. 5, 6, 14, 19 We are supposed to distribute Narcan, so I was on a call with the administrator of the program on Tuesday. 16 I was like, “Okay, so this whole Narcan thing—we are kind of confused.” 6, 13, 14, 16 AS: They don’t want needles? 10 MM: No, they don’t want needles, but the fact that they were even willing to give it out to the participants—that program is running more on a harm reduction model. 5, 8, 9, 10, 14 They aren’t automatically kicking people out. 9 It is a different approach.  AS: What did you do when they started doing that?  MM: This is very recent.  Our contract isn’t even signed yet and there have been three fares already. 11, 19 AS: So it is recent that they are changing their tune. 17 MM: I’m not sure they are changing their tune, but it’s what their tune is now. 12, 17 I thought it was interesting. 17, 18 I hope this has been helpful. 9 AS: It has been great. 20 Thank you.

"17","Gardner_Carson","Richard Moldenhauer Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer March 30, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Richard Moldenhauer-RM 9 Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan and I am with Rick Moldenhauer at the Department for Human Services in St. Paul at 540 Cedar Avenue. 9, 12 Can you state your name and give me permission to record this interview?  RM: Hi, my name is Richard Moldenhauer and I give permission to record this interview. 9 AS: Could you start by talking about where you grew up and what your childhood was like, your schooling, and how you got into your career? 7, 14, 15, 19, 20 RM: I grew up in a little town called River Falls, Wisconsin. 20 I was born and raised there. 14 I had a public education kindergarted through twelfth grade. 5, 14, 15, 19 I also attended college—both graduate and undergraduate—at River Falls. 7, 14 I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from River Falls and then a Master’s in Science and Education again from River Falls. 14 I spent a large portion of my life there. 10 I currently still reside in Wisconsin. 9 I’ve worked in substance abuse treatment in both Wisconsin and Minnesota. 6, 12, 13 I’ve worked at pretty much all levels there are for substance abuse treatment. 6, 10, 12, 13 I’ve done everything from [unclear] psych dual diagnosis to outpatient to halfway homes, adolescents, adults, pretty much a wide variety of everything like that. 6, 10, 11, 14, 18 I did well in junior high and high school. 7, 14 I’m an only child. 14 I’m married and have children. 5, 7, 14, 20 Kind of the American story I guess. 15 AS: Do you still live in River Falls?  RM: I live outside of River Falls now out in the country. 12, 19 AS: Can you talk about your first jobs and how you got into addiction treatment? 11, 12, 13, 14 RM: When I first started out in college I wanted to be a physician—an osteopath. 7, 14, 18 I was originally pre-med. 10 The way that River Falls at that time orchestrated college courses you could be pre-med but you still had to declare a major and minor and things like that. 7, 10, 14, 18 I chose psychology and my interest was really to be a doctor of osteopathic medicine and then focus on psychiatry. 12, 14, 18 Psychology was the logical fit. 15 I took all the biology and chemistry and stuff and gravitated more and more towards psychology. 15 I finished undergraduate, but when I wasn’t all the way through undergraduate I started to lose a lot of the the biochemistry and doctor part of it and was more interested in the softer science or the behavioral aspects of it. 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 As I maticulated and graduated I turned around and went to graduate school in River Falls with an MSC—Master’s in Science and Education with a focus on Community Counseling. 7, 14, 19 My first job in human services started in the fall of ‘83 at a residential group foster home outside of River Falls that was all male, court ordered and almost all of them had substance use disorder problems and behavioral conduct problems. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 They were in court for stuff like that.  RM: Yes, all juvenile.  In that piece of employment I had contact with in today’s world we call comorbid disorders—dual diagnosis or COD even though we had different terms for it then. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 AS: What did they call it then?  RM: It would depend on who you talked to.  Dual diagnosis. 6 At that time there was still a lot of what is primary? 19 What is secondary?  What is the initial etiology versus symptomatic outcropping?  AS: There was a ranking.  RM: Yes, much more than there is today. 16 Depending on who you would talk to a lot of the mental health folks would tell you that the substance use was a symptom of underlying mental health etiology. 6, 12, 13, 19 If you talked to the traditional substance abuse people they would tell you what appears to be mental health symptoms are just a roller coaster on the Jellinek Chart of Intoxication Withdrawal and things like that. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19 I did that and at the same time I was going to school. 7 When I graduated at that time I then went and enrolled in graduate school. 7 I enrolled in a locked dual diagnosis program that was in Prescott, Wisconsin, which is closed now. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 That was locked adolescent and adult.  It was technically a psychiatric facility all for dual disorder people. 9, 13 You had an increased level of acuity and impairment. 12 This would have been in the mid and late eighties now. 12 The primary substance you would see floating around this area was alcohol—always has been and always will be. 6, 8, 18, 19 A lot of marijuana.  Then you saw a more increased smattering of some of the other substances that have now really proliferated. 6, 10, 12, 18 We saw some heroin, some pharmaceutical stuff, but not much. 16 This was on the tail end of the powder cocaine and crack days. 16 AS: Who were the heroin users at that point? 6, 13, 16 RM: Most of the folks that were coming into that facility at that time and the demographics of the time were older people. 9, 12, 20 If you look at today’s numbers the primary demographic are in their early twenties. 16, 19 At that time the primary demographic were much older—in their forties or early fifties. 19, 20 AS: So these were long-time users. 6, 13, 17 More long-term users. 6, 13, 17 Heroin at that time was not an initial drug or a gateway drug. 5, 6, 18 Heroin was like the last rung on the ladder. 8 People that were using heroin back in those days in the mid to late eighties were folks who had already gone through alcohol and cannabis and had done crack and everything else. 6, 12, 16 Heroin was the last thing there was for them to move into. 15 In today’s world you see heroin and other pharmaceutical opiates used maybe not as the original substance of introduction, but certainly much earlier in age with a faster onset and more pervasiveness and greater acuity. 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 The heroin that is floating around today—the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension lab, when they do the heroin analysis, they’ll tell you that the purity of heroin today is vastly increased from what it was in the eighties and that timeframe. 10, 15, 16 Heroin purity samples were twenty odd percent pure.  Today the BCA does spectral analysis and finds stuff up from eighty percent purity. 16 Today it is cut with things like fentanyl and carfentanil, which makes it multiple times stronger. 16, 17 AS: I do want to talk about that later when we get to it.  Can you talk for a minute about the kids that you first worked with? 14, 15 As a freshman in college you weren’t that far from their age. 7 What was it like to work with them?  What do you remember of those young men and their stories? 9, 12 RM: It was a little different because I was so much more closer to age in them. 9, 10, 20 I was only three, four, five years older versus some of the other staff at the facility who could have easily been our collective parents’ age. 14, 20 I had advantages and disadvantages to that.  You know when you were sitting around listening to the top forty stations? 12 I knew the same music they knew versus some of the other staff who were still from the Buddy Holly to the Beatles timeframes. 9, 15, 16 I was familiar with the terms, the lingo, the music, the culture of that early eighties timeframe versus some of the other staff who weren’t. 8, 9, 15, 17 There were some difficulties with it too in being seen as a staff person or as someone who had a degree of authority in decision making or trying to be involved in the therapeutic process with them because I was so close to their age at the time that the lines had the opportunity to blur. 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19 There was a lot of work and effort to delineate the line between Rick as a staff person and Rick that they might see walking down Main Street. 6, 9, 16 AS: Where you could have been their friend. 20 RM: I was of the age where that certainly could have been a possibility. 8, 17 I was someone they could have ran with.  AS: After the lockdown Prescott dual diagnosis where did you go from there? 6 RM: I had a number of jobs that overlapped with each other so there’s not a really clean A, B, C. 11, 18 I worked at Metropolitan Clinic of Counseling for a number of years and did EAP [Employee Assistance Program] work for them for GE [General Electric] a number of years out of Eden Prairie. 14 Most of it was telephonic.  GE is a huge multi-national, international organization, so a lot of the stuff I did was assessment referral, telephone types of things. 8, 12, 13, 16 I worked on Prairie Island on the reservation for a while doing adolescent youth substance abuse counseling. 6, 13, 19 I worked at Hudson Memorial Hospital doing the same type of thing.  I worked at Dakota County Detox.  I would have to go back and look at my resume.  There are so many to try and remember.  I worked at the Veteran’s Home in Hastings for three years before I came here and I’ve been here since 2001. 14 AS: Let’s start with the nineties and your familiarity with what was happening with opiates and heroin. 8, 12, 15, 16 RM: I’ve got a chart going back to about 1995 right now, so I can give you the whole thing from ‘95 to 2016. 12 In Minnesota the number one substance that people come to treatment for has been and forever will be alcohol. 6, 9, 12, 13 It’s a little over fifty percent. 20 When we are talking about what the client themselves identifies as their primary substance as time of admission into the treatment center. 6, 10, 12, 13, 19 The data collection methodology we use is called EAAENS. 6, 13 So, slightly over fifty percent identify their primary substance as alcohol. 6, 19 Over the span of time the second most common type of substance abuse was marijuana up until just a couple of years ago. 6, 11, 13, 14 That was overtaken by pharmaceutical opioids and now has been taken over by heroin and methamphetamine. 6, 8, 12, 13, 16 Cannabis as a primary substance has actually become kind of a B-squad. 6, 7, 19 It is not as prevalent as defined by primary substance at time of admission. 6, 10, 11, 19 Alcohol use is still king of the hill, if you would, but then you have heroin and methamphetamine. 6, 8, 13, 16 A couple of general trends, if you would, were people that were coming to treatment back in the early mid-nineties still were what were thought of as single substance or primary single substance: they would just drink. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 Or their primary thing was cannabis, or their primary thing was cocaine. 16, 19 Today, that mono-drug user just doesn’t seem to exist anymore. 5, 6, 13, 16 Today there will be a stated preference for something, but it’s not a drug of choice. 5, 6, 10, 16 It’s more of a preference on a continuum. 10 They prefer 10 A but they use B and or C and or D. 6, 13 It’s more of a question of what is available and what they can get.  Speedballing is really popular in the mid to late eighties and then it kind of went away now, but it has come back again. 12, 18, 20 Speedballing was heroin and cocaine back then but today speedballing is heroin and methamphetamine. 16 One of the things you notice over time are trends and patterns that ebb and flow, come and go. 10 Alcohol still wears the crown, but then underneath that you see a lot of changes. 6 Where we see a lot of notable changes in particular is in age range. 6, 7, 9 Each substance and each combination has a different demographic. 6 With pharmaceuticals or with heroin what used to be a forty or fifty year old age range back in the eighties now is twenty to twenty-four years old. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16 The age of first treatment episode where the individual identifies heroin or a pharmaceutical opioid is about half what it was twenty, twenty-five years ago. 12, 13, 14 The primary presenting client is much younger. 5, 10, 19, 20 Depending on what part of the state you look at there are specific concentrations for heroin in particular. 9, 16 In and around reservations in particular. 9, 19 The disproportionality of American Indians as compared to prevalence by population is vastly greater than it is for the general population. 5, 10, 20 AS: So even as usage by young, white people has increased it still hasn’t proportionally reached the Native American population? 9, 19 If you look at pure, raw treatment numbers caucasian is the highest for just about everything because eighty-odd percent of Minnesotans identify as white. 7, 12, 13, 19 In the state demographer’s statistics you will see that people that self-identify as American Indian are 1.1 percent of the population in Minnesota, yet when you break it down by drug of choice pharmaceutical drugs versus heroin versus methamphetamine or even general treatment numbers generally speaking when you control for incidents by thousand—in research epidemiology one of the ways we try to demonstrate the prevalence of something in a given population is we make a level playing field. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 Incidents by hundred or incidents by thousand are just a general way of doing that. 18 So for treatment admissions for all substance abuse American Indians are about eight per thousand versus all other races combined which is a little bit about one per thousand. 6, 12, 13, 20 As you go into heroin or methamphetamine or opiates that goes anywhere from eight to about fifteen per thousand versus other races combined. 6, 8, 16 There is a hugely disproportionate overrepresentation for opiates and methamphetamine for people who self identify as American Indian versus other races in Minnesota. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 I can send you those slides.  You see that played out both as population demographics self identified as American Indian and the geography of Minnesota. 6 Some of those maps you see the darker areas are almost exlusively around reservations. 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 20 The one exception being Hennepin County, which is not immediately contiguous to the reservation, however there is a very large percentage of American Indians in and around Phillips and Little Earth and that area. 8, 19 AS: Can you back up and say what you said about when you started here in 2001.  Can you describe what your job is and what your work is? 11 The word opioid is in your job title. 11, 13 RM: I kind of carry two job titles here. 11, 14 We are a public union, so I am a principal planner. 19 That is my technical job classification according to the union. 7, 11 One of the insular duties I have carried since I started here is State Opioid Treatment Authority, which used to be called State Methadone Authority, and then they changed that title four years ago. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 AS: Why did they change that?  RM: What used to be methadone treatment programs now expanded to other medications besides just methadone. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 There is methadone, buprenorphine, what was called WAM which is an acronym, you see vivitrol. 6, 10 They wanted to expand the title to be more inclusive rather than just identifying a particular medication: methadone. 9, 14, 18 AS: And to identify what the problem was and not the medication used. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 RM: It’s a better descriptor of both problem and solution—I don’t like the word solution—intervention instead of just targeting one particular thing. 9, 12 AS: Why don’t you like the word solution? 9 RM: Well, I view addiction of whatever substance it happens to be a multifactoral issue, whatever you want to call it: a disease, a disorder, a maladaptive coping skill. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15 There are a lot of schools of thought and philosophies about that. 7, 17, 18 I don’t think I as a professional or we as an agency have a solution. 6, 9 There is not a single solution. 9 Science isn’t that good. 10 We don’t have the addiction pill to solve or resolve everything. 12, 14 When you look in the DSM-5 addiction, or in today’s world when we talk about substance use disorder there has been a lot of changes in the DSM—the diagnostic and statistics manual. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 When you look in the current edition you have specified from moderate to severe, and then you have symptom constellations, and certain numbers of all of these mean mild, moderate, or severe. 6, 17 There is a degree of volition involved in that.  Passive exposure to something does not qualify as addiction. 12, 14 If somebody who may have intoxication from an inhalant because they work in the industry, but there is not volitional effort on their part to concentrate it—it is passive exposure because they inhaled sewer gas and hallucinated—they are not an addict in the same sense as a fetus that was born with neonatal abstinence withdrawal syndrome because of gestational exposure that child, baby, fetus, will have a recognized withdrawal syndrome, but the baby is not an addict because they had no volitional choice. 5, 6, 9, 14, 17 If mom used while baby was on board the baby got some of the parent compound and the metabolite, versus volitional choice and going out and purchasing and using and stuff like that. 6, 13, 14, 16, 20 I think I am diagnosing.  [laughs] 15 AS: It is interesting. 17 What about your job here? 11 What have you been doing and what you’ve seen? 6 RM: Each state has at least one opioid treatment program and it has a SOTA—State Opioid Treatment Authority. 12, 13 There are forty-eight of us right now scattered throughout the country. 5, 12, 14, 19 Part of the SOTA role is to work as a go-between between state and federal agencies that regulate opioid treatment programs. 8, 10, 12, 13 We are the folks that try to knit stuff together for them. 8, 12 In Minnesota right now we have seventeen opioid treatment programs. 12, 13 One of them residential sixteen of them outpatient. 9, 11, 13 They are licensed and regulated by a variety of different agencies both state and federal. 8, 13 AS: When you say opioid treatment programs do you mean what we would call methadone treatment clinics? 12, 13 RM: What used to be referred to as methadone programs. 5, 6, 13, 16, 17 AS: You regulate them?  RM: I function as a go-between is one way to describe it. 9, 18 While I do not have actual regulatory authority over them I am the guy that goes around and tries to knit everything together. 8 You will have state and federal level requirements and things and I’m the one that explains and knits everything together. 8, 12 They have a Rule 31 license. 13 By division of licensing they enforce that. 6, 8 They are registered as a narcotics treatment program by the DEA and they enforce that. 5, 8, 12, 13 They have to have an accreditation body like [unclear]. 5 I’m the guy who runs around and knits all of that together. 8 To keep the whole machine working.  AS: What have you seen change? 6 You said four years ago the name was changed, but what was happening before that? 13, 14, 15 What is the difference between methadone programs then and now? 12 RM: There are a couple of noticeable changes both in the clientele served and the method of service delivery. 6, 10, 11, 19 The clientele served back if we had had this conversation twenty odd years ago were almost exclusively heroin addicts. 10, 13, 14 You didn’t often find a pharmaceutical opioid addict. 13, 14 Today there are a lot of pharmaceutical opioid addicts. 13, 14, 16 In today’s world a lot of folks coming in and using heroin are the same folks that were coming in four, five, or six years ago that were using pharmaceutical opioids. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 They started out with vicodin, percodan, and percocet and either as a result of a legitimate medical etiology—sprain, break, or tear—or that was their substance at that time now have converted over to heroin. 6, 7, 12, 14, 16 There are a couple of reasons for that. 11 There have been changes in scheduling of some pharmaceuticals. 6 There has been an examination by individual practitioners and larger chains of clinics or hospitals around their prescriptive practices. 8, 10 It’s not as easy to get the prescriptive opioids as it used to be. 6, 10, 13, 16 If you have a pool of people that have an active addiction to an opioid and the source of it starts to diminish they will come over here where they can get more, stronger, and cheaper. 9, 12, 13, 14 It is the migration of substance use. 6, 13 You see a change in the patient profile. 6 It used to be forties and fifties and now it is twenty to twenty-four year olds. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 The gender changed a little bit but not as much. 13, 20 There was a vast discongruence in racial breakdowns too.  It used to be primarily caucasian and some black. 6, 13, 16 Now it is primarily Native American.  There has been some shift in that. 8 From a treatment intervention standpoint methadone and laam were the two original FDA approved medications to used. 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16 AS: What is laam?  RM: Levacetylmethadate. 6, 13 That went off the market years ago. 5, 13, 14 There was concern about it causing cardiac arrhythmia called QT prolongation. 6, 17 It is gone and you can’t find it anymore. 8, 11 That left methadone as the sole pharmaceutical for a time. 6, 8, 14 Now you have methadone, buprenorphine products like suboxone and subutex and there are different formulations of those. 6, 8, 14 There are tablets, strips, et cetera.  There is vivitrol now, which is an injectible. 12 Part of the desire to change the name from State Methadone Authority to State Opioid Treatment Authority was a reflection of the changes of both the drug of choice or the primary substance of abuse no longer being almost exclusively heroin and being the pharmaceutical pills as well as the treatment intervention not aimed solely at methadone but methadone and buprenorphine products and whatever the next intervention pharmaceutical happens to be. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: What is your feeling about how treatment has changed in terms of the twelve-step model from the seventies and eighties? 12, 13, 15, 17 It seems to me that there were methadone clinics and those were people that were totally down and out. 6, 9 There is a huge stigma still around methadone. 9 Can you tell me about what you’ve seen change and what you think about medication assisted treatment today? 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 Where do you see it going? 6 RM: There has been a change in the acuity of the patients as well—the clients if you would—as well as with the age demographics and geographic areas. 8, 10, 20 It used to be that heroin was primarily found in large, major metropolitan areas. 6, 8, 13, 16, 20 You’d see it in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and Rochester. 6 Now the maps indicate that it is everywhere. 10, 14 It’s not just the big city drug anymore. 5, 6 Along with that there have been responsive changes in the system. 6 In the delivery of substance abuse treatment. 6, 12, 13 If you go back the mentality—the zeitgeist—in the early mid-eighties was that everyone went to detox, twenty-eight day resident care, six months of a halfway home and then if that didn’t work it wasn’t because the system wasn’t responsive to their needs it was because they weren’t motivated or they hadn’t hit rock bottom yet. 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 AS: It was the responsibility of the client. 10 RM: This is back when the accepted standard were things like the hot seat. 12 They would put you in a chair in a big circle and just pepper you with statements and questions until you broke down and cried and hit rock bottom. 8, 9, 12, 14 Then they would rebuild you and all this type of methodology. 6 AS: Do you remember the names of some of the therapists that came up with that? 16 RM: If you just searched ‘Minnesota Model’ and ‘hot seat’ you will find a few agencies today that believe in that kind of methodology. 6, 16 It is decreasing. 14 There has been a real awakening in what in today’s world I think is referred to as COD or dual diagnosis and co-occurring disorder. 5, 6, 13, 16, 17 That is the popular term. 17 The work I do as adjunct faculty at the graduate school is they have both a degree or Master’s confirmant in COD as well as a certification program in COD. 7 There has been a real awakening to the idea that you aren’t just an addict or you don’t just have mental health issues. 12, 13, 14, 19 You can have both at the same time.  Often one is in play or interlaced with the other.  Part of that awakening is a change or an awareness that the clients coming in today are more acute than they used to be. 6, 9, 10, 13, 16 In Minnesota we have what is called the Sixth Dimension model. 12 It is a modification of the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s patient placement criteria. 12, 14 You have these six different dimension with a zero to four of severity or acuity rating. 12 People coming into the system today are simply more acute than they used to be. 6, 13, 16 Not only are they younger, but they are more severely affected and impacted at younger ages than they used to be. 6, 13, 16, 20 Some of that can be because of the purity of the drug. 5, 6 Some of it can be because of the social nature of heroin in particular. 9, 16, 19 When you look at different drugs there is a different culture built around. 5, 6 Heroin in particular you see as a community drug. 5, 6, 9, 19 People will individually shoot heroin, but they will also do it in groups in the same vein you see people use marijuana part of the culture of marijuana is you will fire one up and pass it around the room versus tobacco and cigarettes where you don’t see that. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 The system itself has become more aware and more responsive to the acuity of the individual clients coming in. 10 A big piece of that acuity is not only the drug itself, but the behavioral correlates that come along with that. 5, 6, 15, 17 There is an increase in mental health symptomology. 12, 19 If you reference the DSM 5 you will see things like ‘anxiety disorder induced by opiate withdrawal.’ 5, 6, 10, 13, 14 There is a period of time where you have mental health symptom constellations that are a product of the intoxication or the withdrawal of the drug. 5, 6, 12, 14, 18, 19 They often respond to medications in the same way. 14, 18 Someone who comes into the emergency room or general medical care that looks like they have generalized anxiety disorder the gold standard in medicine for GAD—generalized anxiety disorder—is to use an an anxiolytic medication like alprazolam or phenazepam to treat anxiety. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 If you are an addict in withdrawal and you show up with a symptom constellation that looks like that that is the medication you are going to receive with no ill intent by the practitioner. 5, 8, 14 That’s just what they see. 6 That’s what their training tells them to give, which the addict will then use to modulate their withdrawal. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15 They start to feel normal again and the cycle continues. 16 With opioids you see an increase in a lot of secondary complications that come along with it too. 6, 13, 17 The mental health stuff. 12, 19 You see a lot of additional use of potential addiction through the anxiolytic medications like alprazolam and phenazepam. 6, 12, 13, 14 You see a large incidence of blood borne pathogens with heroin addicts in particular because of route of administration with needles or behavior they may engage in as a product or byproduct of the addictive nature and addictive use of the drug. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 Hepatitis and HIV and things like that.  Mary from RAAN [Rural AIDS Action Network] can speak directly about that. 18 She has a lot of statistics and numbers about that.  AS: You were talking about the Six Dimension model. 12 RM: I can send you some stuff on that.  It is a standardized method of assessment that we use for substance abuse treatment in Minnesota and have for a number of years now. 6, 12, 13, 14 It has six different dimentions that look at people more wholistically. 9, 12 It’s not just what is your drug of use, how often do you use it, when did you start using it. 5, 6, 13 As an illustration dimension one is intoxication and withdrawal. 5, 12 Eveyone is rated zero through four.  Zero is least impact and four is severe concern. 6 With dimension one we look at intoxication withdrawal. 5, 12 We look at dimension two: biomedical. 7, 12, 14 Does the individual have a traumatic brain injury that would affect where they would go for treatment? 12, 13 Also how treatment services would be delivered to them. 5, 12, 13, 19 Substance abuse treatment, especially in Minnesota as we have done it with the Minnesota Model where they talk about doing steps one through five and the third week is family week and how it used to be is a fairly academically driven method of service delivery that presupposed a level of cognitive ability on the part of the client that may or may not be there. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 Now that we have come mulitple generations down stream with what we know about FASD [fetal alcohol spectrum disorder] and neuroplasticity—how things affect the brain and how the brain responds to things—to take someone who has been an active rip and run heroin addict for the last five years and assume that they are going to be able to engage in a fairly literature based experience of reading the twelve and twelve, the schools and models, the Big Book, and completing these work books on steps one through five all in the span of twenty-eight days when you’ve been pumping delotive into yourself every six hours for the last two years—those two are discongruous. 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 They don’t work well together. 8 An individual client may fall behind and may not get their assignments done on time and depending on the sensitivity of the staff they are seen as resistant to treatment or not surrendering themselves. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 They blame the clients. 10 The clients get frustrated and act out. 10 Then they get washed out of the programs.  AS: Then they are back on the streets. 5 So how is this different?  When did the Six Dimension model appear? 12 RM: It is about eight to ten years ago that we started doing it in Minnesota. 13, 14 AS: Who is the leader in doing this now? 12 RM: The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division. 6, 13 It is based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s model. 13, 14 The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division, which is who I work here for are the ones who drove the idea of accepting a Minnesota-ized version here. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 Have you heard of the Rule 25 assessment tool? 9, 12, 13 The Rule 25 assessment tool uses that Six Dimension model. 6, 12, 13 When somebody has a Rule 25 done at the end of it you will see that they have a rating in dimensions one through six severity rating from one to four. 6, 12 That is the outcome of that.  AS: That’s how if someone is on medicaid they need ninety days or thirty days. 14, 16, 18 They look at the whole picture?  RM: Yes, they look at the whole picture.  In and of itself it is not a determinate for the length of time of placement, but it does play a role in determining a level of care or type of care. 10, 12, 17, 19 If somebody is looking for an opioid treatment program in particular for heroin that is taken into account during that process. 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 If someone has a traumatic brain injury in dimension two that would be taken into account. 12, 13 If somebody is homeless in their recovery environment in dimension six that is taken into account. 12 There is a whole placement criteria of who goes to outpatient, who goes to residential care and stuff like that based on that assessment. 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 In that Rule 25 tool there is also a mental health screening built into it two. 12, 19 The GAIN-SS short screen. 18 Substance abuse treatment today I think is looked at more holistically than it used to be. 6, 12, 13, 16 It’s not that you’re just an addict. 14 You can have an addiction and medical problems; you can have addiction and have mental health problems. 7, 12, 14, 19 It’s not A and B or chicken and egg.  It’s more of a fused, integrated, co-occuring aspect. 6, 13, 14, 16 I think there is a greater sensitivity to that now. 12, 20 In the eighties you would hear a lot that people’s mental health problems would just go away if they quit using. 6, 9, 12, 18, 19, 20 It doesn’t necessarily work quite that cleanly. 11 Or if you resolved your mental health problems your addiction would magically stop. 12, 14, 19 That just doesn’t happen. 15 There is a much greater awareness of how brain function is with PET scans and tomography and things like that. 9, 13, 20 In the same sense there is a greater sensitivity that it’s not just cleanly this or that, but there is a fusion of all of it together. 8, 20 AS: And we don’t understand completely how it all interacts. 14, 17, 18 There is more awareness about how complicated it really is. 9, 18 RM: Yes.  There is a greater awareness of the complexity. 9, 13, 20 The complexity of individuals and how delivery of treatment needs to be not just a cookie-cutter. 12, 13 You can’t just go to detox and just twenty-eight days of residential and just six months of halfway home. 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 Or that this program is not the solution for everyone every time, every place, everywhere. 9 AS: You see a more flexible, individualized treatment model? 6, 12, 13 RM: Yes.  AS: Do you have any thoughts about the schedules and methadone and heroin and its regulation? 6, 8, 16, 17, 18 Is there any chance that it would be downgraded or expanded? 5 RM: I’m not sure what you mean by downgraded. 5 Methadone is a schedule two and buprenorphine is a schedule three now. 10, 12 AS: Right, so methadone is more highly regulated. 7 You can only do it in certain places. 17 Do you see that changing, or methadone programs becoming less stigmatized? 6, 9, 17 RM: There is still stigmatizing to opiate treatment programs. 9, 12, 13 By the DEA methadone is a schedule two. 6, 8 Buprenorphine products are schedule threes. 14 Buprenorphine is a little different in that it can be used in an opiate treatment program and individual practitioners, MDs, DOs with training and additional registration and stuff can also do it out of OBOT—Office Based Opioid Treatment. 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 20 Part of Buprenorphine’s introduction here in the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 was to make it more flexible for individual practitioners as opposed to having to go to a program. 8, 10, 12, 14 Methadone programs, whether it is methadone or buprenorphine through that program is still seen by many people as quote unquote harm reduction. 5, 6, 8, 9, 14 In the eighties you had done everything there was to do and this was just palliative care. 19 You were going to be there forever and this was the only thing left to offer you because everything else had failed. 14 That’s not the attitude that you see today. 6, 16 Individuals may still have that belief.  Certain funding streams or practitioners may believe that. 8 Certainly the patient demographic has changed because it’s not just forty to fifty year old guy with three green teeth who has failed abstinence based treatment fifteen times. 12, 13, 14 When you have people that are twenty to twenty-four showing up it’s more acceptable. 9, 12 There was a real prevalent belief that once you enrolled in an opiate treatment program in the eighties or nineties that you were there for life, but that’s simply not true. 5, 10, 12, 13 Our GAIN data tells us that an average admission to discharge timeframe is around a year and a half to two years right now. 12, 13, 14, 15 Now there’s a number of reasons that can play into that.  It can be funding sources, people moving, people simply chosing to leave, people are sometimes removed from a program, administratively separated or discharged. 7, 9, 15, 18 There are a bunch of reasons why, but the fact of the matter is that the stories you hear about people who have been on methadone programs for thirty years are very small outliers at best. 9, 14 That’s not how the system works. 9 AS: Those people are much older. 9, 20 RM: There is a degree of aging out.  Back in the eighties when you looked at the average person that was on a methodone program back then had a lot of additional medical complications to them. 7, 14 That’s not tremendously different now. 12 We still see a lot of people that have Hepatitis or HIV or insilulary secondary problems, but there is a big difference between a fifty year old guy with a cirrhotic liver and hepatitis C and a twenty year old person that doesn’t have a cirrhotic liver and may have hepatitis in a system of health care and the ability to withstand that as a function of youth. 6, 9, 12, 14, 19 Forty years of shooting smack versus a year and a half of pharmaceutical opioids are two very different people. 6, 9, 13, 14 The medical compromising of the older person versus the younger person is that the older person is going to hit mortality sooner than the younger person just as a function of physical decay over decades of use versus months or a couple of years. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 20 AS: What are you seeing about the positive outcomes with medication assisted treatment? 6, 12, 13, 14 Are you collecting data on that? 13 Are people following clients over a period of time in the state? 9, 10, 18 RM: The short answer is yes, we do. 18 Part of it depends on how you define success. 11, 15 Within that you have people that embrace any of the continuum of a definition of harm reduction. 5, 9, 14 There are people that will tell you that their flavor of harm reduction is that the individual continues to come back, and whether they have intermittent use or continued use and continue to come back for some form of service. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 17, 19 The back of the NA chip says, ‘Keep Coming Back.’  As long as you keep coming back, as long as there is the opportunity for continued intervention that’s better than nothing. 17, 19 As you move along a line of conservative interpretation of harm reduction they will tell you that there is success in a decreased amount of heroin used, or they have stopped heroin use, but they still only ocassionally smoke or drink marijuana, all the way through complete abstinance from any and all mood altering substances, maybe with the exception of tobacco and caffeine. 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 There is a huge continuum along that line. 9 Thirty or forty years ago it was kind of a one stop shop—either you were completely clean, minus tobacco and caffeine, or you were an active junkie. 13, 14, 15 With the increasing complexity of people coming in with a lot of mental health stuff there is a greater acceptance of folks who have comorbid disorders and the use of psychotropic medications, too. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 It’s not that long ago, and you can still find self-help meetings around here, where they will tell you if you are on psychotropic medication you’re not sober. 13, 14, 17, 18 Or if you’re on methadone or buprenorphine or any other medication assisted therapy you’re not really sober. 12, 14, 18 There’s nowhere else in behavioral health or med/surg that you see that type of mentality applied. 6, 12, 15, 19 I hold licensure as a drug and alcohol abuse counselor. 5, 6, 13 I also hold licensure as a LPCC—a Licensed and Professional Clinical Counsellor which is a mental health professional by state definition. 12, 19 If I am working with somebody who is a heroin addict and we talk about medication assited therapy and we are talking primarily about methadone or buprenorphine products, if I’m working with someone who is an active hallucinatory psychotic that’s on Seroquel, which is any typical antipsychotic, nowhere in his or her treatment plan do we talk about trading off of Seroquel. 12, 13, 14, 16 Nowhere do we say, “Your life will be much better if you don’t have to keep taking that Seroquel.” 10, 11 When you talk to folks who have a bipolar disorder we talk about compliance to medication to stabilize mood, not withdrawal from medication to see if you’re all better now. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14 Only here when we talk about active addiction do we seem to find that. 6, 12, 14 Even within addiction there is a bifurcation of that mentality. 12, 14 There are folks who find it completely acceptable for somebody who has difficulty or is unable to stop drinking being on Antabuse Disulfiram there is a real behavioral modification way of trying to address a spiritual disorder. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 If you take Disulfiram or Antabuse, but you don’t drink alcohol, you might have some of the noticable sideaffects like dry mouth, loose stool, and stuff like that, but really nothing bad happens. 5, 6, 9, 13, 15, 18 If you take Antabuse and you drink you’re sicker than hell and puking that’s completely okay because then you are being punished for your addiction versus taking an opioid repalcement medication where if you are at normal therapeutic dose you are just normal. 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 You’re not high and you’re not in withdrawal. 5, 7 You just feel normal. 16 But then for some reason we have to talk to you about titrading off of that or weaning off of that medication because we know you really want to be ‘sober’ and you can’t be if you are still taking this medicine. 11, 12, 14, 18 Then somehow we don’t want to talk about that with anything else. 8 “You came in today and we checked your diabetes profile and your ANC [absolute neutrofil count] is fourteen right now and your glucose is close to six hundred, but we really want to get you off of that insulin.” 9, 10, 12, 16, 18 You don’t see those kinds of discussions in other forms of health care. 6, 19 AS: Which is a huge stigma and a huge problem. 9, 12 I went to Zurich a couple of months ago and met with the director of an addiction medicine clinic and because they had the needle parks in Zurich in the eighties where they had so many deaths and so much illness and how they treated that problem all on its own using medication and basically have eliminated it. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 People don’t do heroin very much there anymore. 16 I just got this perspective that it’s really how we perceive it and you were just getting to that with your examples. 18 Do you see any way in the near future where we could change the thinking and attitudes around it? 6, 18 Are we stuck with this hundred year old opium junkie stereotype? 5, 14 RM: I think there are couple of ways and I can give you a few angles. 11, 18 If you go back forty or fifty years it was actually illegal to treat an addict with an opioid. 7, 13, 14 There was one treatment center in the country and it was the Federal Narcotics Farm [unclear]. 12, 13, 19 It was an old renovated prison.  Doctors Nyswander and Dole published a landmark paper at the end of the ‘67 or ‘68 about the use of what was then the narcotic replacement was methadone—dolophine—because it has a long half life of twenty-four to thirty-six hours and all the pharmacology about it they were able to maintain addicts. 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 There has been a shift away from incarceration—the Federal Narcotics Farm—you would go there for anywhere from twenty-one days to six months and then you either ‘got the cure’ or you didn’t and you would come back. 8, 11, 16, 18, 20 There has been a shift away from that to the idea of methadone for those people that somehow couldn’t be reached by anybody else. 6, 8, 9, 18, 20 Then you have the DATA [Drug Addiction Treatment Act] 2000 act with buprenorphine which was a very volitional, intentional act to try to destigmatize the use of medication out of a physician’s office versus going to that clinic. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Prior to 2001 the Food and Drug Administration, which still plays a role, had a much larger role in regulation of methadone programs. 10 Under those old rules and 21 CFR 291 505 you could never get anymore than a twenty-one day take home dose regardless of the amount of time you had been on the program. 13, 16 The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment steps in as the new agency in 2001 with new regulations that are more laxed or more understanding. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 I think the best example of that is the idea that you could never have more than two weeks of take home medication because all you are going to do is sit around and be stoned anyway versus the idea of getting people to be more normal. 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 There is an eight-point criteria now to get take home doses and among some of those eight-point criteria and among treatment plans today is going to school, going to work, and doing the stuff that ‘normal’ people do so that you don’t just go to the clinic everyday to dose. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16 The idea is to get you to be less and less reliant on the clinic and things like that and more and more engaged in normal ADL—activities and daily living stuff. 16 Making it more acceptable to have take-home medications, having a degree of expectations that is flexible to individual needs rather than this is how we are doing it and if you don’t like it that’s too bad. 12, 14 I think there are landmarks that show you from the days of the Federal Narcotics Farm up through today where there is a greater empathy and understanding and expanse of the complexity of the individual client or patient, as well as the flexibility required to meet the individual. 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 It’s not just an inner-city drug anymore. 5, 6 It’s not just that old dope fiend anymore.  When it’s the twenty year old girl from Eagan shooting smack versus the sixty year old Hmong guy in upper Frogtown those are two very different people. 6, 7, 9, 14 It is the same drug, but the dynamics, the cultures, and the expectations are very differnt. 5, 6 They are all still in Minnesota.  They are twenty miles apart from each other. 9, 11 The one size fits all has given way. 15, 18 I think there is hope. 9 In the same vein there is competing interests.  When you look at the DEA they by its nature is an enforcement authority that looks at scheduling and regulation more from a law enforcement standpoint versus DHS issued license Rule 31, which is more soft-science treatment standpoint. 8, 12, 13 Rule 31 is the chemical dependency licensure for Minnesota. 13 There are different agencies that have competing interests in the sense of regulation and the sense of funding.  The one thing you can never control for in any piece of research is who funded it. 8, 16, 18 People fund studies to get answers that they want to get.  If they get answers they don’t want they stop funding or they don’t publish it.  AS: Do you see any new changes coming down the pipe for treatment in Minnesota? 6, 12, 13, 16 RM: Yesterday President Trump issued an executive order establishing an opioid commission. 9, 13, 14, 16 It just happened yesterday. 15, 16 On that commission there is a variety of individuals and titles. 13 Some of them have yet to be determined, but it’s an interesting make up in the text of the executive order involving the Secretary of Defense. 17 There has certainly been demonstrated change from the Federal Narcotics Farm through this stuff today. 8, 14, 16, 17 Now, policies are primarily created by politics, and politics gives and changes and ebbs and flows. 6, 10 As a sideline if you look at cannabis right now it has continued to be a schedule one all along here, which by definition is highly addictive and of no medical value. 7, 9, 12, 14 Yet, you have a large number of states that have medical cannabis laws—thirty-eight I believe—and then some of those that have recreational cannabis laws. 7, 13, 14 There is this discongruency between federal scheudling by the DEA and individual states recognizing medical cannabis like Minnesota does, or recreational cannabis like Colorado. 7, 8, 14 What is going to happen with the current federal administration and that state ‘sovereignty’ for medicinal or recreational cannabis is to be determined. 8, 14, 15, 17 People have theories and guesses but who knows. 12 With the awakening and awareness of what is going on just in the last fifteen years or so with a greater sensitivity to co-occuring disorders, to the interlacing to substance abuse and mental health, the introducation and increasing acceptance of medication as a legitimate intervention—not necessarily a solution, but part of the equation—gives me hope that that can continue. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 Even though I think that is a pervasive trend—you have pockets of greater acceptance and pockets of deeper resistance to it. 12, 20 There are still folks who absolutely delieve that addicts should go into withdrawal and suffer. 5, 12, 14 They shouldn’t die, but they should suffer because that is somehow going to make them reevaluate before they go and use again. 6, 8, 13 If it was that simple nobody would ever have a second mind crushing hang over when they were an undergraduate. 14 The first time you wrap your head around a toilet and gag your guts out you would never go out and drink again. 5, 14, 16 IT just doesn’t work that way. 18 There’s no addict booth at career day. 14, 15, 16, 19 People don’t choose this whether it is prescription pharmaceuticals, whether it’s heroin, whatever the drug or the method it is a condition that comes into play and prominence and in my opinion it should be treated as that. 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16 To stigmatize, lay blame, and point fingers at this group or that group is simply not true because it’s not that fifty year old carnie guy with green teeth and the body mask of Kid Rock anymore. 5, 9, 14 It hasn’t been for a long time. 17 AS: I don’t know if it has ever been. 12 RM: Right, but people have that image. 9 People have the image of the stereotypic heroin user and they think of Keith Richards. 6, 9, 13, 16 They don’t think of a twenty year old kid who is an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. 14 I do adjunct facutly at River Falls and I teach an addiction class at the graduate program down there and The Voice is the student newspaper and five or six years ago one of the headlines of The Voice was a kid they found dead in one of the dormitories who still had the needle in his arm. 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 He was a young, novice user who was really narcotically naive and got ahold of a hot load and had no idea what the actual strength was. 6, 13, 18 He had an unintentional hydrogenic overdose because he didn’t know. 5, 12 That’s why you see so much overdose with younger people. 6, 9, 20 When you look at the common profile for heroin addicts and opiate addicts right now they bifuracte pretty cleanly into the young ones and the older guys—I’m saying guys as a term and mean the older population. 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20 The older population are the people who just won’t die. 9, 20 They know how to live, how to survive, they know how to come down, and they take care of each other in groups. 12, 19 The young, narcotically naive, novice kids who think they’re superman and bullet proof have no idea that the stuff they just bought from the new handyman across the street is cut with fentanyl and will kill you stone dead. 8, 16 They don’t know that so they solulate it up and fire it in and they have a hydrogenic overdose from it. 5, 12 Dead addicts can’t recover. 14 AS: There is a lot of stuff saying it is the pharmaceuticals that have made this younger generation’s access to opiates and adderall—they aren’t as frightened of drugs because they have been accustomed to them. 5, 6, 9, 12, 20 They have a belief that heroin is just the same thing. 16 Would you say that the pharmaceutical culture we live in has increased their nonchalance around it’s danger?  RM: There seems to be nonchalance about it. 6 Younger people today of sixteen to twenty-four or twenty-five are always kind of the petrie dish of that generation’s culture. 9, 16, 18 We have gone through the grunge kids, the emo kids, now you are into the social media, Twitter, and Facebook generation and all that. 8, 12, 19 On that course of line you see a huge, vast influx of various medications, a greater willingness to use pharmaceutical intervention, which is both good and bad. 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 20 Along with the acceptance of pharmaceutical intervention for an addict comes pharmaceutical intervention and a greater perponderance for things like ADD and ADHD. 12, 14, 20 Back in my day there was not such a swiftness to diagnose someone as ADHD and Ritilin was about the only thing around. 16 Now you’ve got adderall and everything else.  There’s a greater buffet line of medicine intervention. 9, 12, 14, 20 The advertisements you see on television, if you even watch commercial tv anymore. 6, 12, 17 You look at magazines with large-scale full glossy ads. 14 There’s a lot of work done from companies for that. 10 I think that is a piece of it.  We also live in a culture whose tag line from my point of view seems to be ‘how fast can you burn and how far can you go?’ 6, 9 Faster, bigger, badder, harder, stronger, whether you’re talking about bycinopril because you’ve got high blood pressure and colesterol or viagra single pack ads. 7, 9, 10 Everything today is flooded by pharmaceuticals. 16 We went through the energy drink craze that was pretty targetted at adolescents, specifically male adolescents. 5, 10 AS: And couldn’t you argue that those drinks are a sort of gateway to other things? 5, 18 RM: There are folks who would argue that. 12 Caffeine is one of the ten categories in the current DSM for addicitive disorder. 13, 14 I think there’s hope for continued if not standard acceptance of individuals who have substance abuse and mental health disorders. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 I think there’s the opportuity for continued work with medication as well. 14 I don’t think medication is exclusively the answer. 14 I think it’s got to be a combined effort just as you have compelxity of the client you need increasing responsiveness of the treatment system of delivery. 10, 12, 13 Like I said before you can’t control who funds the research and you don’t always get to control the social outcome of political decisions. 14, 18, 19 AS: That makes me think of prevention education. 10, 14, 15, 19 Do you have a role in any of that? 10 RM: Our office does.  The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division does have a prevention section to it. 6, 10, 13, 19 There’s not a whole lot that I do.  AS: Has it changed from D.A.R.E. 13 [Drug Abuse Resistant Education] program? 6, 13, 14 Are they willing to talk more specifically about the dangers in public school systems? 7, 19 RM: The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division does not directly fund D.A.R.E. and there isn’t any direct federal funding for D.A.R.E. 6, 8, 13, 18 There is money available—in fact Minnesota is one of the recipients of what’s called SPF RX—the Strategic Prevention Framework around Prescrition Opioids. 8, 10 The A and D division upstairs did receive some money from that. 6, 8, 10 They are going to implementing it as part of their prevention strategy and framework this year. 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 A treatment service delivery model does more with treatment than we do with prevention. 10, 12, 13, 19 When you talk about prevention you are trying to prevent something that already happens. 10, 15, 19 To try to quantify and measure a negative is by its definition is difficult if not impossible versus when we look at numbers and stats and figures of teatment admissions and stuff liek that is all data gathering after the fact. 10, 12, 13 So Joe comes into treatment and we ask Joe all kinds of questions and then we compile stats and numbers versus prevention where you try to prevent those numbers from ever happening. 10, 12, 13, 15 There is an industry to treatment. 12, 13 There is funding and there is revenue to be created off of it.  If you talk about revenue of prevention you are trying to prevent damage. 10, 19 AS: There’s not much money in prevention, is there? 8, 10, 19 RM: Not compare to treatment, no. 12, 13 AS: Anything else?  RM: The only thing I have to remind you is that I’m not saying anything as an official representative of the Department of Human Services. 5, 9, 10, 12 There’s truly no way to separate my role as the State Opioid Treatment Authority from our discussion here, but I just want for the record that I do hold those two faculty positions at Adler and River Falls, so I’m speaking in a multi-layered role and some of this is stuff I do in Minnesota, but also with Adler graduate school or University of Wisconsin at River Falls where the course work I teach is the education of young clinicians, especially Adler with their COD program, is the sensitivity about substance use disorder and mental health as a fused individual, which is an Adlerian concept by itself. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 With River Falls it is guidance counselors and psychologists, so it’s helping assisting or educating future professionals to be more sensitive and flexible and to increase the acuity of people coming in. 9, 14 The volume of medical knowledge seems to double every couple of years now with increases from everything from brain imaging to epigenetics to everything else. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 WE simply learn more and more at a faster rate. 10 Because we learn more we hopefully have a greater sensitivity for the given complexity of it, and then out of that a need for us to become more flexible in our response with folks. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 20 We can’t lock you up for six days of detox and throw you twenty-eight days of residential care and then if it doesn’t work blame you for the failure. 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 AS: Thank you.

"18","Hilger_Chuck","Paula DeSanto Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 26, 2017 At Minnesota Alternatives Spring Lake Park, Minnesota Paula DeSanto -PD Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan. 14 I'm in Spring Lake Park, Minnesota at Minnesota Alternatives with Paula DeSanto. 14 Paula can you state your name and say that you give me permission?  PD: This is Paula DeSanto and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record today. 16 AS: Thank you.  One of the things I like to start off with in the interviews is kind of just to get more of a full picture of who you are. 14 I'm interviewing you because you're a professional in the field but I'm also trying to get a sense of people's journeys to where they ended up. 9 If you could just give me a little background. 20 You can spend as much or as little time on it as you want. 10, 20 Where you grew up and stuff like that. 20 PD: What inspired me to be doing what I'm doing? 5 AS: What inspired you. 5 PD: I grew up in Rochester, Minnesota. 20 I was, I am, the daughter of a physician.  My father's a physician who worked for the state hospital down in Rochester. 8, 16 He was not in the field of psychiatry per se but his job was to be the primary care doctor for the internal medicine doctors that took care of the patients that were at the Rochester State Hospital that got physically ill. 6, 11, 12, 14, 19 I was born into a home that was actually on the state hospital campus. 7, 8, 14 We would go to the hospital, that was back in the days when the boundaries were all blurry. 8, 16 We would be taken to the hospital. 8 We would be attending events that they had at the hospital with the patients. 8 My mother tells a story once when we walked into a bathroom in a hospital and apparently there was feces all over the wall. 8, 14, 15, 16, 20 I looked at her and I said, ""I'm not cleaning this up."" 14 She says, ""No, you don't have to.  That's okay.""  There were times when we would be at home, it was an open campus back then, it was much more of an asylum and patients were free to roam about.  The patients would come into our home.  She shared a story once where a patient came in and immediately went to the drawer and was rummaging through the utensils drawer. 5, 15 She got quite alarmed, she thought maybe he was looking for a weapon. 5, 11, 17, 18 It turns out he wanted a bottle opener. 18 There are some interesting stories then. 9, 17 I have memories of my father bringing patients home. 16 They would have a bunch of cuts on their arms.  I was curious about why they would do things like that.  It set a clear impression that people with mental illness are people that are in trouble and aren't to be feared or aren't pathological or somehow different than us. 5, 8, 9, 10, 12 They're just ill.  Both my parents were very compassionate people. 9, 20 There was just a culture of compassion in our home.  That was kind of early experience with mental health issues. 12, 13, 18, 19 We did not have any experience with substance use disorder dynamic in our family. 6, 12, 13, 18 Neither of my parents used drugs or alcohol at all. 5, 6, 13, 16, 20 When I was a young child I was pretty independent and willful and was good at negotiating. 10, 14 I was quite certain I was heading for a career in law. 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 I just assumed that was what I was going to do.  I went to a couple years of community college in Rochester then moved up to Minneapolis to start at the U of M to continue on towards a bachelor’s degree in political science with the anticipation that I was heading towards some kind of prelaw program. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19 Then on a whim decided to take my college tuition money and go on a road trip. 7, 8, 10, 14 I took the quarter or semester off with a friend, went out to Arizona and just had a lot of fun. 20 Then some sort of epiphany occurred to me and I decided I didn't want to be an attorney. 5, 14 Instead I wanted to be a social worker. 18, 19 AS: What year was this or what year were you born? 14 PD: I was born in '61. 14 Graduated high school in '79 and moved up to Minneapolis in '81. 7, 15 AS: This is the early 80s that you go on this road trip.  That's awesome.  Do you have siblings?  PD: I do, I come from a family of five girls. 7, 11, 12 AS: Where are you in the family? 12 PD: I'm number two.  Some other kind of interesting stories; I was caught in the seventh grade with marijuana in school because it was around and a lot of people were dabbling with it in the seventh grade. 5, 7, 9, 17 I was wanting to be kind of a leader.  I bought some pot and a bunch of us were going to go to a movie that night and go and smoke some pot and try it out. 6 It really was very experimental at that time. 12, 18 We were young.  We were in the bathroom smoking cigarettes as well. 6, 14 The things we did at young ages.  I had this bag of pot in my lunch bag. 6 We got caught smoking cigarettes and they found the pot. 6 AS: There's probably more going on here.  We're going to take a look.  PD: Curiously though I was sent to the assistant principal's office and he said, ""I'm calling your mom."" 5, 14, 16 I said, ""Let me call her.""  I got on the phone with my mom and she was a very rational person. 8, 14, 16 She said, ""What's going on?""  ""I'm in the principal's office.  I got in some trouble.""  She said, ""Smoking in the can.""  I said, ""Worse.""  ""Drugs?""  ""Yep.""  She came and picked me up and I was just sent home for the day. 5, 16 There actually weren't any consequences from the school except that they wanted me to be evaluated by a counselor for drug and alcohol problem I guess. 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 18 I remember that night I went home and my dad took me out to play tennis instead of going to the movies. 14 We went and played tennis and I told my parents it was experimental. 12, 16, 20 I wanted to kind of be cool so I was the one that bought it. 8, 14, 17, 18 I had money. 8, 10 We were all going to go do it but I didn't have a problem. 12 It was true. 5 It was a true story. 5, 15 They accepted it. 12 The counselor called a couple months later saying to come in for an evaluation. 11, 14, 16 I told them I didn't need it and my mother supported me so I never got the evaluation. 16 It did launch a fairly longstanding experience with cannabis. 9, 14, 17, 18 I was blessed with this, my father's from the Philippines, he came from the Philippines to Minnesota to study medicine. 12, 14, 16 As a result of some of my Asian ancestry I lack and enzyme that breaks down alcohol so I have a constant state of Antabuse in my system. 6, 13 If I drink I get rashy or uncomfortable and my heartrate increases. 5, 9 So I don't drink. 5 Alcohol was never my thing. 16 A lot of my peers were in to alcohol at early ages as they were into cannabis and speed and LSD and mushrooms. 6, 14 I dabbled pretty hard from kind of junior high through high school. 7, 9, 10, 14 I had the good fortune to have enough common sense and supportive home and family environment that I really never got into trouble. 10, 12, 16, 18, 19 I was able to maintain my academics and I started working at fifteen in the food industry. 20 Despite having a pretty intensive with substance use, I bet I was stoned almost every day for three, four, five years. 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16 I managed to not get in much trouble.  AS: And you didn't get caught again.  PD: I didn't get caught again.  Curiously by the time I graduated high school I pretty much had outgrown most of that stuff and was able to stay out of it. 7, 10 AS: What about your sisters? 20 They didn't venture.  Maybe a little casual alcohol use but they were pretty, and a little bit of pot dabbling but they didn't like the experience with cannabis that I did. 6, 10, 13, 18, 20 They stayed away for the most part. 9, 18, 20 There really wasn't any direct intro through my siblings or my parents. 18, 20 When we start to talk about nephews and nieces and second generation there's more stuff going on.  AS: What about your mom. 14 You said your dad came from the Philippines to med school. 7, 14 Where's your mom from? 14 PD: My mom is from northern Minnesota, small town called Breckenridge near Fargo. 8, 14 She's got German ancestry and she was working in Minneapolis as a secretary.  She hadn't had a college education and they started dating and she got pregnant and they got married. 7, 10, 14, 15 That's kind of their story. 15 They kept trying to have a boy and five girls later. 7, 11 AS: My parents did the same thing, they tried. 20 They stopped after three.  PD: After three girls? 7, 11 That question comes up frequently about what's your history? 15 Are you in recovery?  I get that a lot from people, from clients. 9, 10 I say, ""I have a pretty extensive experience with drugs and alcohol but I was fortunate that I really never ended up developing symptoms of an alcohol use disorder."" 5, 6, 10, 13, 16, 18 I might have maybe had one or two. 5 I don't think it was ever really anything beyond mild. 18 AS: Your life didn't spin out of control as a result. 6, 10, 18 It didn't take over your life. 10 PD: Right.  AS: I want to come back to that later when you're talking about clients. 10 We'll just try to remember that about why is it that in this field people feel like the person that they're talking to or confiding in has to have had that same experience to effectively relate and treat to them when in all other aspects of psychotherapy and medicine we don't expect, we don't have that expectation. 9, 12, 14, 18 Maybe we can talk about that a little. 20 PD: Do you want to briefly cover it now? 12, 19 AS: Let's just talk about that now. 12 PD: That was a design of the field. 11 The field was created typically by people initially who were in recovery. 9, 14, 18 AS: The Minnesota Model.  PD: Exactly.  When it started they chose to adopt AA. 14 AS: And help people help others. 9 PD: Absolutely that was a key part of it. 9, 15 The system created that phenomenon. 12 Clients don't really cling to that. 18 My response to them typically is, they may be curious but I typically say, ""You know, while I appreciate that's a concern for you and that you feel that might help me better identify with you. 10, 12, 13, 18 I think that there are lots of ways for me to be able to identify with you. 16, 18 That's why having an open heart and a good skill set. 9, 10 I'm a woman, you're a man.  I can't identify with that fully. 14 I'm not your parent. 20 So you're saying that anyone who comes in here with a mental illness, if I don't have that mental illness I can't help them. 12 If I don't have that personal background, I can't help them.  There's no way we can walk in everybody's shoes. 16, 18 What matters more is that we're people that are really interested in trying to help you. 9, 18 We're compassionate.  We're welcoming.  We have skills. 10 We have some skills that we can offer you if you want them. 10 Skills and knowledge."" 12 AS: Then they kind of back down.  Would you say part of that, the way that's been created has to do with stigma and the power of stigma? 9, 17, 18 That if I haven't battled with addiction myself they might see that as there being some stigma because stigma is so strong against it around us? 6, 9, 12, 14 PD: I don't know if it's stigma so much as the system has created this idea that there's normies and there's abnormies. 9, 12 You somehow are a group separate from us. 8 If you don't actually have this thing they've convinced you that you have. 7 This genetic disease, this abnormal brain that makes you unique. 13, 16 We're all kind of in it and if you're not in it you're separate from us.  I think that unfortunately that traditional 12 Step disease based approaches have created that divide. 13 They created it and fueled it.  That language still comes up.  I'm like, ""What?""  We spend a lot of time pointing out our commonalities and how blurry those things really are. 10, 18 The difference between someone with a substance use issue and not and how things happen on continuums and different levels of severity. 6, 13, 15 Client today, staff tomorrow. 16 Staff today, client tomorrow. 10, 16 It's really very blurry. 18 We all have a lot of the same conditions.  AS: It's just how they impact our lives.  PD: I think more and more that we recognize the environmental factors are significant. 11, 12, 17 In terms of the stressors that people are struggling with in the environment that they're in in terms of their ability to navigate a lot of the challenges. 7, 9, 12, 17 We're looking at really highly stimulated people today. 7, 9, 16, 18 I think it creates a lot of unsettled nervous systems out there.  I think that's hard too. 9 Everyone's all amped up all the time.  They get their first drink or their first benzo or their first opiate. 5, 14 AS: And they finally calm down.  PD: Right.  AS: Let's go back to your epiphany or your moment on the road trip where you decided that you wanted to do social work and not law. 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 You had moved from wanting to maybe be a police officer to lawyer. 5, 7, 8, 13, 15 You always wanted to do something for people? 9, 18 PD: Yes.  AS: It just changed. 13 PD: Being a lawyer was really being an advocate. 13, 18 AS: You were moving towards that.  PD: Definitely.  AS: What happened after the road trip? 15 PD: I think I just had a chance to slow down a little bit and kind of reevaluate where I was heading. 10, 14, 20 While political science was interesting to me I think I realized it was about human relationships. 17, 19 I went back to the U and changed my major from political science to human relationships. 13, 19 Then I started a different course.  AS: By that point you were what?  A junior? 14 PD: Then I finished up the human relationships program at the University of Minnesota and then right on the heels of that I started working in the field of mental health in 1981. 12, 19 Right when I moved up here I got a job as a mental health worker without any training, without any degrees. 7, 11, 12, 15, 19 I just got a tech type job in a big large residential facility. 9, 11, 13 They hired me quite frankly I think because when they asked me, ""What's the difference between mental illness and mental retardation?"" 5, 11, 12 I knew the difference. 16 I think that was my credential. 5, 9 I started working in a big facility, a two hundred bed facility in St. Paul as a mental health worker. 12, 19 That just kind of launched my career and I've been doing it ever since. 10, 14, 15, 19 I finished my undergraduate work and I was working by then in a higher level position as a mental health counselor once I got my bachelor’s degree. 7, 12, 17, 19 That went right into a master’s degree. 12 There was an employer that I had that was very innovative and very person-centered in her approach and she pursued work coming out of Boston University, the Center for Psych Rehab, Dr. William Anthony's work. 5 Back then it was highly progressive. 7 The idea that there's a patient movement out there. 12, 15 That there's an approach toward mental health care that doesn't fit the positions in charge that it really is the person that should be in the center and the doctor and the medical team are one part of that. 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19 As a patient my goals, my wants, and my needs should be respected in this process. 17 That was the heart of this work coming out of Boston University. 9 I entered a master’s program at the support of my employer at the time to get a masters in psychiatric rehabilitation counseling. 5, 19 AS: Did you do that in Boston or did you do that here?  PD: It was both actually. 7 I went out there for intensive course work and all the clinical work was done here through transcription and actual CDs and cassette tapes. 17 AS: Cassette tapes, not even CDs. PD: Record and play buttons.  AS: You'd get your course content that way. 18 PD: I'd get my clinical work, yes.  It was a program that was designed for working clinicians. 11 The work was done on audio and sent to my instructors to evaluate. 5 Then I'd be flying out there periodically for intensive coursework. 14, 18 It was kind of a half, half. 14 AS: Pre-internet.  PD: Exactly.  AS: Pre online course work. 9 We moved around back then. 7, 15 PD: That kind of helped solidify some credentials anyway. 5, 9, 14, 18 Then I worked for that organization for eleven years. 14 I ended up working as a director, developing a new program. 16, 18, 19 It was called, supportive living services that basically provided an assertive case management type service to people where you go out into their homes and help them manage their mental health issues in their homes. 9, 12, 13, 17, 19 Very boots on the ground, community based, do what it takes. 13, 14, 17, 19 That was after working several years in the residential intensive mental health. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 It was all mental health really. 12, 18, 19 I worked for that organization for eleven years. 14 Then I got head hunted by the department of human services to go out to Anoka Metro Region Treatment Center. 9, 12, 14, 19 They were at that time moving from their old state hospital campus to their new multimillion dollar facility. 8, 16 The commissioner was spending millions of dollars to build this new state hospital. 8, 10, 16 My job was to transition, help them transition their clinical services from a kind of highly medical outdated model to a person centered progressive model as they moved to their new state of the art facility. 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: Do you remember what year this is? 14 PD: It would have been about; I can look at my resume.  AS: That's okay.  You can give it to me later.  PD: Let me see, early 90s. 6 AS: May I ask you a question about the history of mental health? 12, 15, 19 In the 80s Reagan puts all kind of mentally ill people back out. 9, 12 Would you say your career at this point kind of reflects what, you were going from an institution into people's homes? 9, 15, 19 Did you see positives and negatives? 6 We tend to only think of New York City and all the mentally ill. 12 Do you remember any of that?  I find that part really interesting. 9, 17, 18 PD: Definitely.  AS: It was probably really good for some people and really horrible for others. 9, 10, 18 Absolutely.  I think any time you run into an everybody needs the same thing kind of thinking you're going to run into trouble. 8 The assumption back then was everyone needs to get out of the asylums and in apartments on their own. 5, 9, 11, 12 For a lot of people that was the last thing they needed. 9 Granted there was the development of group homes. 12 The group homes back then weren't actually homes. 7 People could be in them if they needed to be in them.  When I first started in mental health, in residential mental health people could be in them for years. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 They were really a place, they were transitional homes and then you could go when you wanted to go, when you needed to go, when there were resources to accommodate your next step. 13, 17, 18 AS: But you could also just stay.  Yes, you could stay long-term and they'd redefine them to ninety day programs. 5, 11, 16, 17 A sort of intensive treatment, residential treatment. 9, 12, 13 With the idea then ACT teams, assertive community treatment, wrap around teams, supportive living services like the programs that were developing would help people transition from state hospitals to more group homes, short term residential treatment into long-term stays in communities in their apartments. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 Good, yes absolutely but most people probably would prefer to have their own places and be able to be active members of their community. 9, 10, 19 For a lot of people with severe substance use issues and mental health issues living alone in an apartment was not considered to be an environment that they're going to desire. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 It just led to isolation and a return of symptoms and a lack of community. 19 They weren't naturally prone to community integration. 8, 19 The community wasn't welcoming. 19 That continues today. 16 There's some kind of pendulum that moves all over the place but there's definitely some recognition that we need to have long-term community type settings for people. 9, 15, 17, 19 It's not the idea that everybody needs to be alone in an apartment is the best option. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 Congregate living, with lots of supports on site where services can kind of come in and out of people's lives based on their current acuity. 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 That way have people that can be available twenty-four seven if needed but not programming them if they don't need the programming, being flexible. 9, 18 There's been lots of heroes up there who have advocated for a return to some more of that community housing models, cooperative housing, supportive housing. 6, 16, 19 There's a lot of regulations now that prohibit it because you can't have too many people living together or you move into these institutes for mental diseases clauses that prevent you from actually developing programs that house people with disabilities. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 20 They want to be integrated.  AS: Then there's all the zoning and the neighbors and people who don't want those people in their neighborhood. 9, 20 PD: Right.  My job was to actually close two of the units at the state hospital and open up then two sixty bed units, one in Bloomington and one in St. Paul. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19 Then transition the rest of the units to a facility. 17, 19 Integrate their mental health and substance use disorder care and bring patient centered state of the art services to the state of the art hospital. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 19 AS: At this point are you an administrator?  PD: Yes.  AS: You've kind of worked into that.  You're not dealing directly one on one with residents. 9, 18 PD: I did a fair amount. 9 I had a primary treatment unit that was a psychiatrist and a social worker and some other disciplines and I was the treatment director on the unit. 9, 12, 13, 18, 19 So I did a lot with the units. 19 The two sixty bed units I was hands on there trying to direct the care as well and then trying to get the hospital to do stuff differently which continues to be an ongoing struggle. 8, 17, 18, 19 It was real apparent to me that while the intentions from the department of human services might have been good in terms of we really want a person centered, state of the art, mission driven services but there's so many conflicting interests because we had also had a public safety medical model. 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 It was a very difficult system to try to change because everybody's worried about risk and liability. 10 AS: Are people hurting themselves or hurting other people? 9 PD: I did that for five years and then said, ""Oh boy. 7, 14 I'm not committed to them.""  Another epiphany.  I had a dream that if I stayed at that job I was going to get cancer. 5, 10, 11 It was one of those really, really obvious messages and so I listened to the dream. 5, 18 I gave them a year's notice and I left. 14 I worked my ass off for another year and gave up wrapping up these projects I was deep into. 5, 14 Then I moved on. 7, 15 I went traveling for six months and then got a job with People Incorporated which is a very mission driven pretty state of the art mental health organization. 5, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19 I worked for them for nine years directing a campus on the North side of Minneapolis. 9, 14, 18 I had a nice integrated network of services there that I helped develop and create and led a big capital campaign and built buildings. 18, 19 That was great. 20 I thought that was probably where I was going to end up retiring. 17, 18 Then I had another epiphany.  The universe keeps kind of just telling me what to do. 15 AS: You listened.  PD: It was a Sunday afternoon and I was in the tub and this message said you need to open a drug and alcohol treatment program. 5, 6, 12, 13, 16 What are you talking about?  You need to do this.  Alright. 12 At that point I was feeling pretty discouraged about having worked in mental health for decades now and seen the revolving door. 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 19 All the stuff you talk about in your chapter, inaccessibility and the same things over and over that repetitive nature of things. 9 This is a continuous loop, barriers to access, unwelcoming, one size fits all, blaming the family, all the stuff. 9, 12, 15 I saw it and I saw it firsthand, I heard about it from clients over and over. 9, 10, 14 It's just like how long are we going to keep blaming the client for the system's failure? 10, 14, 17 I'd been trying to champion mental health person centered care for all of my career really. 5, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19 Mental health has been enormous strides towards moving toward a patient to patient recovery movement which is impactful. 12, 15, 19 I think we've come a long way in mental health in terms of making that a rehabilitative experience and much more person centered. 5, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19 We have a long way to go. 17, 18 But with drug and alcohol we were still stuck in the 50s. 5, 6 I guess in 2009, April basically given marching orders. 19 We opened that September and here we are today trying to recreate the system. 16 AS: Who would you say your marching orders come from in your epiphany?  PD: I think they're just universal.  AS: Something bigger than yourself.  PD: Yes.  I think I'm here to provide service and to give guidance. 19 I think that we all have access to that if we tap into that flow and listen, if we're willing to listen and be open. 9, 10 I think I appreciate you emphasizing that because I think that probably is what kind of keeps me going. 10, 15 I just trust that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing and we're doing the best we can.  AS: In the moment where we are. 8, 12, 14 PD: Exactly.  I'm not guided by fear; I'm not guided by liability or worry. 10 Let's just do the best we can to create an environment where people feel welcome and comfortable so they can get out of survival mode and start to open up and trust and heal. 9, 12 Whatever that looks like.  Do the best we can with that.  I just have an enormous confidence that if it all comes tumbling down then it’s time to do something else.  My survival doesn't rely on anything.  I trust that regardless I'll be okay.  I have two operating principles:  how's this going to read in the Star Tribune with big decisions? 14 Most times it reads fine. 11 It'll read okay.  How will it read?  That's kind of how we make decisions. 14 Most of what we do I think you can justify pretty clearly. 10 It doesn't fit the norms or the rules or always the safest routes but builds a hell of a good argument. 10, 12, 13, 15, 18 I can sleep with that and worst case scenario it all comes tumbling down, I'm going to be okay. 16, 17 There's other stuff to do.  That keeps us in the flow. 10, 15 When you're in the flow the universe helps you. 10 It just does.  AS: Were you raised in a religion at all? 14 Did your parents model this or did you kind of just get this as you grew? 20 My father's Catholic and he tried to impose it upon us but my mother she's a self-proclaimed atheist. 16 She didn't support him.  No way he's going to round up five kids and take care of it. 18, 19 There was this attempt at Catholicism but the closest we got to a church was the bingo hall probably. 9, 10 AS: So you didn't really have a formal religious education to speak of. 14, 15, 18 That's really interesting. 17, 18 Okay so 2009 you started Minnesota Alternatives. 14 Did you get your PhD?  PD: No. AS: You did not get your PhD.  Okay so tell me how did this come about?  You thought ""I'm going to open up my own clinic."" 17, 18 PD: I had been doing program development for a long time. 12, 17 My first job I was quickly into leadership roles and development programs. 10, 11, 12, 14 The state hospitals development programs and people incorporated my job as to develop programs. 8, 9, 11, 12 I know how to do it. 12 I know the rules. 12, 13 I know how to work the process of getting a program. 12, 17 I just kind of started networking to figure out where would be the best place to do it.  At that time, because of a rich history working in Anoka County it seemed like this would probably be the easiest place. 6, 15 That's where we started.  We started in Columbia Heights in 2009 and moved up here to expand in 2011, into Spring Lake Park. 7, 15 AS: Now we're talking about Minnesota Alternatives? 14 PD: Correct.  AS: Just for the record here.  PD: Minnesota Alternatives, that's what it's been ever since. 10, 14 The model has been evolving as we continue to get feedback from the clients about what's helpful and what's not helpful. 9, 10 We had a basic structure and the structure that we used was kind of drawing from my heroes. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16 Certainly William Anthony and person centered care. 5, 14, 19 Gabor Mate in terms of understanding trauma and attachment and the power of environment. 12, 14, 17, 18 I'm a fan of Mark Lewis, Joe Rispenza the concepts of being able to evolve your brain and looking at neuroplasticity and our capacities to harness, our ability to train our brains. 7, 13 Libhann has done a lot of skills and my training of Boston University was very skills based and helping people develop recovery visions, rehabilitation goals they call them. 9, 10, 13 Basically was a vision.  What does that vision look like?  What do we do to help you realize that vision?  Very person centered. 5 You decide and we help you figure out how to get there. 14 That's always the paradigm with which I've worked. 18 That continues to be the center of everything we do.  We build in more educational information about what's the best of the best and ways to help support people through a lot of trauma work for example and individual therapy. 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 Helping also with accountability.  If people need accountability we can do that too. 9 The system’s heavy on accountability that's not the piece that we emphasize but for a lot of people that's what they want. 6, 9 AS: The addiction treatment system? 12, 13, 14 PD: Absolutely.  Probation and addiction treatment are in bed together. 8, 12, 13, 14 That's just absurd how that developed.  We kind of think about these pillars of therapy and counseling and welcoming and comfortable and really priority on engagement. 12, 18, 19 Then we have education which hopefully is science based state of the art with a heavy emphasis on true informed decision making so that people know what the risks are. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 Let them know the opportunities and the risks and they get to decide. 12, 14, 19 Heavy emphasis again on harnessing the powers of neuroplasticity and then overcoming well-worn pathways from addictive behaviors or any behaviors that we've been caught in for a long time. 14, 17, 18 Support, education, and accountability. 14, 15 People really want accountability and we can do that. 18 We can do that if they need it.  That has been the goal for the last nine years, is to offer an alternative for people other than traditional treatment. 9, 12, 13, 14 Our program's open ended, people get to decide how long they come, how often they come, what they do while they're here. 9, 14, 17 If they want to just come for skills fine. 10, 11 If they want to stay for the process, the goal is that everything we offer people participate in because they find it helpful. 9, 17 AS: If the 12 Step program doesn't resonate with them you have other options.  PD: Yes, and if it does that's fine too. 11 A lot of people actually are working the 12 Step programs and coming here. 7, 9 They're not mutually exclusive.  AS: What about medication? 14 How have you approached that?  PD: We are not a provider of methadone but we have prescribers who can prescribe sabaxone and there are addiction psychiatrists who can prescribe sabaxone and or any other medications that help reduce recurrence or severity of recurrence. 5, 10, 12, 14 We're big proponents of medications if people want them. 8, 9, 14 We have found them to be incredibly helpful along with psychiatric medications. 5, 9, 14, 18 AS: Do you work in conjunction with methadone clinics?  Is there a continuum of care or do people have to have those separate services, can what they do here count for what they might have to do at let's say Valhalla? 9, 19 PD: Absolutely.  We work real closely. 9, 10 We have a lot of clients who are at Valhalla and so there’s release signed and then we coordinate the care. 10, 11, 14, 19 It works really well because a lot of the clients that we work that they're working with they're fairly complicated. 9, 10, 18 There might be a lot of complex medical issues involved as well. 7, 12, 13, 14 We bring in primary care. 19 Then we kind of work together in terms of how we can best support people. 8, 9, 17 It works so well because they several paradigms in terms of trying to reduce barriers to engagement and keep them coming. 5, 9, 12, 14, 17 And harm reduction. 5, 14 When people ask what your program philosophy, I don't throw out harm reduction because people think all kinds of things when you say that. 5, 9, 14 I say, we are person centered, meaning we embrace a whole range of goals from abstinence to harm and risk reduction. 5, 7, 14 People get to decide. 14 I think that idea, that people come because they find it helpful. 9 We teach skills on a regular training curriculum like you would go to college. 7, 10 If you demonstrate that if you get this you, you're integrating it then don't go to that class that day. 7, 16 You don't need to be there, it's not relevant to you.  If you want to go because you want the reinforcement because you learn through repetition, fine. 8, 10, 11, 12 If you want to go because you want to support your peers in learning and be an example, fine. 10, 11 You don't have to do stuff that you already know. 12 AS: It keeps people from feeling bored and resentful. 5, 9, 15 PD: Exactly.  Ironically what we find is that most people don't want to stop. 9 We have to push, gently encourage people out. 9 AS: They're feeling very heard and at home here. 9, 15 PD: Why would I stop coming to something that helps me grow? 10 Why would I stop?  You've got a good point. 10 We really try to validate that for people but we have services on site. 9, 13, 18, 19 As people are getting ready to go and have got it, they've really developed mastery, they have gained or regained control of their lives then we say, ""Why don't you start dabbling with some support services."" 9, 14, 18, 19 Just start going over there while you're still actively in treatment and check out some of the support services. 12, 13, 19 AS: But that you also offer here.  PD: Yes, through the non-profit. 15 Try those then that's what helps people. 9 AS: What do you offer there?  Are there names of programs? 16 PD: Yes.  AS: What are those called?  PD: There's a co-ed, these are all led by peer specialists these are people who have gone through some clinical cure specialist training. 9 There's a co-ed group on Monday nights they call it a peer support group. 16 Tuesday we offer group for family and loved ones based on CRFT, the Community Reinforcement Family Training. 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19 Wednesday they're gender specific. 16 There's a men and women's group. 12 Also peer support groups. 12 Thursday we have Smart Recovery. 16 Then Friday is movies and a meal. 16 You can just drop in from four to eight Monday through Friday and just hang out. 5, 11, 16 AS: Just be there.  PD: It's all anonymous.  There's no paperwork anybody needs to fill out. 5 We don't require that they prove that they have any kind of diagnosis. 6 It's free.  It's like an AA club in that way. 18 There is no expectation that you have to say anything about who you are.  There's no paperwork tracking you. 16 AS: This is a boring question but how are insurance companies dealing with this program? 10 PD: Well, really well. 18 Curiously, you'd think they'd start to say, ""You know what? 12 That has been there three years, I think it's time."" 14 We have yet to have an insurance company cut anybody off. 14 I think because it's outpatient care and they understand that. 11, 17, 18, 19 AS: It's counseling. 19 It could be one on one counseling and group therapy. 12, 19 Do you offer group therapy? 12 I think that because it's not five days a week, five hours a day people might come once a month. 9, 15, 16 People might come...  AS: Someone here is saying, they're here so they get billed?  PD: Absolutely.  The health insurance companies understand that substance use disorders on the severe end are not episodic, typically, and don't just kind of go away. 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 It's a long distance through the whole process. 17 It's a severe mental illness. 6, 12 Generally, people need to have the opportunity to move in and out of services fairly seamlessly if their acuity changes, if their needs change. 6, 9, 15, 19 To have a system that says, ""We'll hang in there with people long term as they go through the ups and downs of their illness and then keep them engaged."" 9, 12, 17 I think four years was our longest client. 10, 14, 17 The health plans, they're like, ""We love that. 14, 19 They're still engaged.  It's keeping them from more higher cost services or emergency rooms."" 7, 14, 17, 19 We're in network with all the health plans and I think if you ask most of them they say we're a good provider. 10, 19 AS: Did you have to sell this to health insurance companies or you just started it? 10, 19 PD: They were thrilled.  The health insurance companies are fed up with everybody getting the same old same old. 10, 19 AS: And relapsing.  PD: Not seeing any outcomes. 6 We've been measuring outcomes.  AS: That's at thirty, forty thousand dollars a pop.  PD: Exactly.  High cost and ineffectiveness.  We've been tracking outcomes from the beginning and we have really strong outcomes. 11, 16, 18 AS: Do you know those off the top of your head? 12, 14 You can give them to me later.  Probably close to sixty percent successfully complete. 9, 10, 14 That shows reduced use, it shows higher quality of life. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 17 It shows less consequences as a result of use. 6, 13, 17 It shows that they're making changes, moving along the process of change. 6, 10, 17 We've been doing twelve month follow up. 10, 16 It's ninety some, high ninety percent of people are out there living with reasonable to high quality of life and not problematic use. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 Probably half of them at any given time might still be using. 6, 14 We just did another big evaluation; we just did another big call to try to get twelve-month post follow up response in terms of how people are doing. 9, 10, 13, 16, 17 We've been able to get maybe close to two hundred people and they're doing really well. 5, 9, 10, 18 They're doing well.  We've been tracking outcomes from the beginning. 11, 16 We're just doing another, we have all our 2016 outcomes that are all being compiled and all the client feedback. 10, 14 Every time somebody is discharged we do an admission and discharge survey to assess these things pre and post and at twelve months. 11, 16 We have data. 13 When I went to a health insurance meeting and they have all these providers come and they're like, ""We want to talk about your outcomes"" and nobody had anything. 18, 19 They had admission and discharge stats but nobody was measuring...  AS: The other providers?  PD: Yes, they were like no clinical outcomes.  AS: How can they get away with that? 18, 20 PD: Exactly.  Right?  I got three minutes Amy. 15 Are we getting close? 9, 10 AS: Sure.  PD: I'm looking at this and we've kind of gone through most.  AS: I forgot to ask you.  PD: I got through most.  [Heavy machinery noise in background]  AS: Let's sit over here a bit. 20 Well it's only making a little bit of a buzz on here. 10, 20 I think we're still recording.  PD: I'm mostly curious about what it is. 12 AS: You talked about your best practices.  If you could predict something that would happen, something good to happen regarding addiction treatment what would it be? 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 Or change the system somehow what you see where there would just be a huge shift? 6, 8 What's going to take?  PD: I think we have a mental health system that we can use to model things after. 6, 12, 13, 19 Mental health has a lot of community based services. 13, 19 Therapists see people long term; you don't cut them off because they have problems with their symptoms. 6, 9, 12, 17 You should be able to see your counselor long term. 6, 17 You should be able to get wraparound services in your home if you need that level that would include a prescriber and a nurse and a counselor and a therapist. 10, 19 That you have prescribers who are available to you long term that when your symptoms become more severe they don't cut you off. 6, 10, 17 If you need outpatient programs that you should be able to move through them fairly quickly without having to go through complex assessments. 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 You should be able to stay engaged with them long term. 17 A much more robust peer support system so that we've got peer support centers.  AS: Places where people can go when they're struggling or just want to have company. 9, 14 PD: And have outreach workers too so that their peers can go out in people's homes and reach out. 9, 12, 19 AS: Really model it like much of what we do...  PD: With mental health. 12, 19 We should be able to do a lot of the medications in primary care. 14, 19 One of my big questions right now, and I'm working closely with Allina with this, is that we help support their primary care providers to provide medications to help reduce recurrence and that they really start to robustly serve this population. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19 The way that we can support them is that we kind of do these warm handoffs or agree to these long term partnerships. 9, 12, 17, 18 And say, ""If you've got someone that you see in your clinic and you're worried you call us. 6, 14 We'll go see that person. 6 We'll check in with them.  If you want us to monitor their medication, we'll come down to the clinic and get their meds."" 14 AS: Instead of having two separate silos that don't really communicate with each other. 18 More coordinated efforts between it.  PD: Absolutely and whether that's if we're co located which I think would be the logical thing to do, that we actually co locate right in the clinic. 7, 12 If they have somebody that they see and they want to refer them they can just send them down the hall and a very welcoming drug and alcohol or co trained mental health professional will start to talk with them about their needs. 5, 6, 12, 19 Then not assuming that everybody needs treatment but they would get referred to a mental health therapist or they just do some early intervention kind of prevention. 5, 10, 12, 13, 17, 19 There's a lot of people that come through the drop in. 5, 9, 11 I started talking to one of them and it’s like, ""You know what. 12 You don't need treatment. 12, 13 Here's a rethinking drinking booklet, here's some information on Naltrexone, here's some strategies. 5, 8, 11 Here's a screen so you can actually monitor when you've gone from recreational into problematic use. 6, 7, 12, 13 Here's actually the screen they would use to determine here's the symptoms and if you have two or more you're kind of moving into trouble. 6, 7, 13, 17 Look at all this.  Call me.""  A lot of people are like, ""Oh God that's so helpful."" 9 As opposed to ""You've got to come in and get this three-hundred-dollar assessment."" 12, 13 AS: And then go away for thirty days and disrupt your family. 12, 16, 18, 20 PD: Or this assumption that if you're an outpatient and you have a use episode that you need residential. 6, 9, 11, 13 That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard about. 9 You're in outpatient, you relapse, and then you have to head back in. 11, 14 PD: To residential. 9, 13 We accept goals other than abstinence because there's this whole theory of cross addiction that if once you have an alcohol problem you automatically have an opiate problem. 6, 12, 14 Or if once you have a cocaine problem you automatically have a cannabis problem. 12, 16 It's not founded.  It's inaccurate.  AS: It's not based in scientific evidence. 13 PD: It's not based in our neurophysiological capacity. 13 AS: The Minnesota Model, that's why you opened this place.  Is to offer something different.  PD: The other thing is I'm not trying to covet this.  I want this approach to be available to anybody who wants to try any parts of it. 9 I do lots of training. 16 I give information out.  I don't require that you go through these high cost trainings in order to use the stuff. 6, 7, 13 I wrote a book that's just very simple.  Take it, use any of it, any pieces of it you want. 6, 13 Call me.  The more that people just dabble with the ideas. 9, 18 If you're just starting to dabble with the idea of it, letting someone stay in your program without embracing that goal of abstinence and you feel a little bit uncomfortable about it call me and I can help give you some reassurance that it's going to be okay. 20 This is how you can cover your butt if this is what your concerns are.  It's happening. 15 There's lots of providers now that are lining up, if you will, starting to try different things. 12, 16 The response to this program has been overwhelming. 13 We cannot keep up.  We cannot even come close to keeping up. 9, 10 AS: How many people are you serving right now? 9, 12 PD: Probably one hundred.  AS: Then you're opening a second location in St. Paul. 10 When does that open?  PD: Hopefully in February. 14 At any given time, there's a waiting list which is awful. 11, 15 AS: But your capacity here is one hundred?  PD: Probably a little less, it's a smaller space. 20 AS: Thank you Paula.  PD: I just want to say.  Amy what I really appreciate about your article is I just want to comment that I really like your ideas about mothers feeling empowered to start to challenge the status quo. 5, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18 All the judgement that the system gives, the blaming the parent, and your comparison to having a child in the military. 12, 14, 20 All your energy is just wondering is this person going to make it through the day. 15, 16 Your priority is to preserve life. 10 At what point, how long can you do that? 17 Then it becomes your own survival questions.  AS: Which is what we talk about in the rooms in Nar Anon. 14 Okay my life is out of control now because of this. 10, 12, 18 And what you're saying is we don't have to get to that point.  PD: Right, hopefully not for sure. 9, 14 AS: It's what most people get to. 9 PD: How do we help support people? 9 AS: The addicts are told when they hit their bottom, then I'm going to funeral more often than I really care to. 9, 14, 16, 18, 19 For people who shouldn't be dead. 9, 16 PD: Absolutely.  We're also a distributor of NarCan too.  AS: Good.  PD: I just really recognize and appreciate how you package this in terms of really helping people understand what it is to be a parent of someone who is struggling to help preserve their life. 9, 10, 17, 18, 20 How do they stay well enough to survive that experience or even better how do they stay well enough to become an agent for change? 18 AS: Thank you for that compliment. 12 That means a lot to me.  I really respect what you're doing here. 18 I wish I'd known of you some years ago. 11, 12, 13, 14 How it's unfolded is how it's unfolded.  She's alive and doing well, thriving with medication assisted treatment I should say. 12, 13, 14 PD: That's good. 10 AS: It's been a lifesaver. 10 I'm the preacher for it. 10 I tell anybody.

"19","Holman_Deb","Sue Purchase Part 2 Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 9, 2017  At the Home of Amy Sullivan Minneapolis, Minnesota Sue Purchase -SP Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan this is part two interview with Sue Purchase. 9 We’re in my house in Minneapolis on May ninth. 6, 13 Sue do you give me permission again?  SP: I absolutely give you permission Amy.  AS: Thank you dear.  I think we were around 2001.  If you want to go back a little further we can definitely start. 9, 20 I didn’t listen to the very end to find out where we were.  You were the director of Women With a Point from 1996 to ‘99? 12, 18, 19 I resigned in 2001. 11 AS: We did start talking about the Fit Pack and you started to work in Australia.  I talk about the Fit Pack with the disposal project that we did? 5 I don’t know but go ahead. 12, 14 SP: It ties in nicely with really raising awareness around harm reduction, the importance of certainly access to clean syringes. 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 18 Some of the terminology was starting to change, rather than syringe exchange it would be syringe access. 9, 10, 17 There were more sources available for syringes for people actively using illicit drugs. 5, 6, 9 We had the pharmacy project going with four area pharmacies. 5, 8 One was in South Minneapolis on 26th and Nicollet.  I can’t remember the name of it.  They had two locations.  That one and then there was one on Lake Street, really well known. 11, 12, 18 Then we had one on the West Side of St. Paul where there was predominately a Latino population, lots of heroin. 5, 10, 16 There was one on the East Side of St. Paul, more of white working class, methamphetamine. 6, 7, 8 Then we had a pharmacy, I think it was Merwin Drug over on the North Side of Minneapolis.  This project involved community based pharmacists selling, they could sell the Fit Pack. 5, 13, 14, 19 The personal sharps container came packed with a ten pack of syringes and there was a mailing card.  There was a research component attached to it. 8 It had a sticker on the front that we had designed that really talked about safe injecting, safe disposal, and harm reduction message. 5, 11, 13, 14, 18 Then people were involved in that. 9 I can’t remember exactly how it all came about.  Participants at the storefront would participate in a survey; they got a t-shirt that had art on it that was designed by a program participant. 9, 11 It was of a demon being shot out of a syringe with flames behind it. 11 It was a circular image, red and yellow and very vibrant. 5, 10 In a really interesting font it said, “Be Blood Aware. 17, 18 Better Safe Than Sorry.”  We had this whole disposal awareness campaign. 9 Through that what we learned was how pharmacies were participating with users, what the cost of syringes were. 6, 9, 10, 13 The one on 26th and Nicollet oftentimes charged five dollars a ten pack. 8 They didn’t want active drug users in their pharmacies. 5, 6, 13 AS: Was that more money than they should have been charging? 8, 10 SP: Yes.  Syringes wholesale are seventy cents apiece or they were at the time.  You’d get ten of them in a pack.  With pharmacy access laws you were allowed to buy a ten pack but you couldn’t buy more than that at a time. 9, 10, 13 Seventy cents wholesale being sold for five dollars a ten pack.  Their policy around that was based on appearance. 13 If you appeared to be somebody buying syringes for illicit purposes you paid five bucks. 5 If you were a diabetic I think it was three dollars.  There was a price break.  That was interesting, not a surprise. 17 The pharmacy on the North Side of Minneapolis they were asking for identification and limiting the number of visits that a person could have to a pharmacy.  Really deterrents around enactment, on the surface it was really great to have pharmacy access but there were glitches in the system. 9, 12, 18, 20 This project the aim was to help alleviate those glitches, get more uniform policies throughout pharmacies, and give access to people, address safe disposal. 5, 9 AS: Was this a grant funded project? 5, 8 SP: It was a grant funded project. 5, 8 AS: With Access Works?  SP: Access Works with the Minnesota Department of Health. 9, 12 It was titled the Better Safe Than Sorry Disposal Proposal.  AS: We have those documents. 12, 14 SP: Yes, exactly.  That got funded and really created another level of awareness. 8, 9, 18 Working with participants, participants are more involved. 9 The project, although the research component of it was never fully completed, we worked in collaboration with Sarah Riebeckie and Seth Wells from the University of Minnesota. 5, 7, 8, 14, 16 I’m not sure whatever really happened with the data there. 13, 15, 18 Sarah might know something more about it. 12 There was that and that project was also replicated throughout New York City. 5 At the time the big move was pharmacy access for drug users. 5, 6, 9, 13, 15 Not all pharmacies in Minnesota wanted to participate. 9, 18 It was a voluntary thing.  Disposal had never been adequately addressed for pharmacists to feel real comfortable with selling syringes. 5, 16 With the idea that people would bring their used syringes back? 6, 9, 13, 16 SP: That there would be this personal sharps container.  The pharmacists were handing the syringes out within this ten pack and so they felt better. 11 The ten pack was in the Fit Pack.  They were handing out a disposal mechanism with the syringes so they felt better about that with the sense that discarded syringes weren’t going to be left laying on the ground. 11, 14 AS: Do you throw the whole Fit Pack away? 18, 20 SP: The Fit Pack can be thrown in the garbage.  AS: The whole thing when you’re done with those ten?  SP: Yes or it could have been brought back to the needle exchange. 10 There were so many valuable aspects to the Fit Pack in that it also created a much more positive relationship with law enforcement. 8, 12, 13, 19 People who were on the streets having some encounter with a cop, they didn’t have to worry about patting them down and that they’re going to accidentally get a needle stick because they were carried safely. 10, 13 It also provided a level of safety for the user because the dirty ones were going down inside, one way flap. 6, 8, 9, 13, 18, 19 You can’t get them out.  No one wants to stick their finger down there so that residue that will get people a felony when they’re trying to return used syringes to a needle exchange, that’s where some of the rub comes in. 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16 You want them returned but oftentimes people can’t hold on to them for fear of prosecution, something’s going to happen. 9, 10, 15 It was a win, win situation in that way. 18 It was a great project. 5, 20 It really raised awareness. 9, 14, 18 A lot of education happened that way not only for community pharmacies but for the individual user. 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 Much more in a sense activism really a big part of Access Works was always about engaging and educating program participants, everybody, about whether it was know your rights, safe disposal, how do you write to your congressperson. 9, 12, 14, 18 In the storefront there was a room and all the walls were pretty bare. 10, 14 I think I bought two hundred dollars’ worth of posters and postcards from Northern Sun.  It was fantastic because we created this collage on the wall. 14 People would come look at them and ask about them and the quotes.  It was such a wonderful opportunity to educate and open a mind and put forth other ideas. 14, 18, 19 We had letter writing campaigns.  We had the nuns; they had Peace House on Franklin. 6, 13 Are you familiar? 8 They used to protest at the School of Americas. 6, 13, 16 What were their names? 16 They’re the Sisters of Carondelet.  I’m going to blank it out, I should know it so well. 12 They came and did stuff.  We had voter’s rights; the women’s users group had the League of Women Voters. 6, 12, 13 We did so many educational opportunities on a variety of topics. 14, 15, 19 AS: To just engage people who came through the door. 9 SP: Yes, an informed consumer. 14 AS: When we talk with Rae later we can go into what you guys did together and that stuff. 8 Do you want to focus on your life for this? 10 If you want to.  AS: So after you went to work for Fit Pack what’s been going on in your life since? 10 SP: I went to work for Fit Pack and I worked for them until 2004, 2005.  AS: Did you leave the cities? 7, 18 I moved to Tacoma, Washington. 7, 15 My husband 14 Dave ran a program in Tacoma.  Kind of a twofold, he had a needle exchange, it was the first publicly funded legal needle exchange in the United States. 8, 10, 14, 19 AS: How did you meet Dave? 18 SP: Everybody knew Dave Purchase. 16 AS: But how did you meet him? 18 SP: I met him at a conference.  I met him at the first harm reduction conference in Oakland, California. 5, 14 AS: Do you remember the year? 14 I thought he was a showboat. 17, 18 AS: What do you mean by that?  SP: Well Dave was a presence. 10 I thought that he was just a little too full of himself, met him there. 14, 17, 18, 20 Had to have a conversation with him about...  Dave had the needle exchange in Tacoma but he also had a larger national organization. 10 It was the North American Syringe Exchange Network, NASEN is the acronym.  NASEN involved technical assistance for startup needle exchange programs in the United States and other places in the world. 10 It had a buyers club for needle exchange programs. 10 It had a grants program.  Then I can’t remember if it was an annual conference or every two years Dave put on a conference. 14 He was a really well-known figure. 11, 12, 18 Dave was instrumental in starting all the New York programs. 12 He worked throughout the country. 14, 19 He worked throughout the world, programs in Hawaii and Vietnam and Puerto Rico, everywhere.  He’s this larger than life figure. 10 I think he’s arrogant and annoying.  I have to do business with him.  AS: Somehow a romance developed?  SP: Not so much.  Then a year goes by. 14 I had to apply for money with him. 8, 10 The needle exchange pots of dollars were so few and far between you didn’t not apply. 6, 10 I had to apply for money from him. 8, 10 I didn’t get funded. 8 I remember calling him on the phone and saying, “What’s the deal? 8, 16 Where’s my money? 8, 10 Why didn’t I get some?”  Out of that he sent me a little money for needle exchange. 5, 8, 10, 20 I remember then Dave was self-described as glib and he was.  He’d make some comment like, “Oh darling you should marry me and take me away from all of this.” 12, 18, 20 Then some time goes by.  I don’t know if it’s later that year but I’m at a drug policy conference in New Orleans and in the opening reception. 5, 6, 10, 12, 14 I think I was with my colleague Toni.  We’re standing at the bar. 14 I look across the room and I say, “Oh no Dave Purchase is coming across the room. 14 Let’s move.” 15 We said hello.  Later that night, Dave used to hold court in the bar, everybody was there. 6, 13, 14, 16 This was harm reduction in the United States. 5, 14 All these people who are the old timers now were young, having a conversation with him in the bar. 9, 12 It was a good conversation, it was an interesting conversation. 10, 14, 17 He wasn’t annoying.  It was enjoyable.  Then there was an attraction.  The conference goes on.  I don’t know what the hell he had said to me. 12 The last day or something he said there was a spark between us. 16 I don’t remember how I responded to that.  He was going on to Denver to another harm reduction conference. 5, 14 I was going home to Minneapolis.  I think I had told him that I’d lived in Colorado for years. 7, 14, 16 He had a sister that lived up in the mountains. 7, 20 He sent me a card that said something like, “Proof of purchase to follow.” 5, 10 I think he sent me some Fat Tire beer in the mail. 5 You couldn’t get it in Minnesota.  That’s when it said, “Proof of purchase to follow.” 10 He was coming to visit.  That was the proof of Purchase.  And visit he did.  What a human being, certainly human. 8, 17, 19 We had an amazing relationship for about nine years, travelled, worked together, my confidante, his confidante. 8, 9, 14, 19 We lived in Tacoma, Washington and he ran a program. 7 I had run a program. 8 I had run a much more progressive, comprehensive program. 8, 10 Dave had started a needle exchange and it didn’t really expand beyond where it was in 1988, on the corner of 14th and G Street. 10, 14, 18 Minnesota offers a lot of services. 19 Minnesota is hospitable.  Tacoma is not hospitable.  It’s the West Coast and there’s black tar heroin. 16 Tacoma was built on Indian burial grounds and I think the spirits were revolting.  I worked on the corner of 14th and G Street in a van. 14 The Tacoma Needle Exchange has a very strict one for one policy.  They might still have a strict one for one policy. 8 Dave created that policy when he was being glib with People magazine.  He got all this attention, it’s the late 80s and it’s a new thing in the United States. 16 Dave answered off the cuff and it became policy. 5, 14 Working at the needle exchange, if somebody didn’t come with a used syringe they weren’t supposed to get a clean one. 6, 8, 10, 13, 16 That program was constantly under the gun.  The people of Tacoma weren’t fond of the needle exchange at all. 9, 10 They were always looking to shut it down. 18 It was located on the corner of 14th and G Street is the Catholic Worker community. 14, 19 There’s St. Leo’s, the Catholic Church sits right above with the hospitality kitchen. 8, 12 There is Father Bicks who is in charge of stuff.  He was a Jesuit priest who used to protest at School of Americas all of this stuff. 6, 13, 16, 20 Bicks was an amazing human. 9, 19 There’s the Guadalupe House on the other corner and all the Catholic Workers. 6, 13 There is Joe the nurse who works at the medical clinic at St. Leo’s. 7, 9, 14 There’s a one for one policy.  There are people in the neighborhood who spy. 9, 20 People, in order to have a clean syringe, a sterile syringe had to dig around in the dirt, they had to dig around in the grass, they had to find a piece of a plunger.  They had to find evidence of a syringe and bring it.  Dave had people working for him that were very obedient but that wasn’t me. 9 I was a game changer at the exchange. 10 They’d come on Fridays and I’d say, “Five can get you ten.” 16 It wasn’t going to be a strict one for one. 8 I wasn’t going to be stupid about it but it wasn’t a policy I could abide by.  There was tension.  The black tar heroin, the sex workers, on the West Coast the amount of homeless with people sleeping outside in the jungle. 9, 12, 16, 19 AS: What do you mean by the jungle?  SP: The jungle was...you know Almond Roca candy? 12 It comes out of Tacoma, Washington.  So did Ted Bundy and the D.C. sniper.  As we go on I’m sure I’ll remember some other highlights. 7 Behind the Almond Roca factory, you know Seattle, Tacoma; the Northwest is really green and lush. 12, 18 Bushes, trees, you name it.  Behind the Almond Roca there was the I-5 that goes through there.  There was this big area, wooded under the freeway and behind the factory that was called the jungle that was the homeless camp. 8, 18 It was huge and dangerous and dirty. 11 There are sex workers; there was the Green River killer. 12, 19 At the needle exchange I took the bad date report. 10, 13 SP: The bad date report was for women who were sex workers. 12, 13, 19 If they had a bad date they could report it to us and we compiled a weekly bad date sheet so we would hand it out at the van for other working girls so they would know who to be aware of. 7, 11, 12, 13, 15 It might be so and so got picked up.  She was raped at knife point and thrown out of a truck at Tacoma  Avenue or something, some story around that. 15 We would compile that.  I’d take those reports. 13 There’s also SOAP and SODA laws in Tacoma. 13 There is in Seattle as well, in many places in the United States.  SOAP stood for “Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution” and SODA stood for “Stay Out of Areas of Drug Abuse.” 6, 13 If you had a crime, you’d had a drug crime you couldn’t be in those areas. 5, 6, 8, 20 All social services, all low income housing, the needle exchange, all of it are in these areas. 6, 8, 10, 19, 20 Most of Tacoma are SOAP and SODA areas. 8, 20 You could only be there between nine and eleven, nine and twelve, ten and twelve that you could be there to do your business.  Otherwise you were subject to arrest and brought back to jail.  The correctional system is a revolving constant.  AS: I’ve never heard of that before. 9, 16 SP: That’s a longer story too. 15, 17 We would help women escape the cops. 12 They’d be there looking for them.  They’d cruise the needle exchange. 10 I had several encounters with law enforcement. 8, 12, 13 The point of the needle exchange is not only that people get sterile supplies but also they can get some help with housing, they might need an ID, they might want to go to treatment, they might want to get on methadone. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 All of that takes time. 17 That’s the work we did there.  It’s long and complicated. 17 That was work that I brought there that had never been done there in the past. 16 It kept people hanging out at the van. 9 There were complaints about that in the neighborhood. 20 There was a dude named Wes who worked up at the hospitality kitchen and he liked to take pictures of the people who were participants at the needle exchange and then he would deny them food. 8, 9, 10 There was one woman in particular that I remember. 9 There’s MRSA going around, a drug resistant staph infection, eighty five to ninety percent of the participants had MRSA. 5, 6, 9 Abscesses, wounds that you wouldn’t even begin to believe.  There was one woman who was intent on saving her life and get a clean syringe. 10 She’d risk everything to come and get it.  She’d have to shoot dope on the fly.  Dope sick, got to get your fix, got to earn money, all those things that it takes to survive. 8, 10, 15, 17 The whole top of her arm, the left arm, was eaten away by an abscess. 14, 18, 20 You didn’t have to worry about finding a vein.  You could load it up and put it through your clothes and stick it in your arm while you’re moving and hiding from the cops.  Those sorts of situations I see more and more and more. 6 Dave and I have disagreements. 12 AS: Had you seen things as bad as that in Minneapolis? 6 AS: It was worse in Tacoma.  SP: Oh my God it was way, way worse. 18 SP: Yes and Minnesota didn’t necessarily have black tar heroin, they had China white. 16, 19 Black tar is nasty.  People would transport it under their fingernails; maybe it’s in their pussy. 5, 17 However you don’t get busted.  You think about all the bacteria and you’re shooting it. 6 The health risks are huge. 19 I would help sex workers evade the cops. 12, 19 I’d drive to the site. 5 I’d put them in my car, drive up around the block and drop them off so they wouldn’t get arrested. 5, 11 I brought people to clinics. 9 I went to meetings. 18 I talked.  I spoke up.  AS: This rubbed Dave the wrong way? 11, 18 SP: Yes.  It began to certainly he was getting more flak from the community because there’s more presence at the exchange. 8, 10, 17, 19 All the participants loved me. 9, 14 They showed up.  “Go see Sue. 6 She’ll hook you up.  She’ll help you out.”  I’m seeing all this stuff and I’ve got things going on in my personal life at the same time. 6, 10 AS: Were you married to Dave? 7 SP: We got married in 1999. 7 There’s so much that’s happening. 15 One of the things that happens towards the end, there’s a woman named Valerie. 15 She’s a Native woman.  She’s trying so hard to get her life together and get on track. 8, 9, 10, 16 She wants to go home to her family at the Flathead Indian Reservation. 12, 14 Montana is close to Washington. 9, 10 You get a lot of tribes. 12 She got shot in the head one block down on Faucet. 11, 14 Shot in the head and killed. 14 All I remember saying to Dave is, “Every social service provider in this town has blood on his hands, including you.” 17, 19 I had expectations of Dave.  I believed that he should be doing certain things a certain way. 14, 17, 18 He should have built that program and moved it along and been responsive to the needs of the community and he was not. 7, 15, 17, 19 I lost respect for him. 11 Then there was somebody else.  There was something else that had happened, which I can’t remember right now. 12, 15 I met a woman named Linda.  This is a story about stigma. 9, 15 Linda had lived on the streets for fifteen years in Tacoma. 5, 7, 14 She was beautiful when she was young.  She was from Montana.  She had kids that she was estranged from. 7 She did sex work to survive. 12 She had seizure disorder. 13 She would go to the medical clinic up at St. Leo’s. 7, 14 The nurse that ran St. Leo’s medical clinic was on the Catholic Worker community, Joe. 7, 14, 19 Joe had been a medic in the Vietnam War. 14 He had a heart of gold. 9 He understood what happened with people on the street and how hard it was. 9, 15 How I met Joe and I met Linda is they came to the van one day. 16 He explained what was going on with Linda and her seizures and she couldn’t hold on to her medicine and was always disappearing. 12, 14, 18 People like seizure medicine. 12, 14 You can get high on it. 7 The arrangement is I would hold on to Linda’s medication and she’d come by the van every morning to get them. 7, 12, 14 Linda wasn’t much of an injection drug user. 5, 6, 13 She was a crack smoker. 16 This arrangement worked for a while. 7, 12 I make sure that every day Linda gets one pill in her mouth. 16 It happens for a week, two weeks, a month. 15, 16 Then Linda disappears.  I don’t think much of it.  I hold on to the meds.  Then there’s this dude named Troy.  Troy comes by the van a lot, a good guy. 10 He’d come by and he’d say, “Sue, Linda got housed.” 6, 13, 16 I’m like, “That’s awesome.  That’s really awesome.” 18 He’d be like, “You should go visit her.”  I’m like, “Yes I should.  Then he comes by and he tells me that she has cancer and she doesn’t have long to live. 10, 15, 17 He really wants me to visit her. 18 I agree.  Troy and Linda had been friends years before. 14, 16, 20 I don’t remember what Linda told me. 16 Troy had a reputation on the streets for slashed throats. 5 The streets are rough. 5 He’s kind of funny. 9 He gave me this beautiful hand knit scarf.  He liked me.  He and Linda had had some issues. 12, 13 They got along. 17 They were friends, they were close. 9, 10, 16, 20 I finally go to visit Linda.  Her belly is really distended, she had liver cancer. 10, 18 Linda had been living with AIDS for twenty years. 14 She’d gotten housed for the last six months of her life. 6, 10, 11, 13, 16 She had this boyfriend. 7, 20 What the fuck was his name.  I can picture him in my brain. 13 I don’t think much of the guy.  She’s got a son in prison.  She’s got this guy as a boyfriend. 7, 20 Linda likes to smoke crack. 16 I go over and meet her. 18 We talk.  I meet her daughter in law, I leave. 13, 18 Somehow I get in the mix with Linda.  I started checking on her; make sure she has her meds. 14 She loved to smoke cigarettes and she loved to smoke crack. 14, 16 Somehow in there we had an agreement. 12 She needed some care; I could help out with it. 14, 19 I knew she smoked crack. 14, 16 I’m like, “Here’s the deal.  I don’t care.” 19 We became very close and I ended up helping her with the help of Joe the nurse and Linda’s boyfriend, we helped her die at home. 7, 9, 10, 20 It’s a longer story. 15, 17 It was representative of the stigma, the lack of services, and the lack of caring for people who were homeless, strung out, and had been drug users in Tacoma. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 19 There was no harm reduction there. 5, 14 There was a needle exchange. 10 Needle exchange is a strategy that reduces harm but it does not mean that it’s done with compassion or with any sort of insights or care. 5, 10, 14, 19 It simply exchanges a syringe on a good day. 6, 10, 16 The marriage ended after that, not long after that. 14, 17 I moved back to Minnesota in 2007. 7, 15 Before I leave Tacoma Rae wants to leave Access Works. 18 Her computer had been stolen and she had had enough.  AS: We’ll have to have that story tonight. 15 SP: We’ll pick up there with Rae.  I went back to Minnesota.  She had called me saying, “Do you want the organization back?”  I said, “No, not necessarily.”  I was burnt out on needle exchange. 10 I was burnt out period. 18 AS: It takes so much energy to do it the way you were doing it, with more harm reduction model than just needle exchange. 5, 10, 14, 17, 18 SP: It takes a lot. 17 The idea behind needle exchange is it builds a bridge to other services. 10, 19 AS: It’s a part of harm reduction but it’s not the only part. 5, 9, 14 SP: Right.  I take it back on a temporary basis.  I was shocked by what had happened there, what had changed. 13, 14, 15 The program certainly was booming when I left but by the time I get back, this is four years later; there are youngsters there that are from the suburbs. 8, 14, 17 Pills are plentiful.  People are coming through the door.  AS: You’re saying the users changed, the people who came through the door between 2004 and 6, 9, 13 SP: Yes, it’s like the fall of 2007.  They’re younger, they’re from the suburbs, and they don’t look like they belong there. 17, 20 They are there looking to hook up.  AS: They’re there looking for heroin because their pills are too expensive or not available. 16 SP: Yes.  They’ve got a habit. 20 They’re coming to the needle exchange. 10 I’m looking around in part in disbelief of what I had created there. 9 It was working.  It was a drop in center. 5, 11 We had active drug users providing services across the board. 5, 6, 13, 19 We had people shooting dope in the bathroom. 6, 9, 14 We had kids…  AS: This is what was happening there that hadn’t been happening before. 15 SP: Not to the degree.  It was always a struggle because it’s harm reduction. 5, 14, 18 Even prior to me leaving people would dump off bodies that had overdosed. 9 They weren’t dead but they’d drop them off at our back door. 5, 11, 16 They knew we were a safe place. 16 I can’t even begin to tell you all of the stuff.  All of the reasons that that space served communities. 14, 19 There were funerals for people who were infected with HIV through injection drug use, had worked in the community and had died. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 19 Robert Preston, his was there.  The intention is always that it would be normalized community. 14, 16, 18, 19 That people, all people, were viewed as part of the community and welcomed if they wanted to come there. 9, 14, 18, 19 It was astounding.  There’s this safety issue. 13, 19 I think I showed you the sign that says, “Please don’t shoot dope in our bathroom, if you must please use the sharps container.” 6, 11, 13, 14 People would put syringes down the toilet.  We had wraparound services in there. 19 Rae can talk more about that from her experience in terms of being hired and what she had implemented in my absence. 5, 12, 17, 18 It was working and it was working well.  It had changed. 13 You could see certainly the increase in drug use. 5, 6, 8, 13, 17 During that time in that transition period with Rae and I, we’re getting Narcan brought in with a doctor, Jim Hervenco. 12, 14, 17, 18 I can’t remember what days we had the clinic and how the training happened. 15, 16 He wrote the prescription. 10 People had Narcan the first day that we had it. 14, 16 One of the outreach workers, Tommy Stevens, he had run in the front door of the drop in and said someone in two buildings over had overdosed. 5, 8, 11, 12, 19 I think he had fallen behind a couch.  Tommy Narcaned him, brought him out, saved a life, just that quick. 10 It was absolutely amazing. 9 I’m burnt out; Rae’s burnt out and has moved on. 7, 15 The board isn’t particularly affective. 9 Fundraising is difficult. 5, 10 I want out.  I didn’t like working with them.  I’m fried.  In my own life at the time I had friends dying of cancer. 10, 16, 20 My mother had died and suicides among friends, countless overdose deaths in Tacoma. 16, 18, 20 There were at least ten overdose deaths in Tacoma in the year that I was working at the exchange there, the woman who got shot in the head, Linda dying. 10, 11, 14, 18 AS: You’re just surrounded by trauma.  SP: Surrounded by it.  I remember sitting in there thinking...I’d gotten a divorce.  People continued to tell me one sad story after another. 15 AS: You’re off the chart for that list where you have to make a point for everything.  SP: I couldn’t be there anymore.  I didn’t have the magic to save that organization. 10 I think Rae had been in discussions somehow with MAP. 8 I don’t remember how that happened. 15 I’m like vehemently opposed to MAP having that program. 12 What happens is that they hire this woman… 15 AS: She did say, “We took over your program.”  SP: Yes she did, fucking bitch. 20 There was a woman named Laurie Wolner who was hired as the executive director. 5, 18, 19 Laurie Wolner had been a case director at MAP for many years, a terrible reputation, not nice to people, all sorts of things. 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 She shuts it down.  She decides to close. 9, 10, 14 They tell people it’s a funding issue. 9, 13 Lorraine Teal could see the writing on the wall. 6 She wanted money for her program, her needle exchange. 8, 10, 18 During the history of Access Works there were times... 15 Dave’s needle exchange conference was in Minneapolis in 2000. 10 We had honored Dave. 5 He had beat cancer. 10 People came from all over the world for this conference. 14 MAP was there.  Bob Tracy was there.  He talked how MAP had deemphasized needle exchange. 10 There were grants that we had written that MAP plagiarized.  I knew people. 9, 16 I had friends that were the founders. 16, 20 They read my applications.  I think it may have been Dave.  He’d read my applications.  He read MAP’s application and recognized my program description. 17 They had taken my stuff and plagiarized.  AS: How did they get it?  SP: How did they get my program?  AS: How did they get copies of your grant proposals?  SP: A lot of it was public information. 19 You’d have access. 9 There was always competition for it. 18 In the beginning of Women With a Point, prior to funding through the Health Department, we’d want to have a collaborative relationship with MAP. 9, 11, 12, 19 We don’t have the budget, they’ve got it and we’re disposing the syringes we’re collecting with Minnesota AIDS Project.  They get to have our numbers.  Numbers matter for grant opportunities. 19 They got to count our numbers.  The first year in what I didn’t think was a successful year; it’s a brand new program. 14, 16 We exchanged ten thousand syringes. 10, 13 I don’t remember what MAP had exchanged, four thousand or something. 10, 13 It’s significantly higher. 7, 11, 17 We start getting funding and we’re doing our own disposal.  MAP can’t count our numbers anymore.  Competition stiffens.  In Minnesota for funding competition is everything.  It’s a competitive process. 17 They don’t encourage collaboration.  It’s a dog eat dog.  Lorraine is nothing if not competitive.  She can see Women With a Point and Access Works becoming the hottest gig in town. 6, 12 Everybody talked about it and we got more and more money. 8, 10 AS: You did get Ryan White funds.  SP: We got Ryan White funds, we got directly funded CDC grant. 8, 18 We were the first needle exchange program in the United States to have a directly funded CDC grant when federal funding for needle exchange was illegal. 8, 10, 14, 18 It was a coup.  She resented every bit of it. 5, 20 Opportunity knocked at her door. 19 They got it and they shut us down.  Access Works went away. 18, 20 That’s directly attributed to Lorraine Teal, without a doubt in my mind. 18 SP: I started Morpheus Project in Minneapolis.  It was a brief intervention needle exchange program with Lee Hurtle. 10, 19 I have to leave Minnesota. 18 At the time my best friend is dying of cancer. 10, 20 I was really in Minnesota because she was here dying of cancer not because I really wanted to live in Minnesota. 10, 18 My youngest son was still in high school and graduating. 7 I came back.  I ran Morpheus Project, distributed Narcan.  I really ran a needle exchange out of my house. 6, 10, 13, 18 I worked for Simpson Housing. 6 They wanted a harm reduction housing program for women. 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 They thought they’d hire me. 17, 18 It was a brand new start up program. 16 It had amazing potential. 6, 9 I had eighty five percent of my case load were chronically homeless native women. 6, 12, 14, 17 It was good work. 10 It was really good work. 10, 18 For me that was a slacker job. 11 I’m losing my shit. 18 AS: What do you mean?  SP: Mentally I’m struggling.  I’m in grief.  My friend Lisa had died. 20 Her son Grant had died from a suicide a year and a half before that. 14 It was just so much death. 18 My sister Dianne died. 20 I’m sure there were others, friends, overdoses in Minnesota. 16, 20 I know a lot of people. 9, 12 Simpson Housing, we have a parting of the ways. 6, 9, 18 I bug out.  I saw the Dalai Lama on Mother’s Day of 2011.  I’d been in grad school. 7 I was going to do an MBA on strategic planning and using a harm reduction model. 5, 6, 14 I had it all figured out in my head how it could work. 5, 14 I thought it would be a good place for me because it’s a liberal catholic women’s college. 7, 10, 12, 17, 18 It wasn’t quite liberal enough for me. 11 That went south.  I flunked out of grad school. 7 All through school I’d had a 4.0. 7 I just couldn’t keep it together anymore. 8 I sold all my shit, took all my stuff, brought my Buddha to Rae’s house. 6, 13, 18 I have a two hundred and fifty pound sandstone Buddha and he travels with me.  He had to go to Rae’s house for a while. 6, 13 Then he was over at a meditation center in St.  Paul for a while.  I retrieved him in 2013 when I moved to Georgetown. 7, 15 I had been in therapy and diagnosed with PTSD. 12 Drugs had become a problem in a way that was reminiscent of early days. 12, 16, 18 So I left. 14 I got rid of all my shit except for like two crates. 18 I brought those down to a friend’s house in St. Louis, stayed there for a bit, got healthier. 6, 13, 19, 20 Then I went to Colorado.  I went to the mountains.  My daughter is there and things aren’t good with her. 10 She’s in and out of jail and precariously housed at that point. 6, 10, 13, 16 She steals all my money. 8, 10 It’s just really hard. 9, 18 I worked at Loveland Ski Area for a season.  Then I got in my car and I drove to San Francisco and stayed there for a while. 5 I couch surfed and got my car towed on 4/20 in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood. 20 It’s kind of a funny story. 9, 15 I went down to Tucson, stayed with friends. 16, 20 Went back up to Seattle and stayed with friends there. 16, 20 In the fall I went back to Colorado and started therapy. 12 I’ve been there ever since. 10 Morpheus Project—for whatever reason I can’t not do needle exchange. 10 I have Rocky Mountain Morpheus Project up there, this fledgling little stellar mountain needle exchange program at the continental divide. 10, 20 My last real effort in developing a program in that way. 18 During my days of couch surfing I volunteered with the Berkeley needle exchange program which is called NEED. 5, 10, 16 I’ve worked at needle exchange programs and volunteered throughout the country. 5, 10, 14, 19 For that I am so grateful.  It’s an honor in ways that many people don’t understand. 9, 17, 18 What Dave liked about me and what he saw from the very beginning was that I got it. 11 Should we talk anymore about my personal life? 10 AS: You don’t have to say her name but could you tell me about the person who you brought to the harm reduction summit and what you were doing for her for those days? 5, 14, 16 I don’t want you to say her name because I don’t have her permission but if you could just tell me.  SP: I know her because I know her mother. 12 AS: Is that connected in any way to your harm reduction work? 5, 14, 18 SP: I’m always taking care of somebody. 11, 18, 19 My last big save or something before I bugged out is that I knew that she needed to leave the reservation. 10, 16, 18, 19 AS: Bugged out when?  SP: When I left Minneapolis. 14 She was struggling on a reservation in South Dakota. 19 She came to Minneapolis and lived with me for a few months. 7, 11, 16 I had gotten to know her through her mom. 12, 14 She would show up periodically in Minneapolis. 14, 18 She wasn’t necessarily living on a reservation then, she was somewhere else. 19 The first time I met her I picked her up at the emergency room at HCMC because she’d been down in the Franklin, Nicollet area and someone had stabbed her in the head with a screw driver. 5, 8, 14 Her mom needed her to be picked up at HCMC which is frequently referred to as the chop shop. 5, 14, 15, 17 I picked her up there.  That was the beginning of us knowing one another. 11, 12 She would periodically come and go out of Minneapolis. 14, 18 I always kept track with her mom. 14, 16, 18 She’d come and stay with me.  She had some things happen on the reservation that were awful. 11, 15, 19 She came to Minneapolis, she went to treatment. 12, 13 She’s been here ever since. 10 She was always a drinker in the past. 5, 18 She’s got a meth habit. 6, 20 She is a community theater performer on homelessness and telling her story. 15, 19 Everybody wants to hear a good homeless tragic story for whatever reason. 9, 10, 15 She talks about her hopes, her dreams, things that she’d like to do. 5, 9 She’d like to be a nurse.  She has an uncle who works for the tribe in South Dakota and does amazing work and they’re really close. 9, 10, 18 She wants to do work like her uncle does.  She’s got some stuff to work through.  I brought her up to White Earth with me.  I thought it would be a good environment for her, we’d have quality time. 10, 12, 17, 18 She’s got an apartment; she’s got a place to live. 5, 9, 11, 12 She’d be with some supportive people. 9, 19 She’ll tell you that telling her story is really hard and it opens everything up. 9, 15, 18 When the performance is over there’s nothing but a bottle.  AS: Really what is the point of all this?  SP: It’s to educate the fucking white people in the community about homelessness so they’ll rise to the occasion and do something goddamn different. 9, 14, 19 So they’ll be sympathetic and not stigmatize people. 9 So they’ll learn a lesson, so that they look around and wake the fuck up, all of it. 10 I’m so, so sad.  People think now that Trump’s in office look what’s going on in the world. 12 Where the fuck have you been?  The Democratic Party, there’s a lot of great things to say about Barack Obama but there’s a lot of shitty things to say about Barack Obama. 18, 20 What the fuck is wrong with people? 9, 11 The looky loo tour everybody loves it. 14 I used to take people down to Curry Avenue. 6, 9, 13, 16 SP: I used to call it the looky loo tour because there’s people that are liberal and they want to do what’s politically correct and then be hipsters and groovy at a cocktail party and talk about how edgy they are. 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 20 I’d bring them down to Curry Avenue.  They’d have no idea.  What they knew was Block E and the drive by on the highway. 5, 7, 16, 18 They’d never been to Curry Avenue. 16 Some people got it and they were truly humble and appropriate. 9 Other people got baptism by fire and it was good for them. 9, 10 They would never forget it. 16 I would say that I have contributed a lot to Minnesota.  AS: I would say you have.  SP: Thank you for the opportunity to talk about it. 19 AS: You’re so welcome.  It’s been my privilege.  SP: There’s just so much sadness.  I can’t come here in the wintertime.  AS: Thank you Sue.  SP: You’re welcome.  I can fill in blank spaces for you in the future if you want. 5"
"20","Holter_Janise","Sue Purchase Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer April 27, 2017 Minneapolis, Minnesota  Sue Purchase -SP Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan I’m at my home with Sue Purchase.  It is April 27, 2017.  At my house and I’m with Sue Purchase. 6, 13 Sue do you want to state your name?  SP: I am Sue Purchase and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this interview.  AS: Let’s start with your childhood. 14, 20 You said you’d grown up in Cloquet. 10 Do you want to talk about your parents, your childhood, your early life? 10, 14, 20 SP: I grew up in Northern Minnesota. 20 I was born in Duluth in 1959. 14 Number five of what would be six children. 5, 14, 20 First four years were spent in Esko, Minnesota. 14 Esko is a suburb of Cloquet.  A very strong Finnish community. 19 Number five of six kids.  Moved to Cloquet when I was five years old. 14 Went to grade school there. 5, 7 AS: What did your parents do? 20 SP: My dad, he worked for the co-op store, very much Northern Minnesota. 14 He lost his job working there and then he worked at the paper mill for Potlatch. 11 I guess for the rest of his life. 10 I must have been nine years old or something. 14 He started working for Potlatch.  That was in the mid-60s, the paper industry was huge.  They had Potlatch, Diamond Match, and two other active mills.  There was a mill bus.  It was a mill town.  My mother, she never worked outside the house. 6, 13, 16 How would describe your economic situation growing up? 10 SP: I would say the working poor.  It’s interesting to think about. 17 What I remember, my mother always scrabbling for money. 8, 10, 18 Always worried about money, the things we could and could not have because of money. 8, 10, 18 I suspect that my dad probably made good money. 8, 10, 14 For the times and for the mill industry.  Given the times there was a living wage but he drank it all up. 5, 16 There was no money. 8, 10 I remember things like he’d come home drunk and pass out and she’d go through his wallet after the fact to see what was left, what there could be for school lunches. 5, 6, 7, 8, 14 It’s interesting to talk about. 17 I don’t know what year it was, ‘65 maybe, when free lunches started. 5, 12, 14 It must have been Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty but we certainly qualified. 8, 17 I think that I was in the third grade... 5 It must have been around third grade however old I would be then. 5 They were blue and yellow. 10 I don’t know if one was free or one was reduced or you got one of the colors for hot lunch and one was for milk. 5, 12, 14 There was some sort of order to the tickets but I remember the shame.  I hated it.  I hated using them. 6 Growing up I always felt like everybody in town knew about my house, which was fairly true. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 He was a drinker and he was violent. 5 I grew up at 1802 Carleton Avenue. 20 Carleton  Avenue was one of the main streets in Cloquet. 5 I always felt like we were on display for all of the dysfunction and violence and drinking that happened there. 5, 6, 9, 11, 15, 18 Always a lot of shame related to it. 18 AS: Do you have older brothers or sisters or both? 20 SP: My oldest sister Dianne, I think she was seventeen years older than I was. 14, 20 My mother’s first husband was Greek. 14 He was killed in World War II. 14 Dianne was a baby.  My mother was from Floodwood, another small town in Minnesota.  I think she had grown up with my dad so she knew him. 10, 14, 16 She had my sister Dianne and then she married my dad Charlie after the first husband was killed. 7, 14, 20 I don’t know how much older she was than my oldest brother, maybe four years. 5, 12, 14, 20 There was Dianne and then there’s my brother Chuck. 20 He was the first born son of my dad. 14 Then there’s my sister Scary Mary. 20 She just had a birthday. 16 She’s around sixty five.  Then there’s my brother Jimmy and he is four years older than I am. 14, 20 He was a drinker. 5 Scary Mary is a drinker, Chuck is a drinker. 5 Dianne was way into pills. 18 Then there’s my brother Michael. 20 He’s two and a half years younger than I am. 14, 20 He for sure is a drinker. 5 There’s been a lot of other drugs in the mix. 5, 6 Every single child. 14 Substance use, violence, and trauma. 6, 13 Absolutely.  My mother, she was really proud of the fact that she didn’t smoke cigarettes and she’d have a half a glass of wine. 11, 18 She wasn’t a drinker. 5 There was always some odd sharing of pills. 18 AS: Among who?  SP: My oldest sister for sure and with my mom. 14, 20 I don’t know if that extended beyond to my sister Mary Jane or not. 12, 20 There was a culture.  AS: Do you know what kind of pills they were sharing? 12, 18 SP: Generally speed.  AS: That makes sense because that was available.  It was prescribed to housewives with lots of children. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 20 SP: Absolutely, to get stuff done and it’s good for a little depression. 10, 20 AS: We were at the school lunches, elementary school, junior high; you were telling me a story about your friend who you met in Cloquet, Debbie. 7, 12, 14, 15, 20 SP: So what happens, my parents get a divorce when I’m in the third grade. 5, 15, 20 The mid-60s in Northern Minnesota people didn’t get divorced. 7, 9 Small town environment, everybody knows everything about everybody. 12 AS: Was your dad violent with your mom? 14 SP: Oh yes.  AS: It was physical abuse. 6, 13 SP: All my life. 10 AS: Was everybody a target?  SP: Everybody was a target.  Me less than anybody else in the house. 6, 13 That’s interesting to me too. 17 They got a divorce.  My mother had lived in Oregon in the past and always wanted to go back. 7, 18 The summer between fifth and sixth grade we moved to Oregon. 5, 7, 15 It’s myself, my younger brother, and my older brother Jimmy. 20 We’re out there for about six months or so. 11, 16 I loved being in Oregon. 14 It’s not cold Northern Minnesota.  Then Jimmy doesn’t adjust well to it.  We move back to Cloquet in early February. 15 It sucked.  We moved back into this house at 1802 Carleton Avenue. 6, 7, 13, 15 The old man is still living there because he had moved back in the house. 6, 7, 13, 15 My older sister was there. 20 He had moved back in the house when we moved to Oregon. 6, 7, 13, 15 We come back.  He’s supposed to move out. 15 What I remember about that is just waiting for him to be gone. 8, 11, 15 I didn’t like him being around.  He was just a problem. 12 Two weeks after we got back he died. 15 He died of a stroke in the living room. 14 I might need to write to my therapist later tonight.  AS: We can pause whenever you want. 6, 13, 16 SP: It’s interesting because I’m in therapy and we do a lot of talking. 12, 17 There’s just so much stuff.  Sometimes not knowing what I don’t know. 12 There was a change.  When I think about myself it was Susie who moved to Oregon. 7, 15 I was always known as Susie, as a little girl. 7, 11, 12, 18, 20 My mother would always talk about how Susie was so docile and so calm and this and that. 14, 18 We get back and we always think about it as that’s when ‘A Boy Named Sue’ showed up. 18 My alter ego.  It’s absolutely—I love Johnny Cash. 14 I grew up hearing his music. 9, 20 I was really close to my brothers and I had to be a badass to survive. 9, 10, 18, 20 If I was going to be sweet and docile I wasn’t going to make it. 14 In the sixth grade he gets buried. 5 It’s cold when he dies.  They can’t bury him; they kept him somewhere until the ground was thawed in the spring.  I don’t remember much of that but the relief of having him gone. 8, 11 I didn’t have to worry about his violence any longer. 6, 17 It was hard in the sixth grade. 5, 9 There was a new girl who had moved to town, Connie Carlblom. 7, 15, 16 She had older siblings and a fucked up family life too. 10, 12, 20 We’re still friends to this day. 16, 20 There were some older girls in the neighborhood and we started smoking cigarettes and drinking. 5, 6, 7, 11, 20 My older brother was married and had a little girl and I used to babysit. 6, 7, 13, 16, 20 I used to steal their cigarettes. 6, 13, 16 I’ve probably been smoking since I was nine sort of. 6 Bringing booze to school in a baby food jar. 7 AS: And nobody caught you doing this?  SP: Nobody paid much attention to what I was doing.  AS: Because you were so docile and sweet. 14 SP: They were caught up in whatever else.  I think that it was every child for themselves. 14 AS: In your household? 6, 13 SP: Yes.  Dorothy was preoccupied in whatever else went on in her life. 10 Probably in retrospect she probably, I don’t know before my dad and before her first husband what happened growing up. 10, 12, 14, 15 AS: Dorothy is your mom? 14 SP: Dorothy’s my mom. 14 Sometimes I called her Dot Monster.  She probably had, I don’t know what her childhood experience was but when her siblings would talk about her, she was known as a problem. 11, 12, 14, 18, 20 Maybe bipolar, maybe borderline personality. 5, 15 Certainly she had a lot of trauma in her life. 10 She never drank. 5, 16 She didn’t do drugs. 5, 6 She knew divide and conquer really well and she could be wicked. 16, 18 She would play divide and conquer between her kids really well. 18 She wasn’t a supportive mother. 19 It wouldn’t be like, “Susie how are you doing now that we’re back from Oregon and your dad is dead? 12, 14, 16 How’s life in the sixth grade?” 5, 10 That wasn’t going to happen. 15 I had a lifelong friend, Lisa; we’d been friends since kindergarten. 10, 16, 17, 20 When I got back in the sixth grade Lisa was there as my friend. 5, 20 This other woman Connie.  We all got a really similar mindset. 18 We were friends, we had fucked up childhoods. 14, 16, 20 Connie and I in the summer between sixth and seventh grade we were with her older sister Gail. 5, 7, 20 Gail is beautiful.  She’s was just a hip chick.  So we’re at the glass block department store in Duluth. 9, 11, 12, 19 I don’t know why we were there together; we’d gotten dropped off somehow. 5, 8, 11, 12 We were there and we’re shoplifting. 15 I’ve got Gail’s purse carrying it.  It’s got a pack of Marlboro Reds with two joints in the pack.  We get busted for shoplifting. 15 Connie’s parents get called. 20 They come and pick us up.  The police must have been involved somehow, the school. 7, 8 Before I’m ever in the seventh grade I had to start seeing the guidance counselor. 5, 6 A man named Brian Burg, I really liked him. 18 I don’t know how all that got set up. 12 I remember sitting in his office.  I had to start seeing him before school started. 6, 7 He told me at the outset, he referred to me as being a survivor. 5, 16, 17 I remember sitting there thinking, “What the fuck does that mean?  How do you know that about me? 12 What do you know that I don’t know? 12 What does that mean?  What am I surviving?”  This is my life. 10 I don’t have insights.  It made me so uncomfortable.  So I just withdraw a little bit more. 5, 20 Certainly the pot smoking just continues. 6 In junior high in Cloquet all the grade schools come together and you’re united at the junior high. 5, 7, 8, 14, 19 My friend Lisa that I’d gone all through Garfield School with, the new girl Connie who joins us in the sixth grade, Debbie Holman. 5, 7, 16, 20 Along comes Debbie and then there’s another girl, Mary Dickinson. 7 There’s more but that was the core.  Mary and Debbie, they had been friends for life at the Sacred Heart school. 5, 7, 10, 16, 20 They’d gone to the Catholic school. 7 What a group of groups and energy. 12 There was about, I don’t remember how many of us in number but there was Robin Ward.  Robin  Ward came from Garfield School. 14 I knew her all my life too. 10, 16 In the fourth grade there’s modular scheduling. 5 I don’t know if you’re familiar with modular scheduling in the state of Minnesota but by that point it’s becoming the later 60s. 8, 12 Things are starting to change.  The traditional classroom is going away. 7, 14, 18, 20 There were twenty minute mods and children moved from classroom to classroom. 5, 7, 14, 15, 20 More autonomy, more independence.  That starts in the fourth grade. 5 It continues on throughout my school career up through high school. 7, 15, 19 I think I was the first year to get it and I think I was the last year to get it. 14 That was fun.  In the seventh grade we’ve got modular scheduling. 5 I’ve got to backtrack to this story about the fourth grade and Robin Ward. 5, 15, 16 We’re sitting in a classroom. 7, 14 There’s a teacher named Mr. Saliga.  Probably young at the time, twenties, I have no idea.  Older guy from a little kid’s perspective. 20 He would talk about shit that was so inappropriate while sitting at his desk to the classroom. 7, 14, 18 One of them, he talked about Robin Ward’s parents being divorced. 7, 20 I remember sitting there thinking, “Wow, there’s somebody else that can identify with me.”  Robin and I would be friends all our lives. 16, 20 Up until probably the last ten years. 14 He was sexually inappropriate. 12 We didn’t know. 12 We were little girls and didn’t have a voice and any place to share it. 7, 11, 17, 20 With divorced parents and things that had happened and nowhere to go with it. 7, 12, 15, 20 There’re these layers of stuff that start.  AS: That just kind of sets up the trajectory.  SP: So we get to seventh grade and we all get together. 5, 8 I’m not sure how we all met.  We formed our club. 14 It was the Weed Weevils.  It was given to us, this name by my friend Lisa, her older brother Joel, who was very instrumental all my life. 10, 12, 20 We all have Weed Weevil names. 16 We earned them somehow. 8 Lisa’s name, she was the queen of the Weed Weevils, she was Wee Helvi.  Not all of us are Finlanders but many of us are.  Then Mary Dickinson became Mad Dog.  She loved to drink Mad Dog. 5, 14 Her mother was a teacher.  She would leave early in the morning. 18 Her mother partied at night and she taught during the day, grade school children. 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 20 This fledgling group of Weed Weevils, these adolescent girls would gather in Mary’s bedroom. 5, 7, 11, 14 We’d have an ounce of weed, a lid, four fingers and we would roll joints and each of us would have one and we’d keep them passing. 20 Then we’d get really high. 7, 18 Then we’d go to school. 7 We had a presence. 10 We were rascals and fun and outrageous and didn’t give a shit. 18 We weren’t shy.  AS: Were you getting in trouble all the time?  SP: We started.  That’s how we start seventh grade. 5 We smoke cigarettes in the bathroom. 14 AS: What was your name?  SP: Susie Monster.  I don’t even remember, in the seventh grade I’m sure I started getting suspended then. 5, 10 In the eighth grade I think it was Lisa and I, we had skipped out of school. 5, 7 We started dropping acid I think in the eighth grade, maybe not in the seventh. 5, 11 I think I was fourteen the first time I did acid. 14 It was at a junior high fun night, the school dance. 7, 14 It just continued.  Then the first day of ninth grade there was like four of us and we had planned, we got two joints and we were behind the school somewhere. 5, 7, 14, 16 There was a church across the street close to the junior high and we’re back there getting high. 7, 9, 10, 14 Somebody reported us so the principal comes from one way, the assistant principal from the other way. 13, 18 We’re caught and suspended from school. 7, 10 My mother was pissed.  AS: How long were you suspended for? 10, 17 SP: I think it was only three days. 16 I don’t think we got more than three days. 16 I had been on in-school suspension. 7 Just in trouble.  Still modular scheduling.  All this independence to move around the school and these new found friends. 7, 15, 16, 20 All of the things that they talk about as things change for kids, junior high. 7, 14 AS: Where were you getting your drugs? 5, 6 SP: Lisa had an older brother Joel who was six years older than we were. 14, 20 He’s the same age as my sister Scary Mary. 20 Joel was way into drugs. 5, 6, 18 We weevilled from him.  We knew people around town. 9, 16 AS: So it was easy.  SP: It was very easy.  We always hung out with older people, older siblings. 9, 18, 20 We figured it out. 5 We were resourceful.  The LSD, I don’t remember how we got that.  It was something that it just continued to escalate.  In the ninth grade after I got caught, there was so much independence you could easily leave school. 5, 7, 18 There wasn’t a lot of supervision by teachers. 16 You were supposed to be accountable, there was passing time.  You’d have a schedule and maybe mods one and two you were in Social Studies and then you’d have free time from mods five through eleven. 5 I think there were eighteen in a day. 16 Eighteen twenty-minute periods. 15, 18 You were expected to go to a resource center, use your time wisely, study, and not get in trouble, and not be caught in the hallways. 6, 13, 18 We used it to our advantage. 6, 13, 16 We had no fear. 10 The ninth grade episode, whatever other friends we were with they got suspended, I got suspended. 5, 10, 16, 20 I went home.  AS: That was the pot episode? 6 SP: Yes.  I got out of my house. 6, 13 I moved in with my older brother. 7, 15, 20 My oldest brother’s name is Chuck. 20 He was always my hero. 18 He liked me.  I moved in with him and his wife and my nephew and niece. 7, 15, 20 They were little. 20 My nephew Tom must have been two years old. 14 My niece Michelle must have been four or five.  Chuck and Pam, my sister-in-law Pam twenty-two, twenty-three years old. 13, 14, 20 My brother a couple years older than that. 11, 14, 20 They loved to drink, they loved to party. 5, 9, 14, 20 Not smoke pot. 6 AS: Did you just fight with your mom and leave? 14, 18 Is that what happened? 15 SP: Yes, I asked my brother if I could move in with him. 15, 20 I’d had enough of her shit. 18 I had been leaving home, my oldest brother told me the last time I was up here two years ago, and we were talking about me and writing. 13, 14, 16, 20 That I had started writing again probably since 2006.  He said to me, “Susie you were a writer since you learned how. 10 You wrote to everybody.”  I didn’t remember that.  My mother took my diary when I was maybe sixteen, fifteen. 5 I’d hidden it and she read it.  It was used against me. 6, 13, 16 I didn’t write after that.  There’s this memory that he talks about in me writing.  Then it comes back to me.  From the time I was really little I’d write to my grandma. 18, 20 Floodwood, fifty miles away, Northern Minnesota. 18, 20 I would ask her if I could come stay with her.  It would just be arranged. 7 I don’t remember exactly how I got a stamp or if I figure out you didn’t need to necessarily have a stamp on the envelope.  I knew where the mailbox was on the corner. 16 It would be arranged. 7 I’d have an uncle that would come and pick me up and I’d go to my grandma’s house for whatever number of days or she’d call my mother. 6, 13, 16 As I got older I’d just hop on the Greyhound Bus and somebody’d meet me. 18, 20 My grandma knew that my mother was incompetent and could not protect her children. 5, 14, 16, 20 My grandma liked me.  So I was allowed to come and stay. 10, 14 I started out really young just taking care of business. 11, 18, 19 I’ve always known that I could only depend on myself. 11, 12, 18 As time went on, and by the ninth grade the old man’s dead and shit’s happened. 5, 15, 16, 18 I’m an adolescent girl with hormones and I’ve got a period. 7, 8, 18 AS: So you take off to live with them.  Is it the same town?  Are they in Cloquet?  SP: They’re in Cloquet, another part of town. 9 I take off to live with them and he’s got more structure for me living with them. 15 I’ve got responsibilities that I’ve got to do and can’t say no and wouldn’t talk back.  I respect him.  I could drink there. 5 I could smoke cigarettes in front of them.  I’m just enjoying it even more.  My friends and I we just become more emboldened and empowered. 5, 16, 17, 20 More drugs, more acid. 5, 6 I’m not sure what else was in the mix in the ninth grade. 5 Drinking, a lot of drinking. 5, 11 A lot of pot. 6 I live with them for a year. 14 My mother wants me to come home.  My sophomore year I moved from the junior high to the high school which is on 18th Street. 7, 14, 15 In the ninth grade Debbie Holman starts going to treatment. 5, 12, 13 Debbie gets sent away. 5, 18, 20 We all tried to understand that. 17, 18 We want to be badasses, hoods they’d call us.  Debbie gets sent away. 5, 18, 20 I remember there was conversation around that.  I don’t know how we knew what we knew. 12, 16 AS: To drug treatment she gets sent away or she gets sent away for mental health? 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 SP: She gets sent away to drug treatment. 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, 20 I can’t think of what the name of that one was. 8 Debbie can tell you.  She’s gone for a long time. 17 It is a therapeutic community. 19 Fuck, Debbie had to wear a sign. 11 She had to wear a sign in treatment. 11, 12, 13 It said, “I’m a dirty slip-sliding junkie.”  We were fourteen.  Oh my God.  It’s Debbie’s story to tell. 15 There was shit that had to happen to us. 15, 18 AS: You were part of it. 9 You’re not telling her story, you’re telling it from your… 15 SP: It was intense.  We didn’t know. 12 You don’t talk about stuff, it’s Northern Minnesota.  It’s the 60s, the early 70s.  Things might be changing, things might be becoming more liberal but not in Northern Minnesota. 17 There’s a tradition.  Girls are not supposed to be wild and out of hand and rebellious and have a club that is all about getting high and getting over. 7 It was like, “Fuck you.  You think we shouldn’t do this?  Well we’re going to show you what we can do.”  We didn’t care. 19 We had fun.  Debbie goes to treatment. 12, 13 AS: Are you sexually active at this point? 12 SP: We become sexually active. 12 AS: Were you being stalked or abused? 6, 13, 16 SP: There’s abuse. 6, 13 AS: While you were drunk or high. 5, 7, 8, 14 SP: There was always but it wasn’t really talked about a lot. 18 It was talked about after the fact among some of us.  We’re an ever expanding group.  Junior high, ninth grade, tenth grade we start to take on momentum. 5, 7, 8, 12, 14 There’s the core group: Crazy Mad Dog, Wee Helvi, and there’s Connie.  There’s Peggy and there’s Debbie and there’s Berta and there’s Brenda and there’s Pixie.  Debbie’s name is Crazy Fry Brain of the Weed Weevils.  AS: So there’re a dozen of you?  SP: Yes, easily a dozen of us.  Really we just feed off one another and we all have similarities.  There’s Robin and there’s Jennifer.  Jennifer had mono, something happened to her in junior high. 7, 14, 15 Maybe mono was just the excuse. 6, 13 I don’t know if she had some sort of mental breakdown. 12 She came back to school and things were never really the same with her. 7, 16, 18 We all start becoming sexually active. 12 Parties and drinking. 5, 11 AS: I got you off track, Debbie comes back. 16 SP: What I remember is I’d start out on my corner of 18th Street, stop by her house in the morning. 6, 13 We’d sit up in her bedroom and do bong hits. 5, 14 Then we would listen to Cat Stevens “Father and Son.”  Get ready and then we’d walk to high school further down 18th Street and maybe do some bong hits in the bathroom stalls. 5, 7, 14, 16 Smoke some cigarettes for sure.  Get ready for school and there was a bunch of girls in there smoking cigarettes. 6, 7, 11 It was just known, the first floor bathroom you smoked cigarettes. 11, 12, 14 There was graffiti in the stalls. 15 By the time we were sixteen I don’t remember if Debbie stays in high school the whole time or if she comes and goes during different periods of time there. 7, 18 I think she was around for the most part. 9 We continued to get high. 7 That’s a routine and more acid.  Berta gets pregnant at sixteen. 7, 10 I think we were sixteen.  Connie’s sister Gail, the beautiful one, she moves to Minneapolis. 8, 15, 20 She quit school. 7 Gail lives in a house down off of Lake Street. 6, 13 There used to be a grocery school called Applebaum’s. 6, 7, 13, 16 She’s living down there with this black dude named Sunny Gangs.  I get introduced to Curtis Mayfield, somewhere around in there. 14 I think it was Sunny Gangs, he loved that music. 9, 14 I just bought that CD for the road trip.  I found it somewhere cheap.  That’s what’s funny about memories. 9 We would hitchhike, we would leave Cloquet. 18 Debbie and Connie and I, we’d hitchhike from Cloquet down to Minneapolis.  We went to Gail and Sunny’s house one time. 6, 13 These two guys gave us a ride.  They were crazy. 20 Debbie and I still laugh about us.  They bought us a half gallon of vodka, drinking on the way down. 5, 11, 14, 18 We get down here and we go to Applebaum’s shoplifting food. 15 You steal everything.  That’s part of the Weed Weevil club thing. 9 You save your money for drugs and you steal things, shoplift, a way of making money. 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 18 We get caught shoplifting in Applebaum’s. 15 Connie and I get to go back to her sister’s house but Debbie gets taken. 6, 13, 20 She gets taken away to juvie or something because she’s got priors. 18, 20 She’s got history. 15 Our antics just increased.  We become more empowered. 5, 17 Growing up angry, frustrated. 11 Debbie goes away. 18, 20 There’s always some different pairing of friends within this group. 16, 18, 20 Some of us become closer. 9, 10 It’s a dance.  Berta gets pregnant and has that baby, Amanda. 7, 10 I don’t think that baby fared very well. 5 There was a lot of sexual abuse in that household—things that we learned after the fact. 6, 10, 12, 13 All of these girls, some of us do drugs differently than others. 5, 6, 7, 11 The eleventh grade I go to live with my sister Dianne in Duluth. 5, 20 She’s got three boys. 7, 11 I have three nephews.  Her oldest one is Ricky. 8, 20 He’s two years younger than I am. 14, 20 Then there’s my brother Michael two and a half years younger than I am. 14, 20 We’re close, the three of us. 9, 10 We grew up together. 8, 20 Ricky, smart, smart guy.  Not a lick of common sense.  He deals drugs. 5, 6 He deals hash, probably sold pot. 6 They’re in to partying. 9, 14, 20 I’m into getting hash from him.  There’s just more drugs. 5, 6 I don’t remember exactly what happened but he came to live at my mother’s house. 6, 13, 14, 15 He always lived and spent a lot of time with us. 7, 18 I go to live with my sister in an apartment in Duluth. 5, 9, 11, 12, 20 At least for half of the year. 14 Maybe the full year my junior year is spent at Central High School. 14 Dianne and I were close in many ways to the degree that we were close in my family. 9, 10, 12, 18 She talked a lot about experiences. 18 She was beautiful.  She had long, dark black hair. 17 She wore in a long braid down her back. 17 She looked like an Indian.  Indians are discriminated against in Northern Minnesota.  She’s half Greek, she’s beautiful. 14 She’s my mother’s first child. 14 My mother never let anybody forget that she’d had a first husband that she really loved. 14, 16, 18 He was killed and she married Charlie by default and she has these kids by him but really Dianne’s the favorite. 7, 14, 18 My sister grows up; to the time she’s twelve years old in the family house. 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 20 It must have been in Esko with the old man beating the shit out of her. 18 She goes to high school in Esko. 7 This small town, smaller than Cloquet, with black eyes and split lips.  I don’t know what happened in there. 12, 15 My grandma thinks that my mother’s incompetent, can’t raise her children, all of that. 5, 14, 17, 20 It really gets established with Dianne. 18 Dianne is sent to reform school in Southern Minnesota, Sauk Centre. 5, 7 A couple different places, Red Wing maybe. 5, 11 She’s sent away. 5, 18, 20 She never comes home to live. 16 She, at seventeen, has Ricky this baby.  Her first marriage. 14 Lives in Duluth.  Then she would be divorced a lot of different times. 7 When I go to live with her when I’m a junior in high school it’s one of those times when she’s not married. 7, 14 She and I would talk.  We would talk about trying to sort out what had happened growing up. 10, 15 She’d talk about her experience being sent away and the violence. 5, 6, 18, 20 We tried to understand why our mother didn’t protect us. 17, 18 There was always this curiosity and trying to understand what happened, our trauma. 15, 17, 18 AS: So you’re sixteen when you go to live with her and she’s how old?  SP: She’s like seventeen years older than I am. 14, 20 SP: Yes.  She’s close to my mother at the same time. 9, 10 AS: Just trying to understand it. 17, 18 SP: In many ways hates my mother. 18 Angry, pissed off.  That dynamic is just so hard. 9 My sister Dianne wants to be friends with me and friends with my friends. 16, 20 My sister Dianne when I think about music, I was introduced to different music by each of my siblings. 9, 14, 20 My sister Dianne introduced me to the blues. 14, 20 I think from the time I was two years old I’ve loved the blues. 14 Otis Redding, Little Richard, oh my God, Ray Charles. 9 My sister Dianne was a brown girl that loved the blues. 7, 14, 20 That understanding of what it means to be a brown girl when you’re non-white started with her. 7, 14, 17, 18, 19 When I’d go to stay with my grandma all those times, all the old ladies from Floodwood would get together which is considered so Minnesotan, a little lunch. 5, 8, 9, 20 Then they’d want to do the run down where I fit in in the sequence of siblings. 8, 15 Old people, “Oh you’re Dorothy’s daughter.” 9 They’d have me do this run down. 8 I’d say my sister Dianne. 20 It happened without fail. 15 There was always that qualified. 18 “She’s only your half-sister.” 14, 20 AS: Is this because she was Greek?  Just because of her dark hair? 17 Did she have a dark complexion? 13, 17 SP: Yes, she’s beautiful.  She looks like a Native woman.  Yes.  There’s all of that stuff.  It just gets layered and layered. 5 I live with her.  We’re close. 9, 10 As close as we can be. 9, 10 I don’t trust any of them.  There’s this thing of wanting Dorothy’s attention.  My mother always encouraged divide and conquer. 18 If she could ammunition against one of her children that was so much the better for her. 5, 14, 19, 20 There’s no trust.  I think Dianne tried to be a supportive big sister and take care of me, look out for me as she possibly could. 19, 20 I think I need a bathroom break. 14 [Break in Recording]  SP: So I live with her for my junior year. 14 I move back to Cloquet for my senior year in high school. 7, 14, 15 That was just a year of partying. 9, 14, 20 My mother left town for a month and went to the West Coast. 14, 16 It was crazy. 20 My brothers and I, we had a whole month to party in that house. 6, 9, 13, 16, 20 We had a plan.  We had Operation Bar Glass.  Preparing for my mother to leave town so we could party and have a fun time. 9, 18, 20 We covered up her china cabinet and all of this stuff. 5, 14 AS: Just to protect it?  SP: Just to protect things.  We had Operation Bar Glass, we had all these other glasses. 11 We were trying to take care of the house to the best of our ability and have a party. 6, 9, 13, 19, 20 It was huge.  It was a lot of fun in many ways. 18 There were constantly people in that house. 6, 9, 13 My nephew that deals hash.  There was always somebody there and we were getting high. 7, 18 We’d have parties. 9 Sneaking into the bars in Northern Minnesota at seventeen, eighteen years old. 14 We’d bring the party home to the house. 6, 9, 13, 20 Somebody talked about how the streets were lined with cars. 5, 9, 14 There was nowhere to park to go into the house. 6, 12, 13 They were fun parties. 9 They didn’t totally destroy the house. 6, 13 We had a lot of people there, a lot of friends. 9, 16, 20 There were a lot of things that got talked about after the fact.  Apparently one friend was raped during the party. 9, 20 I don’t know how the circumstances were talked about. 12 The friend Connie, she certainly struggles with mental health issues now. 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20 She brought it up earlier this year she was up visiting me, asking if I remembered. 5, 14, 15 I don’t know that I remember. 12 There’s pieces of it sort of, snippets.  Things weren’t really acknowledged. 12, 18 They just went on.  We continued to party. 9, 20 I left Cloquet right after graduation and went to Minneapolis and then went on further, Colorado. 12, 14 The Weed Weevils slowly dispersed. 10 There were a lot of things that happened, drug use that increased. 5, 6, 13, 15 People that went to treatment like Debbie in and out. 12, 13 It was at the time when girls still wanted to get married out of high school. 7, 11, 18 I think maybe more settled. 5 AS: When did you graduate high school? 7 All I ever wanted from Cloquet was to leave Cloquet. 18 I was leaving, no two ways about it. 18 I had established more of a life in Minneapolis. 10 I talked about hitchhiking down there and we’d stay with Gail.  We continued to go down there, drinking in Moby Dick’s at eighteen, underage. 5, 11 AS: Was it underage in the 70s?  SP: Nineteen was the legal drinking age in Minnesota at that point. 5, 11 It kind of shifted back and forth. 8 I’d been drinking in Superior, Wisconsin for a long time. 5, 11, 17 It was just across the bridge.  Minnesota was still nineteen.  We would drink in Moby Dick’s. 5 I don’t know if you’re familiar with Moby’s. 8, 12 It used to be downtown on Hennepin Avenue, down by the Gay 90s and Augie’s. 6, 13, 16 We would drink in there. 5 The first time I was ever in the Gay 90s I’d been doing acid. 14 It was crazy. 20 The friend Brenda, her older brother Bobby was HIV positive, a gay man. 9, 20 He hung out at the Gay 90s all the time.  We had an in with older people continually. 9, 20 At Moby’s that place had a reputation.  Downtown Minneapolis in the 70s with pimps and sex workers with big hats with feathers. 12, 19 We were in hog heaven.  It was fun.  It was entertaining.  It was a challenge.  It wasn’t boring.  We never liked to be boring. 16 Was it scary to you ever?  Was it dangerous? 11 SP: Certainly should have been.  Should have been scared. 5, 19 Connie met this guy, some black man that we’d met.  There weren’t really black guys in Northern Minnesota. 18 Not in Cloquet, there might have been one.  I remember her taking off with him. 11 She just talked about this too.  She was gone for a few days. 16 She tells some wild story around what happened. 15 None of it was good. 8, 10 Real, imagined  I’m not sure.  Probably to some degree very real.  Kidnapped.  Then during that time I don’t know if we were seventeen or eighteen, Connie’s sister Gail, the beautiful one, living with Sunny Gangs. 12, 20 She is a prostitute in Minneapolis, strung out on heroin. 8, 16 She ends up dying.  The story goes that she was on a golf course in Vadnais Heights and she was wearing a lot of silver, turquoise necklaces, bracelets. 15 When the lightning struck because of the jewelry.  I don’t know whether that’s a true story, if that’s what we were told. 5, 12, 15, 16 She ends up dead anyways. 16, 17, 18 AS: From a lightning strike?  SP: That’s what they said.  She’s dead. 16 Sunny Gangs right around that time is accused of killing a cop. 6, 12, 13, 16 We’re living on the North side of Minneapolis. 9 There’s myself and there’s Robin and Jennifer.  Connie lives in South Minneapolis.  She lives over on Cedar Avenue over by Little Earth.  We had gotten in a car accident on Cedar Avenue. 13 We’d been down partying at Moby Dick’s. 9, 14, 20 Then we had some people in the car with us. 9 I think there were two guys and four girls. 7, 11 We’re on our way to some party. 9, 18, 20 Connie hit a parked car. 14 I ended up having my forehead cut open. 14 Jennifer was in the front seat; she hit the windshield and had glass in her face. 11 We were the only two hurt.  There was an ambulance going by as it happened. 15 It was an old Plymouth Valiant.  I think they pulled me out through the window and into the ambulance. 11 I remember this old guy saying because I think we had a bag of weed or we had other drugs in the car. 5, 6, 20 What I remember is him telling me that he wasn’t going to do anything about that. 15 The drugs weren’t going to be talked about. 5, 6 They brought us to HCMC.  AS: Who was telling you that? 15 The cop?  SP: What I remember is a cop.  That I was in an ambulance.  I was laid out on the gurney.  I think he saw us as wild young girls. 7, 11 AS: Maybe take it for themselves.  Yes, right. 12 We’re brought to HCMC and Jennifer’s face is cleaned out and I’m stitched up.  They just let us go.  They let us go.  That was right at my nineteenth birthday. 12, 16 I’d been in three car accidents in three months. 11, 13, 16 I think I’d been in Montana on a little road trip with Lisa and this woman Peggy. 20 That wasn’t really our fault, not necessarily drugs involved. 5, 6, 18 There was the one in Minneapolis. 8 Then I’m back in Northern Minnesota in Cloquet for Christmas and New Year’s.  Lisa and I get in a car accident on Carleton Avenue and I hit the windshield again and we’re drunk. 5, 8, 13, 14 I think I’d had a concussion.  They put me in the hospital then. 8 It was always something. 18 We live in Minneapolis and then Lisa wants to go on a road trip.  She calls me up. 16 She’s still living in Cloquet, I’m in Minneapolis.  She calls me up at like midnight. 16 She proposes this road trip that we would leave Minnesota on the fifteenth of June, we’d have a pound of pot. 6, 18 Lisa was always a planner. 18 We would go through the Black Hills and we’d camp along the way. 18 Then we’d go to Gillette, Wyoming because there was the oil shale boom or something there.  All these people from Cloquet had gone there to work. 9 Gillette is an armpit of Wyoming.  We’d go through Yellowstone and up to Seattle, down the West Coast and then into Mexico. 8, 10 We’d take this trip.  I remember saying to her, “You’re drunk. 5, 8, 14 Call me back tomorrow when you’re sober.”  I’m like, “Okay.  I’m game but we’ve got to go a month later and only two ounces of pot. 6, 16 We’re not bringing a pound Lisa.  We could get in trouble with a pound.”  We do the road trip.  As it turns out with left with expired tabs. 5, 14 We make this road trip, party the whole way. 9, 18, 20 Yellowstone, the Northwest, we get to Tacoma and spend some time because Robin’s living there. 8, 10 We surprise her.  Robin was pregnant and we didn’t know it at the time. 7, 10, 12 We leave, have a great time. 18, 20 Party the whole way. 18 We travelled for six weeks. 15 We didn’t go into Mexico.  We ran out of money in Arizona at the border. 8, 10 I had to call my brother. 20 He wired some to Durango. 5 We get to Colorado, we get to Denver, and I’ve got a friend there who I’ve known since I was fifteen years old. 11, 12, 14, 20 She came to live in Cloquet when she was fifteen.  Her uncle was the assistant principal at the high school. 7 She’s still a part of my life. 9, 10 She lives down the mountain in Allen’s Park.  We go to her house, her and her mom’s house in Denver. 6, 13, 14 We get some day labor jobs in Denver. 11, 16 Lisa and I get enough money to go up the mountain to Summit County. 8, 10 I think we’d seen a Keystone Resort ad in the paper, in the Denver Post or something. 6, 8 We think, “We’re going up there.”  We get a job at the employment office. 11, 12 It’s the boom of construction in Summit County.  Just really starting to be built up. 18 There’s all the little towns, Breckenridge and Silver Thorn and Frisco and Dylan. 20 Lisa and I get this job up on Wilderness, up on the mountain as construction laborers. 11 Moving this guy from one unit to another building. 19 He pays us in cash.  He lets us camp in the finished condos. 14 We think is great. 20 We get a bunch of money for working and we go out on a Friday night and again underage drinking. 5, 8, 10, 11, 16 Now it’s twenty one in Colorado and we’re nineteen.  We met up with the locals right away. 12, 18, 20 We get a room to rent on Silver Lane in Silverthorne at this guy Bob Dennis’s house. 6, 13, 14 Lisa and I have bunk beds and we live across the street from the Mint Saloon.  We think we have died and gone to heaven.  Willie Nelson used to drink over at the Mint Saloon. 5, 6, 13, 16 Oh it was fun.  We’re out of Cloquet.  We get in with the locals.  I met my first husband there, Ron. 14 He was friends with some other people that lived in that house. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 20 When Lisa and I had gotten there it was somewhere in there, we did acid.  I got some Red Dragon acid in the mail. 13 We’d do acid and hang out at the lake. 5 Still did other drugs like cocaine had been a part of my life for quite a while. 5, 6, 9, 10, 16 There’s tons of cocaine in Summit County. 16 AS: Now we’re in the early 80s.  SP: It’s 1979, late ‘79.  I meet Ron. 18 He’s into injecting cocaine. 13, 16 He’s got long hair. 17 I immediately think he is something.  He’s vegetarian, lives in some old trailer.  The mountains are not developed.  A lot of people lived lives with wood stoves for heat, kerosene lamps, vegetarians. 7, 9 Kind of that sort of mountain hippie lifestyle, the Grateful Dead. 10, 15 Ron’s got a trailer.  I just think, “Oh my God he’s cooler than shit.” 14, 17, 18 I picked up with him.  It must have been late August, first of September 1979. 14 It’s not long and I’m living with him in this trailer. 17 Maybe before that.  Ron liked to drink. 5 He liked to drink Jack Daniels and he’d turn the bottle upside and do bubbles as he called them. 5, 9 It was a violent relationship from the very start. 19 He had this old trailer, those really old ones, a lot of them are still left up there. 8, 14, 18 It’s this narrow hallway, a straight line of rooms. 9, 14, 18 I walk in and he’s in the back. 16 He’s in the bathroom with this guy. 14 This biker named Steve.  It’s sort of that Go Ask Alice moment. 8, 12, 14 It’s dark, lowlights and Ron’s tied off with a syringe in his arm with cocaine. 10, 16, 17 It was a dramatic moment. 5, 8, 12, 14 I called it the Go Ask Alice moment because Go Ask Alice was supposed to be the scared straight movie. 5, 8, 12, 14, 19 I got the rinse.  Whatever is left is the residue. 14 You put in a little water to make sure you get everything out. 16, 20 You don’t want to waste what’s in that syringe.  Maybe opened up a new way of thinking. 16, 18 I was always curious. 18 Why not try it?  I think at the time that’s a fairly isolated incident. 9 You just tried it and it didn’t do anything exciting?  SP: Yes, and Ron and I continued to live together. 8 Certainly I didn’t think, “Oh my God, he’s not for me.”  AS: You were primed for violence. 6 SP: Yes.  So we go to Oregon.  My mother is living in Southern Oregon again.  She moved back and forth between Oregon and Minnesota more times than I could count. 7, 15 Her and brother Michael, my brother Michael must be still seventeen or something. 20 I get pregnant with Christa. 7, 10 We moved back to Colorado. 7, 15 She is born in October of 1980. 14 She’s a cesarean section. 8 We rent the house on Silver Lane, the same one that I started out renting a room in. 6, 8, 13, 14 We get to rent the whole house. 6, 13 There’s rooms upstairs that we rent out to other people. 9, 14 Lisa lives with us in that house, rents a room. 6, 13, 14 It’s Ron and Lisa and I downstairs.  Christa comes home, new baby. 16 I might have occasionally smoked pot while I was pregnant with Christa. 6, 7, 10 I really didn’t smoke cigarettes, I tried to quit. 18 Ron’s violent.  I left him. 14 AS: Is he hitting you?  SP: Yes.  He’s crazy. 20 AS: Sorry I have to ask.  SP: You should ask.  There’s a lot of it that I don’t really remember. 18 There was one time he’s got me, I’m on the couch I’m nine months pregnant. 7, 10, 11, 16 I’ve got my knees pulled to my chest to the degree that you can in that situation. 11, 14 There’s a coffee table that was homemade out of two by fours.  Those thick pieces of wood, it’s L-shaped.  He breaks that table.  What I remember is him holding a piece of it over my head. 14 It doesn’t connect with me.  It’s really threatening. 18 I don’t really remember then what happened there. 15, 18 I know that I run out of the house and that I’m hiding across the road in the ditch. 6, 8, 12, 13 I don’t know what happens after that. 12, 15 I end up leaving Ron.  Maybe that incident.  Maybe it was the night before my baby shower there was something.  I don’t really know where I went. 12, 18 AS: When you left him? 14 SP: I left for a while. 14 Didn’t I leave? 18 I think I left. 14 AS: While you were still pregnant? 7, 10 SP: Yes, but I don’t really remember that. 18 I don’t know if I just went back in the house. 6, 12, 13 I don’t know. 12 It seems like I left. 6, 14 But if I did I wasn’t gone long. 17 It’s close to the due date. 9, 10, 13 I don’t know. 12 I delivered Christa. 5 She’s born. 14 I go back there.  I live with them.  My twenty-first birthday was the seventh of September, 1980. 5, 14, 16 I remember thinking that for many people that are twenty one they want to go to the bar because that’s legal drinking age. 5, 9, 11 It wasn’t a big deal for me at that point.  I’d been in the bar for years. 14 I didn’t see the excitement of it. 6, 12 Some people came over for a little birthday party. 9, 16, 20 I wasn’t drinking. 5, 11 I took it serious. 11 Christa was a tiny baby.  I’ve always loved babies. 14, 18 The bedroom was off the living room. 5, 14 There was a rocking chair in there. 14 I was sitting in there breast feeding Christa.  Ron came in and he punched me in the face.  Punched me in the mouth.  I’m not sure why.  What my offense was at that point.  It seemed out of the blue. 6 He was remorseful the next day and all of that happy shit that goes along with that. 16, 17, 18 That would just continue.  AS: How long did you stay with him? 17 SP: Christa was six.  I don’t remember how it happened. 15 Within there Christa was a year old. 14 I started injecting again with Ron. 13 I think it was Christa’s first birthday, no it’s not Christa’s first birthday. 14, 16 It is Ron’s birthday. 16 I don’t know if he was turning twenty five. 12, 20 We have this birthday party. 9, 16, 20 His birthday’s the eighteenth of March. 16 October to March however old Christa was.  She’s there taking care of her. 11, 19 We have this party. 9, 20 I think it’s there that I start injecting again. 13 AS: Cocaine?  SP: Yes.  That would continue for a while.  For at least a year. 14 The times when I can get along with Ron, he used to talk about bell ringers or ear ringers. 6, 13, 16, 17 Cocaine was described that way. 18 If you were injecting you’d get an ear ringer. 13 That was a good hit. 10 I’m sure I was curious about that.  He would always take off with the paycheck. 18 He was a paint contractor. 6, 19 He made good money but there wasn’t ever really money. 8, 10, 18 I get into injecting with him. 13 It makes life easier. 10 We can communicate better.  I’d put the kids to bed and we’d sit up and get high. 7 AS: You have more than one kid at this point?  SP: There’s Christa and then Ron’s got a daughter by a previous marriage. 10, 14 It wasn’t even a marriage, this woman that he lived with, Caroline. 7, 9, 14 Caroline went by Rosie. 9 She was German.  Her parents had immigrated to the United States from Germany, Carola and Hans Wolf. 20 They owned a delicatessen in Keystone. 8 Keystone Resort is a small resort. 8 Keystone opened in 1975. 8 It’s a very small county, it’s just starting. 19 It’s profound because the ski industry and all that it brings.  AS: So you end up with the daughter somehow? 8 SP: We end up with the daughter Jenny when she is four years old. 14 Ron had never really had much for visitation, didn’t really know her well. 12, 16, 18 They’d split up when she was a baby.  Jenny is so abused by the time she’s four years old. 6, 13, 14, 16 We just get her on emergency, something had happened. 15 There was an incident.  We go to court in Breckenridge and we end up having her.  She’s part of it. 9 I am twenty one years old and parenting this little girl who’d been so severely abused, physically, mentally, emotionally, sexually by the whole family including her mother. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 Jenny is four, Christa is one, Ron likes to move. 15 We move down to the Western Slope. 15 He’s working jobs. 11 He doesn’t really stay down there. 18 I’m left down there. 14 Drugs are still involved, not injecting. 13 Pills ground up on bong hits.  I don’t know. 12 Drugs are always a part of the situation in greater degrees with Ron. 9, 18, 20 They’re never completely absent from my life. 5, 10, 16 I have something in me, my own life experience whatever it was, reducing the harm, reducing the use. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 18 Trying to navigate situations.  AS: Would you say that you at that time felt like you were in control of your use? 6, 11, 13, 18 Is that what you’re talking about?  SP: Yes, I would say I had more control over my use. 6, 13, 18 AS: Your life didn’t spin out of control? 10, 18 SP: I was never a chaotic drug user to the way that I would describe that. 5, 6, 13, 16, 18 AS: You were able to take care of the people you were supposed to? 9, 19 SP: Take care of the kids. 19 AS: Take care of yourself as best you could with Ron. 19 SP: Yes.  I had grown up in chaos. 10 I didn’t want chaos for my children at all. 5, 14, 20 Jenny’s a part of it. 9 Christa’s a baby.  Ron moves me to the Western Slope but he’s working in Summit County. 15 He always moved around and I never had a voice. 7, 15, 16, 17, 18 I just went along with it. 17 There was a time; I can remember visiting him in Summit County in the town of Frisco.  We were staying in some hotel room. 7, 14 He’d beat the shit out of me there too and I left. 14, 18 I couldn’t leave with Jenny. 18 I didn’t feel like I could leave with her. 18 She wasn’t my child. 14 It was hard having Jenny. 9 Really, really hard. 9, 18 She’s got a lot of issues. 12, 13 I’ve got Christa and we leave. 18 I think I leave for the summer. 7, 18 I go to my mother’s in Oregon and from there we went to my family’s in Minnesota. 12 I end up going back to Ron.  I end up getting pregnant with my son Blake. 5, 7, 10 The patterns just continue.  Drug use really isn’t a part of my life at all. 6, 9, 10, 13, 18 I’m living up in Leadville.  Jenny is abusive.  She’s sexually abusive to Christa. 12 I feel like I had no understanding of that. 14, 17, 18 I just knew that something, Christa had been potty trained and she’d developed a yeast infection. 6, 16 I had taken her to the doctor. 12, 14 Certainly I know Jenny’s fucked up and there’s issues. 12, 13 Talking about it and starting to gain some insights.  Ron’s always gone and his lifestyle just continues. 10, 15, 18 He’s violent.  I’m figuring a way to get out of this situation. 18 Jenny goes to live in a foster home.  She eventually ends up in state hospital in Pueblo. 5, 8 She’s not bad enough to be there so she gets sent to a group home in Denver, Mt. St. Vincent. 5 It still exists.  Ron doesn’t participate. 9 I try to, to the best of my ability, to go to meetings and stuff like that. 18 Now I’ve got Blake and he’s born a month premature. 5, 10, 14, 16 There’s violence during the pregnancy. 6, 10 He’s born a month premature in Leadville. 10, 14, 16 Jenny, the parental rights were severed of Ron’s and of the mother. 5, 6, 12, 20 The mother, Caroline aka Rosie, she was told that if she did not sever her parental rights that she would be prosecuted. 9, 12, 16, 20 Jenny lives at Mt. St.  Vincent’s for years and is eventually adopted. 5, 14 She’s defined as a success story given the circumstances of her life. 10, 11, 15 As she was older once she turned eighteen I had contact with her. 14, 20 During those years in between there was a social worker in Steamboat, I lived in Steamboat too. 7, 14, 19 She was really great, really wonderful. 18, 20 In one letting me know that it wasn’t my fault, that I’d done the best I could by her. 12 That story sort of comes to an end. 15 Jenny leaves, we move to Leadville, from Leadville we move to Summit County down the mountain. 15, 18 Leadville’s over ten thousand feet high, it’s a high mountain town. 7 They’re beautiful and they’re crazy. 20 Summit County, we move there. 15 Ron is still a paint contractor. 6, 19 His drug use continues. 5, 6, 13 He starts dealing drugs. 5, 6 I think around that time, I’d be sort of in and out of use. 6, 13 I think that injecting may have been something that happened occasionally, maybe more snorting. 5, 13, 15 Ron is certainly spinning out of control. 8, 17, 18 Not that he had much to start with.  Things are getting crazy. 20 I’m trying to get away from him. 18, 20 He flushed fifteen thousand dollars’ worth of cocaine down the toilet.  Frisco’s a small town, maybe there’s four thousand people. 5, 9 A tourist town, the cops don’t care. 19 It’s the wild, wild West in the mountains.  You can get away with anything you damn well please up there. 18, 20 He told me that he thought he was being followed by; he was at the Moose Jaw bar, an ambulance and a corvette. 10, 16, 17, 18 He crawled through a creek bed getting away. 14, 18, 20 AS: So he’s losing it at this point.  SP: He is losing his shit. 18 Flushes fifteen thousand dollars’ worth down the toilet.  He’s still working on job sites. 11 He travels with two guns.  AS: So he’s paranoid.  SP: Oh my God he’s so paranoid.  AS: He has guns?  SP: He’s got guns.  Yes.  He had guns.  AS: What’s your escape plan at this point?  SP: I was working on one.  We live in a couple little houses in the town of Frisco. 6, 9, 11, 13, 20 Probably non-payment of rent, whatever it was that’s why we moved. 7, 12, 15 Then we moved to this little other area of the county, Willowbrook, in this house. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19, 20 I’m trying to get away. 18, 20 To the best of my ability get away. 18, 20 I always knew that if I wanted to get away I wouldn’t be able to take much with me. 16, 18, 20 AS: And you’re at your most vulnerable when you have left or you’re about to leave. 14, 18 That’s when you’re most at risk of being killed. 14 SP: During this time this house in Willowbrook, a split level house. 6, 10, 13 I’d been cleaning condos.  He was extremely paranoid.  It’s a subdivision. 6 There’s tracks through the snow and he’d think that people were coming over to the house. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 He’d make me take my kids to work with me because he thought I was fucking somebody on the side. 9, 17, 18 It’s really a heightened state of alert. 18 I’m trying to get away. 18, 20 He’s becoming increasingly dangerous. 11 I couldn’t shower by myself.  I’m telling him I’ve got to get away. 15, 18, 20 I need a divorce.  We’re getting high so that I can talk to him. 7 It makes it so much easier.  He agrees.  His rationale is that if I went back to Southern Oregon where my mother was he’d give me a divorce.  We’re going to move together because that’s how it’s going to happen. 8, 15 I don’t know if it’s within a week of us moving, a couple days, the house is packed up. 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 I have these really good friends and old neighbors, Mary Ann and Mac. 10, 16, 18, 20 We go to their house for dinner. 6, 13 Ron had been drinking all day long. 5, 11, 16, 17 He would be so ugly, so unpredictable. 5, 10, 14 We go there for dinner, he drinks the whole way through it. 5, 18 You can read people. 9 I know that things aren’t going to be good. 10, 12 I get in the car and he’s saying shit the whole way home. 18 What happens next is that he beat me in front of my kids. 15 I think they thought I was dead. 16, 17, 18 He rapes me.  I still don’t really know how to get away from him. 12, 18, 20 The next day, I don’t remember exactly how it happens; I talked to Mary Ann and Mac. I go to their house. 6, 13, 15, 16 They see my face is just a mess. 6 They’re like, “Susie you’ve got to go.  We’re going to give you this money and you’ve got to go.” 8, 10 Little by little I start putting together a plan. 8, 20 I was never going to raise my children in a house like I grew up in. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 20 My friend Denise she goes with me. 20 We plan it.  I strategically put things through the house and the next day Ron leaves with my brother. 6, 13, 16, 18, 20 They had to go down to Denver for something.  I put my kids in the back seat and I said, “You don’t move. 15 Stay right here.” 12 I threw whatever I could throw in my car and I drove away. 5, 18, 20 I left. 14 I went to Oregon.  He follows me. 10 I knew that he was following me. 10, 16 I started out in Southern Oregon in Grants Pass.  I’ve got relatives all through.  My sister flies in and meets me, my sister Dianne. 18, 20 We drive back to Minnesota together. 5, 8 I leave Ron. 18 AS: He just follows but you didn’t see him? 6, 10 SP: Never saw him again.  No, I stayed one step ahead of him the whole time. 14 AS: Then he never comes to Minnesota? 16 SP: I think at one point he’s there looking for me.  He didn’t know where I was. 12 I lived downtown Minneapolis, I lived in the Elliot Park neighborhood. 7, 20 Another saga begins.  AS: So you never see him again? 6, 16 How do you get divorced from him? 7 You were married? 7 SP: I was still married to him. 7 I live in Elliot Park.  Oh my God the people involved in my life there, love them, love them, love them. 9, 10, 14 I come back and I’m staying with my sister Dianne over in Richfield, South Minneapolis. 7, 20 During that time, I hadn’t ever really thought about it like this, my mother had remarried and she’s living with this man in Southern Oregon. 7, 17, 18 While the time that I’m leaving and moving back to Minneapolis my mother moves back. 15 It was nuts.  She’s got my daughter Christa, I’ve got Blake. 5 Staying at my sister Dianne’s house. 6, 13, 20 I’m looking for housing, getting on welfare. 6 Five hundred and twenty eight bucks a month AFDC. 16 I think I still have a car payment to make. 12 I’m looking for places to live downtown Minneapolis and on Franklin Avenue.  Oh my God Franklin was such a dump.  It’s really sort of like a Go Ask Alice junkie crazy environment. 12, 18, 20 There hadn’t been gentrification started yet.  Somehow through all the phone calls, different things I end up with subsidized housing in the Elliot Park neighborhood. 6, 8, 16, 20 I meet this guy, Ira Simms. 18 My sister Dianne and I used to call him the black Tom Selleck of Elliot Park. 6, 13, 14, 16, 20 He was a handsome man. 17 Ira liked me.  I get to know him. 12 We get to be friends. 16, 20 He gives me a unit to live in. 19 He says he’s got a place to live.  It is 1601 Elliot, the top unit; it had been rehabbed, one of those old houses, Section Eight housing. 6, 9, 13, 19 I paid a hundred dollars a month. 16 Ira liked to smoke crack. 16 My friend Jennifer, I get reunited with her. 19, 20 Jennifer likes to do cocaine too. 16 Her plan is she’s got a good job, works for some insurance company. 9, 10, 11, 14 We’ll just buy a whole bunch and do as much as we can and get sick of it. 15 I’m not injecting but I’ve got a craving. 13 Things had happened, goofy things. 15 I started smoking crack with Ira. 6, 16 That was a horrible experience. 10, 18 I don’t know if you’ve ever tried crack. 12, 14, 16 AS: I have not tried crack. 14, 16 SP: It is toxic.  It is gross, it is disgusting.  It hurts.  I moved Jennifer in, she pays rent. 7, 15 It helps with money. 8, 10 I don’t remember.  I moved it that place in the spring maybe, March, February maybe. 5, 7, 15 I moved into this apartment. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15 Then I live there, I’m not even in there a year. 14 Ron doesn’t know where I’m at. 12 Maybe I’ve been there a few months; he doesn’t know where I am. 11, 12, 16 He had an address and a phone number for my sister. 5, 8, 16, 20 He’d been in Minneapolis looking for me.  Something weird had happened then too. 15 I got some phone calls. 8, 16 Something had happened. 15 Nothing comes of it.  I’d been warned, he goes back to Colorado.  He’d occasionally call my sister. 20 She would arrange for the kids and I to be at her house at a certain time. 6, 7, 13, 17 This is landlines, there’s no cellphones, there’s no three way call either. 8, 9, 16, 18 AS: And he never gets my phone number? 8, 16 SP: He never gets my phone number. 8, 16 Not allowed. 10 We go to my sister’s on Friday that’d she’d arranged. 7, 16, 20 At this point I’d had my kids, Christa for sure I think Blake was too young, there was a group started in Minnesota. 5 It’s the holy land of treatment, social services, all of it. 12, 13, 19 I had Christa in this newly forming group, it was called Children are People Too. 5, 16 It was for kids, I think it was in the Linden Hills neighborhood. 20 It was for kids that came from substance using parents or trauma. 6, 20 I have no idea how I got hooked up with it.  It was one of those early sort of hippie, social services. 19 We’d started that.  There’s that weekend and my sister arranges for us to be at her house for him to call. 6, 7, 13, 15, 20 He talks to the kids maybe just talked to Christa. 5 He kind of ignored Blake. 5 I have a conversation with him.  He’s nuts and I know this at this point. 12 He’s back in Colorado.  When he’d been in Oregon my mother would talk about him being catatonic and the neighbor’s yard.  He just continued down this path with this speedball, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. 16 He gets back to Colorado.  He’s living with a woman out in Plains, he calls talking crazy. 16, 20 What I remember saying to him is that, “My life would be so much better if yours was just over.” 10 Those are my parting words to him. 9 The following week, a nice day in Minneapolis, it’s warm, it’s in the seventies. 10, 15, 16, 18 I’m at Lake Nokomis with my kids.  I come back and get a phone call from my nephew and Ron’s dead. 8, 16 He stepped out of a moving car.  The county coroner from Greeley, the only number they had was my sister’s. 8, 19, 20 The county coroner in Greeley called. 8, 19 Calls and tells my nephew all of this stuff. 15 Craig thinks it could be a hoax. 17 People do crazy shit and Ron did crazy shit. 18, 20 He hung out with a bunch of people. 9 He takes down all the information and then he calls me and tells me about all of it. 15, 16, 17 I have to call Ron’s dad. 14 I have to call the county coroner. 8, 19 He was a really formidable; he’d been an executive for AT&T. 18 Ron was the youngest child and always the problem child. 12, 14, 18 I have to listen to this man tell me about all of it and how they verified that it was him.  Ron’s dead. 16 I got two kids, living in Elliot Park.  It was a come to Jesus moment, profound, life changing. 8, 10, 12, 14, 17 AS: Was it just a huge, incredible relief? 5 SP: It was so life changing. 10, 17 It was a huge relief on so many levels.  I remember thinking first and foremost that for sure I was a single parent. 14, 20 There was no optimism, no hope for the future. 9 Ron was never going to get better. 16 Very cut and dried. 5 You don’t hold out hope anymore. 9 I didn’t have to be afraid.  I could come and go.  To the degree that would be physically possible, the rest was something else. 6 AS: You didn’t have to think about the moment when he might show up and do something. 8, 12, 14 SP: Ever again.  AS: To you or the kids or sabotage you.  He’s out of the picture.  SP: He’s dead. 16 AS: He’s just what you asked for a week before. 15 SP: Yes, right. 12 AS: That’s so crazy. 20 SP: It was crazy. 20 I go to the funeral.  I go out to Colorado.  I don’t take my kids.  My brother comes down from Northern Minnesota and picks them up. 20 My friend Lisa meets me at the airport. 18, 20 She holds my hand.  It’s a visitation and I see him laying in the casket. 6 His parents put him in a suit. 20 He had been airborne. 14 He’d been in this car with this woman Holly.  Holly had no regard for life whatsoever. 10 Ron had been in this town for three months and had been eighty sixed out of most bars. 11, 16 We go to her house. 6, 13 We pick through Ron’s shit. 18 It was like picking through a garbage dump.  We listen to Holly, I’d already had a phone conversation with her and she talks about the experience and what happened that day with Ron. 8, 15, 16, 18 Kind of piecing it together. 8 They’d been drinking and in the bars. 5, 11 She talks about how in between Fort Lupton and this town of Hudson, it’s an old rural road, dark, no lights. 17 That he looked over at her and said goodbye and stepped out of the car. 10, 14 The accident report said she was going thirty, thirty five miles per hour. 13, 15 He was airborne and he hit a sign that took off the top of his head. 11, 14 He died by the side of the road. 9 It was ruled a homicide. 13 AS: He jumped out of the car? 14 SP: Supposedly yes.  He stepped out.  That was her story. 15 He’d also been prospecting for some bikers out of Boulder.  I don’t know rolled over on a dope deal somewhere. 12 He hung out with people who were intense and dangerous. 9, 11 Very little regard for life, drugs were always a part of it. 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 20 Shit happened. 15 It is a scary story isn’t it? 15 AS: So scary.  SP: I’m never real sure if I should be scared or what I should do with it. 5, 16, 19 A pause would be good. 6, 10, 13 [Break in Recording]  AS: We’re back.  Part two.  SP: Ron died.  I have my kids, Christa in some support group for little kids. 20 I go to therapy and talk about the fact that my parting words to him that it would be better if his life was over. 9, 10, 12 It was interesting in that the therapist talked a lot about, “You know you weren’t responsible for his death Sue.” 12, 16, 17, 18 I was like, “Oh, I thought that I was.” 17, 18 What a relief that is to hear somebody say it. 9 I don’t know if I internalized that message. 12 I learned a lot from it. 10 I’ve never said something like that to anybody again. 16 Maybe haven’t felt the need. 11 How powerful that was. 10, 17 From there, my sister Dianne and I we went to adult children of alcoholics meetings. 5, 6, 14, 18, 20 She introduced me. 14 We went at Abbott Hospital.  I remember thinking, it was an all-women’s group, and they might as well have been speaking Chinese because I couldn’t understand them and what they were saying. 12, 17, 18 I couldn’t contribute.  I was afraid to talk, afraid of my emotions overwhelming me.  I didn’t know how to talk about a dead husband. 12, 14, 16 Really, how do you talk about that?  AS: Not to mention all the abuse you suffered under him. 5, 6, 12, 13 You were like shell shocked.  Right?  Would that be fair to say? 9 SP: It’s easy to say that.  I think the day when I found out that he had died, I don’t know if he would talk about ghosts, stuff like that. 12, 16 I just remember thinking, “Now the bastard’s everywhere.”  In some ways there was no containing him. 18 Not being able to sleep and always looking over my shoulder, making sure that he was dead. 10, 16, 18 When I saw the body I looked for the paint under his fingernails just to make sure that it was really him. 6, 18 Because of that and that experience and being able to understand it and begin to process it then, I would say that I’m not completely done processing it. 17, 18 A real commitment to wanting to break that cycle of substance use and mental health issues. 6, 12, 13, 19 Not knowing how just knowing that it couldn’t happen. 12, 15 It was just so important to figure out the key. 9, 15 But it’s not a nice and neat little tidy package. 18, 20 It doesn’t happen like that. 15 I think that I thought if I went to therapy, if I went to school, if I did this, if I did that I would guard against it. 7, 12, 17, 18 If my kids had a college education, if I had a college education. 7, 14, 15 If I made more money, if I did this, if I did that. 8, 10 That’s bullshit. 18 That’s not happening. 15 I don’t know if it was a year. 12, 14 My desire was to get back to Colorado.  It wasn’t long after Ron died, maybe the following fall, a year; I’m not sure how long. 5, 10, 14, 17 Within a couple years I was back in Colorado. 11, 14 I started out managing a Safeway grocery store, their delicatessen. 18 The sense that I could be and do something more.  I could rise above it and made a better wage and worked there, health insurance and creating a better life. 10, 19 I married again. 7 I have a son Kelly.  The marriage lasted a couple years. 11, 14 We moved back to Minneapolis. 7, 15 I went back to school for the third time. 7 During the time that Ron died I tried to go back to school. 7 I was going to go to St. Mary’s.  It’s part of St. Kate’s now and be a chemical dependency counselor. 9, 12, 13 That wasn’t happening. 15 I didn’t make it in school. 7 I went back to Colorado.  Came back, went back to school at MCTC and started in Women’s Studies. 7, 12 I had success.  I did well in school, I learned and it opened up other worlds. 7, 10 I made a decision to get a divorce. 14 Jim was an improvement over Ron. 12 He still had a drug use history, verbally abusive. 5, 6, 13, 15 I went back to school and that saved my life. 7, 10 It was the beginning of Women With a Point. 11, 12 I did projects related to needle exchange. 5, 10 I read a book The Opposing Viewpoints Series on AIDS.  They had talked about needle exchange in it. 10 They’d also talked about gay men. 9, 12 It was a woman who wrote it, her brother had died of AIDS. 20 She described it as a twisted celebration of an immoral life. 10, 14 I thought, “Wow, how could you say something like that?” 17, 18 Isn’t that horrible? 10 It prompted something in me.  I should go back and say that around the time that Ron died, I was trying to get a divorce.  Living in Elliot Park, I had a neighbor Susan Beecher.  She’s a photographer in Minneapolis, a wonderful human being. 18, 19 She was my neighbor.  I had people across the street. 9 I had a legal aid attorney that lived across the street handling my case. 7, 17 They were trying to serve him by publication when he died. 19 I was still married to him. 7 I got social security for my kids, survivor benefits. 15, 19 I got survivor benefits for me. 15 It raised me up and out of poverty a little bit. 14, 20 It was such a life changing event. 10, 17 In so many ways. 18 The aftermath of it still continues. 17 Ron never really got fully talked about I don’t think. 14, 16, 18 In that I tried to share with my kids only good stories about Ron. 9, 10 AS: Do they remember anything about Ron?  SP: Certainly Christa does.  Blake has never really talked about him. 5, 16, 18 Blake had said when he died, one day we were in the car and he’s in the backseat and he’s like, “Can’t believe my dad’s dead meat.” 5, 14, 16 I’m like, “Alrighty.” 12 One time we were in the art museum and there was an exhibit, maybe it was at the Walker, it was a pile of what looked like dog bones. 5, 6, 8, 13, 20 He looks at me and he’s like, “Are those my dad’s bones?” 8, 14 I’m like, “Wow.”  I think the first thing that he had said or Christa said when I told them that Ron was dead, they said, “Now we don’t have to be afraid anymore.” 14, 16 It was huge.  My daughter Christa has struggled all her life around the death of her dad. 10, 14, 18 She was diagnosed bipolar when she was fifteen.  Maybe she was seventeen, depressive before that. 10 Certainly in retrospect, in knowing more I can say that at age eight for sure that Christa had trauma. 12 Things would happen. 15 I didn’t recognize it for what it was. 17 I didn’t know until later. 12 She’s always struggled. 18 AS: How old was she when Ron died?  SP: Six.  I had a book it was called How to Deal with When a Parent Dies.  I always bought books. 18 You read something.  I tried to figure it out and navigate it.  Christa is a story in and of herself that we could talk about for a long time. 15, 17 Her drug use and her struggle with mental health issues. 5, 6, 12, 13, 19 The impact on us as a family, the impact on her children now. 5, 12, 14, 20 She lives up in the mountain with my brother. 20 Her behavior is like her dad’s. 14 She’s somewhat dangerous. 11 She’s been homeless on the streets of Fort Collins for years and in and out of jail. 5, 14 She was released to me two different times.  AS: From jail?  SP: Prison.  There’s very few treatment programs for women in Colorado, very few. 12, 13 Writing fraudulent prescriptions at the King’s Super grocery store and she was arrested there. 10 AS: She was writing her own prescriptions? 10 SP: She’d gotten out of prison, she was released to me.  She was out a month. 16 She had two different doctor appointments. 12, 14 Where are you the mom and where are you always the outreach worker? 12, 14, 18, 19 She stole a prescription pad somewhere along the line. 9, 10 Then she wrote it and she tried to cash it at a King’s Super in the pharmacy. 14 It’s a big grocery store.  We were there grocery shopping together. 8, 15 I had no idea that she was back in that space.  She was still on probation, all of these obligations.  We’re grocery shopping and she looks at me and says, “I don’t feel very good. 10, 15 I want to just go sit in the car.”  I’m thinking, “Whatever, I’m stuck with groceries.  I hate grocery shopping.” 15 Then I’m up at the self-checkout doing my thing and I see Christa walk back in. 6, 16 I think, “She came back in to help me.”  She was being led in by a cop. 14 She was arrested as she walked out the door. 16 She was taken to jail in Jefferson County, in Golden, and held there.  She was transferred to the prison in Denver. 5, 17 SP: It started in the end of September in 2015.  She was released, went back, got out in May of 2016.  It’s your daughter and you’re the mother so what do you do?  You can’t say, “No, she can’t be released here.”  She doesn’t have anywhere to go. 8 She’s burnt all her bridges.  She’s been in fights in Fort Collins where she’s broken people’s bones, very violent. 8, 9 You can see your baby, your little girl. 6, 7, 20 You can see all those other things about her. 6 You let her in and then the same old stuff just starts happening again. 15 I put her out.  I told her, “This is it.” 16 I think that to some degree I lost hope. 9, 11 I can’t fix her.  I’m not responsible anymore. 16 I’m not the only parent. 20 There are things beyond my control. 18 I’ve always thought that I could fix everything because that’s what I do. 17, 18 I have always done that. 18 Why shouldn’t it work now? 12 I tried so hard. 9 She lives with my youngest brother in this trailer. 20 They’re both nuts.  They both have substance use issues. 6, 12, 13 AS: Where are her kids?  SP: The kids live with her dad in Fort Collins. 14 He’s got issues too. 12, 13 Not quite in the same way that Christa does. 11, 18 He’s got a young girlfriend. 7, 20 He’s forty six or something.  Chrissy, the girlfriend, just turned twenty three in February. 7, 20 She has been the glue that has kept everything together. 8 Zach is twelve and angry. 11 He’s seen a lot. 6 Christa started off really good with Zach when he was born. 10, 14, 18 He got the best of Christa.  Then when she was pregnant with Kieran, seven months old, in Tacoma she was in a car accident. 7, 10, 11, 13, 16 Doctor prescribed opiates and Xanax. 10 She was off to the races.  Kieran was born and in many ways ignored. 5, 14, 18 Then a couple years later she gets pregnant with Lisa. 7, 10, 11, 14 Lisa’s born with an opiate habit in the NICU unit a month early in Fort Collins. 14, 16, 19, 20 Not long after, she was a year, Bobby and Christa fell apart. 9, 11, 14, 17 Bobby’s had the kids ever since. 10 They spent a year homeless in Fort Collins. 14 They got a place to live.  A guy who’s a lawyer and I don’t know exactly how he got involved in there. 12, 13 Bobby was profiled in the Fort Collins newspaper with the kids. 15, 16 The story about Christa abandoning them, which just is fucked up. 15 AS: A newspaper story? 15, 16 SP: Christa was just devastated by the story. 15 They could argue it as not being true. 5 It was certainly judgmental of her. 8, 12, 17 AS: Why was there a story? 15 SP: I don’t know. 12 I think Bobby was involved in some helping program.  Maybe it was Thanksgiving or Christmas and they want to do that story about people that need help—human interest. 9, 15, 19 I can find out the details and I’ll send it to you.  AS: Back up to you were talking about Ron and his impact on Christa.  Then we were talking about Jim and Kelly was born. 14 You were going to MCTC taking Women’s Studies and then divorced Jim? 7, 11, 12 SP: Yes.  I thought that school was really good therapy. 7, 10, 12, 17, 18 I learned a lot. 10 I think really between Women’s Studies and I was in a Sociology class, “Sex, Marriage, and the Family.” 7, 12, 18 That was helpful. 9 It provided a level of education for me that I needed and lacked, a sense of understanding. 14, 15, 17, 18 I’ve always been a reader. 18 I don’t put a lot of stock in outside sources. 9 I never grew up with a family where you could check things out. 12, 16, 20 I always went to a book. 18 Education meant so much for me. 14 It opened up a world that I could never have imagined. 16 It signaled the way out. 11, 18 I did really well. 18 I had a 3.8 the whole way through. 18 I worked on the project to create Women With a Point. 5, 12 I did some early project management class or something. 5, 7, 12 This is where I keep getting hung up.  I volunteered in domestic violence in Minneapolis after the whole Ron thing. 5, 6 Right in there.  That’s where I wanted to go. 18 AS: I was going to ask you.  SP: With the domestic abuse project. 5, 6, 13 I don’t know if that still exists anymore. 12 AS: It’s right on Franklin. 12 SP: Oh my God.  They used to have, there was like Project Neon or something. 6, 13, 16 I volunteered. 5 I went to those groups. 12 I volunteered. 5 I used to carry a pager. 6, 13, 14, 16 I’d do on-site visits with women. 12 When there was a domestic and an automatic arrest then we made contact with the women. 12 That was really, really a powerful experience. 10, 17, 18 It moved me in a different direction. 7, 15, 18 The involvement of it and supportive community and trying to figure that out. 12, 19 Really a level of involvement always in the community. 12, 18, 19 That’s what brought me in, it brought me to it.  It was harm reduction before I ever even had heard the term. 5, 9, 14, 17 There was that background in domestic violence. 6 Going back to Colorado, coming back to Minneapolis, going to school, getting involved in volunteering through Minnesota AIDS Project, internships. 7 AS: Did you finish your bachelor’s degree?  I did, I finished it.  I did that at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, in Tacoma.  I went back to school to finish it in 2004. 7 It was a writing from life program. 10 I got credit for building… 5, 19 AS: Did you go there to live?  SP: Yes.  I started Women With a Point in Minneapolis and through that I met Dave. 12 You know my third husband, Dave Purchase. 12, 14 AS: Back up about Women With a Point. 12 You started Women With a Point in? 12 In ‘95 I was an intern at the Street Scene Program.  I think I mentioned that, through Catholic Charities. 8, 12 I met this man Frank Guzman.  Frank, old Latino man, he was something.  He brought me to my first homeless shelter. 14 Frank was also working for Minnesota AIDS Project on the Main Line, the first needle exchange in Minneapolis. 10, 14 AS: It was called the Main Line?  SP: Yes, it was named after Bill Main.  AS: Is it M-A…  There’re so many things about that that work.  Then there was a volunteer or if I don’t remember if she was working part time there, Toni St. Pierre. 9 A labor and delivery nurse.  Toni had her own history of drug use, heroin where mine was cocaine. 5, 6, 13, 15, 16 Toni lost her children. 5, 11, 14, 20 She was big into NA and AA in Minnesota.  Certainly during the time of Ron, my family, “Oh Susie, you need to go to treatment. 12, 13 Oh Susie’s not going to treatment.” 12, 13 Worried about my kids.  The religious piece, all of those things that I saw as problematic. 12 I could go to school and do other things and just work my way through it. 7, 18 The treatment wasn’t a necessity for me. 12, 13 Really coming to harm reduction that way. 5, 14, 18 AS: So you met Toni.  SP: I met Toni and met Frank, met another woman named Gail Thomas.  She was working for Seton, which was part of Catholic Charities. 9 She knew about the idea of harm reduction. 5, 14, 16 We would start talking about it.  Through Frank and Toni I got involved volunteering for, there was another needle exchange program at the time, called Safe Works AIDS Project. 10 Run by this guy Michael Scavuzzo.  Michael was sort of a scandalous guy.  But he had this needle exchange. 10 We both volunteered there. 5 AS: Why was he a scandalous guy?  Just the nature of his life? 10 SP: Who he was and how things happened. 15 He was kind of slimy.  Scavuzzo.  People around in the business knew him. 16 Noel Grey knew him. 16 Lorraine knew him. 16 He was a troublemaker.  In some way she made really good points. 10, 18 He was a grassroots activist.  He wanted to see things happen differently than Minnesota AIDS Project was doing them. 6, 15, 18 He saw the necessity for having a stronger response. 13 This is mid-90s and people are dying of AIDS. 9 They’re getting infected through injection drug use. 5, 6, 13 Minnesota’s slow to respond. 10 Fucked up shit. 18 Michael also had a connection with Dan Big in Chicago with Chicago Recovery Alliance. 13 There’s this small network and I get involved with them.  Toni and I decide that we’re doing good work for Michael but we could do something different and really focus on women and get away from him. 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 We created Women With a Point. 12 It was incorporated in September of 1996.  We had a startup kick from NASEN, the North American Syringe Exchange Network.  At the time I think they gave seven hundred dollars’ worth of supplies, syringes, cottons, cookers.  Then Toni put in, she would put in a lot of her own money. 8, 10 We worked out of our houses. 6, 9, 13 We didn’t have an office space.  We started on Curry Avenue.  People knew me down there because at that time working for a paycheck at the same time. 16 I was working in direct services at Catholic Charities where in the branch they used to have showers and hygiene bags. 6, 13, 16, 18, 19 You can have a locker for people who are homeless. 9 I worked down there.  Many people knew me. 9, 16 When they’d see me on the streets down on Curry Avenue they were less afraid to talk to me. 5, 6 I had this outreach bag that looked like a big gym bag. 12 It had a sharps container in the bottom. 9 Then we had syringes and all the various supplies that went with that.  There were probably less then then there are now. 12 Probably cottons and cookers, condoms, granola bars, socks.  Some form of printed information but being able to talk to people and say, “This is what we’re doing. 9 Do you need any of this?”  It was funny because people were offended. 9 It’s kind of a knee jerk response. 13 There’s never been outreach related to AIDS in the same way on Curry Avenue. 12, 16, 18 There had been the van; we can talk for a long time. 17 There’s a lot.  AS: We might have to have a part two. 9 SP: There is a van.  Frank and Will don’t really get out of the van very much to talk. 18 It parks on Curry Avenue.  The Mainline when it opens, Lorraine… 9 Where is Curry Avenue?  SP: Curry  Avenue, you know where the bus station is downtown Minneapolis? 12 It’s back behind there.  Target Field is down in that area now. 8, 12 That took away, before Target Field was there. 18, 20 There was Mary Jo Copeland had another shelter down there.  AS: Was Catholic Charities?  SP: Catholic Charities had branch two down there which was really a shitty shelter down on Curry Avenue. 18 AS: So that’s gone? 8, 11 SP: The building still exists but the shelter had been closed for years. 5, 9, 10, 14, 19 That was horrible. 10 That was like a Dickens novel.  You’d put men and women, drunk and sober into one room that was poorly lit and you’d shut the door. 5, 8, 12, 14 AS: So there’s a van?  SP: Frank and Will, they don’t really get out of the van much to talk to people or provide a level of education. 9, 14, 15, 18 I think Frank used it for nap time mainly. 6, 13, 16 AS: Who was in charge of the van?  Was this an organization?  SP: Minnesota AIDS Project.  The Mainline van. 9 Minnesota  AIDS Project was approached by Minneapolis Board of Health because they want a needle exchange program in Minneapolis. 10 Minnesota  AIDS Project was the service provider. 19 It’s the main game in the state.  They were approached about having a needle exchange. 10 Lorraine didn’t seek it out. 6 I don’t think she necessarily wanted it. 18 She’s from Eaton House and abstinence based education. 6, 13, 14, 15 They’re approached.  They held a lot of community meetings. 18, 19 The Whittier neighborhood was particularly contentious. 9, 20 They don’t want this visible presence of junkies, even though AIDS. 10 MAP, they hide the van.  They hide it on Curry Avenue.  There were three sites at the time.  There was Curry Avenue, and then there’s a place on the West Bank down under this bridge it was an awful place, then they had one place on the North Side that they used to park. 6, 11, 13, 16 If you didn’t know the van you wouldn’t necessarily know. 12 AS: It’s not marked? 5 SP: It’s green and white. 19 Oftentimes the doors were shut.  Frank liked to nap.  Will talked to people a little bit but he just sat in the seat. 9, 20 It was a new program. 16 Nobody really knew it was a needle exchange. 10, 16, 18 There was a research component attached to it. 8 Needle exchange has always been a grey area whether it was legal or illegal in Minnesota. 8, 10, 18 The understanding was that if there was a research component attached to it, it was legal. 8, 14, 17, 18 I think that program had maybe been in existence for a year when we started Women With a Point. 5, 12, 14 Women With a Point did not have a research component attached to it. 8, 12 We were not invited by the city of Minneapolis to have a needle exchange. 10, 14 We didn’t ask anybody if we could have a needle exchange. 10 We had outreach bags and we went to Curry Avenue and we did outreach every Tuesday. 12, 16 We did outreach in other parks in South Minneapolis. 12 It’s now a record store, I just went by there today on 26th and Nicollet was a pharmacy. 12, 16 AS: That record store right across from that bar and the CC Club. 12 Then French Meadow is right there. 12 SP: That might be Lyndale.  It’s 26th and Nicollet.  It’s now a record store that had moved maybe from Uptown. 5, 7, 12, 15 It used to be a pharmacy there. 6, 13, 16 That was sort of junkie central in the Whittier neighborhood. 20 We do outreach in that area. 8, 12 We get the office space on 24th and Nicollet in the Waldorf Building on the first floor in the back. 14 We get static office space there.  It’s supposed to just be static office space.  We really start creating the infrastructure of Women With a Point. 12, 15, 18 Bill Main, the man that the needle exchange at MAP is named after is getting really sick. 10, 15, 18 He was living with AIDS.  He has a seat on the HIV/AIDS Prevention Task Force, the governor’s task force for the state of Minnesota. 8 There’s a prevention task force, CDC mandated group. 8, 10, 13, 19 If a city is getting Ryan White dollars, prevention dollars, they’re mandated to have a state planning body. 10, 13, 19 It had seats; Bill Main was the injection drug abusers seat. 5, 6, 13 I was asked to replace him.  I think I was an anomaly.  AS: Who asked you?  SP: Somebody through the Health Department. 9, 12 We’re starting to get some recognition.  The founding board of Women With a Point is made up of Gail Thomas from Seton. 12 She’s got a good reputation, very involved in the community. 10, 14, 19 There is Frank Guzman, there’s Kevin Sitter.  Kevin at the time was working for the Red Door Clinic.  He’s got a master’s degree in Public Health and one other master’s.  Unbelievable human being. 19 I think Kevin sat on the task force at that time. 8 Maybe Frank.  I was getting to know all of these people. 9, 12 Here’s this woman, white skin and blue eyes and presents well and she’s starting a needle exchange. 5, 10, 19 They want some of that.  I was good to have at the table. 10 I represented demographics well and all of that. 5, 10 There was another woman, Emma Eskell-Singe.  She was the founding board of directors. 18, 19 She was a methadone counselor for Hennepin County; they had the methadone program over on Chicago, 1800. 6, 8, 13 We’re building the infrastructure, a board of directors, non-profit status, applying for grants. 15, 18, 19 The Indian AIDS Task Force is in the mix, Nick Metcalf.  We had gotten this startup kit from NASEN.  It’s all happening simultaneously. 15 We got a small grant.  I can’t remember how that was administered, sort of the timeline. 5, 9 We’d gotten a small grant through Hennepin County to do a brief connect or brief services for people who were HIV positive due to injection drug use in the services. 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 That paid my salary as this is changing. 17 Needle exchange is so separate from the other services, the dollars, everything. 10, 19 It was so political which can’t be underestimated, how political it was.  I’m doing needle exchange. 10 We’re building this board. 19 We’ve got these people. 9 I’m sitting on the task force. 8 There is money available, an RFP is issued and it’s clearly defined which target populations, where the money’s earmarked for, and how you want to apply. 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 I don’t know if it was a general category for IDU, injection drug users. 5, 6, 12, 13 I had been probably at the first harm reduction conference. 5, 14 I had just been back from there.  The first harm reduction conference was in ‘96 in Oakland. 5, 14 I’d gone to that conference.  I had been in the Mission District of San Francisco.  There’s a women’s program that runs on Thursday nights, still runs on Thursday nights. 8, 12, 16 They provided low-level health care in the back. 10, 19 Pregnancy tests, pelvic exams, they did exchange, they had food, they had support. 10 They exchanged eight thousand syringes a month out of that program. 10, 13, 16 I just remember thinking, “Wow, I could do something like that.”  I applied for a grant from the Health Department. 9, 12 I think there was three hundred thousand that was available and we asked for two hundred and eighty nine.  People would tell me, Kevin Sitter, he just minded everything.  At first we’re having the conversation and I said, “I don’t want to apply for that money. 8, 10, 14 Make bleach kits?”  You couldn’t buy syringes.  You couldn’t have syringes.  You couldn’t fund needle exchange using that money. 6, 8, 10 It was so ridiculous on so many levels. 14 We applied for the money. 8, 10 It was Gail Thomas and I who wrote that grant together. 8 It was all based on the idea that we would provide comprehensive harm reduction based services for injection drug users and really use the women’s program in the Mission as the model. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19 We got it.  We got just about every single dime that we asked for.  AS: Is this from the Ryan White?  SP: These are prevention dollars that came through the Health Department. 9, 12 They start with the CDC.  It was defined as prevention dollars or Ryan White dollars. 10, 11, 19 Ryan  White was always for services for people who were already positive. 9, 18, 19 AS: Just to be clear, the political part was when you got the money from the prevention dollars you can’t buy needles. 8, 9, 10, 19 SP: You couldn’t fund anything needle exchange related. 10 AS: Why, if using needles prevented people from getting HIV? 6, 9, 10 SP: There is a federal ban on needle exchange. 8, 10 To some degree it’s been lifted.  AS: But it remains?  SP: To some degree, yes.  I can’t think of the name of the legislation that’s prohibiting federally to fund needle exchange. 8, 10, 20 AS: It’s like what they’re doing with Planned Parenthood right now. 12 Right?  Around federal funds, they can decide what it’s used for. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16 SP: Kind of like the global gag rule. 13 It’s all sort of in that same mix.  At that point when I was starting there was a federal ban on needle exchange. 8, 10 Even though they hadn’t really certified the science yet. 18 They weren’t going to fund it.  My husband, Dave, testified before Congress for lifting the federal ban. 8, 14 He also was instrumental in working with all the programs in New York. 12 Getting all the needle exchange programs set up in New York. 10 Dave worked with Sam Friedman, Don Dejarle, just an amazing group of people. 9 He’d started the program in Tacoma in 1988.  The first legal needle exchange publically funded was Tacoma. 8, 10, 14, 19 It’s illegal to fund needle exchange. 10 I get prevention dollars. 10, 19 AS: Can this fund your salary?  SP: It can fund my salary and I can hire staff.  We move out of the little office on 24th. 15, 20 I have a bookkeeper named Jules Freeman, he’ll be there.  Jules used to be a bartender at the Gay 90s back in the day. 6, 13, 16 He’s a wonderful human being. 18, 19 Jules is my bookkeeper.  He comes to me through Kevin Sitter.  I think through Jules I get a commercial real estate agent, I can’t think of his name.  A little guy, he was educated at Pepperdine as a lawyer. 13, 14, 20 He’s doing commercial real estate.  He’s looking for a space for us.  He’d say to me, “Sue what do I tell people the kind of work you do? 9 What are you going to do in this space?”  I said, “You just tell them that we’re going to do a little HIV prevention with women. 10, 12, 19, 20 We got 11 W 15th Street.  In between Nicollet and LaSalle.  AS: I drove by it after I met Rae. 5 SP: It’s turning into something else. 20 I drove by it yesterday. 5, 16 It must be something else again.  It’s the perfect location. 17 It’s owned by people who don’t really care about what I’m doing. 9, 18, 19 They want their rent money. 8, 10 Chickie was the daughter; the dad’s name was David. 14 David was eighty years old when I met him. 14 He had been a social worker back in the day. 16, 19 He liked me.  They never asked questions. 16 It had a back door, it had a front door.  We were able to build it out so that there were offices.  I hired David Hamilton. 5 Before that I had already hired one woman. 5 She came when I was still at the Waldorf, 24th and Nicollet.  Laura Collins, she had come from the methadone program. 6, 8 She was working for me part time. 9 When we got this grant and moved to the other space Laura came along and I got David. 7, 15, 17 Then there were a couple funded positions and I got this woman Patrice McCauley. 8, 11 Then not long after we got that space we applied for a grant with the CDC which got funded. 8, 17 We were the first needle exchange in the United States to have a directly funded CDC grant. 8, 10, 14, 18 Not used for needle exchange but for wraparound services for all the other stuff. 6, 10, 13, 16, 19 In the time, in the mid-90s if you said harm reduction people automatically thought needle exchange. 5, 9, 10, 14, 17, 18 Needle exchange is only one harm reduction strategy. 5, 10, 14 There’s so much more.  We had those wraparound services. 19 Money was just coming to us. 8 There wasn’t another women run program in the United States. 8, 12 We got unsolicited money. 8, 10 We got money from the Liz Taylor Foundation; eight thousand dollars came in the mail. 8, 10 There was a Public Welfare Foundation initiative.  Public Welfare Foundation is out of D.C. to fund seven or nine harm reduction programs in the United States that were exemplary so that we could lead the way. 5, 14, 18 Women With a Point was chosen. 12 AS: So you’re serving women. 12 Are you just serving primarily women? 12 SP: We wanted to focus on women and not to ignore men. 12, 18 AS: Tell me how that came about.  SP: I would say to people, “Women With a Point, we have a point to make and a point to give.” 9, 12 Toni and I were two women who certainly had a point to make related to injection drug use. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 17 Double entendre. 5 There’s so much.  I don’t know how long you want to have me talk about this. 12, 17 I can stay as long as you want. 17 I want to be respectful of your time too.  The more we talk about this the more stuff I come up with.  That I think is important but I don’t know where you’re at. 9, 12 AS: I’m enjoying listening.  I think just for our sake we should wrap it up by four so that we don’t get a little loopy. 20 Then I’d like to meet again before you go home. 18 To just talk again.  What’s going to happen is we’re going to both think of things. 15 I’m going to have questions and you’re going to remember stuff.  SP: There’s going to be a lot.  AS: Maybe we can carve out a couple hours before you go home. 11, 15 SP: Absolutely.  AS: Whether that’s up north or whether it’s before.  That’s good. 10 What was going through my head was this idea about first of all what you’d been through in having been raised in a very violent family where you weren’t safe. 12, 14 Then you married someone where you weren’t safe and you had to flee from him. 7, 16 Then you help women who you’d walked in their shoes. 12, 16 Then you make this organization that is primarily for women but you’re also willing to not exclude men. 12 To me thinking about that as a historian, by the 90s we’re twenty years past the second wave women’s movement. 12, 14, 15 In the 90s it was considered meaningless. 5, 9 You had taken these Women’s Studies classes. 7, 12 I’m just thinking about how you thought, to me it’s making perfect sense how it came out this way. 10, 17, 18 How you approached it as a safe space for women that didn’t exclude men when twenty years before the only safe places for women who wanted to talk about things was when there were no men allowed. 10, 12, 14, 18 Did any part of gay men’s participation; is there any role that gay men played for the HIV, that whole movement or Act Up or any of that? 9, 10, 12, 15 Did any of that come to play in your thinking?  Or is it just that you wanted to center women? 12, 14, 18 Not to the exclusion of men but to center women so they knew that they were safe coming there. 12, 16 SP: Absolutely.  Based on our own experiences. 18 Certainly knowing enough in terms of HIV prevention that you didn’t exclude people. 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 The focus was certainly on women. 8, 12, 17 AS: Women had been dismissed in the early AIDS epidemic as not being at risk. 12, 13 SP: That’s right. 12 How shortsighted is that. 18 If you look at injection drug use and you look at modes of transmission, you look at women trading sex for drugs. 5, 6, 12, 13, 17 You look at women trying to support small children through sex work or the inability to carry more than two condoms on you at a time. 5, 12, 14, 20 AS: They can’t carry two condoms?  SP: I think it’s three actually. 7 I don’t know that I’ve ever known of any city in the United States where it’s expressly written on the books that it’s a crime. 10, 11, 12 It’s commonly known that sex workers can’t carry more than three condoms at a time because that proves that you’re a sex worker. 11, 12, 19 You’ve got to be careful. 19 We could talk all day long. 16, 17 There’s just so much.  I think that always recognizing the vulnerability of women. 12, 18 AS: That’s a very known thing in all global feminism. 11, 12 The whole world round we know that where women are suffering, where girls aren’t being educated there’s a problem. 7, 11, 12, 14 That the society is at risk. 12 When you educate the women, when you educate the girls, you take care of families your society can flourish. 7, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 SP: Exactly.  The way that I’ve always thought about it, I’m sure generated out of my own life experiences, men were fine in their place. 10, 11, 12, 17, 18 I was never really sure where their place was and how it fit in. 15, 16, 18 I didn’t dislike them.  I thought women needed something more, new. 12, 16, 17, 18 I thought for sure that the creation of Women With a Point was just some hair brained crazy scheme. 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 But then you got recognition.  SP: I’m sure that my staff thought I was nuts too. 17, 18 We’re creating it as we went along. 17 My colleagues are on the West Coast and they’re on the East Coast.  They weren’t in Minnesota.  They weren’t in the holy land of treatment. 12, 13 They weren’t where abstinence rules. 13 Where Hazelden is the mothership.  The Minnesota Model.  Lorraine Teal had given me a stern lecture when she first found out about what we were going to do. 14 I thought, “Fuck you bitch. 17, 18, 20 I am never going to be in this position again.” 16 I hold my own really well. 18 So we open that storefront.  We don’t really have a name on the door. 18 You’ve got to kind of know where we are. 12 We’ve had this whole delivery service that had become wildly successful. 19 AS: With your matchbooks.  SP: Matchbooks and gay men and people were just coming out. 9, 12 They were hearing about us, word of mouth. 9 We were trustworthy.  AS: You opened your doors.  I was going to ask you to tell me who’s coming in.  SP: One morning in particular, it’s early; three women of color came through, almost one right after the other. 9, 12 The backroom of that little space, it’s like the broom closet. 9, 10, 14, 20 It’s maybe two hundred square feet. 5 It’s got a back door.  It’s like closet. 9, 10 We had to do it separately.  That space had to be paid for separately.  The rent had to be paid for separately.  Everything was separate but in the same building. 19 I would see Gary Novating; he was in charge in the prevention department. 6, 9, 10, 12, 19 He’d be like, “Sue, I hope you’re not spending any of that money on needle exchange.” 8, 9, 10 It’s like, “Gary, not a dime.”  Separate bank accounts.  Being so meticulous.  There was no way I was going to do anything that would jeopardize what we had. 18 Understanding the politics, being really savvy to that. 14, 18 These women, they came through. 12 They’d go in the needle exchange room and come out and then they would leave. 10, 14, 18 I remember looking at whoever was working with me and I’d say, “Wow, it is working.  Did you see who just came through the door?” 6 It’s important. 9 Demographics, women of color who are using injection drugs, preventing HIV, Hep C, all of that. 5, 6, 10, 12 They found a home.  They came in and they found out that the cops didn’t jump out or they didn’t get busted or there was no shame. 14 There was no judgement. 12 They could come back.  They could bring their friends. 16, 20 I got a grant through Minnesota Women’s Fund. 12 I’d had a relationship with them, had been funded. 8, 19 There were some grant funds available through them.  They were banking dollars.  I can’t remember exactly how that RFP was written.  I had this idea, we had a women’s users group. 6, 12, 13 That was the start of the women’s users group. 6, 12, 13 We had a general group, but then a women’s one. 12 I called the potential funder, this is who I am and this is what I want to do with this money. 6, 8, 10 I want to create a financial planning education for drug using women. 5, 6, 12, 14, 15 I talked about what that might look like and my ideas. 18 I said, “You’ve got to tell me right now. 12 If you won’t consider this idea I won’t consider applying because I don’t want to waste my time.” 9 She encouraged me to apply.  We got funded. 8 There was a women’s users group. 6, 12, 13 How to manage your drug habit on a budget? 5, 6, 20 AS: Is that what happens at the user’s group? 6, 13, 15 SP: This is what happens at the user’s group. 6, 13, 15 They would look at me like, “Sue you are nuts.”  It’s never supposed to be that conversation. 14, 16 The conversation is about being sober, paying your rent, not buying drugs or even considering it. 5, 6, 9, 14 This was about banking and how you can have a habit. 20 You can pay your rent.  You can budget your money. 8, 10 Drug use is not mutually exclusive from organization. 6, 13 Your life is not chaotic. 10 You can plan.  You can recognize that this is part of it and it serves a role in your life. 9, 10, 17 Being able to open that discussion because those are never the messages. 16 “It’s bad, you’re wrong.” 11 “You’re an awful mother. 11 You don’t love your children.” 5, 14, 20 How much stigma can you heap on? 9 Then you work at dismantling that and providing another point of view.  It’s perceived as outrageous and over the top.  Probably to some degree blasphemy in the holy land.  It’s working.  AS: You’re leading them to a place where they might not need to use. 6, 13 SP: Yes.  AS: They can make that decision on their own. 14 SP: They can have a little more power and control. 17, 18, 20 AS: Which is very different than saying they have to get to rock bottom. 9, 14 SP: No shit, right. 12, 18 That’s ridiculous. 14 It’s so punitive. 19 It’s so judgmental. 12 AS: It’s also death. 18 SP: It’s death. 18 I had been one of those women. 12 For some reason I have a very creative, innovative, survival force in me. 8 To be able to share that with other women has always been my driving force. 5, 8, 12, 14, 18 Continues to be.  Never to ignore, if we just male, female but it’s so much more.  It’s huge.  My friend Lisa gave me a framed print that says, “Trust your crazy ideas.” 15, 18, 20 AS: Women With a Point, ‘96 things start happening. 12, 15 How long are you at the helm? 17 Where’s Toni at this point?  SP: Toni is out at this point.  It’s a hard piece. 9 AS: You don’t have to go into it in great detail. 20 SP: Toni was out before the storefront.  I learned a lot about perceived boundary violations and other people’s opinions and ideas and rules around all of it. 9, 10, 13, 18 Toni was one of those.  So we have the storefront.  We apply for CDC funding.  That was help.  Huge application.  It’s the start of it.  Through that announcement I start with the project officer. 5, 8, 12 I think I started with Dan Big in Chicago. 13 Dan, looking for a little wisdom, “Sue I wouldn’t even waste my time. 20 They always ignore us. 18 It’s the CDC and they’re stupid.”  Just where needle exchange was and all the politics of it. 10 Dan advises me against applying.  I call the project officer and once again say this is who I am, this is what I’m doing. 5, 8 I’ve got a needle exchange in Minneapolis and I’m seeing injection drug users. 5, 6, 10, 13 I said, “If you’re not going to think about funding me, if I don’t have an opportunity to really compete tell me now.” 12, 18, 19 It’s like writing a thesis.  He encourages me to apply.  David and I, it’s like a couple days before. 11, 14, 16 We’re having this conversation and David’s the grant writer about where the grants are at and what we might have coming.  He brings up the CDC grant.  I said, “I wouldn’t ever think about that.”  We just did it for the experience; we’ll never see the money. 6, 8, 10, 16, 18 I get a phone call the next day from the CDC from the project supervisor. 5, 8, 16 I was on my way to the theater with a friend and I remember I almost drove off the road. 5, 18, 20 They’d funded us. 8 They had funded us. 8 We went from year one probably a ten thousand budget to within four years we are at seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 14 It was huge.  Through that it was testing and case management, I might have some of the documents in here. 12, 14, 17 Rae came along with that grant. 17 Rae had dreadlocks. 5 I had twelve employees.  We got the building next door expanded as well. 19 We had office space, we had user groups. 6, 12, 13 We were known as the hottest gig in town. 11, 12 We were known nationwide and beyond. 11, 12 It was a big deal.  We had a lot of success.  We did testing in the jails and in drug court and providing prevention education in prisons. 5, 6, 10, 14, 15, 19 Comprehensive harm reduction in a way that doesn’t happen ever again here. 5, 10, 14, 15, 18 AS: Was that part of your HepC, was the grant from the CDC? 9 You started doing testing or was that after you were gone?  SP: The first CDC grant provided testing. 14 That originally directly funded grant. 8, 18 Then because we had that first directly funded grant it opened us up to other pots of money. 6, 8, 10, 14, 18 That’s where we had the research project that never went anywhere that Noel was part of. 5, 8, 9, 16 HepC testing…  SP: I’m pretty sure but I don’t remember. 10 The CDC grant that was really more about the beginning of HIV testing, rapid testing. 11, 18 You didn’t have to send somebody to the Red Door for a blood test.  Before that there wasn’t any swab or anything.  HepC, I don’t know if HepC testing started after me or while I was there. 12 It would be good to have Rae and I in the same room together. 8, 10, 14 Maybe we’ll do that.  SP: I stayed there until fall of 2001.  I resigned as executive director and went to work for a company out of Australia for Fit Packs. 11, 14, 18, 19 That’s another project that we had. 5 That was replicated in New York.  AS: What’s a Fit Pack?  SP: A Fit Pack is a personal sharps container.  It’s a little black plastic container about this big. 20 It’s sort of oval.  On one half it holds ten unused clean syringes. 6, 13, 14, 16 It’s got this little divider wall in it. 20 On the other side it’s got a one way flap and you put the used syringes down inside. 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 You can’t access them. 9 Then you can safely dispose of it.  AS: Of the whole pack?  SP: Yes.  It’s a safe disposal mechanism for syringes developed by drug users in Sydney. 5, 6, 13 This other plastics company took it over. 14 I don’t know how I met this crew. 12 I went to the first international harm reduction conference in Brazil in 1998. 5, 14 There’s a man named Peter Galsworthy at the time.  He is running ASP Plastics, the company that had Fit Packs. 8, 14 They send a case to me or something. 14, 17 Those guys were nuts.  I start using them as a program. 6 It provides a level of safety for the people who are actively using because cops don’t want to stick their finger down inside to get a dirty syringe out. 6, 9, 19 You could be charged with a felony for residue in a syringe.  It provided a safety mechanism if you’re a cop patting somebody down you’re not going to get a needle stick. 10, 19 So it was really a win, win. 18 It was an opportunity to talk about them. 19 Then there was some leftover Minnesota Department of Health money. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 Lucy Slater would know about this. 12 It was short term. 17, 18 You had to use it and get rid of it. 6, 13 It wasn’t going to be drawn out over time. 5 The guys from Australia were in town and we wrote it together. 8 It was called the “Better Safe than Sorry Disposal Proposal.”  For the Minnesota Department of Health. 9, 12 We worked with four area pharmacies. 8 I can’t think of the name of that one on 26th and Nicollet. 8 Another pharmacy over on the West Side of St. Paul, another of the East Side of St. Paul and then the North Side of Minneapolis.  They were chosen for geographic location related to race and drug use. 5, 6, 13 West Side of St. Paul primarily Latino, lots of heroin. 16 East  Side is more white people and methamphetamine. 6, 8, 9, 19 The North Side certainly there was a lot of cocaine over there at the time. 8, 16, 17 There was probably some methamphetamine, some heroin. 6, 8, 16 Opiates, I don’t know, pills were probably being talked about to some degree. 12 It’s early.  AS: This is still in the late 90s?  SP: The late 90s.  It was a very interesting project. 5, 17 I know I’ve got that stuff here too. 12 I don’t know how well the research was ever written up and exactly what happened with it. 12, 15 Sarah Riebeckite that’s part of putting on the conference up at White Earth, she and I have worked together. 8, 9 We’ve worked on these projects together. 5, 8 Sarah’s got a lot of history. 15 She knows about this project in particular. 5, 9, 12 The data that came out of it, there was a strong research component with that and there was a kickoff. 8, 13 There was the t-shirt that said, “Be Blood Aware.”  There was the Fit Pack.  We did a sticker for the Fit Pack.  There were a lot of steps involved in it.  AS: You started by saying you left Women With a Point. 12, 14 But you also married Dave. 7 SP: Yes, I was married to Dave. 7 We’d been together since ‘97. 8 We got married in ‘99. 7 We had a commuter marriage. 14 Dave had obligations.  He travelled all the time.  He had obligations to Tacoma.  He had the needle exchange in Tacoma still, Point Defiance AIDS Project or the Tacoma Needle Exchange. 10 Then he’s got the larger national organization that is NASEN.  AS: Was he running that? 8 Did he found that?  SP: Yes.  You should google Dave.  He’s having a conference every two years, annually. 14 He had a needle exchange conference as well. 10 That was held different places throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.  I’m still really steeped in doing all of the work. 18 Always with a focus on harm reduction in women. 5, 12, 14, 18 Never moving away from that and always had various ideas, projects, things that I thought should be happening, always maintained involvement. 5, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20 Dave’s got to be back in Tacoma.  I’d made an agreement with him that we would live there at some point. 12 I leave Access Works. 18 It’s morphed into Access Works at this point.  Women With a Point was too gender specific was the thought. 12, 17, 18 AS: That was right on the cusp that was kind of what I was getting at when I was talking about women’s history and the second wave. 12, 15 We were just on the cusp of that where things started to change. 14 That’s when Women’s Studies programs started switching to Gender and Women’s Studies. 12 It’s this short lived moment. 7, 8, 12, 14, 18 SP: I never really thought about it like that but it’s really, really true. 5, 16, 17, 18 AS: That was really a moment when women had just gotten brought in. 8, 12, 14, 18 We just had this little flash and then gender. 20 SP: It’s neutral.  AS: It’s supposed to be neutral.  Now they’re calling it Critical Identity Studies. 16 SP: I think that’s bullshit. 18 AS: You can’t prioritize one over the other.  That’s another conversation.  SP: People give me grief about it but I still prioritize.  If there’s women identified works for me but the focus is on women. 9, 12 I think that I’ve had regrets about it.  It’s like in some ways I caved to public opinion. 18, 19 AS: We can’t help that sometimes.  You were making a decision that was the best for the organization at the time. 10, 14 SP: If you look at what happened not long after that, it is the rise of opiates and women’s involvement. 12, 15, 17 It’s interesting. 17 There’s so much other history tied up within harm reduction or community based public health. 5, 13, 14, 15, 19 However that gets defined. 11 During that time, always during that time, provided a lot of community education and did a lot of work in treatment programs and jails. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19 Talking about why harm reduction matters. 5, 14 AS: During which time are you talking about?  It created a different climate for people in general but women specifically. 9, 12 In Minnesota there are women specific treatment maybe not as much as we would like but it’s here. 5, 12, 13 It’s huge.  There’s so much.  Trying to broaden a way of thinking. 18 I really think in general people thought I was a little crazy. 9, 17, 18, 20 David Hamilton will tell you that he thought I was a little crazy but good. 10, 17, 18, 20 Really a level of thinking out of the box.  I wasn’t indoctrinated. 14 I had success.  Really just building on that. 19 I was also burnt out.  Things were going on with my own kids.  There’s the work side of it. 9 There’s an integration and certainly one supported the other. 8, 17 It’s really, really hard work. 9, 18 The company in Australia, I think I worked for them for four years. 14 AS: Did you work for them in the U.S.?  SP: Yes, the U.S. and Canada.  There was a lot of emphasis around syringe disposal.  There was a national movement just related to disposal. 12, 15 Really as the politics are changing and needle exchange is starting to gain some more acceptance—this is where I left off around the federal ban. 8, 10, 12, 14, 17 In 1998 Clinton’s in office, there’d been protests in D.C. for a couple of years related to needle exchange and Act Up. 10, 11, 14 Dave’s having his conference in Baltimore.  All this stuff had been going on Donna Sheleyla and Clinton and they were supposed to certify the science. 14 Everybody was so optimistic.  Dave was interviewed on NPR.  What happened is that between Sheleyla and Clinton they certified the science that needle exchange did not increase drug use. 5, 6, 10, 13, 15 They refused to fund it. 6, 13, 16 It sent the wrong message. 5, 11 That illusive wrong message. 11 SP: Let me look right now, there is a place in here. 12 There used to be a political cartoonist in Minneapolis with the Star Tribune. 6, 13, 16 His last name was Saxe.  He did a cartoon that clearly identified two babies in the nursery, in the hospital nursery. 8 One is a baby of color and then there’s the white baby. 19 It says something like, “Tell us again why they refused to fund needle exchange.” 6, 10, 13, 16 They’re clearly identified as HIV positive babies.  The other one says, “It might give the wrong message to the children.” 5, 8, 11, 14, 20 I had it for years, I always held on to it. 14, 18 Some of this in this folder is just articles that I use for I don’t know. 6, 12, 13, 20 It’s a mish mash.  Drug related stuff, women in addiction. 12, 14 Stuff I’ve picked up over the years. 14 I don’t know what all that’s about, I haven’t read it. 12 This was above the toilet in the storefront in the bathroom. 14 I’ve got a t-shirt of this image.  This comes from a friend in New York. 20 AS: This is great. 20 We’re looking at postcards.  SP: This is Carleton Hogan.  This is Noel’s brother. 20 As she says, “Carleton was a New York street junkie.”  He got sent to Hazelden for treatment. 5, 12, 13 The work he did here early on with Minnesota AIDS Project, Carleton Hogan, no oral history project would be complete without Carleton. 5, 15 This is myself and Bob Norman in the alley outside the store front.  Bob used to be the director of Prodigal House. 6, 13, 16, 18, 19 He should be invited.  AS: What’s his name?  SP: Bob Norman.  This is Edith Springer.  Edith is credited as being the mother of harm reduction in the United States. 5, 14 She’s from New York originally.  A wonderful human being. 18, 19 She was my mentor. 12 I was part of the original handful of people chosen to be trained in harm reduction out of the coalition. 5, 9, 14 AS: We need to get you some labels on the back of these pictures.  SP: The Women With a Point T-shirt. 12 We’re in New Orleans at a drug policy conference. 5, 6 This is LaNelle Clancy.  They’re West Coast ladies.  They did some of the original needle exchange in San Francisco and Sacramento with the baby buggies. 10, 12 Hiding syringes in street corners.  Carleton Hogan and David Hamilton.  These are other pictures.  AS: David Hamilton is the one in New York? 8 SP: He’s at Augsburg now. 12 Definitely need to talk to David.  I’m pretty sure he’s coming to the oral history project. 5, 10, 15 The last I heard he was working at Augsburg. 9 These are more pictures of Carleton.  I just kind of stuck everything in there.  AS: Where is Carleton?  SP: Carleton’s dead. 16 Carleton died of AIDS in maybe 2003. 5 Wonderful human being. 19 This is more related to current stuff. 14 Somethings I just keep in here. 6 This is Bill Main doing street based outreach. 12, 13 He became infected through a syringe I think he took out of a sharps container in prison.  These are some other cartoons but it doesn’t have that one. 8 It has an article on the flip side. 9 I think that’s Bill Clinton.  AS: “The White House Denies Funds for Needle Exchange Program Revealing the Need for Another Exchange Program.” 6, 13 There’s Shaleyla.  SP: Here’s Women With a Point personnel policies. 12 Access  Work stuff that might have been the name change.  AS: Why did we come over here?  SP: We’re looking for that cartoon.  It’s close to four I think. 9, 10 AS: Let’s stop for now. 12 Thank you.  SP: Here is welcome to the user’s group. 6, 13 Papers that I wrote.  AS: Don’t judge pregnant drug using women. 5, 6, 7, 10, 12 This is great. 20 SP: This I can bring up to White Earth.  There’s so much in here.  This was a poster we had on the wall.  Our grand opening. 10 AS: Would you say that again about being a good neighbor? 10 SP: We were always absolutely a good neighbor. 10, 18 We weren’t going to give any opportunity for anything but a good neighbor, to disregard us, to judge us, stigmatize us, to counteract the stereotype. 9, 10, 19 We were an amazing neighbor and people knew it. 9, 16 We cleaned up the neighborhood. 20 We did needle sweeps. 10 There were people who were hanging out on the roof when we got there, shooting dope up there. 6, 9 Absolutely a good neighbor. 10 We participated in that neighborhood. 9, 20 This is Frank Guzman.  This is Trudy Shafer.  She is now; I call her a food with medicine chef in Berkeley. 12, 14 She cooks for Green Day and musicians. 9 Trudy’s awesome.  She worked at Seton with Gail Thomas.  A very original outreach worker. 12, 19 This is the year when the harm reduction conference was in Oakland. 5, 14 That one cartoon I don’t seem to have. 6 AS: Did you bring a matchbook?  SP: There’s matches.  It talks about Sarah.  A public welfare narrative, women’s foundation. 12, 19 AS: How did you pay for the needles if nobody would give you money? 8, 10 SP: There’s needle exchange grants. 10 AS: So you did get money from those? 8, 10 SP: Always. 18 Needle exchange you hustle for more. 10 MAC AIDS Fund.  If I ever buy lipstick, which is rare, I buy MAC cosmetics because they support HIV prevention in drug users. 5, 6, 10, 13, 19 Levi Strauss supports needle exchange. 10 Comer Foundation that was Lands’ End supports needle exchange. 10 Stephanie has been supporting needle exchange; it used to be with a phone call, since like 1988. 6, 8, 10, 13, 16 They sold Lands’ End.  The family foundation still supports needle exchange. 10, 12 It’s been formalized a little more. 20 I just got a grant from them.  AS: You just now did? 12 SP: Yes.  AS: That’s awesome.  Are they based out of Wisconsin? 13 SP: Chicago. 13 The rest of the family foundation is really environmentally focused. 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 I think Dan Big got Stephanie involved in needle exchange early on. 10 They both live in Chicago. 13 AS: The next time we talk we need to talk about what you’re doing.  We need to start from when you left until now and what you’re doing in Colorado. 12, 14 SP: I’d love to talk about that. 14 There is just stuff.  It’s helpful in that I was doing harm reduction education. 5, 9, 14, 15 Rae and I were together and we were working with Claire Housing, there’s another name. 6, 8 It’s got a more comprehensive organization. 10 It was for people that were working with housing for people who were positive or living with AIDS. 6, 9 It’s all notes from that.  That may be helpful. 9 Stuff from grants.  This was MDH, CDC thing.  David Hamilton’s resume I think.  I think some of these are old research.  AS: Rae gave me a lot of files from the computer from Access Works.  Photos and photo files.  SP: You’ve got to love Rae. 14 AS: She’s amazing. 9 She’s a sweetie.  There’s a bunch of stuff. "
"21","Hooker_Julie","Charles Reznikoff Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer January 17, 2017 Minneapolis, Minnesota Charles Reznikoff-CR Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I am with Dr. Charles Reznikoff at the Addiction Medicine Center at HCMC [Hennepin County Medical Center] in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 14 It is January 17, 2017.  I am trying to get a whole picture of the people who are involved in what is going on right now with opioids in treatment and recovery and what has happened in the past. 6, 9, 12, 13, 15 That said, I would like to be able to paint a picture of who are the kinds of people who are doing this and what their personal story is. 6, 9, 15 Can you tell me a little about your family and growing up and how you got interested in medicine. 10, 12, 14, 20 CR: I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. 20 Both of my parents were professors at the University of Wisconsin. 20 My dad’s dad was a famous doctor in New York City -- he was a hematologist. 12, 14 My mom wanted to be a doctor but because of circumstances in her life that wasn’t available to her. 10, 12, 14, 18 I grew up in a very academic family. 12, 20 Both my parents were geneticists. 20 I grew up talking about genetics and biology over the dinner table every day. 16, 20 My mom was Catholic. 14 I think she is now a recovering Catholic, you might say. 12 I was brought up Catholic and my mom was very into service. 14, 19 Anyways, I grew up always told from a young age that I was going to be a doctor or a priest. 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 It sounds terrible, but I think my mom meant the best by that. 11, 14, 18 My dad was really mellow about that -- he never told me what he wanted me to be. 10, 14, 16, 18 But, my mom wanted me to be in some form of service. 14, 18, 19 I think she would have accepted if I didn’t, but from a very early age I was told I was going to do one of those things. 12, 16 By the time I was twelve I knew I wasn’t going to be a priest. 16, 20 [laughs] 15 I crossed that one off the list!  That led me to be a doctor. 12, 14 I think other relevant things in my family was that my sister was the smartest person I had ever met. 12, 20 She was my older sister and she is a mathematician. 20 She was a very rigorous and demanding thinker. 9 It sounds terrible to say this but she was verbally aggressive. 11, 18 I don’t mean that to be abusive.  I mean that if you misspoke she would correct you and if you were illogical she would correct your logic.  If you used poor grammar she would correct it. 6, 13, 16 I still use poor grammar but the ability to deal with a critical verbal environment came from my sister. 6, 12, 13, 20 She also has a little bit of OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] so I grew up with some mental health issues in the family. 12, 13, 19, 20 My brother is one year older than me. 14, 20 He is adopted.  He is currently a safety manager at a construction worksite. 9, 19 He is ten months older so we grew up almost as fraternal twins. 7, 11, 16, 20 My parents couldn’t conceive another child so they adopted my brother and then immediately conceived me. 14, 20 We grew up like fraternal twins. 7, 20 He has a much higher risk for addiction and anxiety. 7, 10, 12, 14, 17 At age twelve, thirteen, fourteen I saw him smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking. 5, 6, 11 He was getting in trouble.  As soon as he could he was getting tattoos and taking all the risks. 11 The way I think about it is whatever ‘dumb’ is I did ninety-five percent of it and he did one hundred and five percent of it. 18 Overall, childhood was excellent. 14, 20 I was very sheltered and protected. 5 It was a safe and wonderful thing. 18 I grew up in this amazing, academic, intellectually challenging circumstance. 9, 20 With my brother I got almost a twin-like experience when we were getting in trouble together. 7, 8, 18, 20 With my sister I got this older sister who was very rigorously demanding and intellectually challenging. 9, 20 My parents were these very smart intellects. 20 My elementary school was like lily-white. 7, 12, 19 Very affluent, white kids. 19 There was one person of color in my elementary school. 7, 12 My middle school was forty percent black just by coincidence of the districts of those different schools. 7 My high school was back in the other district with the University brats in Madison, Wisconsin. 7 AS: Which high school was that? 7 CR: Madison West.  It was a great school. 7, 20 I don’t know if it is anymore, but at the time it was. 12 I would say I was pursuing the doctor thing, but I hadn’t really thought deeply about it. 12, 14, 17, 18 It seemed like a good path, and it seemed like a good fit. 6, 10, 15 It was being put in front of me.  Then out of high school I got into a program called the Medical Scholars, which I don’t believe happens anymore. 7, 14, 15 The University of Madison Medical School has one hundred and fifty medical students per year. 7, 14 Fifty of those spots -- one third of the medical school -- is reserved for Medical Scholars. 6, 7, 14 Medical Scholars get in coming out of high school. 7, 14 Basically you apply to a program out of high school at the University of Wisconsin. 7 You have to be a Wisconsin resident, you have to go to University of Wisconsin for undergrad, and if you maintain a certain GPA [grade point average], which was very challenging, and do certain prerequisites, they grant you automatic admission into the medical school. 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17 What Wisconsin wanted was to capture what they thought were their bright students and keep them in Wisconsin or in Minnesota. 12, 14, 17, 18 Keep their applicants in the state.  They did this as a lure.  I got into the Medical Scholarship program. 14 My pediatrician was on the admittance committee.  I don’t know if that’s nepotism or whatever you call it. 6, 12 [laughs] 15 I have really just had incredible luck along the way. 5, 18 It is not like I earned everything I am.  I’m not saying I’m incredibly successful, but I am a doctor so I have a lot of things going for me. 5, 12, 14, 18 When someone has all of that going for them I am just so aware of all the little turns of luck I had. 20 Within the University of Wisconsin’s forty thousand person campus, Medical Scholars is like a liberal arts school dedicated to biology and pre-med embedded within the undergrad. 7, 10, 14 I had all the benefits of a big undergrad, yet none of the problems of being in a gigantic state school. 7, 8, 12, 15 It was an incredibly focused pre-med education program. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 You have to get a good GPA, and they would dictate fifty percent of your pre-med courses and you had to get basically all As in your pre-med courses. 10, 14, 19 All of the rest of your course credits -- do whatever you want; do enriching your careers, take philosophy, take Spanish, take whatever. 5, 15, 19 The typical pre-med is stressing out about their GPA to get into the medical school spots. 6, 7, 10, 14 I was basically studying to learn. 10, 19 I had to get a good GPA to maintain my Medical Scholar standing, but I wasn’t trying to outcompete my colleagues. 10, 14 It was amazing. 9 I met the GPA bar by like .01.  It was literally a miracle.  It was like a B plus in organic chemistry instead of a B that did it. 15 It was literally that close. 9, 10 AS: But you stayed with it.  You continued to enjoy it.  CR: What is really does is it gives you a really enriched education. 14, 15, 18 You can take philosophy and Spanish and history and all these courses that make you feel more like an enriched person. 15 Meanwhile you work your butt off in your biology classes where you can take some risks in your other courses. 7 The typical pre-med is so anxious about their GPA that they will take fluff so they will get good grades in the fluff to focus more on the bio-sciences. 5, 10 I could take more risks with my curriculum.  That has set this precedent for me with this kind of pay-it-forward thing where a lot of people enter medical school feeling like they competed their way in -- I feel like I entered medical school with this like, You’ve been given this, do something good with it. 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 18 I had incredible fortune. 5 I didn’t feel like I was a doctor until human anatomy. 12, 14, 19 The first week of medical school you start dissecting bodies. 7, 14, 15 At that point I was like, Oh, wow, this is what being a doctor is and I loved it. 12, 14, 17 Human anatomy was probably the most important class I ever took. 7, 9 It was incredible. 5 I don’t feel like I knew what being a doctor was until medical school. 7, 12, 14, 16 In some ways that’s the story of an entitled person. 15, 18 Someone affluent who had the silver spoon.  I didn’t have to stress out about my career until I was already in medical school. 7, 14, 15, 19 And then when I was in there I was like, Yeah, this works for me. 9 I had it easy.  I really did. 18 I had a really good path. 10, 18 AS: The important thing is that you realize that. 9 CR: Oh yeah.  I am very lucky, compared to some of the things our patients and other people have to fight against in their young life. 5, 8, 9, 10 AS: How did you get into addiction medicine? 12, 14 Did you have a personal connection?  CR: I think that almost everyone’s got someone in their family that is addicted. 12, 14 My sister had some mental health issues; my brother was alcoholic and later got into cocaine and opiates. 6, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 When I was in medical school there was a scandal in Madison, Wisconsin where some cop caught a news reporter using coke. 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 The news reporter, rather than taking some felony cocaine charge, said I’ve got a good deal for you. 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 He said, I know of at least a dozen firemen that are selling cocaine out of the fire station. 12 I will give you those names if you give me a plea bargain. 16 Of course because the cops and the fire stations usually have competitions, the cop was like, Yes.  This guy names thirteen names of these firemen that were using and selling cocaine. 6, 12, 16 AS: Do you remember what year this was? 14 It’s in all the newspapers. 15, 16 You would be able to find it.  Among those names, he listed my brother who was a fireman at the time. 16, 20 My brother was certainly alcoholic and had certainly used cocaine. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20 Eleven out of the thirteen people were selling cocaine out of the fire station. 9 It was a huge deal and they got fired and went to jail. 5 Two of the people that were listed didn’t have any evidence. 9 My brother was one of them. 20 So my brother was caught in this fire storm of the fire union versus the fire police chief. 8, 20 Someone had seen my brother do cocaine in a bar late at night. 6, 16, 20 No doubt he did; no doubt.  But lots of people use cocaine at 2:00 AM when they are twenty-three years old and they just got this new job and they have money. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 All the seriousness of the accusations of the people selling the drugs -- no one ever linked my brother to that. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 20 I don’t link my brother to that. 20 I don’t know. 12 He was one of two people that were front page news in the newspaper for a year. 9, 14, 15, 16 AS: Even though he was still part of it all. 9 CR: Ultimately he was exonerated. 8 The charges were all dropped against him. 5, 11 It put him under such stress and scrutiny. 7 He was an alcoholic. 6 He was exonerated of all charges. 8, 14 He was allowed to keep his job. 10, 11 After six months of being on the front page my mother was tortured by it. 5, 11, 16 You can imagine being his mom. 14 In the end, he was wrongly accused of this. 6, 11, 13, 16 Two months later he got his third DUI [driving under the influence] and lost his driver’s license. 5, 11, 13, 14, 16 After that he was fired as a fireman. 5 Joe has since gotten sober.  After that he got sober from alcohol and hooked on pain pills. 6 Then he got sober from pain pills and now he is married, in recovery, a safety manager at a construction site, and a union welder. 6, 7, 12, 19 I saw this whole process go down. 17 We did an intervention for my brother. 20 AS: Were you in medical school? 7, 14 When did you start medical school? 7, 14 I graduated in 2002. 7 It was 2000, 2001 when this was happening. 15 That may have been subconscious and it may have directed some of my thoughts but I was not explicitly becoming an addiction doctor to treat my brother. 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 I was actually really clear with him. 7, 18 I didn’t want to threaten him and be like, I’m doing this because of you.  I was also not doing this to help you.  I’m not doing this because of you, or to help you.  I’m doing this because it is right for me. 12 I’m doing this selfishly.  When I got into opioids and the pain world, Joe, my brother, had not come out as addicted to opioids. 6, 12, 13, 14, 20 When he finally told me he was hooked on Percocet, I was already deep into this world. 16 Going down the opioids path was good for me and it had nothing to do with my brother. 6, 10, 13, 20 Only later I found out he got hooked with opioids. 6, 13 Just like every other person in the county that is introduced to opioids. 6, 13, 14, 19 That was a very influential, early thing that happened to me. 15 I think also dealing with my sister’s mental health issues affected how I interact with patients and think about mental health. 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 It’s easy, in this story to be like, Oh, he had an alcoholic brother. 6, 15, 20 But I also had an OCD sister. 20 Both these things had equal influence on how I think about and interact with patients. 18 I did an addiction rotation in medical school in that context -- while all of that was happening. 7, 12, 14, 15 I talked to the addiction doctor at the University of Wisconsin. 12, 14 His name was Rich Brown.  There was a Randy Brown and a Rich Brown -- both of which work in addiction at Wisconsin. 12, 14 In this case I talked to Rich Brown, and he was cool. 17 AS: What do you mean you talked to him?  CR: I emailed him and I was like, I’m struggling with what I should do with my brother. 20 Do you have any advice?  He emailed me back and then I did an addiction rotation. 12, 14 I went to internal medicine residency at County Hospital -- here, HCMC. 7, 9, 12, 14 I didn’t know if I was going into addiction or not, I didn’t know what I was going to do. 12, 14 I was just enjoying residency. 7, 9 I did find that working with patients who had addiction wasn’t like Oh, an alcoholic. 6, 12, 14 I don’t want to go into the room. 14 Then when I come out of the room I feel gross and weird. 14 A lot of doctors are aversive to working with addicts. 12, 14 Or they find working with addicts aversive, I should say. 14 That’s a really common thing. 18 Doctors are humans too. 19 Some doctors are like, ‘I feel really weird dealing with the health consequences of obesity’ because they think obese people caused this by themselves by eating too much and gaining weight. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 ‘They have bad knees because they are obese.  I feel morally compromised.’  Some doctors have that thought. 12, 14, 17, 18 Some doctors have the chainsmoker opioid user who has a heart attack. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 For me, honestly, if there is anything, I don’t know if there is a bias, but patients I work with that have diabetes -- I will do it, but it’s not thrilling to me. 8, 10, 12 I leave the room and I was like, I had to do that because it’s part of my job. 9, 11, 14, 18 Whereas other people love that. 9, 14 They go into that field.  We all have our things.  It just so happened I discovered during residency that when 5, 7, 9, 15 I’m in the room with a patient that’s addicted I’m not stressed out. 7, 12, 14 I’m happy to be there, I feel like I’m delivering care, I can look them in the eyes and relate to them, they seem to relate to me back, and I didn’t question that. 6, 18, 19 During residency I realized that was unique. 7, 9 Most people are avoiding those patients whereas I’m drawn to them. 5, 9 It’s probably because I saw it happening first hand with my brother. 14, 15, 20 I know my brother is a good person, and I love my brother, so I know this person right here is someone’s sibling and I can look them in the eye and treat them as a sibling. 10, 12, 14, 20 I think that contributed.  The fable I tell about how I got into addiction medicine is when I was a first year resident, I saw this young, black, gang member named Anthony. 9, 12, 14 He called himself Ant.  He had a tattoo of the word ‘ant’ on his arm.  He had congenital heart defect and he came in for his heart problem. 9, 12 When he was there he confided in me that he was a heroin user and 6, 13, 16 I didn’t know what to do. 12 I was an intern.  He went home and a couple of days later, as I was walking down the hallway a phone rang. 8, 11, 16, 18 A receptionist picked it up and said, Yeah, actually yes, he’s right here. 7, 12 Someone just called this phone and asked for you, Charlie. 8, 16 I just happened to be walking down the hallway. 15, 16, 18 Crazy coincidence.  I was surrounded by people that saw this happen. 9, 15 I picked up the phone and it was Ant and Ant was crying. 8, 16 He said, I just injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. 12, 16 There were people yelling in the background and he was crying and he said, I’m worried, I injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. 9, 12, 14, 16 I didn’t know what to tell him so I told him to go to the emergency room, which probably was not even the right answer. 12, 14, 16 I didn’t even know what to tell him. 12 All of these people were like, What happened and I told them that a patient that I saw three days ago randomly called this phone number and asked for me and confessed that he had just injected heroin. 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 In some ways that was my vocation calling. 16, 18 I was like, That’s my future calling. 16 That was a true story. 5, 15 The other, more real, practical reason I got into addiction medicine was that my senior year, then as a chief resident, in my chief year, I would always work out in the gym. 8, 9, 12, 14, 18 Gavin Bart, who is an addiction researcher and is my current boss, would work out beside me. 12, 14 He would talk to me and he said, Look, if you want to take this job in the addiction department, we’ll account for fifty percent of your time with addiction work and the other fifty percent you can self determine. 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 Sounds eerily familiar, like the Medical Scholars program where it’s like here are fifty percent of your work you will have to work really hard for and we are going to account for and then we are going to give you freedom. 8, 9, 14, 18 Taking a job here pays thirty percent less than a community job, so it’s not like I’m going for the money. 8, 10, 11, 19 What do you mean a community job? 11, 19 CR: Like if I went to a community hospital and just out of general interest I would have made at least thirty percent more money. 8, 10, 19 He didn’t give me a financial pitch, he gave me a professional enrichment pitch. 12 He just said that if I liked addiction to come do a fellowship and then come to the addiction division and you’ll be able to have a lot of freedom to self determine your job. 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17 It was just such a great offer. 20 Then when I assembled my dream job it’s this diverse patchwork of different things. 5, 11 Everything balances each other.  There is a lot of addiction, but a lot of it is non-addiction. 12, 14 He let me develop myself professionally and he trusts me.  I saw this opportunity to work within a professionally enriching setting with a good boss. 10, 19 AS: When did you start with him?  CR: Residency was 2002 and then chief residency was 2005 to 2006 and then fellowship was 2006 to 2008. 7, 8, 9, 10 I have been here since January 1, 2008.  When you say fifty percent with addiction medicine does that involve the clinic? 12, 14 CR: Yes.  AS: Can you describe what you do?  CR: About half of the weekdays of the year I am responsible for being on-call for the methadone clinic, which could be super mellow or super busy. 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16 It allows me to be in my office to take phone calls, multitask, do academic projects. 5, 8, 10, 16, 20 From 6:00 AM until 1:00 PM, six hundred patients might come through these doors to the methadone clinic and we need a doctor on call. 6, 8, 12, 14 It could go smoothly or it could go crazy. 20 About half of the days when this clinic is open I am on-call and then the other half is another doctor. 12, 14, 16 Methadone is a big component of my addiction work. 8, 12, 14 Every Wednesday afternoon, I do a tobacco clinic. 16 AS: This is one of the other things you do?  CR: This is one of the other components. 8 Well, the tobacco clinic is within the addiction domain and is something I have chosen to do. 12, 14 I don’t know if that counts as my addiction part. 9, 12, 14 What Dr. Bart needed me to do was be on-call for the methadone clinic. 6, 8, 14 That’s what he needed.  Outside of that ten percent of my time is dedicated to tobacco work. 9, 14 Ten percent of my time I drive to Rice County and work in Rice County and I work at a Suboxone clinic. 5, 8 Ten percent in tobacco, ten percent teaching at the University of Minnesota.  Twenty-five percent is general medicine hospitalist work. 8, 12, 14 I work with medical students and medical residents taking care of patients with pneumonia and heart attacks and what not. 7, 9, 11, 14, 19 The rest of it is on-call for methadone.  That’s busy. 15 CR: It’s a lot of things.  The methadone is so hit and miss that you can have a lot of side projects. 5, 6, 8, 9 So I have a lot of side projects, extra curricular projects. 5, 9 AS: What happens when you are in here at the methadone clinic? 6, 8, 15 What do you typically get called out of your office for? 18 CR: Someone appears oversedated, someone wants to change their methadone dose, someone has been continually been using drugs despite our best efforts and we need to do an intervention. 5, 6, 8, 13 AS: When you say other drugs what do you mean? 5, 6 CR: Could be opiates, could be cocaine, could be alcohol. 6, 16 Any combination of drug use plus being on the methadone dose and whether or not it’s wrong or they appear oversedated. 5, 6, 8, 11, 13 Sometimes they have a question and they want to speak to a doctor. 12, 14 Or they are dissatisfied in some way. 18 Often the counselor has a question; the counselor feels like they are up against the wall or they have hit a roadblock and they need to brainstorm what is the next best step. 13 AS: Have you gotten to know a lot of patients? 12 Do you have patients that have been here for years? 14 CR: Yes.  I think the stereotype about addiction medicine is that it is this series of emergencies because an addict who is not in care is a series of emergencies. 12, 14, 19 An addict who is seeking care isn’t going to the emergency room, isn’t going to the urgent care. 6, 14, 19 They are hospitalized, and in jail, and in detox. 8, 19 An addict who is in care isn’t like that at all. 14, 19 An addict who is seeking addiction medicine is in long-term medical management of care. 6, 7, 12, 14, 17, 19 Whether they are getting a medicine or they are at support groups. 12, 14 These addicts that get into care are these long-term patients working towards stability. 14, 17, 19 You get these long-term, incredibly fulfilling relationships with people. 5, 9, 17, 18, 19 There are people that I have seen sixty times within the last eight years -- literally sixty times. 6, 9, 14 I have seen them and fifty plus of those times they are doing great and just checking in. 6, 20 Less than ten of those times they really need help for some reason. 18 They are relapsing or they are worried about relapsing or they are being triggered in some way. 5, 18 Taking care of an addict as an addiction doctor is not a series of crises. 12, 14, 19 Seventy plus percent of the time you are managing people in stable recovery and you are just trying to keep them there. 9, 12 In that sense it is really fulfilling. 5, 18 At any given time, twenty to thirty percent are in crisis.  Every day there is something new. 16 The vast majority of one’s patients are in long-term stable recovery. 12, 17, 18 I think that is a misconception of addiction medicine: that you are dealing with people that don’t want to be there whose lives are blowing up, who are lying their pants off, and who are reprehensible characters. 9, 10, 12, 14 It’s people who have accepted that they have a disease, who are working to get back to a relatively normal life, and who are working hard. 9, 10, 12, 16 Most of them are in treatment. 12, 13 We help them get there and help them attempt to have a perfect life. 10, 17 It is really rewarding and that is a misconception of the job that I do. 11, 18 AS: Speaking of that, I’d like you to talk a little about the stigma of methadone. 6, 8, 9, 20 In interviews that I have had and other conversations there is a stigma that you don’t want to be on methadone because you don’t want to come to a clinic like this. 6, 8, 9 There are class and race assumptions that go along with methadone, not to mention in many of the support groups such as AA [alcoholics anonymous] and NA [narcotics anonymous], to be on a medicine is to go against. 6, 7, 12, 14, 17 CR: It is changing. 17 AS: It is changing, and I would like to see if you could talk about stigma and methadone and if you have seen a change and when that started? 6, 8, 9, 17 CR: I think there are a couple of different reasons why the stigma for methadone is there. 9, 11 I will lay out what I think is the biggest one first. 14 It is basically a misunderstanding about addiction. 12, 14, 17, 18, 19 I am going to come back to that one once I find the words for it. 8 Number two: the easier one to explain. 8 In a methadone clinic twenty years ago you would have a lot of black people. 9, 13, 14 A huge number of African-Americans, a lot of poor people, and whatever the other oppressed group in your local community is. 9, 10, 19 For us it might be Native Americans, poor people, black people, and if you happen to be caucasian you probably had a mental illness. 9, 12, 15 The demographics of a methadone maintenance clinic -- the demographics of heroin twenty years ago -- was black, urban, felons. 13, 14, 16 Because of that I think there’s some component of, I don’t want to go to that clinic with all those people I don’t identify with. 8, 9 If you’re an affluent, urban, caucasian person, the idea that going to a clinic that is highly black, urban, poor, with some mental health and felonies mixed in -- racism and classism took over. 7, 12, 19 That was the first thing. 14 Now, I entered the field of addiction just as heroin was affecting white, suburban kids. 5, 12, 14, 16, 19 You just roll your eyes: this is something that has been endemic in the North Minneapolis black neighborhood for decades and decades and decades. 14, 20 Now that it is affecting affluent, urban kids people are freaking out. 9 I get it.  But I roll my eyes at it.  I do think how democratic opioid addiction is will force the stigma to change. 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 Opioid addiction is absolutely democratic. 12, 14 Opioids absolutely have no racial, gender, or age preference. 10 This is absolutely a democratic addiction and it is fatal. 12, 14 Now, a New York Times article about a Mexican drug cartel looked at a map of America and they said, Where are the regions already controlled by gangs? 5, 6, 9, 10, 18 We aren’t going to get into a gang war to sell heroin in North Minneapolis. 9, 16 But, Wayzata, and Eden Prairie, there are no gangs there and there is a lot of money there. 8, 9, 10 There was a concerted effort of the Mexican drug cartel to look at a map of America, look at existing gang territory, and go to other regions. 5, 6, 9, 10 That came on the tail end of the pharmaceutical opioid epidemic. 13 Obviously the epidemic affected people who had insurance. 9, 13 The pharmaceutical thing disproportionately affected people that had some sort of insurance and didn’t hit the working class as much fifteen years ago. 7, 9, 13, 14 The pharmaceutical thing was more white. 19 The Mexican drug cartel rode those coattails to those same communities that were getting the pharmaceuticals with their three dollar co-pay from their insurance. 5, 6, 19 It’s more complex than that, but opioid addiction has been democratized in the last five years and the only good thing about the new demographics of people: women, caucasians, suburban; these groups were less affected by heroin twenty years ago. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 It was more male, African American, and urban.  Obviously it is negative when other groups get affected. 12 The only positive thing about it is that I think it will dramatically affect the stigma going forward. 5, 9 When only urban black men are affected, when HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] only happened to gay, male, IV [intravenous] drug users, you can’t help but to think of it as a gay disease. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19 When it starts happening to straight people you realize it can happen to everyone. 9, 15 I think that is what is happening with opioids right now. 6, 12, 13, 15 People realize they had false ideas. 18 That gets back to the methadone thing. 6, 8 The treatment was mistaken for the demographic thing twenty years ago. 12, 13, 14 Two is that another thing that has bedeviled methadone maintenance, which is kind of a specific point, but relevant, is that methadone tablets for pain can very clearly cause death in pain patients. 6, 8, 18 There have been many very important warning from the CDC [center for disease control] that methadone causes death when given for pain. 6, 8, 9, 13, 18 Recently, there was a Star Tribune article on this where I was weirdly misquoted but then people say, Methadone for pain is so deadly, why are we giving something so deadly to the addict themselves? 6, 9, 14, 16 This is what I was trying to get at.  People don’t understand that once you’re an opioid addict, methadone reduces death, prolongs life, improves pregnancy outcomes, reduces incarceration, reduces IV drug use, reduces Hepatitis C and HIV transmission. 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18 Once you are an opioid addict, the medicine helps stabilize the addict. 12, 13, 14 Once you are an addict, you have an incredible high death rate. 5, 7, 14, 18 Methadone lowers the death rate in that person in a controlled setting. 10, 18 If you are a pain patient -- not addicted, but in pain -- you should have a really low death rate and methadone raises it. 6, 10, 12, 14, 18 If you are an addict you have a high death rate and methadone lowers it. 7, 10, 14, 18 The pain patient in theory shouldn’t be at risk of incarceration and all the other stuff. 6 The point is that in saying that ‘methadone kills pain patients, so why are we giving it to drug addicts,’ they misunderstand that we are talking about two distinctly different groups of people and the addict is at incredible risk of death. 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 They are totally different groups of people. 9, 12 It’s like saying insulin would harm someone without diabetes, so why are you giving insulin to someone with diabetes? 10 It’s like methadone helps someone with addiction, so why would you give it to someone without addiction? 12, 14 The reason is because over and over since the fifties it has been proven to save lives. 10 I think that since all the stigma and talk is going to go away when you realize that young, caucasian, affluent kids that are dying, we need to have something to make these kids not die. 9, 18, 20 That is a racist idea that we have let it go so long in the African American community. 17, 19 That is a sad thing.  The good thing is that now that it is hitting other communities we are finally going to wake up. 10, 12, 19 The addicts themselves who enroll in a methadone clinic, if there is anything they don’t like it is the attendance requirement. 12, 14 The attendance requirement is funny because the addicts don’t like to attend because the first ninety days you have to go six days a week. 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 The community is often surprised to hear how close we monitor people on methadone maintenance. 9, 10, 19 We observe dosing six days a week for up to six hundred patients. 15, 16 There is a doctor on-call every day. 12, 14, 16 This methadone clinic sees more people every year than the emergency room does. 6, 8, 9, 14 Up to three hundred patients a day come here and are observed. 16 It is an incredibly tight monitoring program. 5, 18 We are giving them a powerful medicine, but it has been proven to save their life and it is in the context of very powerful monitoring. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 Totally different from methadone for pain when they give you a bottle of pills for a month's worth and tell you almost nothing and we have almost no regulation on the doctor's prescribing those pills. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 It is a totally different context.  Part of the stigma that comes from patients is they call methadone ‘liquid handcuffs.’ 9 It comes in a liquid form.  They call it liquid handcuffs because they’re really kind of stuck here. 18 They feel stuck here.  This gets me back to trying to articulate what I was going to say at the very beginning. 11 A lot of people think they are on methadone and then will be tapered off and then can be done. 5, 9 Then I’ll be cured. 5 What methadone is not is a cure for addiction. 6, 8, 12, 14 I hope someday we have cures but we don’t. 9, 16 Before you enter the methadone clinic it means you have opioid addiction, which means you have high risk for death, HIV, incarceration, bad pregnancy outcomes, et cetera. 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 When you enter our clinic, we can’t make that go away. 18, 20 We can only manage it with a drug. 5, 6 A lot of people enter our clinic and think, Maybe I’m addicted to methadone now. 6, 8, 9, 12, 14 You’re not addicted to methadone now. 6, 8, 12, 14 You are still addicted and there’s no getting around that. 12, 14 They feel like they are stuck on methadone.  In some ways you’re stuck with opioid addiction and you need to find the best way to manage it and methadone is one tool. 12, 13, 14, 18 I think a lot of people express their frustration at opioid addiction directed at methadone. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18 They’re frustrated with the fact that they have an incurable disease and there’s no way around it and it has incredible consequences for their life. 5, 6, 10, 18 It manifests as showing up to a methadone clinic six days a week and feeling beholden to that liquid methadone because if you don’t you’re in a lot of trouble and then you get angry at it. 6, 8, 11, 15, 16 I think doctors see that as well, for example, for dialysis patients. 6, 12, 14 If you are a dialysis patient you show up for dialysis three times a week, do a three hour dialysis run, and it shifts fluids in and out of the body and pumps blood around and it feels really weird and uncomfortable. 8, 11, 15, 18 You become reliant, dependent on the dialysis machine. 11 If you skip you die in two weeks. 15 A dialysis patient with die without it in two weeks. 11, 15 They are both totally dependent on dialysis for life. 10, 11 Many, not all, come to resent dialysis and what it represents in their life. 5, 10, 11 They can become angry at their dialysis unit, angry at the dialysis nurses and doctors. 11, 12, 14, 19 Not all are unhappy. 18 They come and get it quietly.  Many patients become resentful at this ball and chain. 5 They mistake the dialysis for the kidney failure. 11, 14 They mistake the methadone for the heroin addiction. 6, 8, 12, 14, 16 That’s a really common confusion. 18 Long winded answer.  AS: Methadone has an image problem from all sectors. 8, 12 From society, from the patients themselves, and from the twelve-step recovery communities. 12, 19 CR: I’m going to sound like what I’ve heard Obama saying. 9 He keeps saying these things like there are these forces and demographics at play in America that will take us on a path, whether we have steps backwards or not, we are on this path and we can’t stop it. 8, 15 These things are changing. 17 It’s a good change. 10, 14 I think the same thing about treatment of addiction. 12, 13, 14 In some ways it’s bad news because addiction is so democratized now, but it will force us to change. 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18 The twelve-step programs not liking methadone -- I’m not even worried about it.  Just give it ten years. 14 You can be in twelve-step programs, but you can only blame the dead person for their death so often before people will just reject it. 9, 16, 18 You cannot blame the dead person for dying. 16 It just sounds cruel. 18 Unless you have another way to keep those people alive you’re ideology is going to need to change -- and it will change. 9, 14, 18 Just like it changed for anti-depressants and all things twelve-step programs went back on. 10, 13 I’m not against twelve-step programs.  I think it’s a good thing. 10 We have seen Hazelden Betty 6 Ford begin to backtrack on the opioid thing. 13, 16 All the dinosaurs that don’t believe in the life saving care, they are going to come around because they have to. 10, 19 AS: There is accountability now because you also have a whole new demographic of rich, affluent, white people who are not going accept that your program didn’t work because they paid for it. 9, 12, 16, 19 CR: Exactly.  I think a lot of those things are going to change.  I’m not worried about twelve-step programs or Hazelden Betty Ford.  They are changing and they have to change. 17 I am happy that I spent those hours in the gym with Gavin Bart who coached me. 15, 18 I will say one other thing.  People in the government and people in the insurance companies don’t flinch for a second about methadone. 9, 10, 12 They know that methadone keeps people out of prison and keeps people alive. 9, 12, 15 There is no insurer in Minnesota that has done the actual math in methadone maintenance clinics that doesn’t pay for them.  Every insurer pays for them.  The typical clinic with collect fifty percent of their bills and the insurance companies will negotiate or people won’t pay or that treatment isn’t covered. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13 We collect over ninety-five percent of our bills.  The only people that aren’t paid for are people who are clearly abusing the system and still relapsing and they get their funding cut off rightfully so. 6, 9, 12, 14 Every insurer is like, Oh, so you’re telling me for five thousand dollars this heroin addict gets six days a week plus urine screens, drug tests, nurses and doctors visits, monitoring, social work; wrap around services for a heroin addict, for five thousand dollars a year. 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 You just need to save one emergency room visit and we’ve made a profit. 10, 14, 15 We easily do that for every patient.  Methadone is just one of the best bargains in healthcare, so almost every insurer is going to pay for it. 19 That tells you that the monied interests love it because it saves money. 8, 10, 14, 15 The government is very clear-eyed about medication assisted treatment; there is no stigma there. 9, 12, 13, 14 This just keeps you alive. 15 The people who look at this with analytical eyes all really clearly understand the value of methadone and suboxone for the treatment of opioid addiction. 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 The people that get their eyes clouded with their stigma, their ideology, their belief system, and aren’t just being analytical about it throw their ideology about it and get moralistic and they blame dead people for dying. 9, 16 One more thing about the stigma of addiction is that [A. Thomas] 9, 12, 14 McLellan published an article in JAMA [Journal of the American Medical Association] in 2001 in which he took four diseases and compared them: asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, and alcoholism. 5, 6, 7, 10, 14 He made a grid and you say, What is the genetic contribution to these diseases?  It turns out that asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and alcoholism all have fifty to sixty percent genetics. 6, 10 Fifty to sixty percent of if I’m an alcoholic is due to my genetics. 6 Second, what is the curability of those diseases? 14 None of those diseases is curable. 8 What is the treatability of those diseases?  All of those diseases have treatments, but not cures. 12, 13 What is the patient adherence to doctor’s recommendations? 12, 14 All of them have comparable patient adherence.  Whether you tell a diabetic to not eat sugar or an asthmatic to not smoke a cigarette or a hypertensive to not use a salt shaker or an alcoholic not to drink alcohol. 5, 6, 13 When you’re telling a person to change their lifestyle behavior, whether it is in the alcohol or the salt shaker, you get the same results. 6, 10, 15 About thirty percent of patients just don’t follow doctor’s orders -- whether it is alcohol or salt or sugar or exercise or weight loss or whatever it is. 6, 10, 12, 14 Thirty percent don’t follow doctor’s orders and seventy percent try to. 10, 12, 14 Many of those don’t succeed.  Alcoholism is just like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma in its genetic risk, patient reaction to news, treatability, and curability. 10, 15, 16 If you forget you’re stigma it looks like any other chronic disease. 6 The final line on the bottom of the comparison is access to treatment. 9, 12, 13 All those other diseases are given access to treatments, but alcoholics are not. 6, 9, 12, 13 This was a really powerful, thoughtful argument made by McLellan saying basically in every way if you are analytical and put your stigma aside, alcoholism is every bit the same, chronic disease but for some reason they’re not given treatment. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20 There are treatments available; they are no less good or worthy of patients than the hypertensive that continues to use salt. 6, 10, 12, 13 They have no more curable than a disease.  I think that is something we’re still slowly wrapping our heads around. 10, 14 AS: There is such a moral stigma and judgement against people. 9, 12 It’s been called a disease for a very long time, but we don’t see it as we see other diseases. 6, 17 CR: Here is another thing I would point out.  In 1975 if you had a heart attack they would put you on bed rest for six weeks and tell you that you are stressing yourself out, you’re an A-type personality, and because of your lifestyle you’ve given yourself a heart attack. 7, 9, 10, 15 In other words, your heart attack was blamed on your personality. 9, 15 Now, if you have a heart attack it’s bing-bang-boom: cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, put a stent in, give them the common cocktail of medicines, and they are back at work in two or three days. 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 Nobody cares what your personality is. 15, 19 Ten years later in 1985 if you had an ulcer people would say, Your family has given you an ulcer, you’re worrying too much, you eat jalapenos. 9, 12, 14 Crap like this.  Now if you have an ulcer, no one cares what your lifestyle, personality, anxiety level, jalapeno, or coffee intake is. 8, 10, 15, 19 Do you take Ibuprofen or Advil?  Do you have cancer? 10 Do you have an infection called helicobacter pylori?  Correct those things and you are back at work in a day and your ulcer will be healed in two weeks. 15, 16 No one cares about your stress level today if you have an ulcer. 7, 8, 16, 19 This is human nature. 19 There used to be this disease called consumption. 6, 13, 14, 16 There was a consumptive personality. 15 That turned out to be tuberculosis.  Or gout was the king’s disease.  Gout has nothing to do with being a king.  It has to do with that you eat foods that are high in oxalate, which kings happened to do because they had money back then and it was trendy. 7, 8, 10, 15 AS: Or hysteria.  CR: Hysteria!  There are lots of examples of this. 16 When we don’t understand a disease fully, and more importantly when we don’t have tools to treat it, we don’t have analytics to measure it, we always describe these diseases to personality. 9, 14, 15, 17, 18 It’s just human nature. 19 When we can’t define it, when we can’t measure it, and when we can’t cure it. 11 AS: Does it surprise you that we are still there with addiction? 12, 14 CR: No. Brain diseases are more complex. 13 It’s just a more complex disease. 13 Depression is probably about ten to fifteen years ahead of addiction in terms of stigmatizing it. 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 The difference with depression was when Prozac came out. 10 People say good and bad things about it: the Prozac revolution, the Prozac brain. 10, 13 What Prozac and all the similar antidepressants that followed -- Prozac is actually not as good as an antidepressant as those that preceded it. 7, 10 There were better antidepressants. 10 But, Prozac was so safe that any primary care doctor could give it out basically willy-nilly. 12, 14, 19 It’s main advantage was safety, which allowed it to be used in any primary care clinic in the country. 6, 10, 13, 16, 19 By putting a tool in the hands of every primary care doctor, suddenly a primary care doctor could ask their patient about their mood. 12, 14, 17, 19 Suddenly, if the patient had a bad mood the primary care doctor could do something right there to help them safely. 12, 14, 19 Not perfectly effective, but moderately effective. 17 By putting a tool in the hands of the average doctor, you basically began the process of destigmatizing the disease. 9, 12, 14, 17, 19 To have depression in 1980 was totally different than having depression today. 10, 16 Having depression in 1980 would have kept a politician out of office. 10 Today we have a governor that has had depression. 10, 16 AS: And we can talk about it and people know about it. 9, 12 CR: We can talk about it.  Great!  I voted for him knowing that and I don’t regret it at all. 12 I think it’s appropriate.  When we start putting metrics and tools in hands -- not BS, but things that work and really make a difference for people’s lives -- we are going to see. 6, 9, 17, 18 You need metrics.  If we need a blood test or if you can measure and quantify something with a blood test, or an x-ray and you have a tool to fix it and it goes to every primary care clinic in the country it changes everything. 6, 19 It is out of the shadows now. 12 It is quantifiable, it’s visualizable, and it’s treatable.  Right now addiction is hard to quantify and treatment is still in this shadowy, ghetto corner of medicine. 9, 12, 13, 14 That’s why I think Suboxone should be in primary care clinics, not just to gain access, but to destigmatize. 9, 19 AS: Can you talk about Suboxone a little bit? 8, 20 Is the clinic that you work in in Northfield [Minnesota]?  CR: We actually moved to Lonsdale for practical reasons; they actually have a great space. 7, 15, 20 I know have a Suboxone clinic here in Minneapolis at HCMC. 12 I’m not taking any patients at that now, but I have a Suboxone clinic in Lonsdale, Minnesota in a family practice setting. 8, 11, 12 All the doctors that work in that clinic are family practice doctors. 12, 14 Every other Monday 16 I see patients in Lonsdale. 6 Yesterday I saw twenty-three patients in five hours. 15, 16 It’s crazy. 20 It’s incredibly rewarding. 5, 18 Yesterday literally two of my twenty-three patients were using heroin still. 6, 16 The rest were sober.  I get drug screens, I check their prescription monitoring program, but more so I just know these patients. 5, 6, 10, 12, 18 I meet with them regularly. 18 One of them was given a cruise as the best salesman in their company. 14 She was awarded a cruise to Hawaii. 14 One of them just got offered a major promotion at work. 5, 20 These people are really thriving at work and are really happy. 9, 18 It’s incredibly rewarding work for me. 5, 18 Suboxone is like that thing I said about Prozac.  Prozac isn’t a better antidepressant, but it’s safer, so therefore it could be given out more easily in a primary care facility. 10, 19 AS: Can you talk about the difference between suboxone and methadone? 6, 8 CR: Suboxone and methadone when compared head to head have similar effectiveness in keeping people alive, out of prison, stopping injections -- there’s more data on methadone because it’s been around longer -- but every time Suboxone and methadone have been compared they come out about equal. 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17 What that means is that on nothing, on abstinence based therapy, you could say twenty percent at best are abstinent still after a year. 12, 13, 14 If you just try to do behavioral, talk therapy alone, the outcomes are approximately twenty percent a year, and some have been ten percent in the studies. 8, 12, 14, 15 Sometimes it’s five percent.  To be fair to abstinence based treatment, twenty-five percent is the high end after a year. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 Methadone or Suboxone changes that to seventy-five percent, eighty percent in some studies. 6, 8 You are taking a one year abstinence success rate at twenty percent and turning it into seventy percent. 11, 14, 20 Still note that thirty percent of opiate addicts don’t respond to Suboxone or methadone. 14 This is not a one hundred percent effective treatment. 12, 13 If you do Suboxone or methadone it is not one hundred percent. 6, 8 Seventy percent are going to respond to either methadone or Suboxone as opposed to twenty percent to behavioral treatment. 8, 12, 13, 15 Methadone and Suboxone are comparable in those studies, but there are some differences and I’ll itemize them. 8 Methadone is a full opioid. 13, 14 Both are very long acting and can be taken once a day and will last all day. 16, 17 If you stop taking them you won’t go into withdrawal for three days. 5, 11, 16 In case of emergency or if something happens you have time to get to a clinic if you can’t get it today. 15, 16, 17 They both have very long half lives, and can be taken once a day and last all day, and don’t cause withdrawal for the first three days. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 17 They both block other opiates.  If you try to use heroin you won’t feel the heroin. 6, 13, 16 Therefore, it helps you extinguish your heroin habit. 20 Almost all methadone and Suboxone patients, early on, test it; they try heroin on this drug and they realize they are wasting their money. 5, 6, 8, 10, 16 Suboxone may be a little better at blocking heroin than methadone, but they both block heroin. 6, 8, 16, 20 They are both once a day drugs that last long and block opiates. 5, 6, 16, 17 Neither of them get you high if you are tolerant. 7 If you have never touched an opiate before and you take methadone -- yeah, you’re going to get really intoxicated. 6, 8, 16, 18 Even Suboxone you can get intoxicated on if you have never used an opioid before. 6, 8, 13, 16 But, if you are a heroin addict, you aren't going to get high on methadone if it is dosed appropriately. 6, 7, 8, 14, 16 They are long acting, block other opiates, you should be wide awake, not nodding off, not intoxicated. 17 In that sense, they are identical.  The difference comes in in that Suboxone has a ceiling effect in approximately forty percent opiate strength. 8 Even if you really wanted to overdose someone on Suboxone you couldn’t because it has that ceiling effect. 8, 18 Suboxone in some ways is dummy-proof. 18 You aren’t going to get oversedated on Suboxone. 8, 13 If you take Suboxone patients -- I was showing this to a medical student yesterday in the clinic -- if you took Suboxone patients and lined them up with patients who had never used opioids in their life and you took an expert and they had to pick who’s on Suboxone and who’s not, you can’t. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16 I’m very attuned to this -- the size of someone’s pupils, their eyelids, the rate of their speech.  I’m very attuned to opioid intoxication and I cannot pick a Suboxone patient out of a line-up. 9, 13 It’s got a lighter touch.  You don’t have to worry so much about dosing Suboxone. 8 If you don’t nothing terrible will happen. 11, 15 Methadone does not have that ceiling effect.  Methadone is a full opioid agonist. 13, 14 Because of that, if you want to be a responsible methadone prescriber you have to work really hard to set limits. 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18 There is a dose of methadone which is enough to keep the patient out of withdrawal, addiction managed, keep the patient comfortable, block other opioids, and yet not cause oversedation or, even worse, overdose. 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14 There is a dose of methadone that can do that. 6, 8 There is a sweet spot. 6 There is also such thing as too much methadone. 6, 8 If you are going to work with methadone you have to work really hard to set limits on your patients. 9, 18 Some of these are patients that don’t like limits.  Part of the job of being a methadone doctor is setting limits. 6, 8, 11, 12, 14 If you can set those limits and keep them in that window where they are getting incredible therapeutic benefits without the oversedation, then methadone behaves exactly the same as Suboxone. 5, 8, 15 Suboxone’s advantage is that ceiling effect and you don’t have to constantly say ‘no’ to people. 8, 9 That is the first major difference because you can overdose and die on methadone much more easily. 6, 8, 14 There’re only a few cases of people dying of buprenorphine alone. 8, 9, 10, 17 You can mix buprenorphine with all sorts of other drugs and die, but buprenorphine alone doesn’t kill you. 5, 6, 8 Methadone alone can kill people. 8, 9 Because it is more potentially lethal that is why it is more highly regulated. 6, 7 That is why we get these clinics and people coming in six days a week. 9, 15, 16 Suboxone is less tightly regulated and can be done out of a primary care clinic. 19 Primary care doctors can prescribe Suboxone and not see the patient six days a week. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 AS: I’ve heard that there’s a limit on how many patients a doctor can take because of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. 8, 9, 12, 14 Has that changed? 13 First, there were thirty patients per doctor. 12, 14 Then, if you do that for a year you can apply for a hundred patients. 5, 14 Now the DEA has raised it to 275 patients per doctor. 12, 14 That far exceeds what any reasonable doctor needs. 12, 14 CR: Within the last year -- less than six months ago. 11, 13, 14, 16 That far exceeds what any doctor would need. 12, 14 Right now that limit has been raised to almost too high of a level. 7, 12, 14 The truth is that the average primary care doctor has 1500 patients, let’s say. 12, 14, 19 Of those, twenty percent at least are on opioids. 6, 13 That’s three hundred patients on opioids. 6, 13 So the average primary care doctor has three hundred opioid patients and of those ten percent are addicted. 12, 13, 14, 19 The average primary care doctor actually has thirty patients that are addicted to the opioids they are prescribed. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 The average primary care doctor has a couple dozen addicts in their midst, and they know those patients and they are desperate to do something for those patients. 11, 12, 14, 19 It is incredibly burdensome to their day, to their clinic, to their nurses. 5, 16, 18 They call in all the time, they are running out of pills; they are addicts. 8, 14 Right now those patients are fumbling through with their primary care doctor on Percocet. 12, 14, 19 When the primary care doctor creates a manmade addiction -- iatrogenic addiction -- they created it themselves as a side effect of a prescribed medicine. 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 When that iatrogenic addiction occurs it would be really handy if the primary care doctor had a tool to treat that addiction. 12, 14, 18, 19 It would save everyone a ton of time and heartache. 10 In that sense, the average care doctor only needs fifteen to thirty spots in suboxone. 6, 8, 12, 14, 19 If they wanted to take on community Suboxone patients they would need more than thirty. 18, 19 When I’m talking to a person and they ask if they should go on Suboxone or methadone, if you are a very complicated patient: mental illness, socially sick, homeless, legal issues, and you’ve relapsed multiple times and you would benefit from very close supervision, methadone is better. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 If you need a stronger agent because you have a super sky high tolerance, methadone is better. 7, 16 If you basically have stuff together, if your life is together, you’ve got a job, you aren’t seriously mentally ill, you haven’t had multiple life-threatening overdoses and relapses, having a community Suboxone doctor for one month at a time and not get all that supervision; that may be better for you. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 You don’t have to come into the clinic six days a week because you basically have good mental health, good social stability, good structure because you can take medicines on your own. 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19 You just need to get out of this trap you are in in this opioid addiction. 12, 13, 14 That’s the really basic part. 9, 18 The reality is what can you get in your community. 19 Right now you just take what you can get. 12 AS: Right.  In the ideal world where the primary doctor knows how to deal with Suboxone, but that’s not happening right now? 8, 12, 14, 15, 19 That’s not happening right now. 12, 15 There’re not enough Suboxone spots. 6 Only these major metropolitan areas have methadone clinics. 6, 8, 20 If you are in the rural clinics you have to drive hours to a methadone clinic. 5, 15 It’s not safe.  There is this weird patchwork of availability of these different drugs. 5, 6 If you can get anything they just jump at it and take it.  It will save your life. 10 In the future if there is greater availability, that’s what a methadone clinic is for: people who need this high degree of supervision. 7, 9, 16, 20 AS: Is there any kind of campaign to get Suboxone out more? 14 I don’t know. 12 People talk about campaigns but I don’t know what that actually is or if it will actually affect change. 7, 12 AS: The only other question I was going to ask was what an ordinary day for you is and what an extraordinary day for you is. 16 You can limit it to one of your places.  CR: There is one other thing I want to say.  Another variable in all of this is the research into addiction. 12, 14 There is incredible work being done right now in the NIH [National Institute of Health]. 5, 12 Nora  Volkow is at the center of this but there are many great researchers involved in looking at where the addiction centers are and all the neurotransmitters involved. 12, 14, 17, 20 There’s a lot of money involved in other pharmaceuticals and treatments. 8, 10, 12, 13 If you can treat addiction more effectively and safely it is a gold mine. 12, 14 There is a lot of interest in it, but it is complex science. 13 I think it’s going to take ten to twenty years. 14 As that science emerges I think it’s a really exciting time. 18 There is a refocus on clinical science and basic science and the development of pharmaceuticals for addiction. 12, 14 It’s exciting.  That is another way to destigmatize things. 9, 18 If you can define them in analytical terms it removes a lot of stigma. 9, 11, 15, 17 I’m hopeful that we are on the right path. 9, 12 I really am. 18 I’m not doing any of this science, so I’m really glad someone is out there doing it! 18 My boss is one of them, so I’m glad people are doing it. 9 A fulfilling day -- there are two versions of the same day. 5, 16 Either a busy Suboxone clinic or like on Monday I saw twenty-three Suboxone patients. 8, 15, 16 Greater than eighty percent are doing well.  One of them was a pregnant mom who was on pain pills and got pregnant and the doctor abruptly cut her off pain pills. 6, 7, 10, 12, 14 She went into withdrawal and she got desperate and she went and used heroin. 5, 6, 13, 16 She called me and I was able to get her onto Suboxone which was life saving for her and her pregnancy -- it improves her pregnancy outcome. 8, 10 Another one, similarly; I had two pregnant moms. 7, 8, 10, 14 I just had an incredible mix of patients at a crossroads in their lives. 5 I had this pregnant mom who was at a crossroad in her life. 7, 10, 14 Eight years in I’m confident -- I’ve made errors, I’ve had bad outcomes -- but I’m confident I can help this mom who is snorting heroin and get a good outcome. 10, 14, 16 That is exciting and thrilling me to see my eighty plus patients who are living the good outcome and then have the ten to twenty percent that are trying to get there and I feel a real sense of hope and confidence that I can get these patients to cross the finish line to a good outcome. 6, 9, 10 I want both these moms to have healthy deliveries. 14, 19 A similar analogy here is I’ll have methadone clinic days where I’ll just line up the methadone patients and I’ll see maybe ten in the morning talking about dose and side-effects and their life. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 16 Some of those mornings it is so fulfilling and wonderful to me even though the majority of them have some problem we are working on, either with their dose or something else. 5, 12, 18 To see these people that were really badly wounded and suffering and sick in a lot of ways, to hear them and their stories and to meet them and understand how they are really leading a meaningful life now. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18 Whether it is Suboxone or methadone having those clinics where I can see these folks and sit down and get to know them. 6, 12 Friend isn’t the right word, but I’m friends with some of them and I really appreciate their presence in my life. 10, 12, 16, 18, 20 I had one guy give me a cup of coffee -- he’s a ceramicist -- and I drink out of it every morning. 5 This heroin addict made me this beautiful mug and I drink out of it every morning! 5, 14, 16 Those things are wonderful. 18 I think the worst thing for me is administrative paperwork called a prior authorization that is attached to Suboxone administration.  It is January so I am getting nailed with them because it is the beginning of the year. 11, 14 The worst things is when red tape gets in the way of delivering care. 5, 18, 19 Then I have to call my patients and be like, Sorry, there is going to be a three day delay until you can get your medicine. 12, 14, 16 They start crying and yelling.  They are angry, scared, tearful, and they’ll relapse. 5, 11, 19 I’ll call them and say there is nothing you can do because your insurance requires this paperwork and they’ll blame me, the pharmacy; they’ll cry, they’ll beg, and I’ll say there is literally nothing I can do.  It is all work put on me.  AS: It is red tape but also denying access to care. 5, 9, 19 There has been lawsuits settled in other states about prior authorizations for Suboxone. 8, 13 The attorney general has put on notice the insurance companies in the state that she will be prosecuting. 10 A similar thing for prior authorizations on Suboxone. 8 She just put out a memo encouraging this to be a legislative priority.  She is hoping that she won’t need to prosecute them because it will be legislative in this session.  There’s hope, but it is absolutely the worst thing when an administrative detail prevents the care of a patient and then I feel their pain when I tell them it is going to be days before they get their medicine. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19 AS: Is the prior authorization because it is Suboxone or just red tape from the insurance company? 8, 14 It’s not DEA restrictions or anything?  Insurance companies made a practical, financial decision that they used prior authorizations for anything that is costly or potentially abusable or when they think physicians aren’t educated about appropriate use for a medicine. 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 When you talk to the people doing the prior authorizations, like me, they catch a lot of doctors prescribing the wrong thing. 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 There is a benefit to it, but it hurts the well meaning. 15 AS: Thank you very much.  I’m so appreciative. 10 CR: Thank you.  It was fun "
"22","Johnson_Chris","Yussuf Shafie Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer December 19, 2017 Bloomington, Minnesota Yussuf Shafie-YS Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  It's December 19th, 2017 in Bloomington, Minnesota at Alliance Wellness Center with Yussuf Shafie.  YS: Yes, that's correct.  AS: Would you state your name and say you agree to be interviewed?  YS: Yes, I have agreed to be interviewed.  My name is Yussuf Shafie.  I am the CEO and the director of Alliance Wellness Center. 18, 19 AS: Thank you.  Tell me a little bit about your family, your childhood. 12, 14, 20 Where were you born? 14 How did you get to Minnesota?  YS: I am an immigrant.  I came from Somalia with my family here back in 2001. 12 I came in with my brothers, sisters, mom, and dad. 14, 20 Grew up in Burnsville, Minnesota.  Believe it or not when I came here I didn't even know how to speak English. 12 I've come a long way. 17, 18 Education was very important in my family. 9, 12, 14 My mom made sure we all studied and went to college. 7, 14 I graduated from Burnsville High School back in 2006. 7 Although I had been passionate about social work and mental health and addiction since I was a little kid, I don't know why. 12, 14, 19, 20 In our community there are people that have addiction or mental health issues and are stigmatized. 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 I wanted to create awareness and educate folks. 9, 12, 14, 18 In order for me to do that I had to go to school. 7 I went to Inver Hills Community College for my Associate's Degree because I'm cheap [laughs] and it went really well. 15, 18, 19 My first semester actually was horrible. 7, 10, 14 I didn't do so well.  I failed all of my classes. 7, 14 I was young, playing basketball, chasing girls. 7, 11 An immature eighteen-year old. 14 I didn't do well.  It messed up my confidence a bit, which was good. 10, 14, 20 I think it's the best thing that's happened to me. 15 So that happened. 15 I got a letter from financial aid saying they were going to take my financial aid away if I didn't get my grades up next semester. 5, 18, 20 I thought about all the hard work that my mom has done for us and my family and how hard we worked. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 My second semester I worked really hard. 9, 18 I got my act together and got all As and Bs, and I graduated in 2009. 7, 8 I went to Metro State for my Bachelor's in social work. 19 AS: How old were you when you came from Somalia? 14 YS: I was about ten, eleven years old. 14 AS: What was life like before you came to the US? 10 YS: It was kind of a blur.  I was young and I don't remember much.  It was a good life. 10 We didn't have much, but we had enough.  I've learned that we have a lot of privileges here in the US. 10 Health care, education, safety. 14, 15, 19 It depends on where you're from. 15 There are parts that are really great in Somalia and there are parts that are—even before the civil war—there were a lot of great things. 9, 18, 20 AS: Where were you born? 14 YS: Actually I was born in Kenya, but I was raised here in the US. 14 I was born and raised in Kenya, and then my mom and dad are from Somalia so it was like a next door neighbor. 14 When the civil war broke down all the people went to the neighboring countries. 8, 9 I speak Swahili as well.  I speak Somali and Swahili even though my Swahili is only eighty percent now, or seventy percent. 12 I'm kind of losing it.  So yeah I was born and raised in Kenya but my parents are Somali. 14, 20 My mom traveled between Somalia and Kenya. 14 It's like here to Wisconsin kind of a thing.  A little bigger, but you get the picture. 20 People drove back and forth, and my mom was a businesswoman. 5, 14 YS: She ran a trucking business, which is not common for women to run that kind of business back home, but she was a hustler and that's where I get this working for myself. 8, 12 I've never believed in working for someone, or I've always been a risk taker and things like that, and that's where I get that from. 16, 18 That's a little bit about my childhood. 14, 20 Came to the states, worked really hard, learned English in ESL. 9, 10, 18 I did go through a lot.  AS: Was that all during high school that you learned English? 7, 10 YS: Middle school and high school. 7 AS: So you got your bachelor's from Metro State?  YS: I got my bachelor's from Metro State back in 2012, and then I decided if I wanted to do something I should go get my master's. 14, 18 I decided to go to the U [University of Minnesota] and get my master's. 14 When I was going to grad school my sister called me one day and she said, ""Hey, we should open a Somali restaurant in Burnsville,"" and I'm like, ""You're crazy."" 7, 16, 20 I hung up the phone. 8, 16 She called me back three times and I knew she was serious. 11, 16 In 2013 we started the restaurant and it did really well. 18 It took off.  We had a Star Tribune article, and some big publications in Minneapolis St. Paul magazine, and the Dakota Tribune, which was a big article in Dakota County. 19 We did really well, and that's how I got the money to start what I was passionate about with Alliance. 8, 10, 18 I did that for about two and a half years, and I thought, ""I don't want to do this."" 14, 17, 18 I'm passionate about mental health and chemical dependency. 12, 13, 19 Back in 2015 when I graduated from grad school I worked in Minneapolis Public Schools [MPS] for about a year in CUHC [Community University Health Care Center] clinic for about a year in Minneapolis where I learned a lot about addiction and mental health. 7, 10, 12, 14, 19 It's an FQH, federally qualified health care center. 8, 19 It's owned by the University of Minnesota technically.  AS: When you said grad school did you get your MSW? 7 YS: Yes.  My MSW [Master’s in Social Work], LGSW [Licensed Graduate Social Worker].  I did my internship at CUHC, so I did a social work triage position for about eight hundred hours or whatever the internship was. 15, 19 After that they hired me as a mental health practitioner, so I was working there for about a year. 5, 8, 12, 14, 19 I was in the process of starting Alliance as well. 17 Kind of a lot going on at the same time.  AS: Is the restaurant still open?  My sister manages it. 20 It's about ten, fifteen minutes from here right in Burnsville. 12, 15 If you look up African restaurant it will come up.  I did that, and that's where I learned the business aspect of things. 10 I'm a social worker, I can't do math. 19 [laughs] 15 But I learned all about managing budgets and things like that. 10 I learned a lot from the restaurant and starting and being patient and things like that. 10 AS: And restaurants are still communities. 19 They really are. 18 Food brings people together. 8, 9 I did that, graduated, and started Alliance. 7 I've been in business for about two and a half years now and we're doing really well. 12, 14, 18 Things are going really well for us. 18 We have a day group, Alliance Wellness, that works with the East African population that is culturally specific. 9, 16 We have twelve beds where we lodge them, so they go into treatment and then they go to the house too. 6, 12, 13 AS: So you bought a house? 6, 13 YS: A couple houses, yes. 6, 9, 11, 13 AS: Tell me about the stigma. 9 Stigma around addiction is huge in many cultures. 12, 14 I had a Muslim student from Kenya I think, and she was in my history of addiction class a few years ago. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 She said that the stigma was very intense. 9 Could you describe what that would mean in a family? 12 YS: Of course.  I think in our culture people are always skeptical about alcohol and drugs and any addiction. 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 18 I think in our culture we have black and white thinking, which is never a good thing. 10, 16, 19 Either you're crazy or you're not. 20 Either you're a drunk or you're not. 5, 8, 14 Either you're a good person or you're a bad person. 10 That's my biggest frustration.  The religious aspect doesn't help.  Because you're a Muslim you're not supposed to drink alcohol; it's forbidden. 5, 6 And I'm like why do we have fifteen clients in a group right now that are talking about alcoholism and addiction? 6, 10, 12, 14 And they're Muslim.  It's like the elephant in the room. 14 The worst thing you could do is drink. 5 It's like being the priest's daughter and getting pregnant. 7, 10, 20 It's like the worst thing.  It almost means you're not practicing your religion.  It's horrible. 10 People are shunned, and it's pretty bad. 10 Especially for women. 12 You're a woman, you're a person of color, you're a Muslim, and you're an addict. 14 It's like it's the worst thing.  You're down on the bottom. 9 I think education and awareness are the most important. 9, 14, 15 These things are not going to go away. 18, 20 When you move to a culture—America is giving a lot of immigrants a lot of opportunities, but also you pick up the bad habits to some extents. 15, 19, 20 AS: There are a lot of bad habits I think. 20 YS: Kids having sex before marriage, kids partying. 9, 12, 14, 20 Back home it's more family oriented. 12 You respect the elders and things.  Kids are just not that bright to be honest. 8, 12 With cell phone technology and things it makes things a lot easier. 8, 16 The stigma piece—I think people are just not educated and so they tend to judge and be judgmental. 9, 12, 14 I think people don't even know what to do as well. 9, 12 They don't know how to deal with addiction—the families. 12, 14, 17 And the clients, too. 10 All this happens, you're in detox, you're miserable. 15, 19 And pride.  We're very prideful people. 9 Like,  ""Do I want to get help?  Now Yussuf will know my problem now. 12 And he might know my mom or my dad."" 12, 14 AS: So even as an insider in the community you still struggle. 9, 19 YS: Oh yeah.  There are people that want to come help here. 9 People might say, ""Well, you're a Somali.  What's the big deal?""  Yeah, but sometimes it might not be a good fit. 10, 15 Just because you're Somali doesn't mean they'd be a good fit. 10, 15 I always make that comment when I do conferences or talk to people. 9, 12, 18 The assumption is that if you're from the same culture— AS: People who aren't Somali assume that.  YS: I think education across the board is important. 9, 14, 15 I'm a big advocate for that.  AS: Can you tell me a story, without using their name, about someone who has struggled with addiction and what has happened to them and their family? 6, 12, 14, 15 YS: Well, I know twenty people I can tell you about. 9, 12 A lot of them don't get support.  In a Western, white, American culture it's easier for someone to support you, or to come to AA with you and things like that. 19 It's a little more socially acceptable. 12, 19, 20 If your son or daughter is using you could kind of assist them and get them help. 6 AS: So there's not even that for parents? 20 You're not helping at all.  She doesn't even speak English.  How's she going to help you get into treatment? 12, 13 Or she doesn't understand it. 17, 18 AS: And she thinks, 17 ""Why don't you just stop?""  ""Why don't you stop?""  And they always tell me that. 18 ""If Amy just stops drinking, she's really a good person."" 5, 10, 11, 18 Well, yeah, but why is she drinking in the first place? 5, 11, 14 Let's find the underlying issue. 13 Amy didn't just pick up prescription pills. 10 Maybe she had a back pain issue and the Vicodin wasn't enough so now she's buying street drugs. 5, 6, 12, 13 Because there's always an underlying cause. 6, 13, 18 There's always pain under that addiction. 6, 12, 14, 18 I think people don't understand that and it's hard for them to fathom. 9, 17, 18 AS: Is there also a mental illness stigma? 9, 12 YS: Oh yeah, huge.  Mental illness is more accepted than addiction. 12, 14 The interesting thing is that ninety percent of my clients are concurrent. 10, 17 A lot of them have mental health issues. 12, 13, 19 They self-medicate themselves to cope with their mental illness. 12, 14 The addiction starts because the mental illness is not met. 12, 14 Mental health issues are not being treated so they self-medicate by using drugs and alcohol. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 19 AS: When you were talking about the black and white of being crazy or not that's almost doubly stigmatized. 9, 19, 20 If you actually do get a diagnosis and your addiction was the cause does it matter to the families? 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17 YS: No, it doesn't matter.  To some extent if you have mental health issues you are the crazy one and it's not acceptable. 8, 12, 13, 19, 20 They will kind of feel bad for you.  Rather than if you have severe mental health issue and then you come home drunk or high now it's a problem. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 In the reality you're treating your mental illness and that's what the issue is. 12, 13 Oftentimes we find that when we treat the mental health issue and get you get people stable on medication and they see the psychiatrist things are a lot easier to deal with. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19 The addiction can be treated because you're stable. 12, 14 If the mental illness is like up and down and you're not medicated or you're not seeing a psychiatrist and you're not stable then it's not going to work. 6, 12, 14 You cannot treat your addiction. 12, 14 We try to tackle both.  AS: What's the environment like at the sober house? 6, 12, 13 Do you call it a sober house? 6, 13 YS: Yeah, supportive housing. 6, 19 AS: I like that name better than 'sober house.' 6, 13 I just think about language a lot.  YS: Yeah, of course.  Language is really important. 9, 18 AS: Yeah, so what is life like there? 10 YS: It's really good. 10, 18 Some do well and some don't do well.  We teach them some life skills. 10 They all have some chores.  They have to learn how to make appointments for themselves. 10, 12 They learn life skills. 10 Some of them might not get along. 17 They fight about pickles and ketchup, who knows. 12 There's always something. 18 A lot of them are homeless, so in the winter we are more busy. 15 So right now we have twelve beds and we're full. 12, 14 In the summers it's a little bit slower because people tend to go outside and have a good time. 7, 9, 10, 20 AS: And you help them find the services that they need? 19 YS: That's one of the daily commands.  We apply for GRH [group residential housing] or apply for some type of long-term housing for them. 6, 9, 13, 17 So that way by the time they graduate here they can find something. 18 AS: Can you tell me about any success stories you've had? 9 YS: Where do you want me to start?  [laughs] 15 AS: Well, you never know. 12, 16 It's a tricky business.  YS: That's true, it is. 5 We have a couple clients that have graduated, a couple that show up at least once a month out of gratitude, thankful, have two jobs. 7, 10, 11, 14, 16 This guy came from jail.  He had like four DWIs.  Chronic alcoholic. 6 Everybody disowned him in his family. 12 His wife, his three kids. 20 Now he's back with his wife and kids and working two jobs. 11, 20 It took six months of hard work with him. 9, 11, 16 He did some outpatient too and is doing AA. 11 People lose hope when they are at rock bottom. 9, 14 Sometimes when you lose hope people are incapable of doing anything. 9 Hope is a big thing.  I think a lot of people are like, ""Shit, what do I have to lose?"" 9 I'm in jail for a year now, I have four DWIs, my wife left me, my three beautiful daughters left me. 12, 14, 20 My mom won't even talk to me. 14 What do I have to lose? 9 They throw in the towel.  I think when you give people hope—it makes a big difference when you give people three meals a day and a place to stay. 9, 16 It makes a huge difference.  You educate them and you give them opportunities and you believe in them. 14, 19 I think you see a difference in people. 6, 9 AS: Do you have a personal connection to addiction in your family? 12, 14 You said you've always wanted to do this. 18 YS: Actually I don't to be honest, which is actually kind of interesting because I would say sixty percent of my staff are in recovery. 7, 8, 17 That is always good because we need people with that experience. 9, 10, 18 Personally I don't.  Nobody in my family has addiction. 12, 14 I do have highly addictive behaviors as some of us do. 7, 14 I don't have any addiction issues. 12, 13, 14 I've always been passionate about it. 18 I've always understood it, and I was always curious. 18 I'm very passionate about helping people that are underserved. 9 I thought that my community needs me, and why not do my own thing. 17, 18, 19 It took me a lot of years to think about this and to plan and go through all the DHS and all the stuff. 14 It's not easy.  It's a lot of work.  AS: How many clients do you have right now? 10, 12 How is it growing? 10 YS: In the day group we have about twelve to fifteen. 16 We also have the evening group that is mostly white or black—it's not culturally specific. 12, 19 Then we have a Sunday group. 16 In total I would say we have about thirty to thirty-five.  AS: Those are clients? 10 YS: Yes.  AS: Has it stayed at that level?  Winter is a little more busy. 15, 20 People are more depressed. 10 Summer is down.  The numbers are more like fifteen to twenty.  AS: That's pretty common in the field, isn't it? 10 That's how it is for the big people with the clients too. 9, 10 AS: When it gets cold and dark people are ready to go. 9, 17 YS: Absolutely.  AS: What is your treatment model here? 12, 13 YS: We have many models.  I think the most important thing is to meet people where they're at. 9, 18 That's the first important thing. 9, 14 We need to figure out if they have toothpaste.  Let's go to Wal-Mart and get them some toothpaste.  Let's not worry about the alcoholism or the opioid addiction right now. 6, 12, 13, 14 He needs a towel and some toothpaste and we'll start with that.  Let him get some sleep tonight and make sure he brushes his teeth. 16 Dignity is very important. 9 He showers and tomorrow morning he comes and we will treat the mental health issue, the addiction issue. 12, 13, 14, 19 Meeting people where they're at—I'm a big fan of that. 9 AS: Do you see that as part of a harm reduction model? 5, 6, 9, 14 YS: Oh yeah.  Harm reduction is so important. 5, 9, 14 That's my frustration sometimes.  You have to understand the client and where they're at. 10, 14, 17, 18 A lot of people don't understand. 9, 17, 18 There are big companies out there that have their own policy. 10 ""Our policy is we cannot buy a client toothpaste."" 10 Well, yeah, that doesn't help anyone if he can't brush his teeth.  He's probably afraid to talk to you.  Do you see what I mean? 6 I think motivation is a big thing that we use here. 6, 13 EMDR  [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing] is something we use, CBT, and DBT is big. 6, 12, 13, 15, 17 I think the most important thing is just treat people like human beings. 9, 19 That's the most important thing. 9 I think a lot of people struggle with that. 9 AS: That's a big part of the history of treatment in the US. 9, 12, 13, 15 There's the moral component that's really big. 8, 18 How do twelve-step programs work into your program?  YS: Yes, we invite people. 9 I have been trying to establish a Muslim twelve-step based—there's a lot of need for that. 13 I wear so many hats and I've got so much stuff to do.  I just need to find the right person to help me with that. 12 It's just really important. 9, 18 AS: How would you change it for a Muslim based twelve-step? 13 Because twelve-step is always about how the higher power can be anything 7, 17, 18 YS: Yeah, the higher power, God—I don't know how it would look. 7, 12, 17 I actually should sit down and think about it. 7 AS: You might not be the first person to think about it. 14 There might be someone else out there.  YS: Yeah I know they did something in New York, but I don't know. 12 I want to do more research and figure it out about NA or AA for a twelve-step model, but I think there's a need for that.  Again, the same token, the whole ""let's hold hands and sing kumbaya"" is all a Western, American cultural thing. 17 We have to find a way. 18 In fact, I had a client that has graduated and is doing really well that talked to me about wanting to start a support group. 7, 10, 18 That's his thing.  He's a big fan of that.  So, I've got to support him in doing that.  I got him a space he could do.  We maybe do a weekly meeting or something. 5, 15, 18 AS: What do you think about best practices?  Meeting people where they're at, but when you think about the future of treatment where do you want it to go, where do you see it going? 6, 9, 12, 13 Is that the same thing or not?  YS: I'm just a small, tiny guy.  I think we need more counselors, number one. 14 LADCs [licensed alcohol and drug counselor] in general because there's not many in the field. 5, 6, 13 Also, people who are culturally competent are very important. 9 Culturally competent is kind of a broad word, but people that are sensitive to other people and other cultures are really important. 9, 18 I think also it's important with policy. 9 They keep cutting budgets and all these things.  It's just going to keep getting worse.  It's not going to get better.  Whoever is in charge, the big boss, and they read this book we need more funding.  I had a professor that used to say, ""Funding drives practice."" 5, 6, 13, 16 Which is true. 5 You have to make sure the bills are paid.  AS: And that it's that important that it can determine how you practice. 9, 17 YS: It costs so much money, Amy, to put you in jail and prison than it would cost me—like ten dollars a day. 8, 10, 16 That's just hypothetically speaking, but it's a hundred dollars in the county jail a day. 6, 16, 19 With these ten dollars you get three meals a day and treatment. 12, 13, 16 You're learning about how your mind thinks. 10, 17 You're not just sitting in the cell for twenty-three hours. 15 That's not going to do any good. 10 For you and for me because I'm a taxpayer too.  AS: The whole incarceration—incarcerating people with addiction and mental illness because they 'committed a crime.' 9, 12, 14 What can you tell me about your clientele and opioids? 6, 10, 13 YS: We have been seeing a lot of that recently. 6 AS: What are they using? 6 YS: Heroin, prescription pills, benzos. 10 I think a lot of them especially in the Somali community there are a couple cases. 11, 17, 19 We had one guy that OD'd and passed away. 18, 20 I have clients that say—we talk about it in group. 10 A lot of the guys are more alcohol than opioids and they call it the rock. 6, 13, 14 AS: They call heroin 'the rock'? 14 YS: Yeah, like rocks. 14 It's a street name I think.  What they do is basically they're saying, ""I'm an alcoholic, but alcohol will not kill me."" 6, 19 So they're discriminating against each other.  It's very interesting. 17 There's a whole hierarchy of it.  The pain pill people think they're better than the injection drug users. 5, 6, 9, 13 YS: I'm like really? 18 I tend to challenge them. 14 AS: So you're seeing an increase in heroin. 6, 16 What about meth? 6 YS: I don't see much meth. 6 Somali women I see it. 6, 12 AS: That makes sense because it gives you energy.  If you have children. 5, 14, 20 YS: Child protection cases, yes. 17 We see a lot of alcohol. 6 Opioids have increased.  Our numbers have been increasing.  A lot of them it starts with a car accident and back pain, or an accident in football, baseball, or basketball. 6, 13 You have to be mindful of this.  My mom had back surgery and he gave her a prescription for ninety pills of oxycontin. 10, 14 I was like, “Dude what the hell are you doing?”  My LADC—that kind of thing.  I'm not LADC but my treatment director in me was like, ""That's a lot of pills."" 12, 13, 18, 19 And that stuff is highly addictive. 7, 14 We have to make the doctors responsible. 12, 14, 16 AS: There is some work being done on that here.  Do you know Chris Johnson? 12 I'll connect you with him.  He's doing an opioid prescribing task force to try to cut that. 8, 10, 13 He got really frustrated as an ER doctor in St. Louis Park. 12, 14, 18 YS: How does he feel about Suboxone or methadone? 8 AS: Oh, absolutely.  How do you feel about that here?  YS: I love it. 14 I'm a big fan of all avenues of recovery.  What works for you might not work for me. 9 I've challenged people that say, ""Well..."" 9 Whatever works for you I'm a big fan of that. 9 AS: All seven of the doctors I've interviewed—because they're science based. 12, 13, 14 Their evidence based and they know that it can work. 12, 13 YS: Yes, if you do it right. 12 AS: Can you get your clients to their clinic everyday? 10, 16 YS: Yeah, or we have people that have [unclear]. 9 I was looking into establishing one actually. 7 AS: Oh really? 18 It's the time.  It's the moment for that for sure. 8, 12, 14 I've worked closely with people from Valhalla Place. 9, 10, 14 Well that's where I met you!  YS: Yeah, what was his name?  AS: Chuck [Hilger].  That's where I met you was that MAT [medication assisted treatment] training. 12, 13, 14 It's fascinating that we have a medicine that can actually help people get their mind on track, but we still have a stigma about even the different medications. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 Methadone is for the hopeless cases. 9, 17 It's not true though. 5 YS: Yeah, Suboxone is really good. 8, 10, 18 I know. 12 AS: What's your dream for this place? 5 Five years from now. 12, 14 YS: I think my biggest challenge is housing. 6 I want to house people and it's important—because what happens sometimes to be honest is we find someone, treat them for ninety days and they do well, and then after that we have to, not kick them out, but insurance will only pay for so many days. 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16 We have to form them back into the community. 19 Apartments are usually good because they have [unclear] or they didn't pay their rent. 9, 10, 12 A lot of them don't have a job. 11 If we can get them into the GRH.  I need some type of long-term housing. 6, 17 Even if they can get a place to sit for another four, five months until they figure things out. 11, 16 What happens is they go back to the streets, they relapse, they come back to treatment. 5, 12, 13, 15 Resources are not there and it's a waste of money if you ask me. 8, 10 You give people three months and a place to stay they will likely get a job, or at least a place to take their meds. 9, 11, 16 So housing is my biggest challenge. 6 If I could find a place to house people I think it would be good. 6, 9, 10, 13 I think that's one of my goals is to find long-term housing for people. 6, 9, 17 AS: How are you thinking about doing that?  YS: Getting a contract with the county. 19 Or figuring something out.  AS: That would be under Alliance Wellness?  It takes so long for us to get someone discharged because they can't find a place to live. 17 I have a couple guys right now that are ready to graduate and we don't know what to do with them. 11, 12 We give them an extension for thirty days. 16 Sometimes I honestly do a free service for them because they have nowhere to go honestly. 8, 10, 12, 19 AS: When you say the homelessness—you mentioned this a couple of minutes ago—but the homelessness is usually a result of being shut out from their families, right? 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 YS: Oh yeah.  Obviously when someone is using they steal, cheat, and lie. 6 It's not the person so much as the addiction. 12, 14 A lot of families don't understand that. 17, 18 They say, ""Oh, Amy, she's an asshole.  She stole a hundred bucks from me!""  Well, yeah, you left a hundred bucks on the counter and she's an addict. 14 The families don't understand that. 17, 18 We have to educate the family. 12, 14 Don't leave the hundred bucks. 18 AS: Do you have a family group? 12 Have you been able to do that?  They don't come.  I don't blame them.  One is transportation. 17 I think a lot of immigrant families are working two jobs and trying to support them, so time is of the essence. 11, 17 I think they're also skeptical about me to do their dirty laundry. 5 Because of pride and ego.  AS: Because is there an understanding of trust? 14, 17, 18 YS: No, honestly I think a lot of them are skeptical about me and I don't blame them. 8, 10 If I was a Somali guy who was an alcoholic I probably wouldn't go see Yussuf too. 6 To be honest. 8 YS: Because of the stigma. 9 It's a small world.  Everybody knows everybody. 12 It's a small community. 19 I think pride and ego are a big thing, too.  I think a lot of people are skeptical sometimes. 9 I think an important thing for a lot of families is they don't understand it. 9, 17, 18 They have no clue.  They love their kid and will do anything for them, but the kid or whatever, the person, the client, has cheated on them, or yelled, or lied, and they've bailed them out twenty-five times. 10, 14 ""We are just tired. 5 Stop it.  Shut up.  Leave us alone."" 8 AS: That's a common thing in every culture.  YS: Absolutely.  But if you don't have a lot of resources and I bailed you out with the three thousand dollars I had in my savings it's not going to look good if you go back using again. 6, 10 I had a client that was telling me that thirty-three thousand dollars her dad wrote a check to Hazelden for a month or whatever for the treatment. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 The day after she came out she relapsed. 16 She said, ""My dad was pissed."" 14 I said, ""I would be pissed, too.""  But things like that.  Addiction is a disease and we have to figure out a way to treat it. 14, 18 I think a lot of people don't understand that. 9, 17, 18 AS: Yeah, seventy-five years later we are still talking about that. 14 We are still trying to convince people it's a disease. 9 YS: If you're a diabetic and you see a doctor you take your insulin. 6, 12, 14 And it's like, ""Oh, you're a diabetic.  I'm sorry.  Make sure you take your blood sugar."" Whatever.  Make sure you eat.  Addiction is kind of the same idea but nobody feels bad for you. 14 Those comments on Facebook—my blood pressure goes up. 10, 12 I get into fights with people on Facebook all the time. 9 AS: Your Alliance account or just your personal one? 8 YS: Just my personal one.  People are idiots and I educate them. 14 Some times I say, ""Enough is enough,"" and I just start.  I'm like, well that worked for you, and you got lucky maybe and good for you. 5, 8, 10 And others are like, ""Boo hoo.  Feel sorry for me.""  And maybe by the grace of God you did well, but it doesn't mean that you can look down on people that are struggling. 5, 9 You struggle for five years before you get out, or whatever. 14 I think it's important that we do that. 9 Education is very important. 9, 14 AS: And community education. 14, 15, 19 YS: Absolutely.  AS: What is your place in the community? 19 That's a broad question.  YS: No, it's okay.  I know that a lot of people like me. 9, 12 I think a lot of people respect what I do. 9 I've been recognized. 17 I think if you just Google it you'll find a lot of articles and stuff.  Some people are skeptical about me still and you'll have people who doubt you, and that's okay. 9 You can have it both ways. 18 I graduated from the U as I told you, and the University of Minnesota did a story about Patty [Shandy], one of my former professors. 7, 15, 16 [takes out the article] 17 YS: Yeah, she's great. 20 She is well known for trauma care. 11, 12, 19 AS: I was going to ask you about trauma.  YS: Oh yeah.  We do a lot of EMDR.  I think a lot of people, over ninety percent of Somali people are victims of torture. 9 It's a high number. 7 Because of the civil war.  Have you seen the movie Hotel Rwanda? 6 The Hutus and Tutsis.  It's kind of the same thing.  AS: I studied a lot about Mozambique and southern Africa.  YS: Same thing.  Same thing.  AS: One thing I've been reading about it the idea of epigenetics.  That parents who experienced trauma their children or grandchildren might have a proclivity towards higher anxiety, depression. 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 YS: I didn't know that. 12 AS: I'll send you some stuff.  I think you would find that as an interesting approach to think about how to help explain it to families. 17 YS: Yeah, please do.  AS: There's a lot of research connected to the Holocaust.  YS: Wow.  There's this video I want to find for you. 18 Yes, send it to me.  I want to read it.  There's something called Inside War. 9 I'm thinking about it on YouTube right now. 12 It's like an eight-minute video. 15, 18 You should watch it. 17 The Inside War. 9 AS: Who do you have here that does EMDR?  YS: We have an LICSW [licensed independent clinical social worker] that we contract out. 13, 19 The War Inside, sorry. 9 Treating Somali's mentally ill. 12 It's like a nine minute thing. 15 Abdulrahman Ali.  Actually we have Skyped him many times.  AS: Anything else?  AS: Oh, is this the first— YS: It's the second. 14 AS: That has an East African focus?  Where's the other one? 8 YS: In Minneapolis.  They do things different.  They might not welcome you.  AS: What's the name of it?  YS: South East Homes.  AS: They might not welcome me?  AS: What's their approach?  YS: I don't know, maybe you should call them and find out. 5, 12 The lady that owns it is very different.  She doesn't believe in networking and stuff like that.  She sees me as a threat. 6 There's not enough clients for all of us. 10 That kind of thing.  AS: Oh, so it's not like, ""Great there's a second person that I can work with!""  And there are like three or four after me that have established and helped.  AS: How many are there now? 12 YS: Four or five outpatient. 11 Maybe one other one inpatient.  So there's enough clients for all of us. 10 AS: What about other immigrant groups? 12 YS: I've helped the [unclear] open one with the Wilder Foundation. 8 CLUES [Comunidades Latinas Unidas en Servicio] is doing the Hispanic community. 14, 19 The Hmong community? 19 I don't know much. 12 YS: Okay, that's good to know. 10, 12 AS: What do you think about the culturally specific—obviously you think it's important but as a practitioner? 8, 9 YS: It's still different.  You don't—here you just have your own forty minutes and then you have to bill for services. 15, 19 You get thirty minutes session and boom you're out. 15 We do way more than that. 18 We have to educate families. 14, 17 I feel like it's not fair sometimes with insurance companies or the state. 9, 10 They just want you to check your damn boxes and bill for it.  But we might spend an hour and a half explaining something to a family but you can only bill for thirty minutes. 10, 12, 14, 15 AS: There are things within the institutions and the structure that are not culturally sensitive. 15 YS: Absolutely.  That's a nice way to say it. 18 You should run for office. 8 AS: [laughs] 15 Once I finish my book.  YS: Let me know. 12 I'll support you.  AS: Well, thank you. 11 YS: Yeah, you're doing great work. 20 I think we need more awareness and we need more education so I'm glad you're doing this. 9, 14, 15 Whatever support you need let me know. 12"
"23","Johnson_Dean","Lorraine Teel Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 9, 2017 St. Louis Park, Minnesota Lorraine Teel-LT Amy Sullivan-AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan.  I am Rustica Bakery in St. Louis Park with Loraine Teel.  It's May 9th, 2017.  Lorraine, do you give me permission to record this interview?  LT: Yes, I do.  AS: Alright, thank you. 11, 12 If you could just start by telling me a little bit about your life story. 10, 15, 20 LT: As you said my name is Lorraine Teel.  I'm not from Minnesota.  I was born and raised in New York just outside of New York City. 14 I moved here last year of high school with my parents. 7, 14, 15, 20 Given that I'm now sixty-seven years old I think it's fair to say I'm from Minnesota. 9, 12, 14 But I still consider myself part New Yorker. 9 I started at the University of Minnesota very, very young.  I was only seventeen.  I only had done three years in high school. 7, 14 I immediately got caught up in all sorts of unusual activity.  AS: How old were you when you started, or what year were you born? 14 LT: I was born in 1950, and I went to the U for the first time in the fall of '67. 14 Within probably a week I was chair of the committee to end the war in Vietnam. 15 A lot of escapades at the U. I met and fell in love with a man, and winter quarter dropped out, and got married. 5, 7, 11, 14 So I am now married forty-nine years. 7, 12, 14 I will now be married fifty years to that same person. 7, 12, 14 A lot of people say when they meet me, and I saw I have a forty-seven year old daughter they're like, well you don't look like it. 9, 14, 18 I always say, well, she's my husband's daughter from his first marriage. 14, 18 That always kind of gives me some space. 18 We got married. 7 He was a machinist at the time we got married. 7 He himself—he's very open about it—had had a drug problem as a teenager and a young adult. 5, 6, 12 Back in those days in the early sixties there was really nothing, and he wound up going out to California to a program called Synanon. 16, 18 He was in Synanon for a year and a half in San Francisco. 14 He came back to Minnesota to see his mother and started back at school, and that's where we met. 6, 7 From the very first days that we were married he talked about wanting to start a program like Synanon, and to work with people like himself who had addiction problems. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 I like to consider myself the original Nancy Reagan, because at the age of eighteen I remember quite distinctly saying to him, ""I don't understand. 9, 11, 17, 18 If people don't want to use drugs why don't they just stop?"" 5, 6, 9, 13 I mean I was into kind of the sixties psychedelic sort of scene, but never into any kind of heavy drugs, and I've never used anything—any kind of substance like that. 5, 6, 13, 16 But we were married for about two years, and a program started up here in town that was basically a bad trip center for kids that were taking psychadelics and wound up in a bad way. 7, 11, 14, 18, 19 AS: Do you know what that was called? 12 LT: Pharm House with a 'PH'. 6, 13 It has morphed and changed. 13, 14 I think it's still in existence; it has nothing to do with substance abuse. 6, 13 It wound up being a residential program for adolescents with mental health problems. 9, 12, 13, 19 When we were there it was a bad trip center, and we wound up moving in.  It was being underwritten and supported by the Johnson Institute, which was the originator of what is called the Minnesota Model of treatment. 12, 13 So the Johnson Institute, which was backed by a wealthy family, the Whitney family, Eli Whitney and his wife Irene. 12, 20 Irene had started this bad trip center, and they wanted to open a treatment center and eventually they did. 5, 12, 13, 18 They hired my husband and myself to work there. 5, 14 It became apparent that they really wanted to work with adolescents from well to do families. 17, 18, 20 My husband didn't really want to do that. 14, 18 He wanted to work with street addicts. 14, 18 And I didn't really care. 18, 19 I was twenty years old. 14 I had a brand new infant, I was like whatever. 16 I'll go along for the ride. 17 Ultimately he hooked up with another guy and the three of us started Eden House, which is now R.S. Eden, which is about a fifteen million dollar a year operation that started with me keeping the books on my blue jeans. 6, 12, 13, 14 Earlier it was a program solely for people addicted primarily to opiates coming back from Vietnam. 9, 12, 14 For the first nine months that was who we got. 11, 14, 16 We started in September of '70.  April of '71 we got two inmates released from St. Cloud [Minnesota Correctional Facility].  It was the first time that the Department of Corrections had done that. 9, 12, 14 They took a [unclear] of thinking, well, we'll take a chance.  One of those individuals is now the president of R.S. Eden who has been clean and sober since that day that he came to Eden House. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16 AS: What's his name?  LT: Dan Cainn.  He would be a great person for you to talk to. 20 He also ultimately went on to be chair of the Sentencing Guidelines Commission. 9 He is a very well respected expert on addiction and corrections. 12, 14 I was his boss when I was still at Eden House. 6, 13 So I was at Eden House and we expanded. 6, 13 We had a number of different programs because it was like today with the Federal Government's response to opiate addiction where it's like, oh my God! 12, 13, 14, 16 People are using drugs! 5, 6 The same thing happened under Nixon. 15 And in 1974 the National Institute of Drug Abuse did something called Rapid Expansion grants because all of a sudden they noticed, with all due respect, that white people were using drugs. 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 And who cared before that, you know? 5, 12, 19 It's identical.  I've lived through the '74 thing; I've lived through the crack epidemic, and now the opiate use. 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16 It has all of the same exact hallmarks and it's just like deja vu all over again. 5 So I stayed at Eden House for eighteen years. 6, 13, 14 Seventeen or eighteen years, and I always argue when I left. 14, 18 I finally felt I had done everything I could do in drug abuse. 5, 6, 11, 13 I was very well recognized in Minnesota, and sat on a number of commissions and led a number of different initiatives, and I thought, ""I want to do something different."" 17, 18 I really wanted to work with people with HIV. 9, 18 It was late eighties.  We were just coming to terms with what HIV was, and the link between HIV and substance abuse especially injecting drug use was quite [unclear]. 5, 6, 11, 13, 17 And I thought, ""Well, what am I going to do? 17, 18 I'm not a direct service provider, I'm not very good."" 10, 18, 19 AS: Can I back up.  So did you go back to school after you had your daughter? 7 Can you talk about your education? 14, 15 LT: Oh, yeah.  After my daughter was born we were at Eden House. 6, 13, 14 I didn't want to go back to school, and I didn't know whether or not I could quote unquote ""do it."" 7, 12 So I took a flyer on going to the University of Minnesota.  They had a chem dep [chemical dependency] counselor training program—they don't have it anymore, but I went through that and became a chem dep counselor, which was when I realized I could not be a direct service provider. 13, 18, 19 AS: Meaning you didn't want to counsel people? 9 LT: Right, it just wasn't my thing.  In 1977, Eden House went through some real turmoil. 6, 13 There were three of us who had founded the organization, and I was the Program Administrator, and my husband and Chuck Beady, who was the other founder, were the co-directors. 14, 18, 19 They had a split.  The whole thing started to come apart at the seams. 9, 11, 14 The board chair at the time was a graduate of the University of Minnesota program in Hospital and Health Care Administration. 14 Basically, my husband said, ""I don't want to run it. 8, 14 I only want to work with people. 9 I don't want to be in charge of pushing paper.  I just want to work in the program.""  The board said, ""Who wants to run it?"" 8 And I raised my hand, and the board chair said, ""You need some learning."" 10, 14 [laughs] 15 I went back and got my graduate and undergraduate degree at the U. I went through the programs in Hospital and Health Care Administration, and at the time it was in the School of Public Health.  Then it wound up over at the Carlson School [of Management], and now it's back in Public Health I think. 12 I got my undergraduate degree in a self-designed program through what was then University Without Walls. 11 It's now a program in Independent Learning and also in Hospital and Health Care Administration. 12 So, yes, I did finish my education, which was really wonderful. 14, 15, 18 I can't say enough about that program at the U in hospital and health care. 8, 19 At the time it was perfect for what I needed. 17 So when I wanted to go back to work, or after I left Eden I set up a consulting business, actually not far from here. 7, 14, 18 I consulted with a lot of, at the time, a lot of—chem dep was the word—so a lot of CD programs doing their licensing, and policies.  I'm an excellent paper pusher.  This is my strength.  [laughs] 15 I understand all the bullshit that the government wants you to do. 12, 17, 18 I know how to put it in their language, and yet have it be understandable by counselors and clients. 10, 12, 17, 18 Myself and my business partner did lots of training in vulnerable adults, federal confidentiality. 8, 9, 16 This is before I started AIDS work.  I had this consulting firm, and I was very successful, but it was very isolating because my business partner worked half time as a clinical director of Wayside House. 6, 9, 13, 18, 19 She wasn't really in the office that much. 18 It just felt really, I was still young, and it felt really kind of lonely. 8, 11, 18 I thought, ""I've got to get a real job."" 11, 17, 18 Plus, at the time health insurance was becoming an issue. 13, 19 My husband had left Eden House after I did, about two years after I did. 6, 13, 14 AS: How long were you at Eden House? 6, 13, 17 So a long time. 17 By then it had expanded.  It had a residential component, and then an outpatient component. 8, 9, 11, 13 We also had other things.  We had a coffee house for a while. 6, 13 We had a program for Native youth that were inhalant abusers at Phillips Junior High. 6, 13 We had some programs at the women's prison in Shakopee, and the men's prison up in Stillwater. 12, 16 We were doing lots of stuff. 16 At this point, Eden House had really four divisions. 6, 13, 18 Substance use, which is the old Eden House, which is inpatient, outpatient program, and they have about five hundred units and supportive housing. 6, 11, 13, 19 And a corrections programs.  That's where the R.S.—it's now R.S. Eden. 12 They merged with a St. Paul corrections program called Reentry Services.  The R.S. was for the Reentry Services.  I know, and I hate their logo. 12 [laughs] 15 And everyone thinks 17 I have so much power because I was a founder and all this. 17 I'm like I can't get Dan to change anything.  It's amazing. 9 He and I are very, very close, and he's a wonderful person. 9, 10, 18 I don't work for him, and the final thing they have is a lab, so they do a ton of UA [urine analysis] testing. 6 I work in the substance use division for the individual who runs the substance use programs as a consultant. 6, 8, 13 I basically told him, ""I like to think of you as the executive director,"" because he's—the administrative offices for R.S. 16, 18, 19 Eden are on the north side, and he's over on Portland on the south side kind of by himself. 9 I said, ""And you need an assistant.""  And I had a lot of executive assistants.  I know what they do. 12 I write policy manuals, I develop training, I do client handbooks. 10 I do all the stuff that he doesn't have anybody to do.  So, right now I'm doing the PREA—Prison Rape Elimination Act policies for them because I can read through all this bullshit. 12, 18 I did the consulting work for a couple years. 11, 14 And like I said it was kind of isolating, so I thought I wanted a real job, but I didn't want to be in direct service, and the only thing—because Minnesota is a low-incidence of HIV state—there aren't a million programs. 10, 11, 17, 18, 19 And the only thing that I would like to do is run the Minnesota AIDS Project, but somebody's doing that. 8 And guess what?  Right when I thought that, literally, he quit and went to Washington. 17, 18 So, I thought, ""Wow, I'm going to apply for that job!"" 11, 17, 18 So I applied for the job, and in all honesty I think they were really intrigued with me because of all of the things I had done, and the fact that at the time I had also, through my consulting work, was the associative administrator of an agency called the Institute on Black Chemical Abuse, which later became the African American Family Services; now it's gone, but it was an organization founded by Peter Bell, who is a local, well known individual. 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 18 Peter was a rarity: African American Republican. 19 During the tail end of the Reagan and Bush administration, Bush won, and they sent Peter all over the world, literally, as a spokesperson on chem dep. 5 And there was nobody left to run the shop. 8, 14, 15 So I was kind of the invisible, behind the scenes person that Peter hired, because I knew him for years. 5, 14, 16 I think the MAP board—Minnesota AIDS Project board—I kind of think they thought I was black, you know. 12, 17, 18 And that's my theory.  Anyways, I did make the first cut. 14, 18 I never thought I'd get the job because I thought they would only want to hire a gay man, or someone who had a direct connection to HIV, and I had no one in my family, and really immediate friends other than my neighbor who I knew was living with HIV. 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20 I was kind of shocked that they interviewed me.  It was very formal; very different back in those days because HIV was so new. 16 To cut to the chase I got the job. 11 I was stunned.  I mean, how different it was back then.  When I got the job they immediately dragged me over to the Health Department to have me meet with the Commissioner of Health. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 18 I mean, now, I don't know if Linda, who is the new ED could even get a meeting with the Commissioner of Health, but I was like on day one. 8, 12, 16, 18 I mean articles in the paper about me, interviews about me, which is where I developed my favorite line, which was—you mentioned you have a daughter? 8, 9, 12 When a reporter said to me from the St. Paul Pioneer Press ""You mentioned you have a daughter, and I'm just wondering could you describe your family structure?"" 8, 12, 13, 15 Which was an indirect way of everyone trying to find out whether or not I was a lesbian. 18 My standard comeback to that question, which I have freely given to anyone else to use was, ""Never have so many people been interested in who I sleep with since my mother in 1968."" 6, 9, 13, 14, 16 I constantly, everyone always asked. 18 The response—people were for years—the inside joke was, ""Well have you ever seen her 'husband'? 6, 9, 13, 14 Did you know his 'name' is Pat?"" 12 Which was back and forth from the Saturday Night Live thing. 16 And my husband is very antisocial, and so the last thing he would ever do would be go to a MAP thing. 14, 19 And, at the time he had left Eden, and he started a gun store. 14 So, I don't think firearms and MAP were— So, it was an odd sort of time, but it was wonderful. 18 It was a real bonding time.  I think the people that were at MAP in the early days have stayed very close. 9, 10, 14, 16 I mean for a long time I felt a bit like an outsider. 9, 11, 17, 20 I started in 1990, and MAP had started—had been founded in '83, really got going in '87—‘83. 18 [pause] 6, 13 I was talking about how the people at MAP in the early days really bonded, although I did feel a bit like an outsider starting a few years after others, but quickly got to be kind of accepted. 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 Part of the inside crowd, if you will. 9 But they remained for a long time, and probably still does, an element of people who—it's the same in any field of the public professions—people who feel like they are doing God's work, and they kind of look down their noses at so-called bureaucrats who sit in the office and push paper. 9, 12, 17, 19 And I was kind of a cool executive director because I knew the streets, and I knew kind of both sides. 5, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 I think I had a little more cache with the staff. 20 But when I started MAP was doing—at the time it was called the IVDA: Intravenous Drug Abuse. 6, 13 Then that got changed to IVDU because you didn't want to make a judgment that people that were using drugs were abusers, so then it got changed to IVDU: Intravenous Drug Users outreach. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13 Then it got shortened to IDU: 18 Injecting drug use because not everyone was injecting intravenously, especially in the gay/bi community you had a lot of transgenders that were using hormones intramuscularly. 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 17, 19 Personally, I found the distinctions to be absolutely beyond distracting, so inside the walls of my office I referred to it as the IUD program. 5, 17 It just was irritating me.  And you couldn't use words like I was used to at Eden House like junkie, or dope fiend, or anything because those were too judgmental. 6, 12, 13, 16 Early on that whole harm reduction meet people where they're at began to permeate the world, which I always thought was another stupid thing. 5, 9, 14, 17, 18 AS: Why did you think that was stupid?  They're over on Hennepin Avenue or Nicollet [Avenue].  I took it literally as people where they're at. 9 But in terms of the language? 17 LT: I understand, I understand that. 17, 18 But as we talk about the needle exchange, I think there was a real difference between my approach and the approach of solely harm reduction because I felt that at the time, and I'm not in the field now, so I can't speak to today. 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 AS: Sure, you're talking about in the nineties. 12 LT: Right, but at the time there were people that were self-described harm reduction folks offered little other than clean needles to people. 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20 I wanted to offer people clean needles, and an opportunity to talk about a future. 9, 10, 18, 19 I mean it wasn't a pray before you eat Salvation Army approach, but I wanted people to know there was a way out of this lifestyle, and the choices that they were making. 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 So, I wanted a more comprehensive approach than solely, ""Hey, ain't I cool because I talk your language, and I know what it means to fix,"" you know. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 I can say all the cool things that you can say. 17 I also frankly felt that some of the people that were doing the work were putting themselves at risk. 9, 11 Sue [Purchase], who at the time was with Women With a Point, I don't know that Sue was doing it, but her partner whose name I can't remember, I don't know if she mentioned that when you met, but her partner thought it was really cool because people would call her to exchange needles. 8, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18 She would drive over to somebody's house and leave her kids in the car and go upstairs and exchange needles. 5, 6, 10, 13, 18 And I'm thinking, ""Well that's great. 20 So there's a bad drug deal that's going on upstairs, and you ain't never coming out?"" 5, 6, 16 I just thought this was really not good. 10, 17, 18 But, at the time we hadn't started needle exchange. 10 It was just starting.  The first one, which I'm sure you know, out in the Seattle area, Tacoma, that Dave Purchase started, was getting some traction. 8, 12, 14 There was no Internet, so we didn't read about things on the Internet.  I was active in Washington.  I was on the Public Policy Committee for a national advocacy group, AIDS Action Counsel.  I don't know what it's called now. 12 It's still there, but it's not AIDS action counsel anymore.  They had a policy committee, and I was the only non-coastal person that was active, and that was part of this. 9, 16 It was hearing from people from other parts of the country how their AIDS organizations were wanting to start needle exchange. 9, 10, 19 At the time I had hired a guy at MAP, Bob Tracy, to do our public policy work. 5, 19 I had reached far into my past, and hired the person who worked with me at Pharm House back in 1970, and he had been a chem dep instructor here in Minnesota, but he had moved to San Francisco, and gotten a degree. 5, 6, 7, 13, 15 It's a doctorate degree in human sexuality with a specialty in HIV and gay me. 9, 12, 14, 19 He was himself a former injecting drug user. 5, 6, 13 He had the perfect background. 17 His name was Dan Ford.  Dan had been the director of education for the Cascade AIDS Project. 14, 15, 18, 19 He had worked for a street program in San Francisco with homeless, gay youth. 9 He had all the perfect qualities. 17 I called him up, and brought him back to Minnesota, which was a wonderful thing. 18 Sadly, he passed away this past October, but he would have been a wonderful person to talk to. 18, 20 So, my policy person and Dan and I started talking about doing a needle exchange, but I wanted to do a legitimate needle exchange. 10, 18 I was brash enough to think I was going to get the county, or somebody in the government, to fund this. 12, 19 At the time the only publicly funded program was in Connecticut, and it was supported primarily because it had a very complex research component that Yale was doing. 8, 13, 19 I think it was Yale.  It might have been Harvard.  Where they would actually barcode the needles. 7, 10 When they would come back into the exchange they could trace, ""Well this one was distributed at location twenty-two and it came back to location five."" 8, 10 And then they would analyze the residue blood in the needles to see whether there was mixed blood. 6, 10 To see whether or not the needle had been shared. 5, 6, 10 It was a very costly kind of research program.  I wasn't interested in doing something that complex because frankly Minneapolis/St. 13, 14 Paul did not have heavily concentrated injection areas as other communities did, and I felt we needed a mobile program. 8, 11, 16, 19, 20 So, I began working with the county and talking to them about needle exchange—with the Hennepin County Public Health Department, City of Minneapolis Public Health Department, State Health Department, and I talked to the governor, attorney general because I didn't want to have it be illegal, or that the workers would be arrested. 9, 10, 12, 19 Eventually we carved out kind of an interesting piece. 17 This was going on for a couple of years. 11, 14 It took about two years' planning. 14 The piece it carved out was that there was language prohibiting the distribution of syringes except for under certain circumstances, one of which was research. 17, 20 It was an archaic law, and I don't know why they put research in there, but thank goodness they did. 10, 11, 12, 13 At the time the mayor of Minneapolis and the city attorney carved this out and said it would be okay. 5 In the meantime behind the scenes we had Women With a Point going on kind of underground, and then there was this other guy who came to town. 12 I don't know if they talked about him, but some character names Mike Scavuza who was from out east, and he wanted to do needle exchange because we were a bunch of straight—not in sexuality, but straight in terms of drug use—and we didn't understand what it really meant. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 I just thought he was a punk, and he was going to disrupt this whole, very carefully constructed house of cards I was putting together to get funding for needle exchange. 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 The county commissioners at the time—one of whom is still on the board, Peter McLaughlin—were supportive. 8, 19 So, I had the support of them, and amazingly right when I needed it most into town arrived Dr. Alan Lifson. 9, 12 Alan is a physician, and a master's in public health, HIV specialist, came out of San Francisco, and knew all about injecting drug use. 5, 6, 13, 16, 19 I needed that person with the right alphabet of letters, and Alan quickly supported what we were doing. 12 He's at the U. He's continued to work a lot in HIV, particularly internationally. 9 He was very helpful in the beginning. 9, 11 Eventually the county gave us money. 8, 10, 19 I went over to Eden House, and talked to some of the clients I had known because some of these substance abuse programs kind of recycle in and out, in and out. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 So people 9 I knew as clients in the seventies came back in the eighties came back in the nineties, and their kids were there or they worked there. 10, 12, 16 I had them tell me—find out from them—where good places would be to have a mobile van. 10 We needed lots of stuff. 16 We had to get a van.  Someone from the health department helped us obtain a used ambulance, and we had it retrofitted to include space to bring people into the van, do some basic education, exchange needles, have a save sharps away. 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 Then there was a whole issue of insurance. 13 Nobody had ever insured a syringe exchange program. 5, 10 The insurance agent at MAP, Vicky Freyer, God bless her soul, managed to talk an insurance company into insuring us. 14 Because I'm thinking all the OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] issues, and you know liability issues of someone giving a needle to OD's, and whatever happens. 10, 12, 13, 15 So we talked through all of this.  My board at MAP was a challenge because there were many people that felt like there was, if you will, the innocent people that got HIV. 9, 11 In the mainstream the innocent people were, you know, the people that got it because they were dentists, the hemophiliacs, or whatever. 9, 12 But there also were a subset of gay men who felt that, well, back in the seventies and eighties we had no idea what this was. 9, 11, 12 But now, you know, we've got these junkies everybody knows. 12 So we don't care about them, you know. 12, 19 So there were people on the board and supporters of MAP that left over the issue of doing syringe exchange. 9, 10, 13, 14 There were some of the staff that were afraid that we were going to have dangerous people come around. 9, 11 There were other staff that were thrilled.  Very excited about this because up until then basically our outreach was setting up a card table on the corner of Franklin [Avenue] and Nicollet [Avenue], or going to one of the Catholic charity's branch programs. 12, 19 AS: The van gave you an opportunity beside needle exchange? 10, 19 It gave people condoms, or safe sex—was HIV testing ever anything you could do in the van? 9 LT: Yes, yes.  With rapid testing later it became part of the activity. 9 But in the early days, no, we would refer people to the red door. 5, 9, 16 But, yes, absolutely.  All of the syringe exchange packets that we would put together included alcohol wipes, a cotton, a cooker, a tie off, and condoms, and mint, or some kind of candy. 6, 8, 10, 14 Yes, safer sex was a really big part of it. 9, 12, 18 So everything seemed to be moving along quite well. 6, 11, 17 And then we hit the road block.  The road block was that a couple of the commissioners wanted to treat getting the support for needle exchange like running a political campaign. 8, 10, 11, 18 And that if we were going to go into a neighborhood with this mobile van we had to get the approval of the neighbors. 20 And we should do that by going on a door knocking campaign.  As in knock, knock, knock, ""Hi, I'm just here to tell you we want to park this out here.  There will be a lot of kind of nefarious looking characters, perhaps.  Don't worry.  It's fine. 11 We've got you covered."" 5 I thought, ""This is the stupidest thing."" 17, 18 So, finally the door knocking campaign morphed into, ""Well, you have to get the neighborhood association approval."" 20 At the time there was quite a concentration of IV use in the Whittier neighborhood. 6, 13, 20 The Whittier Business Association took off with a vengeance against me.  To this day my gas station guy calls me, ""Hey, it's the needle lady."" 10, 16 Talk radio just tore us apart. 9, 11 AS: What year is this? 14 LT: This was about '94 I want to say.  I had started taking the money from the county and had hired staff, bought needles, and all this kind of stuff. 5, 8, 10, 11, 19 And one of the Whittier guys took a van and painted all over it, ""This is your needle exchange van. 6, 10 Come in here.  We'll kill you.""  I mean stupid—it was quite ugly. 11 We had neighbors that were in Whittier that really didn't want anything to do with us. 18 I was fighting some of the folks up on the north side that didn't want anything up on the north side because just you white people coming up here to enable and prolong. 9, 12, 17, 19 You want us addicted to drugs. 5, 6, 12, 14 That whole line. 9 So, I really was getting it from all sides on needle exchange. 9, 10, 18 Finally, I just said, ""Fuck you.""  And gave the money back to the county. 8, 10, 19 I said, ""We'll do it on our own.""  I mean at the time there was a federal prohibition on using any federal money, but there was no prohibition on using local money. 6, 8, 10, 20 So this was county dollars. 19 And it was good money. 8, 10 It was one hundred thousand dollars a year, which even today it's good money. 8, 10, 14, 16 Back then it was a fortune.  I said, ""Okay, never mind."" 16 I gave it back, and said we'll do it on our own and fundraise. 5 I don't know if MAP now gets any money for needle exchange or not, I don't really know. 8, 10, 12, 18 But when I was there, and I was at MAP from June of '90 through April of 2010 or '11, I never remember which. 16 I always have to look at when I got my dog. 18 I think it was '10.  Twenty-one years almost. 14 Anyways, it was a long time I was there. 17, 18 It was a wonderful experience. 18 So we hired folks to come and be in the van and drive around. 5, 12 We had certain set spots that we would go to. 6, 17 They new the other people like Sue, and others that did syringe exchange. 9, 10, 16 And I think they got along pretty well. 10, 17 I think at that time Sue might have already started Access Works, I don't remember when that started, which was a storefront exchange program. 10 Our mobile van I think was really effective because we could move as the population moved. 7, 15, 18 For example, up on the north side for a while we were parked outside Lee's Liquor Bar up on Glenwood [Avenue], and then we moved over to Mervin's Drug Store up on Broadway [Street]. 7, 9, 15, 18 So we could move the van around. 15 We had a good relationship with the police because I was worried. 8, 10, 19 AS: How many hours a week was the van out? 15 Do you remember?  LT: It was out Monday through Friday. 16 I don't remember how many actual hours. 15 At night?  LT: It would usually not be late at night because of the safety concerns. 19 And obviously not too early in the daytime because nobody's up. 16 So I would say probably, gosh, I really don't remember so I don't want to make a mistake. 18 But I want to digress to one fascinating story was that in 1993, Dan Ford and I from MAP, Dan and I went to the International AIDS Conference in Berlin. 15 We stopped in Amsterdam because they had a very robust needle exchange program. 10 We met with the drug czar, or I don't know what his official title was, but a government person in Amsterdam. 5, 6, 12 And back in those days everybody and their mother was going to Amsterdam to find out how to do a needle exchange program. 10, 16 And he said something to me that stuck with me to this day. 16 That was, ""I can't believe how stupid you Americans are.""  He said, ""You are treating this problem of addiction like you're ordering off a Chinese menu. 12, 13, 14 I'll have one from column A, and nothing else.""  He said, ""You can't just have a needle exchange program absent a comprehensive approach to addiction. 5, 10, 12, 14 You can't just come here and copy this, and think it's going to make a difference because it won't.""  Of course we didn't really care. 18, 19 I mean in America everything is so siloed.  I mean addiction people hated needle exchange. 9, 10, 12, 14 Harm reduction. 5, 14 Because it was enabling, and it caused all kind of bad stuff. 6, 13, 16 So, I didn't know how we could integrate the two, even though I came out of substance abuse, and people knew what I was doing. 6, 9, 12, 13, 16 I mean I was getting a lot of calls from friends of mine in substance abuse that were chem dep back in those days like, ""What the hell are you doing?"" 6, 13, 16, 20 AS: What would you say to them?  LT: I would give them the shtick about, look, it's a journey.  Addiction is a journey. 14 People are going to stop at some point.  They are going to stop because they are in the joint, or they die, or they just suddenly wake up and say, ""I don't want to do it again,"" or, in very rare cases, treatment works. 9, 12, 13, 17 So in all those cases where people stop using I don't want them to be HIV positive. 6, 9, 17 I would say, ""It's that simple,"" you know. 12 I don't want them to end their addiction and then die because there were no long-term survivors from the HIV. 12, 14, 17 And that seemed to resonate with people, that there was a way out of addiction, and that maybe this would keep them from having that terrible plague. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18 And so that seemed to alleviate some of the concerns that people had. 6, 9 That was how we managed to kind of get it going.  It morphed a lot over the years. 14 We had a lot of different staff.  It's hard work. 9 It's really hard work in the needle exchange. 9, 10, 18 There's a lot of turnover because you tended to have either people who were in recovery themselves. 9 Because it's not good work for people not in recovery. 9, 10 And it takes a certain type of person in recovery to not all of a sudden to be running into all their old friends, or to suddenly want to go back to that life. 8, 10, 16, 17, 20 So it really was kind of dicey. 14, 18 We lost some people who did return to that life. 9, 10, 11 And then we had other people who were like do-gooders, you know. 9, 10, 12 We called them the 'cupcakes' who wanted to help other people, you know, and had no idea what they were getting into. 9, 12, 14, 18 I was always struck—there was a story, I think, I can't if it was New York, West Coast, East Coast—but there was some male researcher who was doing research on needle exchange, PhD, and he got hooked and died of an overdose. 10, 15, 18 I was always struck by ""I don't want that on my watch."" 17, 18 You know, somebody that I brought in that had never seen this life before suddenly became part of the hair club for men, you know, they're going to try it themselves. 6, 9, 10, 12, 16 It's such a good product. 10, 14 AS: So that started to weigh on you?  LT: Yeah, yes.  AS: How many years in? 14 LT: I would say pretty much from the beginning. 10, 11 I was always concerned about the staff. 18 Much more than the outreach staff that worked gay bars, you know. 9, 12 The issues I dealt with outreach staff—usually young, gay men—who went and did education at that bars, or a public sex spot. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 What's the worst thing that's going to happen? 15 They're going to engage in sex? 12 You know. 12 And whether they use a condom or not that's their choice, but they understand. 6, 13, 17, 18 But addiction was something that was much more seductive. 12, 14 But there was always a split I think in the local needle exchange world between MAP and the Access Works type programs that felt they were much closer to the street, if you will, than MAP was. 9, 10, 11, 18 I think at some point when Sue left Access Works, I don't remember what year that was, and a staff person from MAP went and was hired as the ED, and eventually the place was in turmoil. 5, 14 I don't know enough about what happened internally, but it was going to fold. 12, 15 So, there was the question of could it merge with MAP, and eventually we did take over. 5 We didn't change the name.  We didn't call it the Access Works MAP program.  The MAP program was called Mainline, and is still called Mainline, which is kind of a play on words because obviously people mainline the heroin, or opiates, or other drugs, but there was a local individual who I think died around '96 or so, a real advocate for needle exchange, named Bill Main. 5, 6, 9, 10, 16 Bill had contracted 19 HIV by getting a needle from a sharp supply container in a hospital or clinic or somewhere. 8, 10, 13 Even though he didn't like MAP, he didn't like me, he thought I was too distant from the real life, I wasn't a junkie like he was, I was just a straight woman, you know, I wanted to name the program—I'm very big on history. 10, 12, 15, 17, 18 It's my big—I'm a total history nut. 15 So, I wanted to call it Mainline, and it still is called Mainline. 9, 14, 18 Most people have no idea, unfortunately, that it's named after Bill Main. 9 So that was part of the story, but the other part of the story that I want to share with you was how we legalized needles in Minnesota because prior to 1998, I believe, possession of syringes was illegal in Minnesota, and purchasing syringes was illegal in Minnesota. 9, 10, 15 So you had all kinds of junkies who wanted to buy needles who had great stories they could tell. 9, 10, 18, 20 Go in the drug store, ""My aunt is here, she's diabetic, she just arrived in town."" 5, 6 My favorite was, ""I'm doing some repair on the coffee table and the veneer came off.  I want to shoot some glue under the veneer.""  The one I heard from my husband that nobody else has ever confirmed, but I love it so I always told it, was at—because he liked to fish—they could use the syringe to inject the worm, so it would get air so it would float off the bottom. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18 Right!  What a tip!  You heard it here first. 9, 14 People loved that kind of thing. 14 I thought, ""Let's find out how to make purchasing needles legal in Minnesota. 10, 17, 18 By that time Bob Tracy, who did all the policy work for MAP, was very well known at the Capitol. 11, 12 He more than most other people had a way of endearing himself to even his worst enemies. 9, 18 Very smart.  He works with Minnesota Council on Foundations now. 9, 12 Bob Tracy.  And Bob knew how to get an idea into a law, and that ain't easy because besides all the sponsors, and getting it through the whole eighty-five thousand committees, and doing the financial note on it, and all the mark-ups, et cetera, et cetera. 5, 9, 13, 16 Bob shepherded through this idea that we would get legal syringes, and it was quite an exciting time.  It had gone through a number of hearings. 9 We had one more committee that we had to get through.  There was just total opposition.  The committee was very divided; especially the rural DFLers were not in support.  We had created through MAP a very robust network of advocates throughout the states.  One of the advocates that we had was an individual living with HIV from northern Minnesota who had contracted HIV when he worked on an oil rig, and apparently injecting dope is kind of a past time on oil rigs, I didn't know this. 8, 12, 13, 19, 20 So you can't go to the drug store, so there's a lot of needles sharing, so that's how he had become HIV positive, come back. 5, 6, 10, 18 He's got a wife and kids, and you know, and the house with the picket fence. 6, 12, 13, 20 He met with his representative from northern Minnesota, and she changed her vote. 5, 8, 10, 13 And we won by one vote.  I always like to tell that story because it is the power of one. 15, 17, 18 It really was the power of this one guy. 17, 18 So following that, and to this day it is legal in Minnesota to purchase and possess up to ten sterile, clean syringes. 10, 16 And as I told people if they are dirty, I mean if you have used them and there's dope in them then it's paraphernalia. 6, 9, 13, 16 All bets are off and I'm not coming to your defense.  Then the world started to change a lot. 14 This legislation was in '98.  We ran into problems with the Health Department because I think the legislation had something about disposal of the syringes. 9, 12 Well then every diabetic in the state of Minnesota had up until then was having to pay, and now they're mad because if you're a dope fiend you get to throw away your needles for free and I've got to pay to have sterile sanitation. 10, 12, 18, 20 So we are just going to bring them to MAP.  And it was like, I'm not going to pay for every syringe.  So we got into big arguments with the Health Department. 9, 12 I don't remember how it got resolved, but basically it's resolved. 19 So, yeah, that was '98.  I think from that point forward, once it became where you could legally purchase syringes—I didn't change my opinion that needle exchange where you get free needles—I still think that's a good idea, but for god's sakes if you can walk into a drug store, Walgreens, and buy needles I don't need to have my van out there twenty-four hours a day. 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16 I mean come on now. 12 I know you want to save all your money for dope, but you could do like three bucks for a ten pack of syringes. 8, 10, 12 I had some strong judgments about that. 12 I mean every— AS: Is that kind of when you ended the needle exchange? 10 LT: Well, no, I never wanted to end it. 16, 18 And what happened with the van, I don't really know. 12, 15, 18 The van was still going when I left MAP. 14 It is not going now, and they're needle exchange now is out of a church. 10, 12 Yosemite church?  And it's, I think, open three days a week a couple hours a day. 11, 15, 16 So, that's one place people can go. 9 I think Pillsbury has some transgender clinic, shock clinic. 17 And I don't know, I think there are some free lancers here in town. 12 [unclear]  And, I think because they're legal there's less pressure to have eighty-five thousand needle exchanges. 6, 10 And Minneapolis never was, as I stated earlier, never had a huge concentration like New York, or New Haven, or Seattle, or San Francisco. 15, 16 We don't have the tenderloin district.  And it's a pretty mobile population. 10 In fact, we found that a lot of the exchangers we had were secondary exchangers that were coming in from Waseca, Waconia, Coloquet. 10 And one guy would get all the dirty needles and bring in liter bottles, or two liter bottles of Diet Coke, filled with needles because he collected them from the last month from wherever, whatever period of time. 5, 10, 16, 18 Not necessarily a month. 16 He'd pull up over at MAP.  And I had a corner office that had windows by the parking lot, which the smokers used to hate because I'd tap my watch while they were out there smoking. 6, 13, 16, 17 Anyways, I would see people pull up because one of the sites we used was the MAP parking lot. 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 I would see these pick up trucks pull up, quite rural looking, and some obviously non-metro looking kind of person (she said very judgmentally) [narrator says this about herself] would get out of the car, or the truck, and they would have bottles full of needles. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14 AS: And then you disposed of them?  LT: Yes, we would pay to dispose of them.  I know that one of the workers told me that when he was parked up by Louie's Liquor Bar it was very common to get businessmen from downtown that would come with a briefcase full of needles. 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 And many of them would, I mean the way I told the story which was I'm sure embellished—well I know it was embellished—was that these were businessmen and it was lunchtime and they told their secretary, ""I just have to go drop off some dry cleaning,"" and went over to Louie's Liquor Bar driving in their beamer and open their briefcase and they'd have a baggie full of needles. 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 And I know they are down there and going home at night and there's nobody in their family who has a clue what they're doing. 12 I think all of us that worked in HIV—if you had half a brain—and there were a lot of people who worked in HIV that did not have half a brain, but if you did have half a brain, I think you felt some compassion, some even guilt at times that you were enabling. 9, 11, 13 That here was this guy that was shooting up. 6 When you're not open is he risking sharing needles with others, and then sexually exposing his partner? 9, 10, 12, 18 So there was a lot of, at times, angst about the whole game of addiction. 12, 14 And then I think some of my hesitancy around the harm reduction piece because I get the 'meet people where you're at,' but I want to show people that there's also another way. 5, 9, 14, 18 And treatment by any shot is not a miracle. 11, 12, 13 And treatment doesn't work very often. 12, 13 I mean I'm the first person to acknowledge that, but it shows you that there is another way, and you never know when you're going to wake up. 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 I always remember there was a client in Eden House one time. 6, 10, 13, 18 It was when Eden House started. 6, 13 It was a really tough program along the Synanon model where you'd shave people's heads, and there were costumes, and you'd put people on so-called trips, and different things. 9, 14, 18 It was pretty harsh. 10 And we were getting guys out of the joint right and left. 12, 14 I mean very serious offenders. 11 I remember one guy came to Eden House, and he said in his intake group, ""I don't care what you do to me. 6, 13, 19 You can shave my head, make me wash dishes, make me peel potatoes, you can make me edge the lawn with a spoon, and I'll scrub the bathroom floor with my tongue if you want. 6, 13, 14 I'm never using drugs again."" 5, 6, 16 And he never did. 16 And he was really only sort of half-heartedly in groups, but he went out, he was done with Eden House, and he got a job with the City of Minneapolis. 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 Retired. 5 And to my knowledge, I mean I don't know if he drank, but he never became a junkie again. 5, 12, 16 But that's a very rare case. 17 Treatment is kind of like a wash, rinse, repeat sort of episode, but it does work. 12 Whether it's a hundred percent sobriety, or eighty-five percent sobriety, or if it's even, and I get that now we're going down the harm reduction road, but there's some point at which at least let people know there's an option. 5, 9, 12, 14 And hopefully the only option that they're option is not methadone or Suboxone. 6, 8, 9, 14 Those to me are temporary kinds of options.  I'm not a big proponent. 8 I mean I know I have some friends who have been on methadone for thirty years on a very low dose, but I wish they weren't. 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20 That's where I sort of parted ways with the whole—plus there was this whole attitude of the folks that worked street outreach that, ""We're so cool. 9, 12, 17, 18 We're the cool kids."" 17 After a while that just sort of wears on you.  You know? 12 Only because I've been around the block for so long, and I've seen this movie. 6, 17 I lived through the returning Vietnam vets, opiate addiction, the crack problem. 7, 12, 14, 16, 20 This sudden, ""Oh my God, people are using opiates. 6, 9 Wow.  How'd that happen?"" 15 AS: Then it goes mainstream.  LT: That's kind of my story with that. 15 When I left MAP, I mean honestly the reason that I left MAP was I had never taken a vacation at home. 8, 10, 14, 16 My husband and I always went somewhere on a cruise—a blue's music cruise. 9, 14, 18 Only blue's.  The whole ship!  It was fabulous.  We had a policy at MAP with vacation the use it or lose it. 6, 9, 13 It didn't roll over year to year. 14 So everybody in December was gone. 8, 11 And I was never gone in December because somebody had to hold the ship down. 16 And December—that's why I think I left in '11. 14 It doesn't matter.  One year I said, ""I'm taking the last two weeks of December off. 11, 14, 15 And there's no cruise so I'm staying home."" 7 I stayed home, and I was stunned by how disabled my husband was. 14 He had had a number of strokes, and in 2009 he had a major stroke in April.  I had stayed home for a couple of weeks. 11, 15 I had obviously seen these changes in him, but then I didn't really ever take the time to observe it. 6, 18 And during those two weeks that I was home it suddenly occurred to me that my tombstone was going to read, ""She cared more about MAP than she did her husband."" 5, 8, 14, 15, 19 And so I thought, ""This is not good. 10, 17, 18 This man really needs a lot of help."" 18 And to this day he does. 16 And so I left whenever it was that I left. 14, 16 But I was only home for a short time before I thought, ""This sucks."" 17, 18 And I had been a consultant, a 1099 person before, and so I talked to Dan over at Eden House, and I said, ""Let me do the AIDS education with the clients because you guys are doing needles. 6, 10, 13, 14, 15 They're bad stay away. 18, 20 Let me teach people, because you know they're going to fuck up when they leave here. 9, 12, 18 You don't want them to come back.""  So I started doing AIDS education with the clients. 10, 14, 15 I was referred to as the butt-fucking lady with the clients. 5, 10, 17 Yes.  Because most addicts that come in from the streets and you talk about anal intercourse they don't know what you're talking about. 5, 12, 14 So I started off doing AIDS education with the clients, and then slowly started doing some other grant writing for them, and now as I said, I work a set number of hours, usually fifteen, twenty hours a week. 10, 12, 14, 15 I get paid to do all their policies and stuff.  They have the stupidest AIDS policy ever, but their HR department developed it because they were in a lab there are a lot of OSHA issues. 9, 12, 13, 19 But there're eighty million needle sticks or paper cuts, and all kinds of crap. 10 I mean when I worked at MAP I referred to it as the ‘what if’ questions. 5, 17 ""How do you get HIV?""  You can talk all you want about sexual harassment and sharing needles, but inevitably people would always be like, ""What if? 9, 10, 12, 18 What if a guy with AIDS worked in my office?  What if he touched a piece of paper and got a paper cut?  What if I touched that piece of paper?""  My favorite was—this was true—was somebody asked the question, ""What if I was in a swimming pool? 5 What if there was a guy in the pool that had the AIDS?  And what if someone threw a cat in the pool, and cats hate water. 16 What if that cat scratched that guy?  And what if I tried to get the cat out of the water and the cat scratched me?"" 16 I said, ""Well, probably what if a truck right now driving down Park Avenue filled with cattle fell over and a cow fell through the roof and hit you in the head?"" 5, 12, 14 It would be the same level of risk!  You know. 12 AS: That was a crazy time. 20 LT: It still is a crazy time. 20 I think it really is. 18 I think people are a little bit better because I think where it got screwed up was with the Surgeon General's thing in '88 when Everett Koop sent out that thing about bodily fluids, and it was trying to get passed the 'bodily fluids.' 5, 9, 20 And here in Minnesota in the early nineties, and I don't know if you are aware, we had a couple of doctors who were HIV positive, and one of them, he's dead now, Dr. [unclear] 11, 12, 14, 16 Benson, he and his partner, business partner who also had HIV, but let's not draw any conclusions, had a small family practice clinic. 5, 9, 12 Dr. Benson delivered one of his patient's babies, and his dad used a brand new technique of video taping the birth of his child. 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 18 He and his wife had been quite concerned because he and his wife had noticed that Dr. Benson had been losing a lot of weight, but Dr. Benson had told them whatever he told them. 11, 16, 20 But when they took the videotape, Dr. Benson was not wearing gloves, and his arms and hands were covered with open sores. 5, 14, 17, 18 Yes.  That video tape blocking the child birth portion of these hands was shown endlessly, and it resulted in a tremendous move to test physicians, nurses, and it was like where are you going to stop? 6, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 Daycare workers? 12, 19 Teachers?  I was the only voice, honest to God, the only voice on this statewide committee that opposed it. 8, 17 I remember saying to them—one of the reasons you had to know if your doctor had HIV even if they were using universal precautions that was offered was, well you know one of the ways HIV manifests itself is dementia. 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20 AIDS related dementia. 12 So you could have a doctor with HIV; you could have AIDS related dementia. 12, 14 You can have any freaking doctor with dementia. 12, 14 Are you going to start testing every doctor over the age of fifty for early onset? 12, 14 To which there was no answer.  We still have now pretty strict laws in Minnesota about physicians and nurses in particular. 9, 10, 12, 13 If you are HIV positive you have to self-report to the licensing board. 13 There has to be someone in your practice that monitors you.  There are certain—I don't know if there are certain things anymore, again I'm not current with it, but there were certain procedures that you could not be involved in. 12, 17 Now when Dr. Benson did that universal precautions were not universal. 10 They were voluntary.  But between his case, which went national, and the case of the dentist in Florida, who infected Kimberly Bergalis, and a bunch of other people—because of those high profile cases universal precautions became universal. 7, 9, 10, 17 I remember even back in those days when I went to the dentist and they said, ""Where do you work?"" 16 And I told them, ""Oh my God."" 16 Out came the masks, the gloves with the assumption being that if you work with them you've got to have it. 14 I mean we couldn't even get pizzas delivered. 5 I'll never forget that. 16 The pizza guy would leave pizzas—the UPS man wouldn't come in. 18 So, it really was quite stunning the early days of HIV. 11, 16, 18 I don't think people really realize. 9, 18 AS: It's easy for people to forget, especially people who didn't live during it. 9 Like people twenty years younger. 9, 14, 20 LT: But for me it was nothing different than the early days of trying to work with junkies because like why would you want to do that? 16 Who cares about them? 19 Let them die.  And to some extent I think that still is true. 5 I think there is more support and empathy now for people living with HIV than there is even for people who have addiction problems. 9, 12, 14 Although people in recovery have been lionized. 9 That's the other part I hate about addiction is you get all of these clowns that get out of treatment and they're out of treatment like one second and they're an expert. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 And that irritates me more than almost anything else.  I've spent my lifetime understanding the dynamics of addiction. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 I personally don't buy into the disease model of addiction. 12, 14 I think it's a learned behavior. 10 There may be a genetic component. 8 I certainly believe that. 8, 17 But, I think it's a learned behavior to cope with mental health challenges, or environmental challenges you have be they abuse, neglect, violence, trauma of growing up in a dangerous environment. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 But people use as a means of escape. 6, 9, 13 And they start using as young people, and when they suddenly get to be twenty, twenty-one they are like a ten-year-old. 6, 9, 14 And now they're forty and they are still like a ten-year-old. 12, 14 And I think they need to learn how to grow up. 10 I think within treatment these days the approach is that we've got to change your feelings, make you more empathetic. 12, 13, 15, 16 I think that's bullshit. 18 Most of these addicts are pretty hardcore, and the best way to change is you change your behavior. 9, 10, 14, 18 Act as if you care about somebody. 19 We know you really don't care about your roommate, and you think he's a loser. 9, 12, 14, 18, 19 Just pretend like you do. 10 And if you practice long enough it will become internalized, and you will slowly notice your attitude's changing. 10, 17 So, first your behavior, and then you attitudes, and eventually you really get emotional feelings out of that. 5, 14, 15, 18 That was the essence of Eden House. 6, 13 It no longer is, which is sad. 17 I feel— AS: What is the essence of it now? 12 LT: It's much more of an AA model, and they have to abide by all the ASAM standards.  American Society of Addiction Medicine. 14 It has to be in effective behavioral intervention as approved by ASAM. 15 It has to be trauma informed.  I mean it's all these buzz words, and it's like, ""Jeez Louise.  You've got a bunch of emotional babies here that they don't know how to be an adult. 12 They've never been an adult. 16 They've never been raised responsible. 14, 16 Let's just start getting them—""  We had an early client at Eden House and he was a Hispanic guy. 6, 10, 13 He always used to say—the saying in Eden House was, ""It's not you man, it's your behavior."" 6, 13, 16, 18 And used to say, ""It's not Jew, man. 6, 13, 16 It's your behavior.""  And I always loved that being Jewish. 14, 18 That really is a [unclear] behavior. 18 I'm not attacking you, I care about you. 19 But the behavior that you're exhibiting of stealing money, of hurting other people, whatever it is to keep your addiction alive. 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20 I don't like that, and I think that sucks.  And I want you to change that.  And I want you to do it because I care about you. 19 And, you know, ""Well, nobody's ever cared about me."" 5, 12, 19 So, I think there's a different approach, and they try to blend it still somewhat at Eden, but it's very hard. 9 AS: To keep the older model you mean? 20 LT: Right, well everybody who works there has to be an LADC, a licensed alcohol and drug abuse counselor. 5, 6, 9, 13 And most people in recovery don't have the ability or the background to go to school and become an LADC. 7, 9 So, you have a lot of particularly young women, young men, who want to be a social worker, and then become an LADC. 9, 12, 19 I actually feel a little bit bad that during my brief stint between the Eden House and MAP when I was a consultant that I was the one who drew up the guidelines that became the licensing of alcohol and drug abuse counselors. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 20 At the time it was credential through the Health Department and I created that. 5, 9, 12 I created it for the state.  I brought together— AS: Why do you feel bad about that? 8 LT: Because I think this whole ""you need an education"" is not the only way. 14, 15, 18 I mean there are lots of people who come out of Eden House who would be wonderful counselors, but they can't go to school and get a bachelor's degree. 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 18 I mean there was a time at Eden House where the only people we hired were graduates. 5, 6, 9, 13 And there were a lot of problems with that, but now they rarely if ever can hire a graduate of the program—they have one guy right now. 12 Out of like twenty staff.  Well, there's more with the CD tax, but in terms of being a counselor, I think there are like twenty counselors, and only one of them is a graduate of Eden House. 6, 13, 17 I look at someone like Dan Cain who pulled himself out of this addiction. 11, 12, 14 I mean he was a hardcore heroin addict, and he had been in Lexington [Kentucky, Narcotics Farm] through their program. 9, 14 He's done wonderful. 18 Well, that's my story. 15 Is there anything I missed?  AS: I don't think so.  LT: I appreciate the opportunity. 10, 19"
"24","Kazel_Jeff","Andrew Tuttle Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer February 16, 2017 Wettingen, Switzerland Andrew Tuttle -AT Amy Sullivan -AS AS: We are in Baden? 5 AT: We’re in Wettingen.  AS: Wettingen.  AT: Next to Baden.  AS: Today is February 16, 2017. 16 This is Amy Sullivan.  I’m with Dr. Andrew Tuttle. 5 Would you just say your name?  AT: My name is Andrew Tuttle. 5 I explicitly give Ms. Amy Sullivan permission to record what I’m saying.  AS: Thank you.  I wonder if this is picking you up.  I might put it on top of this, is that okay?  AT: Sure.  AS: What I was telling you earlier is I like to start with your childhood, where you grew up, your family, some of your childhood experiences. 12, 14, 15, 18, 20 How you ended up here, where you were born, stuff like that. 14 AT: Do you want me to just go?  Okay.  I was born in Minneapolis in 1952. 14 I was the only child of my parents then. 14, 20 We lived on Oliver Avenue in Kenwood in Minneapolis. 7 It was a nice, modest house there. 6, 13, 18 My father worked in the M.A. 16 Gedney pickle packaging company. 14 He later becomes the CEO.  My mother then was not employed.  She was a mother and a housewife as much as I remember. 6, 13, 20 She had been to college and was a very well educated person. 7, 14 She’d gone to college. 7 She majored in English literature. 5 She was very well read and well spoken.  AS: Where did your folks meet? 12, 18 AT: I don’t know. 12 I think it was a family thing. 12 The parents on my mother side belonged to a certain social circle that knew each other. 9, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20 As well as my grandparents went to places like Minikahda Club. 20 Somehow a connection occurred there. 5 My knowledge of exactly how that occurred is kind of sketchy. 5, 12 Now my father has died. 16 Anyways, the way I remember those first years is rather difficult. 10, 14, 18 I have nice memories. 18 My father and my mother and being tickled and stuff like that. 16 But I also remember them fighting viciously, verbally.  AS: Even as a young kid?  AT: As a very young kid.  I think this was at a stage where I hadn’t completely stopped wearing diapers, two or three or something like that.  Definitely before kindergarten.  I have scenes in my head of standing at the top of the stairs just watching my parents just rip each other’s throat out. 8, 14, 17, 20 AS: Were they physically abusive? 6 It was verbally.  I was a difficult child. 10, 14 Retrospectively  I most certainly had ADHD. 8, 17 I was unmanageable.  My parents constantly got calls from kindergarten. 16, 20 Later on I spent most of the time in the principal’s office in grade school. 5, 7 I was disruptive.  Give me a hammer  I’ll attack the front walkway of our house and see how easy it is to break concrete apart. 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 Bicycles, or a car I can let the air out of the tires.  I was a troublemaker.  I got into fights and was just hyperactive.  I was all over the place.  AS: Were you still watching your parents fight at this point? 8, 17, 20 AT: That’s not that central.  More central is the way that I met disapproval with adults. 18 Actually kids of my own age who knew that they could get me to do stuff. 16 Then they’d go tell on me.  AS: You were that kid.  AT: It was kind of a formative experience because I felt myself being that troublemaker and that guy who could never do something right. 11, 12, 16, 18 I think fortunately I was intelligent and could pick things up quickly.  I remember my dad once, this must have been before I was six and half or seven years old because that’s when we moved to California, he was just absolutely beside himself because I’d taken some tools and taken his bicycle apart. 7, 9, 11, 14, 15 That’s kind of a memory I can chuckle about now but at the time it was, “I’m just trying out these tools. 12 Why are you mad at me?”  We moved to California before I was seven or after seven. 7, 15 I had just started first grade in Minneapolis and we moved to California and I continued first grade there. 5, 7, 14, 15 We lived in Berkeley where my mother worked. 7 This was after my parents got divorced. 7, 20 AS: When did they get divorced? 7 AT: They got divorced in Minneapolis. 7 Just after they got divorced my mother moved with me to California where her parents had moved to previously. 7, 10, 15, 20 AS: Your father didn’t move to California? 15, 16 AT: No, this was just my mother.  I moved with her to California. 7, 15 First we stayed with my grandparents there, my aunt and uncle who were still adolescents at that time. 20 A very big age difference between my mother and her sister and her much, much younger brother who was four years older than me. 14, 20 He wasn’t even in his teens when we moved there. 7, 15 He was still a kid.  We quickly moved to Berkeley where we had an apartment. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15 My mother worked in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory up on the hills of Berkeley as a librarian.  That’s where she met my later step-father who was working there as a nuclear physicist. 16 They had a relationship, got married, and in 1962 we moved to Switzerland which was an adventure in itself. 7, 15, 19 We came by boat from San Francisco.  A steamer that went through the Panama Canal and across the Atlantic Ocean and across France with a steam engine.  AS: Was he Swiss?  AT: No he was German, from Munich.  AS: Is your mom American? 14 AT: Yes.  So is my dad. 14 My mom had her roots in Ireland and Scotland. 14 My dad’s ancestors come from Southern England. 14 Anyway, we got to Switzerland and I was nine years old. 14, 18 I have a late birthday in December. 16 I’m actually a year younger than the year I’m living in. 7, 14, 20 I became ten in that year but we moved here in Spring. 7, 14, 15 We very quickly moved to a very small farm village in Switzerland where I was in school with the only Swiss students, pupils. 7, 8, 15 It was still an adventure because here I’d come from urban Berkeley to this tiny Swiss village where most of the kids who came to school were farm kids. 7, 8 After school we could wander over to the farm. 7, 8 We could watch their parents milking the cows and help them gather cut grass from the fields to feed the cows with. 14, 17, 20 I just thought it was really cool. 17, 18 Within a three minute walk you could be in the woods and the forest. 15, 16 If you walked you would come to a little lake and you could go swimming there and jump off the limbs of trees into the water. 5, 14, 16, 20 It was cool. 17 My stepfather was a passionate mountaineer. 7, 16 I have to credit him with introducing me to the Alps. 5, 14 We did a lot of Alpine tours and not actual climbing but long, long several day tours up high over glaciers and staying in Alpine cabins. 7, 16, 17 That’s where I gained my own passion.  Later on I became a rock climber and did a lot of rock climbing and mountain climbing and stuff like that. 14 I still love going up in the mountains and taking long hikes. 11, 14, 17 He was also a difficult guy and my mother was a difficult person. 10 She was the central person for me throughout my childhood, right up to my early twenties, I was very focused on her and very emotionally. 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20 She was the person I’d lived with all my life. 7, 10 Only now with a certain temporal distance and knowing what I know about psychology and dealing with life myself, I know that she was a very, very emotionally difficult person. 10, 12, 17 One that could get somebody to fight with her.  With my stepfather it became physically violent. 6, 7, 16 I witnessed her being beat up a lot.  He was a brilliant scientist, well liked.  AS: Did he work at the technical place?  AT: He worked in conjunction with the Swiss Institute of Technology. 14 He was building what today is known as the Pau Scherrer Institute. 11, 12, 16, 19 Then it was the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research.  A short way from here they constructed a cyclotron and now they have a bevatron and a synchrotron. 12, 14, 18 It’s a big nuclear research facility that he oversaw the development and construction of. 12 He was a prominent physicist in his field then.  He also drank pretty heavily. 5, 10, 16 They fought viciously almost every night.  Occasionally it would escalate to physical. 6 AS: By this time, you’re ten?  Eleven?  Was this happening when you had moved here or was it before? 7, 15 AT: They were verbally fighting before.  Right from the outset they were verbally fighting.  I did not enjoy all of the stress. 7 In my mid-teens I started detaching myself from them.  AS: They stayed together? 8 AT: Yes, she had three more children by him. 5, 14, 20 Three half-sisters of mine. 14, 20 The middle one, the second one suffers from Downs Syndrome. 5, 7, 8 She lives in a supervised living situation here in Wettingen. 16 My oldest sister, Christa, she lives not far from here. 20 She’s very much like my mother.  She’s a difficult person. 10 She’s one who’s kind of emotionally unstable and will very quickly take offense at something you say that she interprets in a certain way. 10, 12, 17, 18 She’ll start attacking you back.  Most of her boyfriend relationships have been characterized by a lot of fighting. 7, 19, 20 That’s kind of how I see my mother now from this point in life. 6, 10, 12 She was a difficult person. 10 If my stepfather beat her she sure knew how to get him to beat her. 7, 16 Nothing justifies each other but it’s kind of something that you can’t just see unidirectionally. 6, 18 I don’t think he really was that kind of person. 18 He never touched me. 16 He was always very correct, very fair. 9, 18 That made it difficult for me to relate with him. 10 I saw him beating up my mother but my relationship was sort of okay. 19 What am I supposed to feel or think?  It was very confusing. 6 He was actually a good guy but he really destroyed a lot of stuff. 7, 10, 18 My attention deficit disorder sort of abated. 13 I was able to adapt to the Swiss school system. 7 My antics were a bit, for a while, kind of legitimized because I was a foreigner who didn’t know how to behave. 12, 20 I very quickly learned the language and thought living here was just so much great fun. 10, 17, 18, 20 School was kind of cool too. 14, 17 It was this Little House on the Prairie type school with three grades in one room. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 The teacher was really good. 10, 18 He was the kind of person who had a very firm authority but in a way that was gentle. 18 Everybody just sort of naturally did what he wanted. 18 AS: Even you?  AT: Yes.  AS: Interesting.  AT: In those times corporal punishment by teachers was not forbidden here. 12 I got him once to the point where he took me out of the classroom, not in front of the other pupils, and slapped me. 7, 14 That’s really not the kind of teacher that he was. 18 The teacher upstairs, it was known that he kept a hazel switch in the corner which he liberally used on students. 6, 11, 12, 13, 16 That was the 60s.  That was when we lived in the Zurich region. 7 A few years after I had completed grade school we moved into Wettingen, here, which is a different canton and has a different school system. 5, 7, 14, 15 I was able to from the so-called second fahrschule, the sort of midlevel middle school in Zurich which actually is a little bit higher than the secondary school here, at that time was at least, and moved into the mittelschule which was the upper tier. 7, 15, 17, 20 AS: When you were talking about how kids could move up earlier that’s what you meant. 15 AT: I was a whiz in things like, I picked up things easily.  I never had an easy time doing homework. 16 I was horrible. 10 I would always find excuses not to have done my homework. 6, 13, 18 In classroom I could pick up things really easy. 7, 14, 18 Languages and math.  I was really good at math. 10, 18 The teacher was impressed. 10 I was able to move along without much effort which isn’t the best attitude academically because even if you can learn things easily you should do some work and apply yourself and study stuff. 10, 15, 17, 20 I was able to weasel my way through. 18 I made it into the canton schule, the one that ends with an equivalent of a baccalaureate. 8 They have three divisions, a natural science division, and a modern language division and one of the classic languages. 6, 7 We had to do Latin or Greek or stuff like that.  I did the natural sciences division because that’s something that I found easy. 6 I was able to complete that school. 7 During the first year of that school I actually went to America and visited my biological father there. 7, 14, 16 I complained, “Oh God it’s so awful.” 11 I hated living with my parents here. 20 He offered that I could stay with him. 5, 20 I did, which backfired completely because from the Swiss school that I had been in, which was kind of easy going, students were allowed to smoke in recesses and stuff like that. 5, 7, 10, 14 He put me into this college preparatory school, Blake. 5, 7, 10 I was supposed to wear a tie in the morning.  I was just so alienated by that.  I just sort of mentally left the whole scene. 12, 14 I went to school every day but I was just sort of sitting there. 7, 16 After eight months… 11, 16 AS: You didn’t fit in socially? 15, 19 AT: I didn’t fit in socially. 15, 19 None of the students lived nearby where I was living anyways. 7, 8, 17, 18 Everyone was driven there or drove there themselves from various parts. 5, 9 Most of them were from Edina or something like that.  We were living in Kenwood.  I barely had any social contacts. 19 AS: And you got plopped down when those kids had been together for years. 8, 14 AT: Yes.  I was able to speak English as a local.  Nobody realized that I had a reason to have a hard time adjusting or anything like that. 9 It was expected that I was able to do all this stuff which I was confused by and alienated by. 6, 13, 16 After eight months I should have talked with my father about it but was somehow unable to at that age and stage. 8, 11, 16 I ran away. 18, 20 I was able to scrounge up the money to get a Greyhound bus to Chicago. 8, 10, 13 In Chicago I hitchhiked out to Deerport and presented a sob story to the Swiss people there. 5, 9, 10, 13, 15 That I’d been stranded in America.  They put me on a plane.  They could confirm that I actually had parents there. 7, 20 They put me on a plane back to Switzerland.  AS: Who paid for the ticket?  AT: My mother and stepfather eventually. 5, 7, 16 AS: You didn’t even say goodbye to your father? 16 AT: I did later.  AS: Were you getting along with him? 17 AT: Yes, I was but I just felt so lost and misunderstood. 11 AS: He had other children? 5, 14, 20 AT: I actually felt that this was my personal failure. 7, 11, 14 I had asked to stay with him and now I was failing him and not fulfilling his expectations or anything like that. 5, 12 It felt awful. 11 AS: Had he remarried? 7 AT: Yes, and already had Karl, my brother, and Jeff. 20 John  I’m not sure.  No I don’t think he was born yet. 14 Back in Switzerland I dived into the 1970s psychedelic hippie stuff.  I dove.  I consumed a lot of cannabis and LSD and stuff like that.  The whole psychedelic thing.  I don’t think I ever overdid it.  Were you living at home then?  AT: I was living at home which I did for another year and a half. 14 When I was nineteen a buddy and I were able to rent an old dilapidated farm house a short way from here that had cold water and an outhouse out back for like a hundred buck a month. 6, 8, 13, 16, 18 That was affordable.  I said, “Bye Mom” and just moved out. 7, 15 I moved together with him and completed my school from there. 7, 8, 15 I took a year off and worked on construction. 14 I travelled some, rode my motorcycle a lot.  I had a big old beautiful 1951 BMW.  I rode all over Europe.  Around Italy and Sardinia and places like that.  I always have had kind of a tendency to travel on my own. 18 I grew up as a single kid essentially even though I have a lot of half-brothers and half-sisters. 5, 14, 20 I never felt like I was really brothers and sisters with them. 11, 16, 18, 20 They were age wise so far apart. 9, 11 I was the only link between my biological father and my biological mother. 16 I almost kind of saw myself as a single kid.  I knew how to be alone. 8, 16 Travelling alone, I have travelled with other people before. 8, 9 If nobody is available wanting to do the same thing I just go by myself.  You always meet people along the way. 9, 18 AS: Is that when you went to Bangkok?  AT: When did I go to Bangkok?  No, I’d already started medical school. 7, 14 I did a lot of travelling.  A year after I completed the local high school, the gymnasium, I went to medical school together with the guy I was living with, Chris. 7, 8, 14 He later became an anesthesiologist.  It was a great time. 20 Medical school was fun. 7, 14 I extended it by a year because I didn’t want to get stressed out in having to complete it in just six years. 7, 14 I took a lot of time off in between to travel.  That is the time I went to Southeast Asia.  Once I spent three months hitchhiking through the United States. 11, 16 I did that twice and then went down to Central America and to Mexico and stuff like that.  I really enjoyed travelling. 18 It was so cool to meet all these different people along the way. 9, 17, 18 People would be interested in where you’re from and I’d get invited to stuff.  It was really, really cool. 17, 18 In a nutshell that’s kind of how things went.  I graduated from medical school in 1980. 7, 14 The year that I became twenty-eight. 14 My mother died when I was twenty-three.  She had breast cancer. 10 Just after I graduated from medical school my stepfather died from lung cancer. 7, 10, 14, 16 He was a heavy smoker. 6 AS: You had younger sisters. 20 Were they on their own already?  AT: No. After the death of my mother my stepfather remarried with the nanny that had looked after my half-sister while my mother was still in the hospital before she died. 7, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20 A weird thing.  She had two further children by him, a boy and a girl. 5, 7, 14, 20 She was stuck with five children after he died. 5, 14, 20 I wasn’t part of that though. 9 AS: That was not your circus.  Can you talk about how you got into addiction medicine? 12, 14 Not addiction medicine, psychiatry. 12, 14 AT: I stumbled into it.  I’ve always been interested, even in medical school I’d pick up some kind of weird book on psychology or some kind of life view approach thing or something. 7, 10, 14, 18 Primal scream therapy or whatever. 12 I didn’t really get in touch with psychiatry. 18 I never saw myself as a psychiatrist. 16 I thought it was interesting but I never saw myself as such because I thought I was too deranged and disturbed myself. 7, 16, 17, 18 These guys who were into psychiatry, we had all of these fantastic ways of speaking and explaining stuff. 18 I’d never be able to do that. 16 AS: Your classmates? 7 AT: Classmates or older people. 9, 20 People would say something analytical and I’d be like, “Wow, I never would have thought of that. 16, 17, 18 How do they know that?” 12 After graduating from medical school I was kind of disenchanted with medicine all together. 7, 8, 12, 14 It’d been seven years. 14 The final exams were a very lengthy thing.  These were eighteen or twenty individual exams drawn out over a half a year. 5, 14 Specialty, oral, written, stuff like that.  I was kind of fed up with it.  After graduating I decided I’d do something else for a while. 14 I worked at the post office.  I worked at a refrigerator repair place, which was fun.  I had my own little van with refrigerator repair parts. 9, 20 I’d go to people’s house. 6, 9, 13 AS: Someone trained you to do that?  AT: They did at the factory.  They showed me how all the refrigerators worked and how to diagnose what’s wrong with them. 11 AS: You do pick things up quickly.  AT: For a couple months I also worked at a truck mechanics place. 11, 16 It was a way to earn money. 8, 10, 18 That was the year I got enough money together not only to pay for my motorcycle but I wanted to do an extensive backpacking trip to the Caribbean. 8, 10, 14, 18 I was kind of looking for somebody to take of my apartment and my cats while I was gone. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 That was when I met Susan.  AS: Did she take care of the cats or did she go on the trip? 19 We very quickly became enamored. 5 She has just come over here and was glad to have a place to stay.  I was going to be gone for a couple months. 11, 16 She took care of my apartment and fed my cats. 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19 I went to the Caribbean where I started missing her a lot.  Two and a half weeks into the trip in Antigua I met a veterinarian from the United States who was there for some government project to look at the cows or something. 5, 12, 14, 15 We got drunk together and he had a motorcycle and wasn’t able to start it. 5, 8, 14 I could see that it was flooded. 6 I kicked the carburetor and adjusted it and started it for him. 14 “Okay.  I’m going over to the other bar there.  You want to come along?” 17 Along the way we wiped out and spilled. 18 He had some lacerations, I just had some contusions.  Nothing serious happened. 11, 15 It kind of was a jolt.  Here I was in what they call the hospital in Antigua and he was getting sewed up and I was kind of sitting there really drunk. 5, 8, 14, 18 Shortly thereafter  I decided this is not the way I envisioned this trip. 8, 14, 18 So I booked a flight to Minneapolis, spent a week with my parents and almost every day on the phone with Susan. 8, 15, 16, 20 Then a flight back to Switzerland.  Six months later we got married. 7, 11, 16 After I returned to Switzerland, that was 1981, I was able to secure a job at the medical examiner’s in Zurich where I had worked as a student previously for a couple of months and where I first got into contact with death by intravenous drug abuse. 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 I started writing my doctoral dissertation on that which I completed after I started working there in 1982. 7, 12, 14 In 1980, 1981 was the year I took off and 1982 we got married. 7, 14 That’s where I got really involved in addiction. 12, 14, 18 I started getting really interested especially in opiate dependency. 13, 18 After a year and a half of that I went and I was kind of looking for jobs that had a manageable workload where I didn’t have to stay up a lot at night. 11, 14 I just couldn’t handle that very well.  I went to work for about a year and a half at an orthopedic rehabilitation clinic. 9, 14 I had people who came there sort of electively. 9 You had to manage their rehabilitation and stuff.  You’d go home at night even if you had on-call duty you could just sleep there. 16 It was kind of a cushy job, well paid. 11, 14 Residents generally got well paid here in Switzerland. 9 A common starting salary after graduating as a resident would be sixty or seventy thousand dollars a year. 9, 14 My original wish was I wanted to be a general practitioner. 8, 18 I applied for a residency and got one in Hennepin County Medical Center. 7, 9, 14 We moved over there thinking I was going to do a complete residency in family medicine, family practice. 7, 9, 12, 14, 15 That first year I was there was just horrible. 10, 14 I had to work one hundred and ten, one hundred and twenty hours a week, seven days a week. 15, 16 Every third or fourth night was just working through and continue working the next day. 5, 16 I got really depressed. 10, 18 It was almost a reenactment of when I was sixteen and had gone to visit my father. 12, 16 It was like after about eight or nine months I just threw in the towel and said, “Screw it.” 11, 16 We packed up our stuff and moved back to Switzerland. 7, 15 I felt horrible again because I felt like I’d disappointed my father. 10, 11, 16 He was so glad that I’d come there. 14 It was kind of hard to overcome. 9 I immediately got a position back at the rehab clinic where I had worked.  I just was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. 18 I decided to get into psychiatry. 14 I got a residency job at the state mental institution. 7, 9, 11, 12 I immediately liked it.  I was immediately liked by patients and personnel alike.  I remember that I always wondering, “Why don’t the other doctors get involved more with the patients?” 12, 14, 15, 18 I was spending time in the wards, talking with people. 9, 10 AT: Yes, and the other doctors would come by once or twice a week and make their rounds and otherwise just ask the nurses what was going on. 12, 14, 15 I kind of got stuck there.  I thrived and was doing well, was being paid well.  I had manageable hours. 15 Sometimes I’d have to be on call but it was exceptional.  That was actually at a time when a law was passed in Switzerland that even medical residents were not allowed to work more than sixty-five hours a week. 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 AS: That was in the 80s.  AT: After America a sixty-hour week seemed like nothing. 6, 15 I did that and I worked in various university clinics. 5 I spent a year in Basel and a couple years in the outpatient services here nearby. 11, 14, 19 Then I opened my own practice in 1993.  That’s how I got into psychiatry.  AS: What happened with the addiction medicine interest? 12, 14, 15 AT: It was always kind of a special interest area of mine. 8, 18 I had lots of methadone patients when I opened my practice. 16 AT: Yes.  That was when methadone was still the substitution medicine. 12, 14 AS: When was the Needle Park?  AT: That started at the very end of the 80s and blossomed in the beginning of the 90s and was there for a few years. 11, 14 After I opened my practice it was still a thing.  I think in ‘94 or ‘95 it had already been cleaned.  It moved first from one place to the other. 7, 14, 15 AS: From the park to the station.  AT: It moved from Platzspitz to the Letten which was even more horrific than at the first place. 7, 14, 15 Then they clamped down on it and wiped it out.  Police all over the place in areas where it could reoccur, preventing scenes like that from re-sprouting. 8, 10, 20 AS: Were they arresting people at that point? 9 What they doing with people? 9 How can you arrest a thousand people in one day because they’re using heroin? 6, 9, 16 AS: There was never the criminal, the immediate… 8, 16 AT: Of course there was a criminal element. 8, 12 AS: To arrest people, was that mostly for dealers? 9, 12 AT: Of course, but how do you make the distinction?  Everybody who gets involved in heroin at some point becomes a dealer because they have to deal their own stuff. 16 Of course there are people who are more focused on distributing. 6, 9, 13, 15, 16 The Albanians had a reputation for doing that.  It was often somebody connected with some group or criminal organization. 8 Somebody would buy it in a great quantity from somebody and then they’d distribute it in smaller quantities to somebody else and they’d distribute it to the individual people on the scene. 9, 20 Then they would redistribute it and so on. 5 Where do you make the line? 9 AS: Who to arrest?  AT: Where is the victim and where is the perpetrator?  Where’s the difference?  It’s almost a continuum.  Some people were arrested just because they were carrying something with them. 9 They were seldom persecuted.  Some people were persecuted. 9 Some people 9 I’m not sure whether it was sensible to be persecuted.  A friend of mine who was a dentist, he spent two years in a regional penitentiary because he was caught with cocaine and he was selling it. 14, 20 He was a dentist.  He was making good money off of his profession. 8, 10 It’s not like he needed to become rich by selling cocaine. 16 It was more something he was just involved in because he was consuming heavily himself. 14, 16 They put him away. 18, 20 Other people I know died. 9, 12 AS: During that time?  AT: Yes.  AS: Friends?  AT: People I knew. 16 Fortunately, none of my closer friends. 8, 9, 10, 16, 20 Maybe the dentist has died since. 10 I don’t think it’s drug related. 5, 6 As Thilo Beck says, his lifestyle. 10, 15 Last time I saw him he was obese and looked pasty and unhealthy. 19 AS: Do you remember what your dissertation was about?  What made it unique in the time that you wrote it?  AT: The time that I started writing it heroin addiction was just starting to bloom. 12, 14 The title of the dissertation was, “The Exceptional Deaths.”  A term for a medical examiner, somebody who doesn’t die of natural causes. 6, 7, 13, 14, 17 A death that is unexplainable, unnatural, or extraordinary death. 18 Literal translation is extraordinary death. 17, 18 Of intravenous drug abusers, a canonistic study of one hundred cases. 5, 6, 13, 17 Most of those hundred cases occurred in 1979 and 1980. 5, 14, 17 It was like a flat curve and then it went up like that.  AS: Just like we’re starting to see. 6 During the 80s the heroin abuse climbed and climbed and climbed. 6, 13, 14, 16 Where previously a couple of people had died per year from it, it was dozens in small Switzerland. 9, 10, 11, 14 Or over one hundred per year. 14 Then at the end of the 80s like Beck said, the most intense drug scenes in the world happened in the middle of Zurich. 5, 6, 7, 15 People pouring in from Germany, from France just to come there to get drugs. 5, 6 AS: Do you know where the heroin was coming from? 12, 16 AT: Mostly from Afghanistan I believe.  AS: Were they able to curb the…  AT: Some from Morocco probably also.  AS: When the introduction of the methadone therapy happened, was there also a simultaneous bust of the heroin market? 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16 Do you know how that kind of worked out? 12 Was there a police effort towards getting rid of it? 8 AT: Yes, there was.  AS: Did those things happen simultaneously? 15 AT: Yes.  It very quickly became evident that it’s useless to pursue the users. 6, 13 You have to find out who the distributors are, the dealers.  The police efforts were concentrated on that. 8 A lot of people got caught up in the net but the focus was where is it coming from and how do we cut this off? 9 AS: Were they or weren’t they working in conjunction with each other?  Was the impulse towards the care for the addicts, getting people off the street, did that happen separately or were they cooperating at all? 9, 14, 15, 19 AT: As I remember it, it was separately but there were attempts with communication and cooperation.  Politically at that time, it was so open and so visible and so in everybody’s faces.  It could not be ignored. 5 It could not be denied.  It was part of our society. 9, 12 Almost everybody knew a family whose kid had got caught up in that. 12, 16 It was just devastating.  Society had to deal with it.  They came to this understanding; we can’t just deal with it by repressing it. 10, 14, 17, 18 We have to also do prevention. 10, 19 We have to do treatment. 12, 13 The four pillars that we say, I can’t think of what they are exactly.  It’s a more differentiated approach and not just forbidding it.  You can’t forbid something, prohibit something that so many people are doing anyways regardless of it being prohibited. 9, 17, 18, 20 It’s not going to go away just by outlawing it. 13, 18, 20 A more permissive attitude sort of came forth then.  They started leaving this expectation that people who were on drugs were just going to stop using them and become abstinence and be detoxed and then be okay. 5, 6, 9, 19 It hardly ever works that way. 9, 18 Occasionally somebody does and that’s good. 10 Mostly not.  AS: You opened your own practice, how did patients who had opiate issues find you? 12, 13 Are all psychiatrists prepared to deal with opiate addicts? 5, 10, 12, 14 I’m just trying to understand your medical system. 7, 14, 17, 18 We would say you’re an addiction medicine doctor or you’re just a psychiatrist. 12, 14 Those two in the U.S. don’t often overlap in private practice.  AT: I’d say generally psychiatrists don’t want to or need to treat people with this kind of addiction. 9, 12, 14 Oftentimes because it’s viewed as something very strenuous you’re going to wind up with your bills not getting paid, stuff like that.  The patients are going to be lying to you all the time.  This also stems from the attitude, “I’m the doctor. 12, 14 I’m going to counsel you on what you need to do to overcome your problems.” 12 Especially in addiction you can’t do that. 12, 14 You have to find out where that person is at that moment and take it from there. 8, 12, 14 You can’t superimpose this expectation of yours which doesn’t fit the frame of reference of the patient. 15, 16 You have to very carefully feel out the frame of reference of this person. 14, 15, 19 Including his substance abuse or her substance abuse and where they’re standing and why they have come to you. 6, 13, 14 What they actually want from you. 7 Without saying, “This is what I want from you.  They’re coming to you with an expectation that you’re going to help them in a certain way. 17, 18 You have to find out what that is.  It might not be realistic but it usually is not realistic in a way that they are expecting me to do much more for them. 18 Ultimately them achieving much more than they are actually able to do at that moment. 7, 8, 12, 14 Oftentimes my first job is to just find out where they are, give them the feeling that they’re being listened to and understood, and then start toning down their expectations. 11, 14, 15 “Listen.  You can’t just stop taking that. 11 You can’t just detox and everything will be okay. 19 Let’s try methadone or Dolophine or oral morphine, the slow release type. 10 You have to be open to various options and approaches.”  Oftentimes you need to accept the fact that in the background they’re using other substances. 6, 12 Each case is its own individual case. 17 Of course there are certain patterns that the addict does this and that. 14, 17 It’s very personal.  AS: Has your practice always been that way? 18 Do you think that the time you spent working at the hospital, the state hospital where you spent more time with patients, do you feel like that influenced your attitude towards addiction and towards people who were struggling with addiction? 8, 9, 12, 14 AT: I started to.  It’s been a long road. 17 I’ve been in this business now for almost thirty years. 12, 14 AS: Maybe you could talk about how it’s changed? 13 AT: It has a lot to do with my own personal experience too. 18 A lot of personal stuff and realizing how vulnerable I am.  This is not something that is just a bad life choice. 6, 10 This is something that can happen to you. 15 I mentioned in one of the letters that I had my own brush with morphine. 8, 10, 12 This is something that took me completely by surprise.  This was shortly before I opened my practice. 18 My friend, the anesthesiologist, had just gotten some practice permit. 20 He said, “Let’s see what this whole thing is about this flash.” 6 AS: Flash?  AT: The flash, the rush, when you inject an opiate.  He had morphine ampules and we shot intravenously ten milligrams. 11 It was at first, “This is kind of relaxing and nice.” 14, 18 But actually a little bit too much because I kind of was woozy and drowsy. 5, 7, 20 I tried it again but with only five milligrams, a very small amount comparatively.  That was, “Oh my God.”  All my troubles with attention deficit disorder, my problems with concentration, my problems with the strenuous—with keeping up a conversation with anybody and staying focused on the subject and not drifting away mentally and my ability to read and retain stuff was just better. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20 I went to twice a week. 15 It was helpful. 9 It was that point where I started feeling discouraged and craving. 14, 15 I got addicted. 12, 14 I detoxed three or four times. 19 If you’re taking something you’ve just really got to stay away from it because then my disdain for being dependent on something like that and my willingness to compromise. 11, 18, 20 I’m clean but I’d still call myself an addict. 14 I have vast amounts of oral morphine in my practice because I have to distribute it. 10 I never ever, ever keep injectable morphine in my practice. 10, 16 I know that it’s too tempting. 12 I could go buy it any time from the pharmacy.  Because you’re a doctor. 12, 14 It’s just I know I cannot fool myself into thinking, once it will be okay. 12 They come in packs of ten and I won’t be able to not use up the entire pack of ten. 6, 13 You can also buy them in boxes of one hundred ampules.  They have ten milligram and twenty milligram ampules.  It’s a really easy split. 18 I just keep it at a distance.  AS: If someone needs that they can go somewhere else.  AT: This was a very, very profoundly humiliating experience. 18 AT: I never thought that could happen to me. 15, 16, 17, 18 It never did with any other substance. 6, 16 I can smoke a joint tomorrow and then not think about it for a year. 14 I like a glass of wine but I don’t crave it. 11 I could easily go days or weeks without it. 15, 16 I had cocaine, I didn’t like the effect because it made me all tight and nervous and crabby.  I talked a mile a minute but I didn’t like the way I was physically feeling when I was on it. 6, 15, 18 I avoid it.  AS: How long did that last for you? 17 Did you take it like three or four times?  AT: Altogether like ten years. 8, 14 AS: Ten years? 14 How did that go over in your family life? 10, 12 AT: Not well.  Susan started to notice.  She could tell that I was using. 6 Sometimes she thought I was using and wasn’t. 6, 17, 18 She was never sure. 16 I lied about it or denied it or denied it when I actually wasn’t doing but she didn’t believe me. 7 Stuff like that.  It was a difficult thing. 10 Like Thilo Beck said, I’m a doctor. 12, 14 I can buy the clean stuff and inject it cleanly.  I might have injected two or three thousand times but you can’t see anything on my veins. 6 AS: Because you’re a doctor? 12, 14 AT: I’m a doctor. 12, 14 I know how to do it. 12 I know I need to stay away from that. 12, 18, 20 AS: Did you use methadone? 6, 13 AT: No, I never wanted that stuff. 16, 18 I just stopped.  AS: But it took you a few times?  AT: Yes.  I’d be using it for two weeks and working and performing just fine. 6, 11, 15 Once or twice one of my addict patients suspected me because they just knew. 14, 16 AS: And said that to you?  AT: I talked my way out of it. 18 “I’m so kaput today because I didn’t sleep last night.” 16 Then I was off of it and clean.  They weren’t sure anymore.  AS: What was the humiliating part? 9 AT: I was not in control. 18 I was actually being controlled by the substance. 6, 7, 18 AS: You have a deeper understanding now? 12, 14, 17, 18 AT: I know how powerful that can be. 10, 12, 17 AS: When you talk about a personal connection.  AT: I know how you can be thinking rationally and you’ll be doing something completely contrary. 12 Knowing as I’m doing it that I don’t want to do it but I’m doing it anyways. 12, 17, 18 “Oh my God that feels good. 10 What an asshole now I did it again.” 12 AS: That consciousness is always there. 18 AT: The other part is like somebody else is holding the steering wheel and driving you. 5, 9, 14 It’s a profound thing and I think it’s kind of unique for the opiates.  They have such an intricate way of interacting with the receptors in your brain and so specific in the way they interact with your brain. 13, 18 They quickly are after a relatively short time can change the way that your brain is functioning and the way of steering your thoughts and your behavior. 9, 13, 17, 18 AS: Do you feel like you got that back?  AT: Yes, but I am very respectful of it.  I will never have that in my practice or close to me because I couldn’t resist. 9, 10, 16 AS: What about your friend the anesthesiologist? 20 AT: He didn’t get into that.  Maybe he was less vulnerable than me.  Maybe he never had attention deficit disorder or something like that. 13, 16 I never identified with my patients. 16 I started to understand them better but I never felt, “You’re the same as me.” 11, 16, 17, 18 It’s not like I chummed up to them.  AS: You understood more about what they were going through.  You had not previously had an experience where you couldn’t control— AT: I was pretty understanding before but you can’t really know what it is. 10, 12, 14, 17, 18 It’s not something that you should have to know. 12 You shouldn’t have to have that experience. 18 The price is just way too high. 7, 18 In that sense it’s very humiliating.  I never feel ever even this much superiority over my patients. 16 I know why they lie. 12 I know that works. 9, 12 I know how much they hate themselves for lying. 12 The whole shame thing and everything is just mind blowing. 10 AS: That’s powerful. 10, 17 What I wanted to ask is what’s changed in your practice besides you? 13, 18 What changes have you seen? 6 Beck was talking about the substantial decrease of the numbers and the increase in age because heroin’s not in. 14, 16 How has your practice changed? 13 What have you noticed around opioids? 6, 13 AT: Hard to say what has changed around me or what I have changed myself. 13, 14 I used to work a lot more, see patients five or five and a half days a week. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 I was insane.  A few years back really started to realize how morphine was helping me to work more. 14, 18 AS: How long ago did you stop? 13, 17 AT: A couple years was the last time I used it. 6, 11, 13, 14, 16 There were gaps.  AS: But it was over a period of ten. 18 AT: I was very worried about myself.  AS: What made you not take methadone?  AT: I took methadone or oral morphine just to bridge over a certain gap of time before I knew I could take two or three weeks off to detox. 10, 15, 16, 17, 19 AS: You know what you’re doing. 12 Take two or three weeks off of work to detox because that’s how long it would take? 15, 17, 19 AT: It would take me four or five days to get over the worst but then you’re shaking depending on how long you’ve used. 6, 13, 16, 17 You’re going to have post-acute withdrawal symptoms for up to a year or two. 5, 14 AS: Those are serious. 11 Back to your patients.  How did it change?  AT: I reduced the number of addict patients I treat. 5, 14 Most of the patients that are being treated by me I’ve been treating for years. 12, 13, 14 I haven’t taken on many new ones. 8, 16 AS: Just addict patients? 14 AT: Beck mentioned, I can confirm that. 8, 12, 14 Most people I see are… 6, 9 AS: In their forties or fifties.  AT: I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a teenaged user. 6, 13 AS: But when you started your practice?  AT: I had sixteen, seventeen year olds. 14 My youngest patients were sixteen and already heavy heroin users. 6, 13 It was a long battle on methadone and this and that. 17 There’s still cocaine there.  We’ll prescribe methylphenidate, Ritalin. 6, 10, 13 AS: Does that help with cocaine addiction? 12, 14 AT: Sort of.  It’s a stimulant.  It’s not like they’d totally not crave it.  In some way or another it helps them maintain a certain stability. 17, 18 I’ll go along with it. 17 As long as it works it works. 9, 17 The pragmatic approach.  It’s a difficult thing when you treat addicts. 10, 14 It’s not a quick thing.  You’re in for a long haul always. 17, 18 AS: Your medical model is set up to accommodate that? 7, 13, 14 AT: To a degree.  I work together with pharmacies. 8 I work with federal practitioners. 8 I actually am one of the very, very few, I don’t know another psychiatrist except for Arud in Zurich which is a huge practice there, I take blood and there’s a central lab in Baden that I bring it over to and do lab work there. 7, 12, 14 I do maintain a very, very small amount of physical contact with my patients. 6 I measure their blood pressure or listen to their heart. 9, 10 AS: We were talking about your patients, the age of your patients and how its changed. 13 It’s rare that I get somebody below twenty for anything anymore which is okay.  I’m older myself. 20 I think it might have to do with the fact that when I started my practice I was much younger and probably projected a much more dynamic, youngish me which younger patients could identify with more. 5, 20 AS: How are people referred to you in private practice? 5, 9, 17 AT: I’d say about a fifth of them just hear about me and call me up. 9 The rest, half of the rest get referred by practitioners and the other half by the psychiatric institute. 5, 6, 8, 14, 17 Most of my patients are not addicts. 14 AS: It seemed like you said this earlier, did you purposely reduce the number of addict patients or have they naturally declined? 5, 6, 9, 14, 15 AT: It’s hard to say. 9 I purposely sort of withdrew a little bit from that because it’s really taxing. 5, 18, 20 In private practice if you don’t have an infrastructure and a lot of personnel and social workers and stuff like that to help additionally it’s a lot of work. 12, 15, 19 Because of the lifestyle that Beck was talking about. 10, 15 AT: The different aspects.  AS: All the stigma and the problems. 9, 12 AT: Their whole living situation, who they’re living with, their economic situation, their job. 11 All this stuff.  How are they buying food?  Who’s paying for it? 14 Where’s it coming from?  Do they have social services of the municipality there to help them? 19 AS: When you take on an addict patient you’re taking on all that. 11, 14 AT: The whole thing.  Which I don’t do myself but I have to be in phone contact with the social services of the municipality or their primary care physician or with their employer or with their landlord or whatever. 8, 16, 19 AS: That stuff typically doesn’t happen with your other patients. 15, 18 AT: Not as much.  It’s a lot of work and a lot of work that I can’t charge for.  AS: Because it’s not the one on one time.  AT: I have a petition for work in absence of the patient but you can’t overdo it.  The insurance will just refuse to pay it. 6, 13 AS: I have a question here about best practices for the future of addiction treatment. 12, 13, 14 If you could predict something that would happen regarding addiction treatment what would it be? 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 If you could change something for the better in the current system here?  Best practices, something that will happen or that you see coming up ahead or something that you could change. 6, 14, 15 AT: I think education of health professionals needs to start early and with a bigger emphasis on it. 14, 15, 19 It’s a huge part of our society, of the health system, of what we have to deal with, it’s underrepresented. 5, 9, 10, 12, 19 AS: And underfunded. 8 AT: Yes.  The whole understanding of addiction, like tobacco addiction is completely under dealt with. 12, 14, 17, 18 It’s addiction that’s about as bad as heroin addiction. 12, 14, 16 People who are hooked on cigarettes have a hard time stopping. 9, 14 AS: There’s not much here for that.  AT: They talk about the amount of deaths from heroin, there’s ten times as much death from tobacco. 16, 18 AS: Still today. 16 That’s a good point. 10 AT: It’s legal.  You can buy it every place.  You go outside and smoke. 9 Alcohol is more noticed but still that’s very accepted. 12 It takes a long time for acquaintances or relatives of an addict to admit that the one close to them is having a problem with alcohol. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17 It will be overlooked and denied and sort of rationalized.  Then for the person who is consuming it themselves, they accept that themselves because it’s part of society. 9, 12 Almost everybody drinks. 5 Ninety-five percent of the drinkers can handle that and five percent consume seventy-five percent of what’s consumed. 5 AT: I think that’s probably universal.  AS: Five percent consume seventy-five percent.  More education. 14, 15 AT: More education, more knowledge about it, more understanding, and you need a lot of experience. 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 AS: Would you say even by education it’s just with health professionals? 14, 15, 19 How is your school system? 7 Does your school system here offer drugs education? 5, 6, 7, 14, 15 AT: More than they used to but I’m not sure how useful that is because the educational system is dealing with kids. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 There’s a degree you can educate them about addiction and substances and stuff like that. 6, 12, 14 It’s something that, “Okay I see my parents drinking wine. 5, 6, 11, 20 I’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about.”  AS: More medical professionals. 7, 14 AT: I think in higher levels of public education you could probably introduce this topic. 7, 14, 15, 17, 19 For teenagers, make them aware that this is something that you have to be aware of and careful of. 19 They need to know some facts about drugs that can easily become available at a party or on the street, heroin or cocaine, before they try it. 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 So that they have an idea of what they might be risking and getting into just by touching the stuff.  AS: Would you talk a little bit about, you were talking the other day about why you’re not in favor of legalization of everything. 16, 20 AT: I’m just not sure.  AS: Is marijuana legal here?  It should be more legal.  When I talk about legalization often people think about it as this black and white thing. 9, 19 Tobacco is regulated legally, so is alcohol. 6 There’re rules and you can get in trouble. 13 AS: They have different rules. 13 AT: It’s a question of how we regulate it legally not whether it’s just illegal or legal.  I think you have to take into account the different risks of these different substances. 6 Opiates is kind of in a way different from the other things. 18 Cocaine is different but it also has similarities with other stimulants and stuff.  Opiates are very distinct idiosyncratic effect.  Alcohol is just a cell poison.  You bathe yourself in it and they sort go “Ugh” and release their dopamine.  Opiate, that docks onto a very specific point and tricks the nerves into thinking something else. 14 AS: It’s very quickly lethal if you use too much of it. 6, 13 AT: If you use too much of it you’ll stop breathing. 6, 13 AS: Anything else?  AT: Not that I can think of at the moment. 8, 12, 14 I’ve been babbling away. 18, 20 AS: What about the future?  Is there something if you could offer some idea for public policy or something for the future? 19 Maybe it’s education as you already said but is there any other care or treatment for people? 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 AT: Make it available I think.  Public acceptance that this is an aspect that should not be so stigmatized that needs to be accepted as something that you can become addicted just the same way as you can suffer from high blood pressure. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 If you have high blood pressure you always have to take a medication that keeps it in the low range. 7, 10, 14, 15, 18 Countless other, like diabetes. 10 Okay there might be some different ways of looking at it and understanding it but in certain aspects why should you think of it differently? 14, 17, 18 It’s a health problem. 12, 19 AS: It’s what Beck was talking about earlier today. 15, 16 It’s the way that it’s stigmatized that marginalizes the people that do have a problem. 9, 12, 18 Their life becomes complex and difficult because of their marginalization, because of the stigma. 9, 10, 13 Right?  AT: The only thing that makes heroin so dangerous is it enters your brain about ten times more easily than morphine. 11, 13, 16 If you inject it this huge wall of heroin is immediately entering your brain. 13, 16 The sharp rise in the concentration might be a temporal overdose.  Your brain doesn’t have enough time to adjust to this amount of effect. 13 Your breathing just shuts down, your heart stops. 9 That’s an overdose.  Apart from that it’s not particularly dangerous. 9, 11 If you take an amount of heroin that you can tolerate your health isn’t going to be impaired. 5, 16, 19 You’re just going to be dependent on it.  AS: That can turn out to be a problem. 12 AT: It can be a problem. 12 I like being able to move freely. 15 I want to go to the states for a few weeks and not have to worry about having something with me that maintains me. 15 These are the motivational factors that Beck was talking about. 17 I have lots of reasons that I don’t want to. 16 AS: With the motivational thinking or interviewing.  Those are powerful. 10, 17 I think my son-in-law had a counselor who used that. 6, 13, 16 I remember he was talking about that he really liked it. 18 He liked a therapist using that model. 6 AT: The whole politics towards this needs to change.  It’s just so tiresome because there are experts who have a lot of knowledge and experience about it but their hands are tied by the greater way that it’s being seen by society and by the health department and by the politics. 6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20 And the different administrations that come in and the ruling parties and how quickly you can backtrack and lose ground on something. 9, 16 AT: How flexible are you as a therapist?  How flexible can you use substitution agents or other treatment modalities that you can offer? 6, 12, 13 Talk therapy, group therapy, institutionalization, whatever works or is desired or is acceptable or makes sense. 5, 9, 12 This whole thing about, “You have to not take it and you’re only a wonderful person if you’re not addicted or dependent on anything at all.” 12, 14, 18 It doesn’t work that way, it can’t. 18 You can argue, “You made a bad decision.” 14 It’s not like that.  You have peer pressure; you have all sorts of things coming into play. 10 You have a teenager who’s heard all this stuff and they think, “Yeah, yeah that’s what all the adults are saying. 9 Here my friend is offering me something and he’s taking it. 11, 20 He looks okay.  I’m going to see what it’s like myself.” 6 You can’t just say this is a bad decision. 14 It’s the way things go. 18 AS: We need to create supports for someone to pull back from it that are consistent and non-judgmental. 12, 14 AT: Yes.  This needs to be very readily available.  To catch it.  AT: And easily available.  Somebody at ten o’clock in the morning could be like, “God I can’t continue this way.” 14, 18 And at one in the afternoon walks into a place like Arud it’s good that something happens right then. 10, 12, 15, 16 AS: Thank you.  AT: Sure.  AS: [Speaking to cat].  Thanks kitty.  [End of Recording] "
"25","Kelvie_Chandra","Verne Wagner Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 18, 2017 Duluth, Minnesota Verne Wagner -VW Amy Sullivan -AS AS: This is Amy Sullivan it is May 18.  I got it right gals. 12 May 18, 2017 I’m in Duluth, Minnesota with Verne Wagner.  Verne do you give me permission to record this interview?  VW: Yes, you have my permission to record this interview.  AS: Let’s start with your story. 15 Where you grew up, when you became a parent, some of your childhood, a little background on who you are. 14, 20 VW: I grew up in the town of Proctor, just a little bit outside of Duluth. 20 It’s a railroad town.  My father was a railroader; my grandfather was a railroader. 16 I grew up there. 20 Railroad men are known for drinking. 5, 11, 12 My dad and my grandfather were no exception. 14, 16 My grandfather was a terrible alcoholic that got into recovery. 6, 11, 16 He left my dad and his mom at a very young age. 14 They separated and he was gone for eight years until he finally got into AA and got very involved in AA. 8, 11, 14 My grandfather was also an international union president which took him to Washington. 9, 10, 16 While he was in Washington, I have some pictures of him and John Kennedy together, fell off the wagon and started drinking again. 5, 8, 11, 13 He ended up retiring.  My grandfather, one of the local railroads asked him to be a drug and alcohol counselor for them. 5, 6, 16 He started a program that is used now throughout the United States. 6, 12, 13, 16 Rather than firing people if you agreed to go into treatment they would put you in treatment and keep you working. 9, 12, 13 When I was a little boy growing up I used to see these men that looked like the roughest meanest looking men sitting in my grandfather’s living room. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20 I’d say, “Grandma who are these men?” 12 “Oh, they’re just men that need to talk to Grandpa.” 12 Those were sponsors.  He sponsored those men. 5, 12 When Grandpa died, all these people at his funeral came up and said, “Your grandfather saved my life, that’s how I know him.” 9, 10, 12, 16 That was my introduction to the AA. 14 AS: But you didn’t know about AA until much later? 12 VW: No, Grandpa gave me his big book and I knew a little bit about it. 16, 20 My father also was a terrible alcoholic. 6, 11, 16 My mother came down with breast cancer in about 1965. 10 On July 4, 1967 she passed away. 18, 20 I was twelve years old at the time and my older brothers and sisters were four, five, and six years older than I am. 14, 20 My father remarried six months later and moved us into a stepfamily. 7, 11, 12, 15, 16 My brothers and sisters all revolted and pretty much left. 10, 14, 20 AS: So they were all teenagers.  VW: Yes.  I was left in a stepfamily. 12, 14 My dad was gone drinking. 5, 8, 11, 14 My stepmother was very upset that he was gone and was very, very verbally and emotionally abusive to me. 8, 11 I was a teenager.  You can imagine as a teenager what that’s like with a stepmother especially.  I was born very strict Catholic. 14 Not only did I go to Catholic grade school but I sang in the choir at eight o’clock mass, at ten o’clock mass I served mass, and at eleven thirty mass I usually read the epistle to the church. 5, 7 I had a priest that taught me public speaking skills. 10, 19, 20 This priest abused me, sexually when I was twelve. 6, 12, 13, 16, 20 He basically raped me. 19 I quit the church shortly after. 18 What’d I’d do when I was supposed to go to church… 14 AS: You were still supposed to go so you didn’t tell anyone.  VW: I went to the Proctor golf course and I’d hide up there.  I worked there as a summer job so I could hide up there. 7, 11 I’d come home after church was done and I never told anyone about this. 16 Finally, my father said to me, “You’re not going to church.” 16 I said, “How do you know?” 12 “I know. 12 “I don’t know, Dad. 12 Church does not appeal to me anymore.  I’ve learned everything I can learn. 10 I don’t like church.  I don’t want to go.”  That was my way out of church. 18 I started discovering girls. 7, 11 Girls started discovering me.  I was a chunky little fellow. 10, 20 I lost all this weight and the girls started knocking on my door which was very strange for me. 7, 11 As a young boy it was extremely exciting. 7 As a Catholic I was never sexual with girls. 7, 11, 12, 16 My father always said, “Verne you don’t have sex with a girl unless you’re either married to her or you plan to marry her. 7, 12, 16, 18 You never, never have sex with a girl.” 7, 12, 16 That’s how I was raised. 14 I had girlfriends who used to say, “How come you aren’t like the other boys? 6, 7, 11, 13, 16, 20 How come you never try anything?” 16 I don’t know but I just knew that was not what I was supposed to do. 12, 16 I had a secret life. 10 Going through puberty I learned about masturbation. 10 It was extremely shaming to me.  It was a secret.  I used to think, if my mother is watching me how shaming this was. 6, 8, 13, 16, 17 Your deceased mother. 14 VW: Yes.  AS: That’s so intense.  VW: I started doing that compulsively. 14 I hurt myself.  Then I started exposing myself to young girls when I masturbated, girls my age, in Proctor. 7, 11 I’m thirteen, fourteen years old. 14 At fifteen I get caught.  Somebody turns me in.  My dad sends me to a psychiatrist. 14 One of my older brothers is gay and my dad could not stand the thought of a son that was gay. 9, 14, 17, 18, 20 This was a World War II, John Wayne, butch haircut, six foot two man’s man.  To have a son that was gay was the worst thing in the world for him. 9 Now he’s afraid that his youngest son is gay too. 9 He sent me to a psychiatrist. 5 It was so shaming.  Only nuts crazy people saw, back then. 9, 20 Only crazy people saw psychiatrists. 9, 12, 20 I was a crazy person. 20 AS: What year were you born? 14 I saw this psychiatrist, he kept me from committing suicide.  At fourteen I actually attempted suicide. 7 US Highway 2 runs through Proctor. 8, 18 There used to be grain trucks from North Dakota that would come down to the grain elevators and it was a steady stream of big grain trucks. 6, 13, 16 At fourteen I closed my eyes and walked out in front of one. 5, 9, 10, 16 That man, poor guy, slammed on his breaks and went around me.  When I realized he didn’t hit me he jumps out of his truck and I took off running. 8 That was my suicide attempt.  At fifteen I started drinking. 5, 11 I started using marijuana and LSD. 6 I was a very out of control kid. 18 The psychiatrist I went to see, I saw him for about a year and then he got arrested for molesting his patients. 6, 14 AS: Where did you see him? 6 VW: In Duluth.  I’d see this where he had women laying on different cots in different rooms. 6, 12, 14 He’d give them a tranquilizer and then he’d molest them when they were out.  One time he came in and he had his pants down and he had thigh high stockings on and a garter belt. 7 What the hell is that?  AS: What did you think of the world at this point?  He’s a professional and I’m the one who’s crazy. 8, 20 I was scared of anybody as an adult. 5, 19 I played sports in Proctor.  I was scared to death of the coaches. 5, 18, 19 I was scared of people in… 5, 9, 19 AS: Positions of authority.  VW: Positions of authority.  With my father’s drinking I got very involved in lots of things trying to become a leader in something to get his attention. 5, 11, 16 Children of alcoholic type stuff. 5, 6 I struggled to do that.  I always thought once I had sex with a woman my compulsive behavior would finish. 12, 17, 18 I met my wife when she was fifteen and I was sixteen. 20 It was a dance that the Catholic Church in the western part of Duluth would put on for teenagers in the summer. 7, 9 I met her, she had white blue jeans on. 19 AS: Those were the days. 16 VW: I memorized her phone numbers. 8, 16 We dated off and on. 13 She was an extremely strict Catholic.  She has two nuns in the family. 12 I’m thinking she’s from the west part of Duluth. 9 If you’re from Proctor you’re thinking west-end girl these women are rowdy. 7, 12 I have to marry one who’s thinking about becoming a nun.  We dated off and on. 13 We finally got engaged.  After four years at nineteen years of age we lost our virginity together. 8, 11, 14 It was very intense.  I felt like I was doing something wrong. 11 “You took her virginity, you asshole.  You selfish bastard.”  She was like, “No, it’s okay.  I wanted to do this.” 18 We ended up marrying.  We’re going on forty years now of being married. 7, 12, 14 I always thought that would stop my behaviors and it didn’t. 17, 18 I got in some trouble with the police. 8 AS: After you were married? 7 After I was married. 7 I met a psychologist in town.  I said, “My grandfather was very big into AA. 16 This feels like a very compulsive addiction, what I’m doing. 12, 14 I’ve tried stopping this my whole life. 10 I can’t stop it.”  I made promises to myself, I made promises to God, I made promises to my wife and I can’t stop this behavior. 20 I said, “I’d like to start this twelve step group based on the steps of AA.” 13 He said, “That’s an interesting thought.” 17, 18 I put it together. 8 He was part of this community group of therapists. 9, 19 He said, “Would you put a presentation on to these folks?” 5, 10, 12 This one therapist said, “You’re talking about sexual addiction.” 12, 14 I said, “What?  I’ve never heard that term.” 9, 16, 17 “There’s a doctor in the Twin Cities named Patrick Carnes. 12, 14 He’s written a book called Out of the Shadows.  It’s now called Out of the Shadows. 12 You should read that book.”  I went and got it.  Oh my God.  It was like this guy wrote this book about me.  I contacted him and tracked him down to the Twin Cities. 16 He said, “I just started a program in Golden Valley.  Would you like to come down?”  I was patient number ninety-seven of his.  Pat Carnes is now a world famous therapist. 12 My second son is named after him.  I went through his program.  I learned about addiction. 10, 12, 14 I learned about core values that addicts have about themselves, low self-esteem. 10, 14 If people knew what I was really like they wouldn’t like me. 9, 16, 18 For me sex was my most important aid. 9, 12 I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs. 9, 18 You have very little self-worth, self-esteem, you don’t trust people so therefore you have a very secret life. 9, 10, 20 I learned that. 10 While I was there I started going to Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings in the cities. 7, 14, 18 But when I came up here we didn’t have anything.  I started a group in Duluth, still going strong.  I don’t go to it anymore but I went to it a year ago. 13, 14 I walked into the meeting and folks were like, “Hi how are you?” 12, 16, 18 “Good.”  “Do you know what meeting you’re at?” 12, 18 “Isn’t this Sex Addicts Anonymous?” 14 “Yes.  How do you know about us?” 12 “I started this meeting in my living room in 1985.” 14, 18 It’s still going strong.  After about two years in therapy I started the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction which was an educational organization. 12, 14, 15 What that did for me though was it got me very involved in the twelve steps.  I understood the twelve steps.  Starting that group in Duluth I can’t tell you how many hundreds of people who I had coffee with that told me their story that needed help. 5, 9, 15, 16 The county jail would call me up, “Verne we have someone up here who needs to talk to you.” 19 I’d go down to the sex offenders program in Moose Lake and they asked me not to come back because they said, “These folks are going to be here the rest of their lives. 12, 14 We’re not going to let them go.  You’re telling them that their behaviors are insane. 15 The second step of the program is belief in a higher power will restore us to sanity. 7, 17 By doing that they’re going to claim that they’re insane and they’re going to try to get out of here.  We’ll never let these people out of here. 9, 16 We don’t want you to come back here.”  “I don’t think this is the right thing to do.” 12 They wouldn’t let me come back.  We started SAA meetings here. 18 I got a call and went up to Canada and did it up in Canada.  Long story short, that’s what got me involved in the twelve steps. 15, 18 I worked the twelve steps, I know the life of an addict, I know how powerful an addiction is. 10, 12, 14, 17 The insanity of that addiction. 12, 14 I’ve been married going on forty years, we have two children. 5, 7, 14, 20 My wife is a medical social worker. 7, 14, 19, 20 She’s soon to retire.  She started a group called COSA.  COSA was the AlAnon version for co-dependence of sex addicts. 12, 14 Both of us have this background.  When our oldest boy called us up and said, “Mom, Dad I’ve got a problem. 7, 12, 20 I’ve gotten myself addicted to meth.” 6, 12, 14 We were like, “Oh my God.  We’ve been down this road.”  AS: Did your sons know about your addiction? 12, 14 VW: I told both my boys my story. 7, 11, 15, 16 VW: Probably when they were seventeen, eighteen years old. 14 I started to be on the news media more and more. 15, 16 I got involved with my work with the church.  I filed a lawsuit against the church in 1992. 13 What I did is I went to the bishop of Duluth who I knew very well. 15, 16 I had dinner with him several times at my mother-in-law’s house. 6, 13 I called him up and said, “Look, I had a priest in Proctor, Father John Nicholson. 20 He molested me.  He raped me.  He did that to a bunch of the kids I went to school with. 7 I’m not interested in suing you.  All of this is starting to come out in the media about what’s going on.  Let’s do something proactive.  Let’s reach out to my classmates and say we heard this happened. 7, 9, 15 What can we do as a church to help you heal?”  “Come into see me.” 6 He wouldn’t see me. 6 He’s an attorney basically, the second in command to the bishop. 14, 15, 19 AS: So the bishop invited you to talk to him but then the bishop didn’t take the meeting. 15, 18 VW: So then this guy meets me. 18 He tells me who he is. 15 “The bishop won’t be joining us.” 15 I told him this guy molested me. 16 I said, “I’d like to do something positive with this.  I would like to do an outreach to my schoolmates. 7, 12 I think we could heal together. 8 I think this could be something very positive that we do together.” 8 He said, “I think that’s a great idea. 20 Let me get back to you.”  He never did. 16 A couple months later I called him back. 11, 16 “We’re still thinking about it.”  He never did. 16 I’m watching Sally Jessy Rafael. 8, 17 She’s got Father Tom  Doyle and another priest on the show. 20 Tom  Doyle was a lawyer and he was with the embassy, the Vatican Embassy in Washington D.C. He and the priest were charged by the American Association of Bishops to look into this. 13, 15, 20 This was all starting to happen. 15 “Is it really that bad or is it just a few bad priests?” 18, 20 He came back and said, “No, this is huge.  We need to do to reach out to these people. 9 We need to do something about it.”  They buried his report and said, “If you two want to have a future as priests you’ll forget this ever happened and bury it.” 13, 15, 20 Here these guys on Sally Jessy and they said, “The only way we’re going to get the church to do something right about this is to sue them. 12, 18 Go after their pocketbook.”  I contacted Jeff Anderson from the Twin Cities.  They took me on.  I settled the case. 14, 17 The laws got changed in one of the courts. 13, 14 Jeff Anderson calls me up and says, “Verne your lawsuit is dead. 13, 16 Until this gets appealed to a higher court, your lawsuit’s dead.” 7, 13, 16, 17 AS: Because of the reporting? 13 VW: No it was just the way the law had gotten interpreted. 10, 13, 18 There’s a lot of Catholic judges.  He said, “Verne the church will give me enough money to get my money out of this. 8, 10 I can get you a couple thousand bucks.” 11 I said, “Jeff I told you when I first started this, this has nothing to do with money. 8, 10, 14, 16 This is about keeping the church accountable.  You get your money out of this. 8, 10 I will settle this thing so you can get your money but I will not sign a clause that will keep me quiet. 6, 8, 10, 11, 13 I want to publicly speak about this.” 19 That allowed me then to continue my work as a volunteer. 10, 14 I think Nicholson had thirty some people that he ended up molesting. 9 AS: That’s the priest? 20 VW: That’s the priest. 20 Since I started that I think the diocese has about thirty or forty priests that have been identified. 20 AS: What’s the name of the organization?  VW: SNAP, the Survivor Network of those Abused by Priests. 6, 13, 16 AS: That’s a powerful story. 10, 15, 17 That interests me being raised Catholic. 14 We were at the point where you said you told your boys when they were seventeen and eighteen. 7, 11, 16 VW: Matthew was born in ‘86. 14 Patrick was born in 1990. 14 AS: This isn’t until the 2000s.  But you brought this up in ‘92?  This was a long process. 17 VW: Yes.  It was settled in about ‘95.  AS: You started speaking out more because it blew up nationally.  Your boys were teenagers and they were going to hear you. 7, 9, 11 VW: They were going to hear me on the news. 9, 15, 16 I told my father, “Dad you’re going to hear in the news.” 9, 15, 16 He felt terrible. 11 He absolutely felt terrible. 11 The reason  I’m throwing this at you was this was the framework that I’ve had to be there to help my son. 15 Sometimes you kind of look about why things happen in your life, talking about higher power stuff. 7, 10, 15, 17 My son Matthew is a professional dancer, he does dance and theater.  He was out in New York.  He had a partner out there, they would go in New York City, it’s all about who you see and being seen. 6, 9 Somebody said, “You ought to try meth.” 6 “Okay.”  He tried it and it was like “Oh my God, this is incredible.” 5 As a dancer, “I’m losing weight because I’m on this stuff.  I don’t have to eat as much.”  It ended up consuming him. 14 He lost his job, he lost his relationship. 11, 19 He lost pretty much everything. 10, 11 AS: At what point did he call you?  VW: He’d been using for about six months when he called me. 6, 11, 16 He called me in the fall.  AS: What year is this? 14 VW: He’s been clean for five years. 14 That was seven years ago, 2010. 13, 14 It was 2012 during our flood that I came down. 14 I had to go down to the cities and pick him up, he’d been using. 6, 7 Probably 2010 when he first...I got him involved in a treatment center in New York. 12, 13, 14 This was a revolving door place.  “Come on in.  Thirty days. 16 Goodbye.”  He started using again. 6 His partner was very upset. 9 They were hurting for money. 8, 10 His partner finally said, “I’m done.” 8, 9 Matt started sleeping with all kinds of people so he put his partner at risk too. 9, 16 Matt’s gay and it’s all part of that gay lifestyle of New York. 9, 10, 15 His partner said, “I’m done.” 8, 9 He called me up, “Verne, Matt owes me money for rent. 8, 10 Can you help me out?”  “Yes.”  I ended up paying his debts. 14 He’d been gone for two weeks on the streets of New York. 5, 15 Nobody knew where he was, none of his friends. 8, 16, 20 I called the St. Louis County attorney who I know. 12 I said, “Mark do you have any contacts in New York City?  I’ve got a son that’s using out there. 6 He’s using meth. 6 I get somebody to look for him?”  “If they find him they’re going to arrest him and he’ll get a felony.  I don’t know if you want that. 12 Although they might put him in drug court.” 5, 6 Finally, he made contact with one of his friends. 16, 20 He said, “Matt I’ve got food and stuff in my apartment come on in when you can.” 5, 9, 11, 12 He put a motion detector hooked up to a computer with a camera. 14 When Matt entered his apartment he had him on motion detection. 5, 9, 11, 12 Matt is so gaunt and so out of it.  This guy finally runs home and gets him and has him. 8 I talk to him on the phone. 8, 16 I say, “Matt do you want help or not?”  “I don’t know Dad.” 12 “Here’s the deal son.  If you want to stay using, then I’m going to put your mom on the phone and I want you to say goodbye to her. 6, 8, 14, 16 Then you’re going to say goodbye to me.  If you want to be an addict, then you choose that and you be an addict. 14 If you don’t think you have a problem that’s your choice. 6, 12 You’re going to lose your family. 9, 12 You have a choice here. 6 You can either have your family and I’ll be there to support you or you can have your meth. 6, 12 That’s your choice. 6 What do you want to do?”  My wife is going, 20 Are you crazy? 20 Are you fucking crazy? 20 What if he says?”  “He has a choice to make: do you have a problem or don’t you? 6, 12 If you’re going to choose your drugs over your family, it’s pretty tough to say you don’t have a problem.” 5, 6, 10, 12 He said, “Dad I don’t want to lose you guys.” 9 I said, “Good.  That’s the right answer. 12 I want you to come home.  I can get you into treatment in Minnesota. 12, 13 We have the best treatment centers in the country.” 12, 13, 19 I flew him and his friend home. 20 I was afraid he might take off.  I flew them both in.  This was retirement money that I had. 8, 10, 12 AS: Verne you never told me what it is that you do. 16 VW: I railroaded for twenty-nine years. 14 I blew two disks out in my back.  I was retired at age forty-seven. 5 I was a union guy.  I represented railroads in Minnesota down at the state legislature. 5, 10 I had success down there and they shipped me to Washington D.C. I was a lobbyist in Washington for a number of years. 14 AS: A lot like your grandfather. 16 VW: My kids were little and I said, “I can’t be a father who comes home on weekends.” 15, 16, 20 I went from assistant national director to a Cub Scout leader here in Duluth. 18, 19 Talk about a little ego change. 20 That’s my background.  We got him home.  I called the Pride Institute in the Twin Cities.  The former director, Joe Meeko, was on my board for the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction. 14, 18, 19 I said, “Is Joe Meeko there?”  “Joe’s gone. 8, 11 We know Joe.” 12 “I’m an old friend of his. 20 I have this gay son who is coming home who is hooked on meth. 6, 9 Can I get him in?”  “Yes you can.”  I picked him up from the cities and he was home for a while. 7, 14 He stole our car and went to the cities and used. 6, 7, 13, 16 The cops pinged his phone and said, “Verne he’s in the Twin Cities. 8, 16 Why don’t you put a health and welfare check on him? 19 If we do find him we can say, ‘Call your parents they’re worried about you.’ 20 If you file a stolen car report, then he’s going to get in trouble and you don’t want that do you?” 13 “I don’t want that.  I just want the boy home.” 7 We got up here the night it started raining, what a hellacious night.  We got back to Duluth at eleven thirty at night when it started pouring.  I was a Red Cross volunteer at the time.  When I get home there’s a call at one in the morning saying, “The city’s flooding out, can you opening up a shelter?” 10 “Yes.”  We have a big church up on the hill and I called that minister and we opened up a shelter for Duluth.  It’s only because I remember how crazy this whole shit was. 18, 20 We did a rule twenty-five. 13 The day of the storm we were scheduled to do a rule twenty-five. 13, 16 The social worker from St. Louis County said, “I’ll try to get to my office.” 19 Mary said, “Great, I will be there.”  Mary took a whole bunch of detours and got there and met with the social worker. 19 She did a rule twenty-five. 13 Then a couple days later I got him down to Pride Institute. 11, 16 He was there for ninety days. 16 He got out, they put him in a sober house. 6, 13 They should have put him in a halfway house. 6, 13, 14, 18 Bought all his clothing, food, linens, all this shit. 9, 18 He was there for two days and he’s gone. 8, 11, 16 We’ve both been down this road.  Finally, we talk and he’s living at some guy’s house that’s providing a free place to stay. 6, 13 AS: He’s going to work the program on his own?  VW: “You’re on your own.  Good luck.”  After three weeks he calls me up and says, “Can I come home?” 15, 16 I said, “I don’t know. 12 Here’s when you can come home.  You go to ninety meetings in ninety days and you get an NA sponsor.” 16, 18 AS: And then you can come home?  VW: Then you can come home.  “You have to agree to those terms.” 17 He went to the Center for Drug and Alcohol and they had an outpatient day meeting. 11, 16, 18 He went there and he started going to NA at night.  He got a sponsor, a woman from Superior, Robin.  Robin is incredible. 5 She’s been clean from heroin for about twenty-five years now. 12, 14, 16 AS: Is it Robin E?  VW: Yes, Robin E. AS: Robin’s being interviewed right now by my students. 12 VW: I was going to suggest to you that you interview Robin.  AS: I found her on NA.  VW: Robin’s incredible. 5 Robin became Matt’s sponsor.  Matt did ninety days. 16 He said, “I’m going to do another ninety.”  AS: Is he living here at this point?  VW: He’s at home.  For two years he was going to NA every day. 14, 16 Then he got on the area board. 8 Then he became the assistant regional.  He’s very involved in NA.  He sponsors a number of people. 9 I got a call from Douglas County, their jail.  I criticized them, their county attorney and their jailers. 14, 19 “You’re talking about locking people up longer. 9, 17 You don’t have a treatment program in Northwestern Wisconsin. 12, 13 You just got done saying if you lock people up longer it’s a better idea. 9, 17 I’m not from here, I’m from Duluth, I’m not here to tell you your business.  You don’t provide any type of programming while they’re in jail.  If you believe it’s better to keep them in jail, then why the hell aren’t you offering NA in your jail?  “I don’t know why not.” 12 “I’ll tell you why not.  You have a policy that you have to be clean for at least two years and you also cannot have a felony on your record to be in a jail. 14 How many heroin addicts and meth addicts do you know that don’t have some sort of record?” 6, 12, 14 I got a call the next day from the county jailer. 16, 19 “We’ve changed our policy. 13 Can you come over and start an NA group?”  “No I’m not an addict.” 14 I said to my son, “Son this might be great service work for you.” 19, 20 Nothing was more sobering for me than to hear that big steel door shut behind me and know I was not locked in. 9, 12 I said, “I would really recommend you consider that.” 9, 12, 14, 18 He runs an NA group up at that county jail. 8, 19 AS: So Matt still lives here.  VW: Yes.  Matt lived with us for two years. 7, 14 Two years of my life I was taking care of my dad who was quite elderly. 10, 11, 14, 19 I was his caretaker up here and I was taking care of Matt at the same time. 11, 19 My life was extremely full. 10, 14 After two years I said, “Son it’s time for you to go.” 14 “You think I’m ready?”  You’re working your program.  You have a higher power you’ve connected with. 7, 17 It’s time for you to go.”  He started, because he’s a professional dance, one of the dance schools called him up. 7 Then he got a call from a theatrical director, “We have a small company in Duluth to not only do choreography for us but we have a couple of lead roles we’d like you to do.” 10, 11, 14, 18, 19 He’s like, “God, Dad I can’t believe this.”  “And you thought coming back to Duluth your whole theatrical life was over.” 10, 17, 18 We talked about higher power action. 7, 17 How this was so much higher power that he needed to recognize. 7, 17 “Son when this happens you need to bank this. 15 When you’re feeling very scared if you can recognize that your higher power has been there for you it’s a very comforting thought. 5, 7, 15, 17, 18, 19 You can recognize you might not have the answers about what’s going to happen in life but you can trust that a higher power does.” 7, 10, 15, 17 He got a call from University of Minnesota Duluth campus saying, “We’d like you to teach a class for us.” 7 This last year they called and said, “One of our teachers is going to be gone. 8, 11, 14 We’d like you to be full time on our staff.” 14 He just finished with that.  Matt’s been clean for a little over five years. 14, 20 Now he’s headed down to Milwaukee to get his master’s degree. 14 The college folks have said, “Matt we’d love to have you come back.” 7, 12, 14 He says, “I love teaching college level.” 7, 14 But he needs to have his MFA.  AS: When did you start the NarAnon group?  VW: Three years ago this June. 13, 14 During those first two years you said were hard, you started the NarAnon group after Matt moved out? 7, 9, 14, 15 VW: Pretty much.  He’d been here for a little while when we started the NarAnon group. 20 AS: Tell me why you started the NarAnon group.  VW: I wanted to start NarAnon because what we went through and what every parent goes through is the darkest shit. 17, 18, 20 You just can’t get over how dark this is. 17 It felt like I had something to give to people. 9, 11 It’s the old thing about turning lemons into lemonade. 20 Trying to do something positive.  Three years ago I contacted the mayor of Duluth, Don Ness, and I said, “Mayor we’ve got this opiate problem going on. 5, 12, 13, 14 We can’t rely on the police to do this. 8 This is bigger than the police. 8 We need to start some sort of community organization. 19 Some sort of community task force. 8, 19 I would like to offer you my services to do that.” 19 I started the NarAnon by contacting the police chief and saying, “We’re going to do this NarAnon group. 8 Would you put that on your Facebook page that we’re going to do that at Miller-Dwan Meeting Room at this date?” 13 I did that with the Superior police chief too. 8 We had ten people at our very first meeting. 9, 14, 18 The police, I’m getting calls all the time with them. 8, 16 The mayor said, “I think we need to do more than what we’re doing.” 5 He put me in touch with the police chief and he said, “There’s a group called the Opiate Advisory Response Strategy group, OARS group. 8 I will make it happen that you can be on that group.” 15 I joined them.  I do not have a formal education. 14, 15 I’m a high school graduate. 7 In Proctor High School I was the valedictorian of my class with a 2.7 grade point average. 5, 7, 14 Just kidding.  I always joke in Proctor it’s all about trains. 18 I got on that.  It’s a lot of doctors, very professional people. 9, 12, 14 We were meeting just to meet. 18 It was becoming a clearinghouse of information but nobody was doing anything. 6, 13 I got ahold of Maggie Kazel and a couple other people. 9, 11 We have all this talent, all this expertise in this room and we’re not doing anything with it. 14 We need to do more.  I started speaking more.  I started letting these people know that we have too many kids who are dying of overdoses. 9, 12 We’re doing a lot of talking but now it’s time to take this talk and go into action. 12 We started holding public meetings. 18, 19 I got everybody to break off into small groups. 12 We have committees on harm reduction, on support, treatment programs. 5, 12, 13, 14 Biggest thing we found in treatment is lack of access to treatment. 9, 12, 13 Five to seven-week window to try to get into treatment. 12, 13, 15 I got on all those committees.  I started pushing like hell to say this is not enough.  People listened.  We just put in a one point four million dollar grant to the Department of Human Services. 9, 12 We’re supposed to hear something by the end of May. 9 I’ve been meeting with the mayor. 5, 18 The mayor put the opioid epidemic as her first priority for the state of the city address this year. 5, 13, 14 She’s going to hold a summit.  I went down to the legislature and met with some people. 9 We’re all going to get together in one room with county commissioners, legislatures, the mayor, the police, treatment centers. 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 19 I’ve been pushing for these rapid response groups where if somebody overdoses we go in there with a rule twenty-five, we have a place for them to go, we have people from the recovery community to meet with them and say this is my story. 9, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19 We get them into a program where they stay overnight for a week or two weeks, get them on Suboxone or medically assisted treatment as soon as we can. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15 It’s a continuous thing.  The police chief just told me, “We’ve decided to adopt the Gloucester community model.” 8, 14, 16, 19 That’s in Massachusetts. 6, 13 “If people come to our precinct and say 9, 10 ‘We no longer want to do this. 17 Here’s our stuff, here’s our drugs.’ 5, 6 We will not arrest them.  We will bring them right into treatment and walk them through the steps so they are not alone.” 8, 12, 13, 16 Now they have Narcan being distributed everywhere.  I’m with the rescue squad.  VW: If there’s a car accident, if there’s a drowning, people are lost in the woods, if there’s an overdose, all that kind of stuff. 5, 9, 11, 13 A lot of the overdoses I get are people who are lost or committed suicide. 9, 11 AS: Do you have Narcan in there?  VW: We do not but we are getting it.  I have Narcan in the house. 6, 13 I keep it here.  I let all my neighbors know I have Narcan in the house. 6, 12, 13 That’s how I’ve gotten involved in this.  This is more involved than I wanted to get. 18 AS: You’re still on the committee.  VW: The committee gave me this award not long ago. 13, 17 It’s from the Public Health Department. 9, 12 It’s an achievement award. 12 The county gave me this about two weeks ago. 13, 15, 19 “This is for the work that you’ve done.”  I’m a volunteer.  That’s the nice part about being a volunteer. 9, 18 I can speak my mind and say what I want to say.  AS: You’re not at risk.  You’re not beholden to anyone.  You’re like the voice of the community. 17, 19 VW: That’s what they’re calling me. 16 AS: That’s really powerful, especially in this current crisis that we’re in. 10, 17, 18 They stay siloed, this task force idea is great. 8, 20 You can sit around and talk but if you don’t do anything there’s no point in meeting. 18 VW: The folks on the range called me up and they want to do the same thing, “Will you come up and meet with us?” 7, 12, 18 I don’t have any magic bullets on this thing.  I’m just trying to get people… 9 AS: You’re saying you don’t have the answers.  AS: You’re coming to it from a place of humility.  VW: If I had an answer I’d throw it out there.  All I’m saying is I believe in the twelve step programs.  I think medically assisted treatment has to have a finite end to it. 7, 12, 13, 14 We need to work addicts to a point where they go, “I’ve tapered off of it. 5, 14 Let’s stay involved in the twelve step community and let’s live a twelve step life.” 10, 19 Everybody kinds of cringes when I say this but I want to start a two year or a three-year treatment program where people can come to it and live there for two or three years and get stabilized. 9, 12, 13, 14 It was two years for my son to really get back to his old mental self. 12, 14, 18 He doesn’t remember half of the stuff that went on when we talk about it. 14 As parents you just don’t get it. 20 All you can think of is, “How in the world don’t you realize how bad this is for you?”  We talk about at our twelve step meetings about expectations and fears. 10, 18 Don’t have expectations, recognize that the addict can’t do that. 14, 17 If you have expectations you’re setting the addict up to fail, yourself up to fail. 14 All you’re doing honestly is putting more shame on the addict. 8, 10, 14 Then you’re mad, “Why are you doing this to me?  If you love me, you wouldn’t do this to me.” 14 I think that’s part of the important message that in NarAnon we get to talk about. 9 I try to share that when I do public speaking. 19 As a NarAnon person I say, “I’m a part of NarAnon but I’m not speaking tonight representing NarAnon.” 5, 9, 10 Same with this OARS group I’m a part of. 9 I say, “I’m a member of NarAnon but I do not represent NarAnon at this meeting. 5, 10, 18 Please know that. 12 I’m a volunteer.”  AS: The anonymity thing worked in the time period that it was developed. 18 There was a need for privacy and anonymity.  For some people there is a need for privacy but the anonymous part hasn’t really helped us understand addiction as a society. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 It’s only kept shame alive.  I think we are about to move into a new time. 15, 16 My experience as a mother of a teenager who was going off the rails that other parents didn’t want to talk to me. 18, 20 I felt ashamed. 11 I wanted to talk but parents of other troublemaker kids didn’t want to talk. 18, 20 They didn’t want to admit they weren’t in control or their kids were struggling too. 18 It was the most alienating thing.  I remember thinking “Why when they’re little babies we’ll talk about the color of their poop and when they’re teenagers we can’t talk about the social problems they’re having.” 12, 19, 20 How can I as another parent help you? 20 I’m talking about long before addiction came into my life. 10, 12, 14, 17 Just normal teenage acting out. 16 We don’t support each other in things we feel shame around.  VW: I look at how that reflects on the child. 14 When the child knows the family is shamed of them what does that do for the child’s self-esteem and self-worth? 12, 14 “I’m the black sheep of the family. 12 I’m the bad one. 8 They don’t even want to talk about me.”  I explained that to my son.  We talked about shame, we talked about the core beliefs of the addict. 14 “Drugs are my most important aid. 9 If people knew what I was like they wouldn’t like me. 9, 16 I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs.” 9, 18 Those are some of the core beliefs that addicts have to go through. 14 The major one is “I am basically a bad person. 8, 19 No matter how many times I have tried to stop my addiction I have not stopped. 12, 14 I have to be a bad person.  I have prayed about it.  I have gone to treatment about it. 12, 13 I have made promises to my mother, my father, my wife, my kids. 16, 20 I’ve responsibilities to my children, to my family. 5, 12, 14, 20 I have thrown them all away to take care of my addiction. 12, 14, 18, 19, 20 What an asshole of a person I am.”  That’s a terrible thing to live a life of that. 10, 11 That’s why it’s important that we have this public education and stop that stigma. 9, 14, 15, 19 Do you mind if I read this letter of this kid?  It kind of ties into this.  AS: You can tell a little bit about it. 20 VW: A NarAnon mom just lost her son. 11, 14 He took his own life because he was addicted to heroin and he couldn’t stop it. 10, 12, 14, 16 He was ashamed of his behavior.  He felt like a failure. 11, 14 This is an apology letter that he left his mother. 14 “Mom, Words can’t come into place for the way I’ve been feeling for a while now and I know you’re going to want to blame part of this on yourself because you gave me more money. 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18 This is the most peaceful way I could have done it.” 18 He put a hose from his exhaust pipe into his truck.  That’s how he died.  “It would have happened no matter what but this was the cleanest least sufferable. 15 You and Dad did an amazing job with what life threw at you and not a lot of people would have been able to handle it. 9, 10, 11 I love you Mom and thank you for being the best you could possibly be. 11, 14 Ok suicide by heroin didn’t work. 16 I know you’re wondering why I did this and I will tell you. 12, 15 Monday I went in to do one of my weekly eye scanners and ninety-nine percent of the time it says I’m clean and I most certainly am not clean. 8, 15, 16, 17 Obviously I started using again. 6 I’m pretty sure probation was going to work for me anymore. 10 I also needed to learn how to get clean off heroin on my own. 10, 16 Probation isn’t going to hold my hand for the rest of my life. 10 I found a way to stay off heroin though. 16, 18 I’ve been smoking weed. 6 To probation weed isn’t legal so there’s no possible way to overlook that. 18, 20 If you need to substitute drugs it needs to be Suboxone or methadone or destruxin which are no different than heroin. 5, 6, 16 They all get you high. 7 They all make you totally dependent on them and they all make you sick when you don’t use them every single day. 6, 13, 15, 16 That’s why most addicts are in court systems in the first place. 14 We get sick and we do anything to use again. 6, 13, 15 I can stop using weed for however long I want and I’m sure as shit I don’t get the least bit sick. 6, 15, 17, 18, 20 I don’t even nod off in public. 19 If for some reason I do need to increase my dosage the same thing happens if increased, nothing. 15 I’ve tried just about everything besides this. 9 I know you’re thinking prison would change me but not in the way anyone would want. 12, 18 Most importantly how I wouldn’t want. 9 I’ve met enough of Duluth’s finest in county and I’d rather not meet anymore. 11, 18, 19 Please don’t leave my body in the ground either. 18 I don’t mind if you have an open casket funeral but please cremate me.  I’ve always had the belief that if your body stays in the ground then so do you but if you’re cremated then you get free.” 18 That is tragic.  Thanks for sharing that. 18 VW: This epidemic is extremely powerful. 10, 13, 17 Those of us that it affects, it affects all of us.  It doesn’t matter if you’re a parent, it affects all of us. 20 AS: You can’t be in a room with more than fifteen people with someone who knows someone. 9, 12, 14 VW: I think of all the children that are in foster care because their parents are in addiction. 5, 12, 14, 19, 20 I think of all the problems those kids are going to have. 12 This is not something we can sit on and allow people to die. 9, 10 That’s pretty much why I’m here. 10 This is what got me involved with all this.  AS: Thank you.  It’s a really powerful story. 10, 15, 17, 18 VW: You’re welcome.  I didn’t say it but with my sexual addiction I had been clean and gotten into SAA and did all the stuff I did and was able to put all that behind me. 12, 14 Thank God for that.  AS: You know it can happen for addiction. 12, 14, 15 VW: I know people who have eating disorders, who have so many other kinds of addictions. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 I have been handing a gift, going through all this crap that I’ve gone through.  I have a lot of insights.  AS: Thank you.  [End of Interview] "
"26","Krause_Marisa","Mark Willenbring Parts 2 & 3 Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer June 14, 2017 St. Paul, Minnesota Mark Willenbring -MW Amy Sullivan -AS MW: Channel nine did a piece on all of this last year. 14 The reporter was totally on board with what I was talking about. 13 AS: He knew what you were talking about? 16 MW: He was on board with it.  The station required somebody else to give a different opinion. 5 The only guy he could find was this guy who works for Teen Challenge, completely uneducated, knows nothing. 9, 12, 14 He’s an ignoramus, an opinionated bullshiter. 18 That’s who I was compared with, my opinion against his. 5 That’s like Comey versus Trump.  AS: We’re in a huge moment for that right now. 8, 12, 14 MW: Post-truth, right? 12 Truth is what you want it to be.  The best thing I’ve ever seen was a poster at the March for Science. 6 The poster said, “If ninety seven percent of engineers said a bridge was unsafe and three percent said it was safe would you go over that bridge?”  I really like that. 18 The other poster that made me laugh, it’s completely off the topic, a woman holding up a sign that said, “I can’t believe I’m still holding up this fucking sign.” 11 AS: A couple things I wanted to ask. 11, 18 First, the last I heard about your family was with your… 9, 12 [Knock on the door and brief interruption] 19 AS: I’m wondering if you’re willing to talk about your family life. 10, 12, 15 You said your wife was pregnant and then I never heard. 7, 9, 10, 16, 20 Can you talk a little bit about your marriage, your children? 5, 14, 20 MW: It was really tough to leave San Francisco. 18 I ended up going to Madison, Wisconsin where I did an interdisciplinary social science research fellowship. 10, 19 I was very lucky in having two interdisciplinary experiences. 8, 18 One as a first year resident in psychiatry in Sacramento and certainly this one. 8, 9, 12, 14, 17 It always served me very, very well. 18 I really got a sense of the different perspectives and histories and traditions of different professions. 9, 18 In the first one I really got to understand the difference in nursing, social work, and psychiatry in terms of what the traditions are, what the worldviews are, how they approach things. 14, 17, 18, 19 Of course being a physician I think it’s all medicine. 12, 14 Everyone bristled at that.  That has served me very, very well ever since. 10 AS: What was the one in Madison again? 8 MW: Madison was the research fellowship. 10 It included an anthropologist, a lawyer, a psychologist, me. 13 I got a chance to really understand the more academic disciplines than the helping professions. 9, 17, 18, 20 That was very helpful to me. 9 Katie was eight months pregnant when we moved to Madison. 7, 10, 11, 15, 16 We had a waterbed at the time. 16 She knew she was ready to get rid of this baby when she couldn’t get out of the waterbed in the morning. 16 You can just imagine.  It was just ridiculous. 14 The balance was all off.  This was back in natural birth times.  We had the panting.  AS: Was she having the baby at home?  MW: Oh God no, I would never do that. 16 No babies at home.  I kept examining her.  I thought I could feel that the cervix was pretty dilated. 10, 17, 18 We were rushing in because we both thought it was eminent. 17, 18 It’s like 3:00 a.m.  There’s this big thunderstorm coming on.  There’s thunder and lightning.  It was very dramatic. 5 Finally we get to the hospital and somebody who knows what they’re doing examined her. 8, 12 It turned out her uterus was really tipped so her cervix was way back. 14, 18 You really couldn’t get to it really easily. 18 It turns out she was like two centimeters.  Then she had to learn how to push which was really interesting and very frustrating for her. 10, 17, 18 The normal Del Salvo maneuver to take a bowel movement, that doesn’t work. 12, 15, 16 It was interesting. 17 A week before that I had spilt hot water all over myself and I had second degree burns all over twenty percent of my body. 15, 16 The hospital was way overcrowded. 8, 18 She was in a hallway with a curtain around her. 18 She called and said, “I got to get out of here.”  I said, “You can’t come home yet.” 14 I went and got her.  We had our first child there. 14 AS: You went and got her before she had the baby?  AS: She wanted to come home after. 14, 18 She was still in the hallway? 18 MW: Yes, there weren’t any rooms. 14 AS: I thought you meant during her labor. 17, 18 MW: No, she was in a labor room then. 14 I went and got her and everything turned out fine. 11 Did you have a baby boy or baby girl? 7 MW: Baby boy, wonderful baby. 7, 18 Both our children had really severe asthma and ear infections when they were like zero. 5, 6, 14, 18, 20 Really sick all the time. 15 That started down there.  I mentioned to you that the plan had been to stay at Madison. 8, 12 The recession was still active and nobody was hiring which is how I ended up at the VA up here.  We moved up here. 7, 15 Jesse was two.  We bought a house. 6, 13 The interest rents were sixteen percent at the time.  We had motivated the sellers so they bought us down two points to fourteen percent.  On the other hand we paid seventy three thousand dollars for the house. 6, 13 That was an interesting time. 17 When we were in Sacramento it was the oil shock, the first Arab oil embargo. 12, 14 I started at the VA.  I mentioned before that I was the first person hired under this new initiative to make it an academic department. 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20 I was really on my own. 18 The only mentors I had did neuroendocrinology research so I did that for a few years. 12, 14 They took me under their wing.  I had this lithium grant which I mentioned. 8, 12 That got me started.  It’s amazing after I learn more about what happens in real academic institutions, I was in the boonies. 9, 10, 15, 20 I could have been in a state hospital in Alaska. 8 I was totally on my own, bootstrapping myself as a researcher.  Nowadays it’s so organized. 16 You join somebody’s lab, you’re doing a post doc at somebody’s lab for four years. 14 You’ve got ten, fifteen publications by the time you’re up for a faculty position. 19 On the good side you could still get grants then. 9, 10 The standard wasn’t as high. 7 These days MDs can’t get grants, an MD, PhD maybe. 5, 16 Meanwhile I was developing my ideas about chronic care management. 6, 12, 18, 19 I had several lines out trolling around and I got two big lunkers at once. 9 Either was too big.  It just about killed me, literally it almost killed me. 14 When I was an intern there was blood all over the place, we didn’t pay any attention to it back in those days. 16 MW: It was pre-AIDS. 10 I got Hepatitis C.  At that time it was not known what it was. 11, 12 It was non-A, non-B hepatitis.  Then it became chronic. 6 I had chronic Hepatitis C. 6 In retrospect I realize it had been more symptomatic than I realized.  The symptoms I had was when I had a virus it would hit me hard. 9 Meanwhile we’re getting up every night at two or three in the morning doing nebulizers for Jesse and wondering when to bring him into the ER, just awful. 11, 15 AS: Did he recover from that?  Our second one took much longer and had much more in the way of complications. 8, 17, 18 AS: A boy or a girl? 7 MW: Another boy. 7 That was four and a half years after Jesse. 14 So about two and a half years after we moved here we had another boy. 7, 14, 15 Jesse was the golden boy, still is. 7 Socially he’s gifted.  From the very beginning he could charm the birds out of trees, he’s still that way. 11, 18 He walks into a room and somebody will think, “Did somebody turn a light on?” 14, 16 He’s just got this posse around him all the time.  MW: He is an abstract painter, an artist. 6 He’s multi-talented.  He’s a designer, he can do branding; he’s multi-faceted. 11 He did our logo.  He invented a font for it.  He’s extremely talented.  This last spring he had a solo show in France, in Paris by one of the best known gallerists in Europe. 11, 12 AS: Where does he live?  His wife is an artist, she’s a filmmaker. 20 She’s a computer graphics expert.  She ran NBC’s graphics divisions for a number of years while they were in New York. 6, 14 Jesse finished his degree at Hunter College.  Hunter and Yale have traditionally competed for number one in painting. 6 He ended up with a wonderful mentor who took him under her wing and really launched him. 12, 18 It’s still a struggle as you might expect.  Both my children are artists. 5, 14, 20 I’ve told them both to marry well. 16 AS: Your youngest is an artist too?  MW: I don’t know what he’s going to end up doing. 12 He’s musically gifted and has been working very, very hard to make it in hip hop. 9 AS: What’s his name?  MW: Morgan, as a producer and hip hop DJ. 14 It’s such a difficult thing to do. 10 Morgan had extremely severe ear infections, sinusitis. 6 He had two sinus surgeries before the age of five.  By that time that had just invented the pediatric sinoscope.  He had a massive steroid exposure.  Severe ADD, I always knew he had it but it wasn’t clearly diagnosed until college or after high school. 7, 14, 16, 18 Then developed depression and by the age of eighteen was suicidal. 10 AS: Do you think that was the steroids?  MW: I don’t think there’s any question.  It turns out that any kind of major surgery before the age of five has major long term consequences. 6, 17 At any rate his development has been quite delayed. 11, 12 Not intellectually but emotionally.  He’s been very gradually working his way out of it. 18 Morgan’s the kind of guy where if you say, “Do X” he won’t do it for the life of him. 10 He’ll do it when he goddamn well pleases. 11 Developmentally it looks like there’s nothing happening for the longest time and all of the sudden he’ll come out with a big leap. 12, 15, 17 He started going to St. Paul College about three years ago and that’s really changed his life. 10, 13, 14, 18 AS: Does he live around here?  MW: He lives right downtown. 12 He started out in music business. 9 The business part was not a good idea; it should have just been music. 9, 10 What he really got turned on about was philosophy. 18 He took a feminist philosophy course and got really into that. 18 He took a philosophy of science course this year. 14 His teacher really took him on as a mentor. 12, 18 What’s he thinking about doing?  Majoring in philosophy with a minor in religion.  If you want to do anything besides drive an Uber. 5, 9 AS: What about your wife Katie? 20 MW: Katie’s an interesting person, very bright. 12, 17 She was a math major when she first went to college. 7, 14 She was bright enough but it wasn’t really her thing. 12, 18 A lot of family issues, very deep family issues. 12, 13 After we’d been here a number of years maybe seven or eight years I started getting seriously ill with my Hepatitis to the point where I was almost having to give up work. 5, 11, 14 AS: Was there any medicine for that? 12, 14 MW: At that point they didn’t even know what it was. 12 I had chronic fatigue syndrome. 5, 6 It’s basically symptoms we can’t explain. 19 It’s turning out to be real. 20 Back then it was just considered a Yuppie disease. 5, 9 It’s very real.  It’s just then that they characterized the virus.  The first treatment for it was Interferon. 12, 13, 14 Just around that time.  Now we know that I obviously had the good genotype of Hep C. 10, 12 Most people in the United States have type one which is much more difficult to treat, two and three are much easier to treat. 8, 9, 10 Obviously I had two or three.  I started Interferon treatment and bang my liver test went to normal and it’s been there ever since. 10, 12, 13, 16 I’m really lucky. 8, 18 Also at that time Katie’s sister became suicidal and moved in with us for a year. 7, 14, 15, 20 Then there was another woman who was being physically abused and she moved in with us with her two kids. 6, 7, 13, 15, 16 It’s life right? 10, 12 Katie had to stop working with Morgan.  Somebody had to be available to pick him up from school when he started... 7 Very, very challenging number of years. 14 Then we had some really nice time. 18 Katie had a ski accident at Afton Alps and smashed her tibia. 13 She ran into snowmaking pipes. 10, 12 Smashed her tibia, what the knee sits on, a very serious fracture. 11 It was knit together surprisingly well with the surgeon. 8 It was a lengthy time to get better.  That really changed our lives in so many ways. 13, 18 We were all active as a family with skiing, waterskiing, hiking. 12, 16 All of a sudden Katie couldn’t do those things.  It really created a huge strain in our lives especially because I was still so into those things. 18 I would go skiing with the boys. 7, 11 Jesse after he finished high school did a year of being a snowboard bum in Colorado. 7, 12, 14 I would take Morgan out there.  Katie really couldn’t ski. 18 She felt left behind a lot. 11, 14 I got into bicycling.  She wasn’t comfortable with that.  Life happens. 15 AS: Are your kids in their thirties?  MW: They’re about to be thirty-five and thirty-one.  AS: Thanks that helps.  There were a few things that I thought that it seemed like you wanted to touch on at the end. 6, 17, 18 The importance of language around addiction, these seem to be things that are important to how you’ve come to see chemical use disorder. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 Language, the chronic illness model, and then evidence based model. 6, 12, 13 I don’t know if there is more about those things? 12 MW: My model is health care. 19 I’m not that different than a cardiologist.  I treat a different organ.  AS: To rephrase that would it be normalizing the way we treat this particular chronic illness. 6, 9, 12, 16, 18 Do you think we can do that?  MW: My ultimate goal is to mainstream addiction treatment into health care. 12, 13, 14, 19 Firstly it’s the only way that makes sense; it’s the only way we’ll get integrated treatment. 12, 13, 18 It’s the only way we’ll get treatment to the vast number of people who need it, if you’ve got twenty million people with alcohol use disorder. 6, 9, 12, 13, 18 The future for substance use treatment for opiate and alcohol use disorders and smoking we already have the tools and the knowledge for the people who get treatment in primary care. 6, 9, 12, 13, 19 AS: They can’t get it in primary care can they? 19 Because of the DEA and the restrictions.  MW: That’s got nothing to do with it.  It has to do primarily with the fact that rehab in this country was developed very self-consciously to keep doctors at a distance. 12, 14, 19 AS: When I was thinking about mainstreaming it and getting it in primary care doctors don’t have the tools that they need or they haven’t been trained. 12, 14, 19 MW: They don’t know anything. 12 They’re not expected to know anything. 12 AS: Would you say that’s because of the way the treatment model has developed in the U.S.? 12, 13, 18 MW: Referred to rehab. 5 AS: So they’ve been siloed from each other.  MW: Totally.  Doctors haven’t really wanted to deal with addiction medicine. 12, 14, 18 MW: To say the least.  They’re not looking for anything else to do.  AS: But if a new disease came about? 16 MW: They’d resist that too.  Specialists would have to do it for a long time before you’d get it in primary care. 17, 19 That’s the other thing, specialists.  There’s no out-patient specialty care. 19 That’s what Alltyr provides.  Primary care doctors are on their own. 12, 14, 19 If there’s one thing a primary care doctor is not, it’s a risk taker. 12, 14, 19 They provide very well-established standards of care. 19 They don’t experiments. 12 They’re not on the forefront of anything except for coordinating care of family based care. 12, 13, 14, 19 That’s all done with specialists.  One of the biggest problems is even for somebody who wants to do this they’re not going to become addiction specialist doctors. 12, 14 If they’re not going to become a specialist then who do they call if something with a patient goes south?  A counselor with a GED preaching at AA for a month? 10, 16 Without the back up of specialists…  AS: Without the primary care doctor having an addiction specialist to call on they’re not going to want those patients. 12, 14, 19 Just like we do with cardiology or endocrinology or psychiatry. 14 They treat depression and anxiety and diabetes. 10 They treat heart disease. 9 They’ll only treat it to a certain depth of complexity. 13, 17 It used to be in rural areas where you only had the hometown doc they were on their own so much they said there’s no one else around. 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, 20 This guy needs this type of surgery.  They’d look it up in the textbooks and try to figure out how to do this.  Those days are long gone. 8, 11, 16, 17 These days most doctors practice in big cities or large multispecialty clinics or they’re part of a big network. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16 Allina has a clinic out in Buffalo but it’s tied in with the Allina network.  They could send you in here for surgery or if you have multiple sclerosis and need a neurologist or whatever. 17 Primary care doctors are now all practicing in areas where there’s a low bar for referring to a specialist. 8, 10, 12, 14, 19, 20 AS: You said last time that Alltyr is a demonstration clinic.  Do you want to talk about how you came up with this idea and went to all this trouble to create this beautiful space?  MW: The programs I’ve developed in other places, the VA in particular but also my own practice with Allina, it’s health care. 9, 19 The model is health care. 19 That includes psychiatry.  I don’t separate out mental health care form general medicine. 12, 14, 19 It’s all connected.  It’s very interesting as we find out more and more about how important the gut is and the microbiome is to psychiatric illnesses. 9, 12, 17 That’s going to just be explosive so to speak.  When I was at NIH I finally got it about the mind body issue. 13 AS: Remind me when you were at NIH.  I finally got that there’s only one thing happening. 15 When something happens with a living organism there’s only one thing that happens but it happens at multiple levels all at once. 15, 17 It’s not linear. 9 AS: Give me an example.  MW: An example is somebody will say, “It’s really genetic.” 18 Or they’ll say, “It’s a brain disease. 13 It’s a derangement of the brain.” 7, 12, 13 That’s called reductionism. 5, 14 You can be any kind of a reductionist. 5, 14 Have you watched the Nobel stuff? 17 AS: What Nobel stuff?  MW: There was a Nobel Conference two years ago. 13, 14 Every year at Gustavus Adolphus has a Nobel Conference at the same time the Nobel Awards are being announced, maybe the same time as the awards ceremony in Sweden. 5, 9, 14 There was one on addiction. 12, 14 If you just go to the Gustavus site they record everything in it, very high quality video. 7, 18 I was invited to be a part of that. 9 The three primary speakers were a biological reductionist, a sociological reductionist, and a psychological reductionist. 5, 14, 19 Myself and the other clinician who were involved, he’s a psychologist, were the only ones trying to integrate that stuff. 8 Each of them was arguing, “It’s only this level of analysis that’s important not these other levels.” 9 Well that’s bullshit. 18 There’s only one thing.  Something happens, right now I’m talking and you’re nodding your head. 12, 14, 15 What’s happening within each of and between us and around us is happening at a genetic, genomic, sub cellular, inter cellular, intra cellular, subsystem, organ, inter organ, individual, psychological, social level. 15, 19 It’s all happening at once. 15 Complex systems aren’t linear. 9 They don’t happen as this happens and then that happens. 15 It’s constant, extremely rapid conversation between layers. 14 One of the biggest challenges across health care is modelling across scale. 19 When I was at NIH I changed the direction of research in treatment. 12, 13, 18 I said, “Fact is we don’t know anything about drinking. 5, 11, 12 Nobody measures anything about drinking.” 5, 11 MW: They don’t measure it.  Only a couple of people measure it. 9, 11 How much people drink? 5, 9 At what time?  What they drink? 5 AS: You mean in a scientific study.  MW: How do you model the different patterns of drinking in people who drink a little, drink a lot? 5, 9, 11, 20 Only a couple people. 9, 11 It’s all been focused on alcoholism. 6, 13, 15, 16 It’s all been distorted by rehab and AA.  AS: And this disease model.  MW: I would call that the pneumonia disease model.  The pneumonia disease model is you get a highly specific disease, it’s acute, you go to the hospital, you treat it, you’re cured, you’re discharged. 5, 7, 8 AS: That’s what we’re doing in the treatment world. 12, 13 MW: It’s not chronic. 6 We don’t just call addiction ‘disease’; we treat it as one. 12, 14 It’s important to understand the meaning of chronic. 6, 9, 17, 18 Chronic often means three months. 11, 16 It doesn’t mean decades. 14 It doesn’t have to mean that.  Chronic pain is after three months. 6, 11, 16 When people hear chronic they think decades or year. 6, 9, 14 Most people have an episode of alcohol use disorder, a single episode typically lasting a few years and then it goes away and never comes back. 6, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 That’s like eighty plus percent.  We’re only focused on the sickest ten percent. 6, 13, 15, 16 AS: And to say that it’s forever.  MW: Those who have that kind of thing typically have five or more episodes. 18 They have recurrences but not everybody does.  Three years is considered chronic in the health care world even if you get complete remission and it never comes back. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16, 19 Even though the typically episode last three or four years it’s still considered chronic. 5, 6, 9, 14, 18 I like asthma as an analogous disease, not diabetes or hypertension. 10 Substance use isn’t like that. 6, 13 Most people get well. 9 Diabetics don’t get well typically. 18 People with heart disease don’t get well. 9 All we’re doing is slowing the rate of deterioration. 10 AS: But asthmatics can and do.  MW: Exactly.  There’s this wide range of severity. 7 The same thing with substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder. 6, 13 Not all chronic addiction, there’s a lot more people than you might think who use heroin for a few weeks and then stop. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Or they use it once a month for years and never get addicted. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 Nobody ever wants to talk about that.  It’s this horrible thing where you inject it once and you’re a slave for life. 10 Same with meth, cocaine, ecstasy. 6, 16 It’s a small minority of cannabis users, even daily cannabis users who you would consider to have a disorder like nine percent lifetime will develop a disorder. 6, 9, 10, 13 AS: Remind me what the percentage is of other things?  MW: With smoking it’s like sixty five percent become addicted. 6, 12, 14 With alcohol it’s more like thirty percent or forty percent. 6 Opiates it depends what you mean by everyday users, using recreationally or not. 6, 13, 15, 16 It’s actually quite low in terms of somebody who uses it once and then never uses it again. 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17 There’s a lot of people like that. 9 AS: I do remember seeing it’s less. 6 MW: Less than alcohol. 6 AS: Back to you’re at the NIH.  MW: Up to that time we mostly had horserace studies, my treatment’s better than yours. 12, 13 Basically the initial thing is my treatment’s better than usual, TAU, treatment as usual. 12, 13 In substance abuse that’s really no treatment. 6, 12, 13, 18 Well-trained people with advanced degrees who really strongly believe in what they’re doing are they going to do better than a counselor with a GED telling his own story? 9, 15, 18 What a shocker.  The end result was what’s called a dodo bird effect. 6 The dodo bird in Alice in Wonderland declared a race. 5, 14 [Knock on door and brief interruption] 19 MW: She’s on state insurance and it changed and she didn’t know there was going to be the need. 12, 13 She’s frantically calling us. 16 Friday afternoon 16 I’m submitting the prior authorization to her old insurance because that’s what the pharmacy said she had.  Then I find out she wasn’t covered by them anymore. 5, 14 I called them.  This is hours I’m spending uncompensated. 10, 15 Then I called the patient and said, “They said you’re not covered by this.” 5 I call her back on Monday. 16 Meanwhile she runs out of medicine on Sunday. 8, 12, 14, 16 Now she’s in withdrawal. 5 She’s at serious risk of recurrence. 11 She’s on Minnesota state insurance.  They’re putting us through these hoops.  We submit a prior authorization and it’s denied.  AS: Has she been on the state insurance this whole time?  MW: It was a different administrator of Medicaid. 14 She’d been on Medicaid this whole time. 14 AS: Nothing has really changed for her medical needs. 7, 13, 14, 18 MW: Or even her insurance.  It’s just who’s administering it.  We get a denial back late yesterday. 16 I call them to find out and I find out.  There’s nothing on their box to check.  “You didn’t say these things.”  I faxed over a letter, late afternoon yesterday from home, with that information which was really stupid. 16, 18 They come back now and they say, “You didn’t submit the right forms.” 12 AS: Meanwhile she is in crisis.  MW: I’ve had people relapse to heroin use because of prior authorization shit. 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 It’s an atrocity.  AS: Is that particular to Suboxone? 8, 9 MW: No, with Suboxone it’s so dire. 8 Then they’re in this double bind.  They can’t pay cash by law because they’re covered under state insurance. 5, 13 They can’t even buy it.  AS: Or they’re forced to go look for it on the street. 8 MW: They can’t legally buy it.  I wanted to get to some things. 18 The dodo bird effect.  The dodo bird declares a race, everybody rushes around. 14 Then they’re waiting for a result and he says, “All have won and all must have prizes.” 6, 15 With psychotherapy research all have won and all must have prizes. 12 Basically speaking whenever you compare different therapy approaches, there are some notable exceptions, but for the most part we know therapy has a powerful effect, but we don’t know how it works. 9, 10, 12, 16, 17 All the stuff we think about how it works isn’t how it works. 9 You can have people with completely different theoretical backgrounds, different techniques, same result for all different types of conditions. 6, 9 I said, “We don’t need any more horserace studies.  We don’t need anyone taking a manual off the shelf, tweaking it a bit and saying ‘I’m going to see if it works for one legged Puerto Rican woman sex workers.’” 6, 9, 11, 12, 19, 20 We don’t need any more studies like that.  We don’t understand how people change. 9, 17, 18 It turns out when you look at it more carefully, in fact, change happens before people enter a treatment or a study. 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19 Entering treatment or a study is a result of change. 6, 12, 13 That was a revelation, all these extremely bright people that was a revelation. 9, 12 What’s causing change? 6 We don’t have a goddamn clue because nobody’s been looking at it. 11 Everybody’s looking at what we’re doing not what’s happening. 15 It’s still happening. 15 I started this whole thing about the basic science of behavior change because we don’t know anything about it. 12 We decided to look at three levels neurobiological, psychological or experiential, phenomenological and immediate social. 12, 14, 19 It’s the thirty people who really influence us. 9, 18 It turns out to be astonishingly difficult. 10 We started working with mathematicians because there’s been this big revolution in mathematical modeling.  One of the mathematicians that I got to know the best had been working most of his career on modelling the beginning of the universe. 11, 12, 15, 19 After being involved on this other project for a while he said, “This is way more complicated.” 5, 18 AS: What was his name?  MW: I don’t remember but I can find out.  AS: Do you have some work from that time at the NIH that I can look at?  MW: No, I don’t really. 18 It’s one of those papers I haven’t written.  I’ve never written enough. 16 I get too involved in doing...I wish I did.  It ended up becoming an NIH wide initiative on mechanisms of behavioral change, from the little tiny NIAAA. 15, 20 AS: What’s NIAAA?  MW: The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. 6, 13 AS: We’re talking about Alltyr and how you came to start this.  MW: Basically, I didn’t want to do this.  It was a calling. 16 I didn’t want to do addiction. 12, 14 That was fate.  To quote the Romans, “For those who are willing the fates will lead.  The rest will drag along.” 5, 17 I chose to be led.  Although sometimes it felt like I was being dragged. 5, 11 AS: But you’ve kept your passion about it and your thinking about it is very different from the doing you were just talking about.  MW: I have always been an academic. 18, 20 AS: But it’s the doing that is challenging and questioning the model for the benefit of the patient? 15 MW: Nobody else had done this and somebody had to try to change the system.  When I came back here I decided… 14 MW: Essentially 2010. 5 At that time we started to develop ideas about how we’re going to do this. 18 It took us two years to put the corporate structure together. 8, 14, 15 Essentially my strategy was the first thing that needs to happen is you need a demonstration model that answers the question: if not rehab, then what? 5, 14, 15 It needs to be in the flesh, something people can experience. 9, 18 It needs to be a place where you can provide proof of concept.  Where you can show that it’s much more effective, much more cost effective.  It costs much less; it provides far superior outcomes at a fraction of the cost. 16 Not only that but people with milder forms of the disorder will find it acceptable or attractive to come to this. 9, 12, 13 They’re not going to go to rehab.  Nobody goes if they’re not forced to. 8 They can’t sell their product; nobody’s going to buy it. 14 The whole system is dependent on people being coerced to buy it. 9 AS: Just off topic a little bit. 20 I understand you don’t deal with insurance but you were just talking about dealing with state. 17, 18 Can you explain your philosophy around insurance?  MW: What’s not covered for people who come here are the professional fees. 5, 9 What they pay us.  All their medications, procedures that’s all covered. 5, 14 AS: Therapy, talk therapy… 12 MW: If it’s here it’s not covered. 5 That’s a professional service. 19 AS: How competitive are your rates?  Have you had any problems with people? 9, 12 MW: People on Medicaid, except for Suboxone patients, most people on Medicaid can’t do it. 9, 14 Then again no one can treat someone on Medicaid with insurance on an out-patient basis unless you’re part of a greater health care system. 8, 9, 14, 19, 20 With every visit you lose money and not a small amount. 8, 9, 10 That’s why in rehabs they have groups of twelve people. 9, 12 That’s the only way you can make it. 18 They’re only paying their counselors eighteen thousand dollars a year anyways. 14, 17, 18 The turnover rate is fifty percent a year. 14 AS: But you’re using a group model to keep your costs down… 6 MW: I’m talking about patient groups. 12 They call it group therapy but it’s not. 12 Almost all of treatment here is done individually. 12, 13 We have an option of a suboxone medication group. 14 This is a med check in a group.  It keeps our costs down, it keeps their costs down. 15 Let me say this in terms of affordability, I am the cheapest act in town for Suboxone by a factor of three. 8, 17 I’m not in to gouging heroin addicts. 14 For an individual appointment with a UA to see me is two hundred and five dollars. 6, 12 I charge much less than Allina.  But you can’t get Suboxone there.  Most Suboxone doctors are three hundred to five hundred dollars a month. 8, 12, 14, 16 Just for a prescription and it’s a monthly visit. 10, 16 Here if you’re stable for a year you can go to every other month. 12, 14, 16 If you’re stable for two years you can go to every three months. 11, 12, 14, 16 For the group it’s one hundred and forty five dollars.  I have people who are on minimum wage who are counting out their pennies. 9 It’s cheaper than using heroin. 6, 16 In terms of overall treatment, on average the first year of treatment here completely integrated mental health and substance use treatment for a year is about three grand. 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19 Other place people are shelling out sixty grand for a month of bullshit. 9, 16, 18 Half the people pay less than that. 9 At their last treatment progress note people with alcohol use disorder, eighty percent were at their goal or had made substantial progress toward it. 6, 9, 12, 13 AS: After how long? 17 MW: After their treatment. 12, 13 AS: What are your plans with this demonstration clinic?  MW: We’re talking right now to two different potential partners. 6, 9, 12 The goal has always been to grow. 10, 18 It’s never been to have a clinic locally or regionally. 16 I’m involved in a different company that is going to be providing treatment for mild to moderate alcohol use disorder among employed people, completely remotely and directly to the patient mainly using smartphones and tablets. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 There is some face to face interaction. 18 We’ll be prescribing medication. 10, 14 We’re talking about a company that has already raised five million bucks. 14 It has the potential to completely revolutionize how everybody thinks about alcohol use disorder. 6, 13, 17 We just enrolled our first pilot patient. 14 We’re only six months in. 11, 16 It’s amazing to see. 6, 9 AS: People would check in on their phone? 8, 16 MW: There’s a coach, there’s a therapist, and then there’s a physician for prescribing medication. 10, 14 It’s only for mild to moderate, relatively stable employed people. 9, 12 This is being sold directly to companies or health care companies. 10, 18, 19 We’ll see what happens but the goal is a billion dollar company. 6, 14, 15 Big investors don’t invest in anything less than a billion dollar company. 14 I’ve learned that. 10 One problem for us is you can’t scale it like a tech based company. 12, 13, 14 A billion dollars or times ten in five is the way venture capitalists think. 18 That’s pretty hard to achieve with something like this model. 9, 10 It’s clinical care. 19 It’s not just an app.  You’ve got to have a place.  Alltyr treats across the board.  We’re kind of complimentary. 12, 14 There’s a lot of stuff happening online in terms of medical care and therapy. 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19 You can get a nurse consultation online about a sore throat, or a UTI, whatever it is and get prescribed medicine and never see anybody. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 There’s Teladoc, there’s all this stuff. 14 That doesn’t mean when you’ve got appendicitis that you don’t need a surgeon in a hospital. 8 That’s what I’m talking about.  Alltyr is already to a limited degree using telephone and internet visits. 6, 8, 16 We want to capitalize more on that.  AS: Have you thought about training other addiction medicine physicians? 12, 14, 17, 18 MW: There’s two companies. 10 There’s Alltyr Incorporated which is a C-Corp that could function in all fifty states. 9 Then Alltyr Clinic is a specific professional organization that operates under Minnesota law, the medical practice act. 7, 13, 14 Every state regulates medical practices differently. 7, 14 Alltyr Clinic Minnesota is a Minnesota specific organization.  It functions in a specific way regulated by that act. 9, 18 Alltyr Inc. will be the vehicle for spread. 10 Spread includes many different possible ways. 10, 18 One is simply making Alltyr more available, that would be more sites. 10 Right now my thought is to start with regional hubs in large cities but then use Telehealth a lot to get a pretty big region from each hub. 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 People can come to the hub if they need to face to face care but you can leverage that with a lot of Telehealth. 19 There should be a lot of people who don’t even need to come to the hub. 9, 14 It depends on the state if it has to be in person or not. 15 It also depends on the situation. 15 If someone is pretty complicated and unstable I’m not going to do that via Telehealth. 10, 12, 19 We also would like to market directly to other physicians. 5, 18 We can do consultations with physicians.  We can consult with existing health care organizations to help them figure out what their needs are according to their population. 19 These are the numbers of people we would expect to have x substance use disorder. 6, 9, 13 This is where we think they’re located according to your geographic area. 8 This is what we think it would cost.  These are the kind of staff you need.  Let’s say we do that with Health Partners.  If they say we want to do this they have to make the decision if they want to build it or buy it. 14 We could either help them build it by providing training or supervision or they could buy it. 16 We could become a vendor either that they just refer people to or much better would be we hire and train staff that would be placed in their facility. 9 They would operate staff for that organization but we would be hiring them and supervising them. 16 They would pay us x amount per year or per patient or whatever. 14 Those are all possibilities.  There’s other approaches, approaching large self-insured companies who provide substance abuse treatment to all their employees. 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14 This other company, it’s called Annum, I’ve already talked to them about Alltyr being a kind of complement. 12, 14 Annum you need local resources for complicated patients.  We need Alltyr there.  That’s kind of the idea.  I’m talking to a very large organization that invests in Alltyr.  They want to move it into behavioral health. 15, 19 They’re based on the East Coast, a very interesting model. 13, 17 It’s called buy out and hold.  The strategy of the company has been to buy relatively new startups that are doing well, buy a majority stake but not completely liquidate the ownership because they want to keep on the current management because that’s what they’re buying. 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 They can infuse all kinds of growth capital. 6, 10, 13 AS: What’s the hold part? 9 MW: Just staying with it. 7 Not a flip.  The owner is a single shareholder, hasn’t sold a company in forty years. 14, 20 His approach is if I get ten percent profit from each of my sixty some companies every year, okay. 10, 14, 15 The other one is a completely different thing. 8 It’s a Hollywood producer who has a personal interest in this. 14 He came here just because he wanted to talk about it and then decided he wants one of these. 14, 18 “We’ve got to have one in LA.  My friends and I talk about this. 16, 20 Where would we refer a loved one? 8, 14 There is no place.”  We’ve had discussions with other investors through the years. 14 AS: When did you start this?  MW: I think we were incorporated in 2012.  I think I started seeing patients in 2013. 6 AS: I have a little question. 20 How did you meet Paula DeSanto? 18 I interviewed her.  She kept saying, “Call Mark.”  MW: She was at a meeting that I was asked to speak to when I was still with NIAAA. 18 I think I had come back from NIAAA then.  I gave an all day workshop. 9, 15, 16 One of the things she’ll talk about is she kept saying, “He said what?  He really said that?” 18 She sent me an email and I said, “Let’s get together for breakfast.” 5, 8 Anything else?  Can I call you again if I need to?  MW: You can call me again.  I get you that blurb about neurobiology?  About why we use methadone. 6, 13 What’s today? 16 Tuesday. 16 We’ve got to get out of here.  [Break in Recording]  MW: Addiction develops as a result of exposure of the brain to a drug. 5, 6, 13, 14 People are not born addictive; they are born vulnerable to it. 14 What makes them vulnerable?  Well in the case of alcohol and opioids we know there are four specific risk factors. 6, 12, 13, 17 First of all you have to like how you feel on that drug. 5, 6 That’s genetically determined. 17 When I take an opioid I feel nauseous, itchy, constipated, bloated. 6, 13 I don’t like it.  I would never take it for fun. 16 When you talk to somebody who’s addicted to heroin I always ask them, “Tell me the first time you ever took an opioid. 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 How did it feel?”  They say, “I loved it. 14 I felt normal. 11, 16 I felt great.” 11, 20 Same with alcohol. 6 Some people like it, some people have half a glass of wine and have a headache. 9, 11, 14 You have to like.  You have to be able to develop tolerance fairly rapidly. 9 People with mild and moderate alcohol use disorder typically peak out between five and ten drinks a day. 5, 6, 13, 16, 18 If they try to drink above that they will fall asleep. 5, 16 They have a medium vulnerability.  The people with the really severe multi-generational early onset really severe AUD they could drink a liter a day, a one point seven five liter in a day. 5, 6, 9, 16, 18 I couldn’t develop that kind of tolerance no matter how hard I tried. 9 That’s genetic.  The third thing is, especially in the beginning, a relative absence of adverse effects while taking it. 11 Again, people become addicted to opioids when they don’t get itchy, they don’t get constipated, they don’t get nauseous. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 Same with alcohol. 6 First of all because of the tolerance when everybody else is throwing up or passed out they’re going, “Hey, where’s the party? 9, 20 Where’d you guys all go?”  The next day when everybody is worshipping the porcelain throne they’re just up with no hangover. 16 “Let’s do it again.”  That’s genetic.  The fourth thing is a very interesting thing. 5, 17 It’s feeling stimulated rather than sleepy when you start taking the drug. 5, 6, 11, 15, 16 People who develop alcohol use disorder when they first start drinking it clears their head. 5, 6, 11, 13, 14 It clears their head. 14 They get more energy, they feel refreshed.  They get things done.  They clean their house. 6, 13 They do all sorts of things.  Same with opioids. 6, 13 They feel stimulated.  They’re no longer depressed. 10, 17 With opioids in particular since we have an endogenous opioid system, which is why these drugs work on us. 5, 6, 9, 13 We don’t have opioid receptors because we were going to invent Percocet someday. 13, 16 That’s our pleasure system.  It’s essential for well-being and function. 5, 9 It’s very likely to assume that with any genetic trait there’s some distribution across the population at birth with endogenous opiate function. 9 They’re people who are always on the high end of the spectrum. 7, 9, 18 They’re always in a good mood. 10, 18 Nothing phases them.  They have a high pain tolerance. 6, 7 Most people are in the middle. 7, 9 Then there are people who are on the low tail of the spectrum. 9, 10 This is speculative but it makes sense.  They never feel good since childhood. 10, 14, 16, 20 They’ve never felt good. 10, 11, 16 They’ve never been a high energy person. 7, 16 They’ve always felt a little irritable. 11, 18, 20 It typically gets misdiagnosed as depression but anti-depressants don’t work of course. 10, 18 Although we’ve known for a very long time that opioids sometimes have anti-depressant efficacy. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 Buprenorphine is being examined now as a treatment for treatment resistant depression. 10, 12, 13 Methadone we’ve known for a very long time. 11, 12, 17 AS: That methadone helps with depression? 10 MW: Yes, in some people. 9 But which people? 9 It’s reasonable to speculate that there’s going to be these people whose internal opiate system is not functioning all that well since birth. 9 They take an opioid, bang they’re normal. 13, 16 Another way to think about it is it could happen secondarily. 15, 18 Especially to a genetically vulnerable person, after using endogenous opioids for so long their internal system gets repressed. 6, 10, 13, 17 AS: That’s what’s written about more.  MW: I’m going to be writing about this more.  A lot of people may have started that way. 9, 18 It may not be secondary to use, it may be primary and it may be why they got addicted. 6, 12, 13, 14, 19 The best to think of it is biological systems operate on set points around which there’s an optimal range. 7 There’s all these feedback mechanisms.  Temperature, a tiny range. 7 Blood pressure, blood sugar, blood calcium, thyroid level, mood not too high not too low. 7, 10, 14 Thinking, creative but not psychotic.  Fear, appropriate but not too much or too little. 20 Weight, body weight is a good example. 10 It’s reasonable to believe that the opioidergic system operates around a set point. 13 In the case of opioids whether it happens secondarily or starts that way when it’s suppressed for long enough you end up with a lower set point, a suboptimal set point. 6, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 Set point, here is the analogy I use to explain to my patients. 6, 13 It’s like a thermostat.  Temperature goes up you get air conditioning if it goes down you get heat.  Let’s say it’s set at seventy and you’re doing fine. 11 Because of global warming in Minnesota you have freak weather and you have seventy five degrees every day for five years. 14, 16 Then you get an ice age.  While it’s seventy five you never need to use the heat so the thermostat gets reset to fifty. 6, 13, 16 Then you get the ice age.  You go and you try to get the thermostat but it’s stuck at fifty and it won’t change anymore.  It’s reset.  It’s a new set point. 16 Fifty won’t kill you but it’s really miserable. 18 You burn up all your firewood trying to get the heat up in the house. 6, 13 Then you’ve got some extra lumber you burn.  You chop down all the trees in your yard.  Then you go out and you’re buying everything because you don’t have any money. 8, 10 You’re buying up wood and coal and whatever the hell you can buy to burn in your fireplace. 14 Then you’re stealing it.  You’re going out at night and stealing firewood and chopping down trees. 14 It occupies all of your time.  All you can think about it getting warm.  That’s active opiate addiction. 12, 14 What buprenorphine and methadone are are replacement therapies. 10, 12 They normalize the system. 16 It’s installing another furnace so you can get the temperature up to seventy again.  Once you’re at seventy you never think of it. 16 It never occurs to you. 16 That’s what happens. 15 With set points that’s permanent.  That doesn’t recover.  AS: In the brain? 13 MW: Anywhere.  Dieting causes obesity. 6, 13 It does that because every time you diet, aka starve, your body has all these mechanisms to prevent weight loss but one of the effects is the body weight set point goes up. 10 You not only gain all the weight back but more.  Every time you diet your weight goes up.  It doesn’t change.  That’s the thing about set points.  Once you’re diabetic it doesn’t usually come back to normal. 16 The thing about the brain is it’s just a different organ. 13 AS: Thank you so much.  [End of Recording] "
"27","Lang_Wade","Mark Willenbring Narrator Amy Sullivan Interviewer May 17, 2017 Alltyr Clinic St. Paul, Minnesota Mark Willenbring -MW Amy Sullivan -AS AS: What I have to start with first is you giving me permission. 14 MW: My name is Mark Willenbring and I give permission to Dr. Amy Sullivan to use this material in her book and her project. 5, 6, 13 AS: We are in the Alltyr Clinic in downtown St. Paul conducting this interview. 14 You were saying you’ve been in this field since the 1980s.  I want to back up and find out where you were born. 14 Tell me a little bit about your family. 12, 20 MW: I was actually born on the Iron Range in Virginia. 7, 14 AS: Virginia, Minnesota.  MW: Virginia, Minnesota:  the queen city in the Iron Range.  AS: Is that what they call it?  MW: Yes.  AS: When were you born? 14 At that time in particular it was a very unique place. 9 It was very ethnically diverse.  In Minnesota diversity means a Swede and a Norwegian.  AS: And religions, a Catholic and a Lutheran.  MW: Maybe Jewish.  The way Northern Minnesota developed was it started with the logging industry. 18 When they’d gone through all the original timber they found high quality iron ore on the Iron Range. 7 Mining became the big new industry. 16 Starting with the logging industry the companies would bring in men from primarily Sweden and Finland to work there. 9, 10, 12 They had a similar climate.  A lot of Scandinavians, Germans, Italians.  At that time that was ethnically diverse.  It was a radical place because with the mining industry there were epic labor battles in the 1930s. 14 The steel companies brought in the Pinkertons, the union formed and was very strong. 10 There were bombings, killings, beatings.  The whole thing.  The place up there became very radicalized. 14 There was actually a neighborhood in Little Virginia which at that time had a population of about 12,000. 7, 20 There was a neighborhood called Finntown. 14, 20 It was probably four square blocks.  The president of the American Communist Party, Gus Hall, was born in Finntown. 9, 10, 14 There were a lot of communists up there in the 30s and a lot of wobblies.  AS: You are a history buff, aren’t you? 15 MW: A little bit. 20 I’m very political so that’s part of it. 9 That was really the core of the DFL Party. 18 It was very heavily Democratic. 16 The unions prevailed eventually. 5, 10 Because they did they were paid well.  These were high paying jobs. 7, 11, 14 That was all across the Mesabi Range ranging from Virginia through Grand Rapids and Hibbing.  There was another vein called the Vermillion, there was a smaller one as well. 8 Then in the late 40s the high-grade ore ran out just like the lumber had. 5, 7 Because it was so focused on natural resources it’s always been a boom and bust economy up there. 6, 13, 15, 16, 18 When I was born it went into a deep recession. 14 It was Depression Era; it was twenty five percent unemployment. 10, 12 The place was devastated.  Mines were shutting down.  That was before I could remember.  AS: Did your family work in the mines? 12 I was a very atypical ranger. 7 If I was a typical ranger my dad would have worked in the mine or for a mining company. 7, 14 I probably would have too.  My father’s family emigrated from Germany. 12, 16 Most of them settled in the St. Cloud, Stearns County area. 8 That’s one of the only places I know where everybody knows how to spell Willenbring. 12 It sounds just like it’s place but it gets murdered in many ways. 5, 18 The best one is Willburding or Will M. Bring. 8 His father moved from the St. Cloud area to homestead a farm outside of Minot, North Dakota. 7, 8, 15, 16 He grew up in North Dakota in a tiny town on the prairie. 20 His mother died when he was nine.  It was a big family. 12 His father married a nineteen or twenty-year-old. 7, 16 His eldest daughters were sixteen and seventeen.  The priest in Foxhome, which was the little town nearby, wouldn’t marry them, it was too scandalous. 20 They had to go to Minot and the bishop married them. 7, 15 It was really difficult. 10, 18 Her name was Loretta.  It was very difficult for the children. 5, 10, 14, 20 There was a lot of conflict and she wasn’t liked.  The two oldest sisters entered the convent. 5, 14, 20 AS: They were Catholic?  MW: Very Catholic.  I visited the place.  It’s still in the family, a dairy farm. 8, 12 A very small house. 6, 13 I can’t imagine nine children in it out in the middle of nothing. 5, 7, 14, 20 They’d take the sleigh in the winter, pulled by horses. 11 For example, my father had to wait after he finished eighth grade he had to wait two years. 5, 14, 16 His oldest brother was going to high school in the town of Foxhome. 7, 20 These days we just drive there but not then. 5, 16 He had a job at the local hotel. 11 Every morning he’d bring around hot water to the rooms. 14, 16 AS: This was your father? 16 MW: No, his oldest brother. 20 He got room and board when he was staying at the hotel so he could go to high school. 7, 14 My father had to wait for him to graduate before he could get that job and go to high school. 7, 11, 16 He did and then he got hired on by the local banker as a teller. 5 That started his career. 14, 15, 19 My mother grew up in Maple Plain which is a western suburb. 20 At that time it was a little farm town. 8, 20 She grew up on a farm outside of Maple Plain. 8, 20 I’ve been there too, still in the family too. 12 Then both of them were just obsessed with getting off the farm. 8 I grew up hearing all the tales of being on the farm. 8, 9, 20 AS: How did they meet? 18 MW: My dad got drafted. 5, 14 He was older by that time. 20 He was well into his thirties.  My mother was eight years younger. 14, 20 She went to a business school and learned stenography. 7, 10 She became a secretary for several years in the Twin Cities. 14 She was living in the Twin Cities and one of my father’s sisters lived here. 7, 16, 20 Two sisters and a brother lived here. 7, 20 One of the sisters had some people over and my dad was back here on furlough. 9, 14, 20 He was stationed in Clovis, New Mexico at an airbase. 8 He was in the Army Air Corps.  He was on furlough here.  I don’t know if he was staying with his sister. 7, 12, 20 Gilly, her name was, invited my mother, Maggie, over.  That’s how they met.  While he was on furlough his entire unit was shipped to North Africa. 19 Every one of them died in North Africa.  He stayed back and his assignment was to stay at the base and keep the records of the company. 11, 12, 14 He was a banker.  AS: So he was sent back. 5 MW: He stayed in Clovis, New Mexico for the remainder of the war.  AS: It just happened when he was on furlough and then he went back. 15 MW: Then he went back to Clovis and my older brother was born there. 14, 20 Then they moved back to the Twin Cities. 7, 15 I think Dad tried selling insurance for a while and it didn’t work out.  There was a job opening at a bank in Virginia and they moved up there. 7, 10, 11, 15 They weren’t rangers. 7 My mother had real big city sensibilities.  To her dying day she hated being in Virginia. 16 She always wanted to be in the city. 14, 18 She had wanted to be a nurse. 18 Her father in many ways was a bastard and was abusive to her mother. 16, 18 He just cut her off financially for some punishment or something. 12 She was already accepted to go to nursing school and she couldn’t go. 7, 12 That haunted her all her life. 10 She was very bright. 12 Extremely neurotic, but very bright. 12 He started out as a teller at the State Bank of Virginia which was eventually acquired by Stanley West (pre-Wells Fargo). 5, 10 I don’t know what happened after that. 12, 15 When I was growing up he was at the bank. 10 He stayed on and ended up being president. 9, 10 There were some very tough times in the middle. 7 He had an early heart attack. 9 The men in his family had early heart attacks. 9, 12 He survived it but I think because of that he was already vice president and he was passed over for the presidency. 7, 9, 10 That was a very bitter pill for both him and my mother. 20 They brought in somebody else to be president. 9, 10 My mother hated his wife. 20 It was a very difficult time for them. 10 They stuck it through.  When this guy left he became president. 9, 10, 14 He presided over a new building there. 9, 10, 16, 19 In my father’s late fifties, early sixties he was the talk of the town. 16 He was very beloved because he really cared about people and really helped people with their businesses. 5, 9, 14, 18, 19 AS: Their farms probably. 8 MW: Not so much farms there. 8 That’s where I grew up. 20 In the early 50s it was like the Depression up there. 10 Then at the University of Minnesota they developed the technology for taconite.  I remember going to a taconite plant when they first started. 14 They use magnetic extraction to make taconite pellets, which then could be used in furnaces. 6, 13, 16 That led to the next boom.  The mines reopened, great jobs. 11, 20 The mining companies were such a great tax base. 10, 20 The utilities money in Virginia was very good. 8, 10 They had the first heated indoor pool in the state of Minnesota at Virginia High School. 14 They built this steam plant that heated every house in town with steam. 6, 13 They piped steam to every house in time. 6, 13 When I grew up there it was really good times and thriving. 10, 18, 20 Main  Street was just alive and vibrant and thriving.  It was a good time to be there. 10 The quality of education was good. 10, 14, 15 We lived on the edge of town where I could walk into this huge field. 7, 16 I could walk over to the train tracks that the mining companies used. 6, 10, 13, 16 There were big trains around and machinery parts. 9 It was beautiful for a boy. 7 There was a creek there.  We would just play there for days and days. 16 Then you could go up into the mining areas. 8, 20 I could actually walk into the woods right from home. 7, 12, 16 AS: How many siblings did you have?  MW: Just one, an older brother. 20 Looking back now I’m almost certain I could have gotten into Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale. 12, 17 Berkeley was where I really wanted to go. 18 Neither of my parents had a college education. 7, 14, 15, 20 The high school counselor wasn’t very broad. 7 I had no guidance.  MW: I went to the University of Minnesota.  I was accepted at Northwestern in Chicago. 12, 13 It was the only other place I applied.  My life could have been very different. 10 I took college chemistry at the junior college across the street from the high school. 7, 14, 15 The chemistry teacher encouraged me to apply to Harvard, but he was the only one. 8, 15 I just didn’t know anything about that stuff. 12 My brother was at the University here. 20 I knew the Twin Cities. 16 AS: Are you guys just a couple years apart? 9, 11, 14 MW: Five years. 14 He was already in graduate school in electrical engineering. 7 I came down here.  I also knew the Cities. 16 I could drive home. 5 I got a good education. 10, 14, 15 AS: What did you major in in undergrad?  MW: I had a double major in sociology and biochemistry. 15 I was in the honors program.  My advisor was H.  Mead Cavert who for decades was the assistant dean of the medical school. 7, 14 He died recently.  AS: Is it Cavert?  MW: Cavert, C-A-V-E-R-T.  Mead.  This will become important. 9 I participated in all the protests. 9 I was a parade marshal in a parade that went from the University to the capitol.  AS: The student protests?  MW: Everybody was protesting.  It went right down Summit Avenue. 12 AS: This is in what year? 14 Things blew up after the Cambodian Invasion and Kent State.  Things really blew up. 18 Students shut down Washington Avenue, barricaded it.  I was in medical school at that time. 7, 14 There was a former police sergeant named Charles Stendrick who was really an authoritarian guy. 5, 8, 18 The cops rioted on the protestors, they just went nuts.  It was really bad. 18 The University shut down for the rest of the quarter.  I was an undergraduate then when that happened. 15 I was a junior. 14 The whole university shut down and they shut down for the rest of spring quarter. 5 What was interesting was that at that time, when I was an undergraduate when I was a junior they did away with student deferments and went to the lottery system. 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 AS: For Vietnam?  MW: I pulled a bad number. 11 I was seriously considering Sweden, Canada, CO status. 9, 11 I wasn’t about to go to Vietnam.  They retained deferment for medical students. 7, 12, 14 I’m a junior now. 12, 14 At that time there were a few medical schools around the country that accepted some students after three years. 7, 12, 14, 19 University of Minnesota was one of them.  AS: So you didn’t have to get an undergraduate degree.  MW: Right.  I applied to all of these and I got waitlisted at Minnesota.  I’m sure the only reason that I got accepted was H. 12 Meade Cavert was my advisor.  There was a shortage of primary care physicians. 18, 19 That year the legislature voted to expand the medical programs by twenty-five students. 7, 14 That got me in.  I got in there and I was deferred. 5 When I graduated it was over. 7 Otherwise the deferment was granted on the condition that you would serve afterwards as a physician. 12, 14 That happened in 1970, I was accepted. 12, 15 I graduated ‘74 just when Vietnam was winding down. 7 AS: What was your specialization?  MW: I went in intending to be a psychiatrist.  AS: Did that have anything to do with your mother?  What made you interested in psychiatry?  MW: I had this image in my mind of sitting in a room with a patient doing psychotherapy. 12, 14 I don’t know where they came from. 12 I wanted to be a doctor from a very early age. 12, 14, 18 Right after I was done wanting to be a priest. 8, 20 AS: A priest or a doctor. 12, 14, 20 I’ve heard this from somebody else I’ve interviewed. 9 MW: My mother had been a Methodist but she converted to Catholicism for my father. 16 It was a requirement but she wasn’t a real Catholic. 12 I didn’t go to Catholic school. 7 My dad was quite pious but he was very quiet about it. 11, 14 My mother wasn’t really a Catholic. 18 We went to the Polish Catholic Church.  I went through communion and all of that stuff.  AS: You thought you were going to be a psychiatrist and then what happened? 15, 17, 18 MW: I enjoyed all aspects of medicine. 12, 14 By the time I was going to graduate I wasn’t sure what I was going to do.  I did a GP internship.  It was the last year they were offered. 5, 14, 20 They were called RO internships.  Before everybody became a specialist most doctors would have an internship. 12, 14 It was well rounded; you do everything.  You do surgery, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, ER, whatever.  I did that at what’s now Regions. 12 It was Ramsey Hospital back then.  I applied there and at Hennepin.  I decided to go to Ramsey. 14 It was a good experience. 10, 18 I still didn’t know what I wanted to do. 12, 18 I started working in the ER there after I graduated. 7 I did that for two years. 14 I also did little stunts in Farmington at a clinic and practiced some family medicine there. 12, 14, 20 I also did some practice at community clinics, the Seward Community Clinic and the Southside Community Clinic. 9, 19 What I found out about myself was that I was good at all that but even family practice is pretty technical. 10, 12 You do a lot of procedures; you don’t spend a lot of time talking to people. 9, 10 I kept wanting to have more time to talk to people. 9 I really like the Emergency Room. 18 It was a MASH mentality. 12 You related to the staff.  You had the repeaters, old Joe who got drunk and fell on his head. 5, 8, 14 You didn’t have lasting relationships with patients. 19 I liked the variety and the excitement. 12 I wanted to stay on there. 18 This was the time when family practice residencies and emergency medicine residencies were just forming. 9, 12, 14 It was a brand-new thing. 16 I could have gotten grandfathered in in emergency medicine or family practice. 5, 12, 14, 16 My chief at the time there said, “I’m not going to do that because in ten years you’d regret it. 8, 14 You’d be at a disadvantage compared to people with a residency.” 5, 7, 9 I had to choose between emergency medicine and psychiatry so I decided to do psychiatry. 12, 14 Now that I know a number of people who were emergency medicine docs I’m glad I’m not one. 9, 12, 14 They all burn out at like forty-five and start doing family practice. 12 It’s the shift work. 8 It just kills you.  I wanted to go to the West Coast. 18 I applied to a bunch of programs out there.  I ended up at the University of California, Davis in Sacramento. 12 It was at that time a very new medical school. 7, 14, 16 It was the first medical school formed in like fifty years. 7, 14 It was like eight years old. 14 They had just taken over the county hospital. 8, 19 The academic programs were miniscule. 20 The main campus was at Davis.  The medical students had their training in Davis, which was just outside of Sacramento. 7, 9, 12, 14 A very precious community. 10, 19 The medical center was in Sacramento proper. 7, 12, 14 One of the things I like about the program there was in the first year they had this interdisciplinary program where you went through this experience with a psychologist, social workers, advanced practice nurses. 12, 14, 18, 19 You got to know other professions perspectives. 12 It was really, really interesting. 17, 18 I really liked that. 18 I did my residency. 7, 9 I became very interested in research.  I started doing a bunch of it when I was a senior resident. 9 I decided I wanted to try an academic career. 14, 15, 18, 19, 20 At that time it was the Reagan Recession.  I went out there in ‘77 and graduated in ‘80. 7 That’s when the recession really formed, ‘84, ‘83. 18 The worst recession until this most recent one.  Everybody was laying off assistant professors, no one was hiring them. 8 One of my advisors there said, “Are you interested in alcohol and drug abuse?” 5, 6, 13 I said, “Oh sure.  I’m very interested.”  AS: Did you participate in the…? 9 MW: No comment. 12 I was never a hard-core druggie. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16 We all smoked pot. 6 AS: More experimental? 12 More social? 19 MW: I liked pot. 6 We drank and partied a lot. 5, 9, 16 AS: But it wasn’t a problem for you? 12 AS: Did you have friends who it was a problem? 12, 16, 20 MW: A couple of people whose drug use got heavy but they never ended up in trouble for it. 5, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16 I think they got over it when they grew up. 20 This was 1980 California.  It was on the cusp of the cocaine epidemic. 13, 16 AS: So he asks you…  MW: If I was interested and I said, “Sure.  I hadn’t ever thought about doing anything in that field. 17, 18 I wanted to do therapy research. 12, 18 At that time the National Institutes on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse were offering what was called a Career Teacher Grant. 6, 13 They would pay your salary for three years as a faculty teacher in medical school if you agreed to develop curriculum on alcohol and drug abuse. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 They were trying to get more education to medical schools. 7, 14, 15 AS: What was it called?  MW: Career Teacher Award.  I applied to that from Davis.  First of all, by virtue of my applying for it the resident expert on alcohol and drug abuse. 5, 6, 9, 13 The first thing I learned was it’s really easy to be an expert because no one knows anything. 8, 10, 12, 14, 18 This is a moment where they’re creating a program on alcohol and drug abuse within a medical school, is that right? 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 MW: Curriculum.  AS: Was it based on twelve step thinking or was it based in science and research? 13 MW: This was funded by the research institutes. 6, 8 Things were very different there but it was based on the current scientific research. 13, 14 It was just emerging.  AS: I guess that’s what I’m getting at.  MW: It was academically based. 13, 20 The process went well and I would have gotten the award. 17 However, the previous chair who was chair when I went there had built the program on something of a house of cards counting money with an agreement for the department to provide care at all these community mental health centers. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19 The county rescinded that contract and the department was almost entirely dependent on it. 9, 12, 14, 19 He left and there was somebody put in place. 14 All of my mentors were getting canned. 12 All the people I didn’t respect were taking power. 9, 11, 17 The department was undergoing a terrible shrinkage. 9, 11, 12, 19 I could see dark times ahead. 6, 14, 17 I left and they were very unhappy with me for leaving after they supported me with a grant. 14, 18 It turns out they went through ten years really dark. 14, 17, 18 They’re doing well now but it was really bad. 12, 18 In the meantime, I was looking at other things.  I was accepted for a fellowship in therapy research, one of the preeminent psychotherapy researchers in the country, at UCSF. 10, 12, 19 I can’t tell you how badly I wanted to do that. 18 I always wanted to live in San Francisco. 18 That’s what I wanted to do. 18 It paid sixteen thousand dollars a year. 14 Even in 1980 in San Francisco that wasn’t very much money. 8, 10 My wife Katie was pregnant. 7, 10, 20 I have to say leaving San Francisco and turning that down was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. 9, 20 I’d applied at various other places.  There was an interdisciplinary fellowship at UW Madison. 10 Another interdisciplinary thing.  This was even more interesting, an anthropologist, a lawyer, an advanced practice nurse, psychologist, social work. 13, 17, 19 Very diverse.  Katie wanted to be closer to her mom as most young mothers want to be. 9, 10, 14, 18 They were in St. Paul.  Madison was kind of the perfect distance. 17 The funny thing that happened is when they asked me what I’d been doing I told them I’d written this grant proposal. 9, 15, 16 One of the main guys in the program there said, “Would you be willing to do that here?”  What he wanted to do was support me with the fellowship for two years and in the meantime cultivate a faculty position for me. 10, 14, 18 Part of it was because he was really interested in alcohol and drug abuse too. 5, 6, 13, 18 He wanted to see more of that taught. 6, 18 That only paid about the same amount of money but he supplemented my income by making me medical director of the county detox. 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19 The mental health center there, which was very closely tied in with the department, had just taken over the contract to provide county detox services. 9, 10, 12, 19 All these kind of serendipitous things.  We moved to Madison. 7, 15 When I got there everybody said, “Oh you’re the alcohol guy.” 6 I said, “That’s an interest but I’m also really interested in psychotherapy research.” 12, 18 After about four months I said, “Oh yeah. 11, 16 I developed curriculum on alcohol and drug abuse but my best education was at the county detox center. 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 19 AS: Because you could see it and you talked to people. 6, 9 Is that where you got to talk to people? 9 MW: Yes, but you saw the same people everyday, day after day after day. 9, 16 It really shaped the rest of my career. 15, 18, 19 I really got to understand these guys, some women but mostly men. 12, 17, 18 When they were turning forty they’d be, “I’m reviewing my life and wondering what I want to do with the rest of it. 10, 14, 15, 20 What have I accomplished so far?”  They all had very conventional dreams, a house, two cars in the driveway, two kids and a dog. 5, 6, 13, 18 The whole catastrophe.  I learned so much from them. 10 This is important from the standpoint of how I ended up doing what I’m doing. 9, 13 I was fresh out of residency. 7, 9 I had all the new stuff. 16 Naturally I concluded the trouble with these guys is they just haven’t been exposed to the right treatment. 12, 13 I’m here now. 12 They’d been through this countless times with fresh young professionals.  They were gentle on me.  They let me down easily.  Some of them even got better for a while so I wouldn’t feel so bad.  But after six months they couldn’t hold it. 11, 16 I remember the day I was walking to a bus from the detox center. 16, 19 It was winter with a couple of inches of snow on the ground. 11, 12 I thought, “I’m not doing anything for these guys. 17, 18 I can get a different job or I can figure out how to approach this.” 11 What do doctors treat in general? 12, 14 Chronic illness. 12 That’s what we treat.  We treat degenerative back disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer. 9, 10 That’s the bread and butter.  Multiple sclerosis, all of these incurable diseases.  Right?  That’s what doctors do. 12, 14 We treat incurable diseases by and large.  Even surgeons do.  Maybe the surgery is a specific thing but it’s almost always for some sort of chronic illness. 6, 12, 18 Acute appendicitis is different. 14 AS: There’s the emergency things.  MW: Other than that we’re not curing very many people. 9 Well what do they do?  They slow the rate the deterioration. 10 They try to achieve remission if possible or get the best response possible if they can’t achieve remission. 13 They try to keep people in remission. 9 They try to minimize the frequency, severity, and length of recurrences.  They treat complications.  They support the family and the patient. 12 AS: With this population?  MW: With drug and alcohol abuse. 5, 6, 13 Yes.  Sure.  That was an absolutely crucial point, the rest of my career has been based on that. 13, 15, 19 AS: Do you remember when this was?  In the 80s in Madison?  MW: This would have been late ‘80 or early ‘81.  I’ve adopted this chronic illness management approach for my entire career. 6, 12, 14, 15, 19 That has really formed the basis of everything I’ve done. 18 They were really into case management so I really became an expert on case management. 12, 17, 18 It’s really coordination of care. 18, 19 Another way to conceptualize that is even if you can’t treat the disease you can always treat the patient. 18 I finished the fellowship in ‘82. 10 Still looking for a faculty job, still a recession. 11 Madison didn’t have a spot for me. 6 There really wasn’t anything acceptable in the Madison area. 8, 12, 18 I naturally looked up here.  There was a brand-new chair at the U whose charge was to really bring it up to date. 13, 16, 18 To make a much more modern, scientifically based department. 9, 12, 13, 19 Her name was Paula Clayton.  She didn’t have a position but she had just hired a new chief of psychiatry at the VA, which had never been an academic place to turn that department into an academic department. 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19, 20 The Minneapolis VA is probably the best VA in the country. 19 It operates more like a small medical school itself. 7, 14 It looks, feels, and acts like a university hospital. 5, 8 The faculty are virtually all full time which is not typical. 14 They have kept their identity from the University separate for that reason.  Usually what universities will do is they’ll put people on five eighths VA, four eighths university. 5, 9 The VA doesn’t get five eighths.  They just basically suck from the VA. 19 That’s not true here. 5 When they built the new hospital here they could have built it on campus but they didn’t. 8, 16 That was the reason.  They had a job for me at the VA. 11 In guess what?  AS: Alcohol and drug abuse. 5, 6, 13 MW: That’s right. 12 I was the first faculty member hired under this new mandate to become an academic department. 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20 When I got there, there was nothing.  There was no psychiatry research.  My mentors were people in neuro-endocrinology. 9, 12, 14 AS: Here you are again the only guy and the expert.  By now you’ve had some experience. 12, 18 MW: By now I was an expert. 12 I’d been teaching at Madison.  I’d read a lot and learned a lot. 10 I got a job. 11 Here’s another serendipitous thing.  While I’m negotiating with the people up here and looking at taking the job at the Minneapolis VA one of the guys at Madison who was an expert in psychopharmacology was reviewing a VA grant application. 9, 11, 14 It was to see if treating alcohol dependence with lithium is effective with or without depression. 6, 10, 13 VA does a co-op space with many, many sites across the country. 19 The big studies, very well done, there’s a co-op center to make sure the methodologies are coordinated. 6 Lots and lots of important research is from the VA. 9, 16 He came to me and he said, “Do you know anything about lithium and alcohol?” 6, 12 I said, “Why do you ask?”  He said, “I’m reviewing this VA cooperative grant thing.” 14 “Well there’s a couple of small studies that support it but it’s never really been known for sure.” 11, 12, 16, 18 I found out who the PI was, he was in Chicago by the name of Walter Doris. 13 I called the chief of alcohol and drug abuse over at the VA and said, “Are you interested in participating in this study?” 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14 He said, “Sure.”  I called Walter Doris and said, “Are you interested in another site?”  He said, “We don’t have anybody up in Minneapolis.”  “I’m going there and I’d love to be a site investigator.” 14 He said, “We need this kind of information from the program.”  They provided that.  Lo and behold I arrive at the Minneapolis VA with a VA grant.  The chief of research there at that time said, “How did this happen? 8, 15 This doesn’t happen.” 15 That gave me support for four years. 14 That totally launched my career. 14, 15, 19 I published some papers out of that.  Then the other thing was it was a yearlong study. 14, 17 We followed people for a year, which was very unusual. 9, 10, 14 Most studies are three or four months. 11, 16 We studied people for a year. 9, 14 I got to track along with these alcohol dependent volunteers in the research study for a full year. 6, 14, 16 I learned about the natural history of alcohol dependence and how recovery went and didn’t go. 6, 10, 15 Most people at that time only saw what they saw in rehab. 9 We can’t learn anything about natural history in rehab. 10, 15 AS: Because it’s a closed environment? 5, 9, 10, 12 MW: And it’s only thirty days long. 16, 17 They had a methadone program there.  AS: Is that the first time you worked with opioid addiction? 12, 13, 14 MW: Yes.  I clawed my way up. 13, 18 At that time the VA was a wonderful place to work. 18 You got lots of autonomy and different ways to get money that weren’t available at the university. 5, 8, 10, 16, 18 I rose through the ranks.  I became the first psychiatrist to become an assistant professor and go to full professor while at that VA. 14 I was the pioneer. 8 Now they’ve got a robust program mostly with psychologists but with some psychiatrists. 12 I was the pioneer that got the whole thing started. 8 I eventually ended up at the national level. 5 I was the co-editor of the first clinical practice guideline for the alcohol and drug and substance disorders for the VA. 5, 6, 9, 13, 14 Towards the end of my time there I was the clinical coordinator for a huge effort to implement evidence-based practices. 12, 13 I really became sort of the most prominent addiction psychiatrists for the VA. 12, 14, 18 I ran the methadone program for fifteen years. 6, 8, 14 While I was there there was a very, very important thing that occurred about learning about opioid addiction. 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 Almost all of the guys at this time were Vietnam vets who got addicted in Vietnam. 12, 14 There was this one guy in particular, just a sweetheart. 9 Just a really sweet, nice guy. 18 The practice when I got there was they maintained people for two years. 9, 14 If they were doing well they’d taper them off.  That was practiced a lot of places at that time.  This guy was doing very well.  He got married, he was employed, he was doing well. 7 They said, “It’s been two years, let’s taper you off and see how you do.” 6, 14 He didn’t make it through the full detox before he had a recurrence. 14, 19 He lost everything he’d gained in six months. 11, 16 He came back and started the program again.  He restabilized nicely, rebuilt everything. 18 Two years later, “It’s been two years. 14 Let’s give this a try.”  Same thing happened. 15 Didn’t make through the withdrawal, went through the entire detox period, had a recurrence, lost everything in six months. 5, 11, 16, 18, 19 He came back and by that time I was the director of the program. 18, 19 When he came back that time I said, “Let’s stop doing this.”  That’s when I learned. 10 At that time there was more evidence starting to accrue that for most people maintenance had to be lifelong or what I would say is indefinite. 9, 10, 17 I also at that time really got into pain. 6, 18 I didn’t want to do that.  The internal medicine folks, orthopedic folks, physical medicine folks had patients who were opioids for chronic pain that were problematic and didn’t know what to do. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 Most of them were giving out Percocet.  They didn’t know what to do. 12 AS: Most doctors? 12, 14 MW: Yes.  Nobody’s taught anything about how to do pain management. 6, 12 Maybe they are now. 12 AS: What year was the pain stuff? 6, 14 MW: That was probably in the early 90s.  AS: When prescription pain pills became… 6, 10 AS: So early 90s.  MW: The prescription pain pills started in about ‘98. 6, 10 AS: When doctors are noticing problems. 12, 14 MW: There was conflict with the patients often.  They would be frequently running out. 8 AS: People hadn’t put their finger on that yet necessarily.  MW: It was problematic. 12 They didn’t know how to deal with it. 12 They refer him to me for a number of reasons.  I’m much more of a physical medicine doctor for a psychiatrist. 6, 12, 14 I was an ER doctor. 12, 14 Then in the VA psychiatrists do a lot of physical hands on medicine much more than the private sector. 6, 12, 14, 17 We did our own physicals. 6 I kept up to date. 13 Also, because I knew about opioids because of working with opioid addicted people and the methadone people and things like that. 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 I just really like complex chronic disorders. 6, 13, 18 That’s always been my focus until now. 12, 18 Although it’s still partly a focus. 9 I was like, “Well I’ll give it a try.”  I knew more than anybody else I guess. 16 Turns out a lot of these folks have poorly treated or undiagnosed mental illnesses. 12 A lot of them have personality disorders. 6, 13, 15 They also had really severe chronic pain disorders. 6, 13, 18 Sometimes they had brain injuries. 13 They were an extremely complicated group of people. 9 We developed a very successful program for managing them.  They’d come in once a month; I’d work with a nurse. 16 They’d come in as a group.  It was a group appointment. 12 Before they came we would write the prescriptions and she’d collect them from the pharmacy. 10 They didn’t have to go wait in line at the pharmacy. 9 Like the Salvation Army we would bring in people to talk about exercise or nutrition or self-care or whatever. 9, 19 Naturally what happens is they start to talk to each other and they find out they’re not the only one. 8, 15 That’s one of the most difficult things for people with chronic pain. 6, 9, 10 They don’t know anyone else who has that disorder. 12, 13 It’s really isolating. 18 They benefited from it. 15 I was able to stabilize a lot of people who otherwise weren’t. 9 Their function improved and so forth. 9 AS: They were still able to keep their pain prescription? 6, 10 MW: Yes.  As one patient puts it, I’m strict but fair. 9 I make my expectations explicit.  AS: About how to stay in this program?  MW: About what my rules are and what happens if you don’t follow those rules. 10, 13, 15 I follow through. 10 I never make threats. 16 People like that.  They like that structure. 15 They like the predictability. 5, 10, 14 All they need is to feel like they’re treated fairly and they’re understood. 9, 12 That’s the most important thing with chronic pain patients. 6, 9 I learned a lot about chronic pain and opioids. 6, 10, 13 I served on a national taskforce that involved clinical practice guidelines for treating chronic pain with opioids. 6, 8, 9, 13, 14 I interacted with a lot of pain experts. 6, 18 Differentiating addiction from physiological dependence in the context of chronic pain is very tricky. 6, 12, 14 Unfortunately, people with chronic pain who are appropriately taking opiates as prescribed who are benefitting are often labelled as being opioid dependent. 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15 There’s a pathological diagnosis of using opioids inappropriately. 6, 13 I devise ways of really teaching that to others. 18 Addiction is drug use that causes clinically significant impairment or distress. 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 That’s the threshold criteria. 14 Another way to think of it short hand is addiction is compulsive, out of control, destructive drug use. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 18 If you’re wondering if someone who is being treated with opiates for chronic pain is addicted all you have to do is ask yourself are they better with the pain medication or are they worse with it? 6, 12, 14, 15 If it’s better they’re not addicted. 12, 14 People continue to confuse the fact that you have a physical withdrawal when you stop suddenly with addiction. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14 AS: There’s so many drugs that cause symptoms. 5, 6, 13 MW: Try stopping Effexor suddenly or Zoloft or Celexa.  It’s really miserable. 18 That’s why I don’t call it withdrawal anymore. 5 I call it discontinuation symptoms.  I never use the word detox ever. 6, 13, 16, 19 It’s withdrawal. 5 AS: And withdrawal is a discontinuation symptom. 5 MW: If I treat it I call it withdrawal management. 5, 12 I don’t call it detox. 19 They’re not toxic.  AS: The words we use, let’s talk about stigma for a minute. 6, 9, 13, 15 MW: Let me give you the list of words I never use. 6, 13, 16 AS: You never use addict. 6, 13, 14, 16 MW: Alcoholic, alcoholism, enabling, co-dependency, relapse, of all things recidivist. 6, 13 People will call relapse or recurrences in addiction recidivists. 12, 14 AS: That’s a criminal name. 8 MW: What I ask people is do you call someone who keeps getting hospitalized for diabetes a recidivist? 8, 9, 10, 15 Let’s see. 6 Denial, unmotivated.  AS: Shame?  MW: We’ll talk about feeling shame. 15 They all feel ashamed.  Selfish.  AS: Self-centered. 5 MW: Right.  Irresponsible, immoral. 16 There’re other things that I don’t use that are concepts that are thrown around that are completely wrong. 6, 11, 13 Addictive personality. 14, 15 There’s no such thing as an addictive personality. 14, 15 That’s total fiction.  The thing you have to understand about the twelve-step approach to alcohol use disorder is they define everything about you in terms of your addiction to alcohol even twenty years after you stop using alcohol. 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 That’s addict thinking. 14 Everything is attributed.  You become your disease.  The alcoholic. 6 The person with an alcoholic use disorder. 6, 13 A recurrence of illness. 12 AS: Instead of a relapse.  MW: A use episode instead of a slip. 6, 13 Language is extraordinarily important. 9 AS: Did you find in Minnesota being this center of twelve-step treatment programs… 12, 13 MW: We have the Vatican here.  AS: You call it the Vatican.  MW: It’s a little Vatican. 20 AS: I’ve had people call it the holy land. 9 MW: Twelve-step is the state religion.  AS: I’m glad I can quote you on all this.  Earlier you talked about gathering people with chronic pain and then realizing that they weren’t alone. 6, 8, 9 Some of the power in the twelve-step environment that it creates is people can get together and start to understand themselves. 8, 9, 12, 17, 18 Do you see value in that aspect of it? 6 Do you have thoughts about the community that it creates for people? 9, 17, 18, 19 MW: Some people do find that helpful. 9 For some people it’s harmful. 9 One of the things we do with our Suboxone patients here is we offer them a choice between seeing a doctor privately for their appointments or we have a group medication appointment. 6, 8, 12, 14 AS: So you’re doing the same thing that you started.  You’re treating them as people with a medical condition who could benefit from getting to know other people with that same condition. 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 MW: That is an effect of it.  That’s not actually the reason for doing it. 7 One is time.  It saves me or another doctor a lot of time. 10, 12, 14 You don’t have to keep repeating yourself.  MW: It’s not so much that as fewer appointments. 12 If you have five or six people that would take care of an hour. 9, 15, 19 They appreciate it too and then we charge less. 10 The main reason for doing it was it makes it more affordable.  I’m ridiculously cheap. 14 We’re ridiculously cheap here. 14 AS: I think I heard you don’t accept insurance. 9, 12 MW: There’s several reasons.  First of all, Alltyr Clinic is a demonstration clinic.  The broader mission of Alltyr is transforming addiction treatment. 12, 13, 14, 17 The business strategy was that whenever you brought this up people would say what’s the alternative to rehab? 9, 14, 16 AS: You made one.  MW: Someone had to make one or nobody would believe it.  This is a demonstration clinic.  This demonstrates how to do twenty first century, scientifically based, professional outpatient addiction treatment. 11, 12, 13, 14 What’s the rehab alternative? 14 Alltyr is the rehab alternative. 14 AS: It’s different than outpatient? 11 MW: Completely.  AS: Or intensive IOP?  MW: Yes.  There’s no such thing as residential treatment. 9, 12, 13 MW: Anywhere.  It’s not a thing.  MW: It’s an IOP in a house. 6, 13 Spending twenty-four seven together for all the mythology about it, stuff occurs and the conversations at night is all bullshit. 8, 18 Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago it was proven in a randomized control trial that keeping them all together in a house had no outcome effect. 6, 8, 13, 14, 18 In 1977 the first randomized control trial done in England proved that intensive multimodal treatment has no benefit over less intensive things one year later. 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 There’s no evidence that an IOP whether it’s in a house or freestanding is an effective treatment. 6, 12, 13, 14 There’s a mountain of evidence that it’s not.  Just think about it.  A burst of intensive counseling in psychoeducation. 14, 15, 19 I hate the term psychoeducation. 14, 15, 17 AS: What does that mean?  MW: It’s just education. 14, 15 They call it psychoeducation to make it sound like it’s a treatment. 12, 13, 14, 15 AS: I’ve never heard of that in all my reading. 9, 16 Who calls it that? 16 The treatment centers? 12, 13 Not just in addiction treatment, also in mental health treatment. 12, 13, 14, 19 AS: I can think of some other ways to say that. 18 MW: How is that different from education? 14, 15 AS: It’s all going into our brain. 13 MW: It helps you understand how rehab started and what the intention was. 17, 18 The original idea was there’s a week of stabilization and withdrawal management. 5, 12, 15 Getting your head about you and a couple good meals in you. 10, 11, 14 There’s two weeks of education about, in this case, alcoholism as it is. 6, 14, 15, 17 An introduction to the twelve steps. 14 You incorporate the first five steps of AA. 14 The fourth week is discharge. 5, 15 It was always conceptualized as an introduction to AA. 14, 18 AS: To get you into the program.  MW: That’s where the action was.  The idea that rehab itself would actually do something was never actually the intention, other than get you engaged in AA. 7, 16 AS: From your perspective, how has this worked with people addicted to heroin and opioids? 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16 We know it doesn’t. 12 There’s no evidence.  There’s not one single high quality study that proves effectiveness of an abstinence-based approach to heroin addiction worldwide. 7, 12, 13, 14, 16 There’s like truckloads, there’s boxcars full of research that have proven that the only effective treatment is indefinite maintenance with morphine or methadone. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14 That is a settled matter.  We don’t need any more evidence on it.  It’s not scientifically controversial.  They’re about equally effective.  We don’t need any more studies about that either.  You don’t need more than minimal counselling, once a month, on top of the medication. 14, 16 Adding more counseling doesn’t improve outcomes. 19 That’s a settled fact.  AS: Unless the person wants it for other aspects of their life, right? 10, 12 MW: If they’re treating anxiety disorder or depression or post-traumatic stress of course. 7, 10, 13 AS: That’s separate.  MW: You’re not treating drug addiction. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14 Think of the idea that it’s called medication assisted treatment. 12, 13, 14 Why do you think that is?  AS: Because it’s medication based. 13, 14 MW: Why is it called medication assisted treatment? 12, 13, 14 Do we call diabetes medication assisted treatment? 10, 12, 13, 14 So this is where you get back to we call it treatment. 12, 13 MW: I’ll get to harm reduction. 5, 14 There’s an assumption if the real meat of it is counseling. 19 AS: Right, because it’s assisted.  MW: If anything it should be called counseling assisted medication. 14, 19 Why call it that?  Why not call it treatment? 12, 13 Most treatment now is multi-disciplinary. 12, 13 AS: It’s like cancer treatment. 10, 12, 13 MW: Cancer, heart failure. 9, 14 It requires a team.  AS: It’s back to the chronic illness model that you’re talking about. 6, 12 MW: Absolutely.  Why don’t we call diabetes treatment harm reduction? 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 All you’re doing with diabetes treatment is slowing the rate of deterioration. 10, 12, 13 If that ain’t harm reduction I don’t know what is. 5, 12, 14 Harm reduction is a great term for a national drug control policy. 5, 6, 14, 17, 18, 20 That’s where it was first used. 6, 13, 14, 16 It’s still only appropriate for that as a policy.  It’s in contrast to the drug war. 5, 6 Harm reduction is a pragmatic policy that seeks to balance the harms of drug use against the harms of policy and minimize the overall harm to society. 5, 6, 12, 13, 14 The drug war is an idealistic approach where the intention is viewed as more important than the result. 5, 6, 9 It’s like preaching sexual abstinence to teenagers. 10, 12 That you should do that because it’s the right thing to do even though it increases teen pregnancies. 10, 12 It’s very much the same approach.  Cost be damned, damage to lives be damned.  It doesn’t matter.  What’s really important to understanding the drug war is that it’s never been about drugs. 5, 6, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18 People keep saying it doesn’t work so why do we keep doing it?  It works politically. 9 The job of the legislature is to keep their jobs to get reelected. 11 It’s worked wonderfully for that. 14, 18 It’s also served as a very nice bridge between the Cold War and the War on Terror. 18 AS: And it incarcerated millions…  MW: Of disenfranchised blacks.  The drug war has always been intensely focused on blacks right from the start. 5, 6, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 It’s explicitly racist.  You find it interesting that heroin was primarily a problem with middle aged black people the response was prison. 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 AS: Now it’s young white men. 12, 19 MW: It’s treatment. 12, 13 AS: The contrast of the trial that’s happening as we speak is five young, suburban, white males and the black female drug dealer from North Minneapolis is being charged with murder. 5, 6, 15, 19 If you switched it, if they had been selling her the drugs nobody would be on trial. 5, 6 Or if it was five young black men 12 I don’t think the state would bring it against her.  We’re at a really interesting moment in how the focus has shifted on heroin. 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 MW: Harm reduction has no place when you’re talking about clinical care. 5, 14, 19 I hope most of us are not doing harm reduction clinically. 5, 9, 14 We do a lot more of that than anybody realizes.  That’s not the goal.  We primarily provide palliative care simply meaning non-curative care. 19 It’s unfortunate that that term has come to mean end of life care. 10, 17, 19 It’s just chronic illness management. 6, 12 The use of the term harm reduction when it applies to clinical care plays into the twelve-step approach. 5, 6, 13, 14, 17, 19 They see harm reduction as giving up on the person. 5, 6, 14 The twelve-step approach is idealistic.  They explicitly teach and believe in AA.  If you do the program it will work.  Period.  It’s one hundred percent effective if you do what you’re told. 16 Rehabs do a double dirty because ninety percent or more of their graduates are going to have recurrences.  Can you think of any other industry except maybe the military industrial that has been so successful at blaming their customers when their stinking product fails? 5, 14 It’s astonishing.  Every hospital has all these quality measures. 8 Primary care doctors are being rated on their treatment of diabetes and depression and asthma and heart failure. 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 Rehabs have no accountability for outcomes at all, none. 8 AS: We blame it on the addict. 14 MW: Guess who’s really at fault here and really complicit? 18 The state regulatory agencies.  These are licensed facilities that are allowed to lie to people. 9, 10, 13 They deprive them of informed consent. 5, 14 When they walk in the door? 16 There’s a seventy percent chance you’re going to…  MW: A heroin addict walks into a twelve-step rehab. 14, 16 “Suboxone, methadone that’s just substituting one addiction for another. 8, 12, 14 It means you’re not really sober or in recovery. 18 We not only don’t do that here; we will take you off of it if you’re taking it. 11 If you do a twelve-step program it will work.”  That’s a lie.  AS: That’s the informed consent you’re talking about? 5, 14 MW: What informed consent would be...Here we do something called Minnesota Model or twelve-step rehab. 5, 14 This is what we believe in and we believe it works. 9 However, the evidence shows it doesn’t. 17 There’s no evidence it works. 9 There’s this other treatment that has a seventy percent chance of having you in recovery. 12, 13 We don’t believe in it.  That’s informed consent. 5, 14 If you go to an oncologist, when I’m teaching doctors about this, the oncologist knows of a chemotherapy that has a seventy percent chance of putting you in remission but doesn’t tell you about it because she doesn’t believe in it. 12, 14 She prescribes a macrobiotic diet and yoga and your cancer progresses. 10 What would you call that?  Malpractice.  How long would that doctor be in practice before her license was pulled? 11, 12, 13, 14, 17 About two days. 16 That’s what they do in rehabs.  That’s what they’re allowed to do in rehabs. 10 Lie to people. 9 Not only by omission but outright lie to people about what the facts are. 9, 12 The state licensing agencies are totally silent.  MW: It’s all the same crowd.  The licensing agencies are filled with people in recovery typically. 5, 9, 18 AS: Who served on those…  MW: Here at the Alcohol and Drug Agency there are licensed professionals every one of them. 8, 13 The state is basically sanctioning deprivation of informed consent. 5, 14, 19 If anybody wants to do twelve-step rehab after being told what the steps are that’s their decision. 14, 16 I’m not talking about imposing anything on the individual.  Informed consent means you provide the information a reasonable person would want to know to make an informed decision. 5, 12, 14 I have people come here and they’ve been through six rehabs. 9 This is more with alcohol. 6 AS: I’ve heard of many more even with opioids. 6, 9, 13 MW: With opioids, people who are addicted to opioids know about Suboxone and methadone. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 AS: They do but they also feel a lot of pressure from people to not be on them. 9, 10 Especially if they are working a twelve-step program and they are on medication. 14 They’re not allowed to talk about it. 10 MW: Tom  Price the new head of HHS just came out and said...did you see that? 6, 14, 16 AS: Unbelievable.  MW: I’m waiting for, I don’t know who it would be, the Earth is actually flat. 7, 12, 15 Not only is there no climate change caused by humans but it’s also flat. 6, 13, 16, 19 Not only that but the sun revolves around the Earth.  AS: We should wrap up, it’s 11:50.  MW: I know that. 12 We haven’t gotten to a lot of my most important stuff yet. 9 AS: I would love that. 14 MW: In terms of the treatment, we haven’t gotten to the treatment. 12, 13, 17 My view of the evolution.  AS: Let’s do that.  I’ll make an appointment. 12 MW: Actually, email Amanda.  AS: Thank you.  I’ll stop the recording now. 12 MW: Harm reduction when it’s applied to clinical care is an inappropriate treatment. 5, 12, 13, 14, 19 It plays into the twelve-step idea that you’re giving up on people. 9 You’re setting a goal less than full remission. 14 AS: What kind of things do you consider harm reduction? 5, 9, 14 MW: I wouldn’t even call them harm reduction. 5, 14 I would say at the national level you might describe a drug policy that way. 5, 6, 18 We’re talking about ordinary public health policies. 19 AS: Needle exchange and Narcan are under the umbrella of harm reduction. 5, 10, 14 MW: I wouldn’t call that harm reduction. 5, 14 AS: You think that’s a public health measure. 19 MW: Those are public health measures. 19 That’s like putting people with TB in sanitariums so they wouldn’t spread it. 9, 10 AS: Needle exchange should be seen as just a public health issue. 6, 10, 13, 19 MW: Right.  AS: Like giving out condoms for HIV.  MW: You’re playing into it.  You’re facilitating the addiction. 12, 14 That’s why you don’t want to call it harm reduction. 5, 14 It’s a public health measure. 19 It’s how we reduce the spread of AIDS. 5, 10, 14 Don’t you want to do that?  That’s why I don’t use the term. 6, 13, 17 I hate the term. 17 What they really mean by harm reduction is continuing to stay engaged and treat someone who’s not perfectly well. 5, 14, 17, 18 Treating it like a chronic condition. 6 They call it derisively harm reduction. 5, 14 They believe that if you really tried and they really tried you’d be in remission, which is absurd on its face. 18 It took me thirty years to figure it out. 14 This I learned at NIH when I had to talk about a study of treatment with medication. 10, 12, 13, 14 For a variety of reasons researchers use quantitative rather than qualitative outcomes because they have higher statistical power. 6, 7, 13, 17 They use things like percentage of days abstinent or percentage of heavy drinking days or how many drinking days out of thirty. 5, 6, 11, 13, 16 They can use parametric statistics rather than the way I think about outcomes is no response, response. 6, 13, 18 Interestingly enough that’s where the field of depression studies has come to. 10 They don’t look at if the score on something goes up or down.  It’s non-response, response without remission, and remission. 13 The goal is remission.  That’s how I think about outcomes with substance use disorders. 6, 13 The finding on this using this continuous measure was the average on that measure was ten percent less in the drug group compared to the placebo group. 5, 6 The reporters kept asking is ten percent drinking is that meaningful? 5, 11, 13 I’d have to explain it to them, “Your interpretation is incorrect. 10 You’re attributing the mean to every person in that group.”  I don’t know if there was even one person there who reduced it ten percent. 5, 12, 14 If you had a whole bunch of people quit it might result in moving the mean ten percent. 6, 9 AS: It’s also how we look at the data. 13 MW: How we interpret the outcomes. 10 This is an extremely common mistake people make of attributing the mean value to every member of the group. 9 Basically, if you have group one and two there’s a distribution along the variables and its mean is here.  There’s another distribution line here and its mean is here. 9 There’s a lot of overlap but there’s a lot of up here who aren’t here and a lot of people here who aren’t here. 9 It pulls the mean down ten percent.  That’s not what typically happened to people in that group. 9, 15, 18 AS: What would typically happen? 15, 18 That was just the mean.  It could be a bunch of zeros here; it pulls the mean down.  This person may have gone up.  This person went down like that.  A bunch of these people went to zero. 9 That’s what you actually get. 7 AS: My humanities brain would say then we should be treating people as individuals. 9, 13, 19 I would point to a graph on that paper.  Figure  Two, if you look at Figure  Two what you will actually see what happened is more and more people in the drug group achieved recovery than in the placebo group. 5, 6, 7, 9, 15 It wasn’t that the average person reduced it ten percent. 5, 14 It was a bunch of people went to zero, reduced it one hundred percent. 5, 9, 14 There were others that reduced it some and others that didn’t. 5, 14 What I finally figured out what to say about this in terms of what is harm reduction is, “My goal for every patient of mine is full remission. 5, 14, 17 What else would it be?”  Sometimes we don’t get there.  Sometimes we don’t get there right away and sometimes we don’t get there at all. 12, 18, 20 Maybe they’re better in significant ways. 11, 18 Maybe rather than twenty-five heavy drinking days a month they have eight. 5, 6, 11, 16 Is that any better?  That’s a lot better!  That’s how we track outcomes. 16 We track outcomes by continuous variables, drinking days per month, using days per month. 5, 6, 11, 16 You can see incremental progress on a regression. 6, 12 Right?  It would be like saying, in diabetes the primary measure is called the A1C level. 10, 19 You want to keep it below seven.  That would be like saying, if you’re keeping your A1C below seven ninety percent of the time but ten percent of the time it’s above the treatment’s a total failure and it’s your fault. 12, 13, 14 Let’s say you came to me and you were wheezing and coughing and I diagnosed you with asthma.  You were having twenty bad asthma attacks per month and I prescribed some inhalers. 10, 16 In six months, you were only having three asthma attacks a month. 11, 16 Would you consider that progress? 9 Would consider the treatment a total failure and it was your fault? 9, 12, 13, 14 I’m just pointing out these absurdities.  People go, “Yeah, what the hell?”  Here’s another thing that people don’t understand that with all addictions for all but a very few exceptions recovery is achieved through multiple attempts and multiple recurrences. 9, 12, 14, 17, 18 It takes persistent effort over a sustained period of time, sometimes years. 14, 17, 18 The good news being that almost everybody achieves full recovery but not everybody does. 10, 14, 15, 16 When I first started that clinic back in the day this was my first research project. 5, 14, 16 We were able to cut the two-year mortality rate from thirty percent to twenty percent. 14 That’s how sick these people were. 9, 15 One of our mottos here is we don’t just call addiction a disease we treat it like one. 12, 14 Rehab is like sending a diabetic person to a spa for a month then discharging them for support groups and saying whatever you do don’t take medication. 12, 14, 16 God should be enough.  Who would have ever thought that very poor quality counseling, pseudo counseling and education for twenty-eight or thirty days would cure a chronic illness. 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 AS: Apparently a lot of people. 9, 20 I’ve got to stop.  MW: A couple of other things. 11 We used to treat breast cancer with prayer too. 6, 10, 13, 16 We don’t do that anymore.  We shouldn’t be treating addiction with prayer anymore. 12, 13, 14 AA isn’t treatment. 12, 13 It’s a support group.  People ask me if AA works. 9 It works for the people it works for. 9 AS: Who want to be there.  MW: Who want to voluntarily affiliate.  It’s sort of like asking if Catholicism works. 9 It works for Catholics. 9 People come to me with alcohol dependence and have been to so many rehabs. 6 I start them on medication and they get better right away. 12, 14, 18, 20 They say, “Why did nobody tell me about this?”  Tragically I just got a new Suboxone patient. 8, 16 She’d been to multiple rehabs and ended up getting a felony charge and doing time in jail. 17 Nobody had ever recommended Suboxone. 8, 12 I started her on it for the first time. 14 When you see it it’s a miracle. 6 After three days they never think about opioids. 6, 13, 16 They feel normal for the first time they can ever remember. 14, 16 They have energy again, they have motivation, they’re happy. 18 She started crying and said, “Why didn’t somebody tell me about this earlier? 14, 15 I could have avoided a felony charge and jail.  How many years did I waste because nobody told me about this?” 14, 16 AS: It’s criminal. 8 MW: It is criminal. 8 I’m going to be on NBC Dateline sometime in June. 9 That focuses on alcohol but you’ll hear some of the same things. 6, 9, 13 Look for that.

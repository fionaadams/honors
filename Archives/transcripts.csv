Greg Anderson-GA
Amy Sullivan-AS
GA: My name is Greg Anderson. I am the Social Service Supervisor for St. Louis County Public Health Human Services in the area of Chemical Dependency Services. I have been employed with St. Louis County for twenty-four plus years. I have a bachelor's degree in sociology from Minnesota State Mankato. I have a master's degree in social work from the University of Minnesota Duluth. I was born in extreme southeastern Minnesota. I grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota, which is forty miles south of Winona. Went to high school, graduated from there. I already described my college life. I was born in June of 1956. 
AS: Do you give me permission to record this interview?
GA: Yeah. 
AS: I just have to say that. 
GA: Cover the bases. In case my attorney calls sometime. 
AS: So you grew up on a farm outside of Mable, Minnesota and then went to Mankato.
GA: Two years in Winona first, then transferred to Mankato State. 
AS: Oh, okay. So does your family have a history of college education?
GA: Neither my mother or father does. My sister had degrees in both sociology and nursing. 
AS: Did your parents encourage you to go to college?
GA: Absolutely. Growing up in the sixties, early seventies in a small, rural town basically there wasn't a lot of industry. The primary business or industry was farming. I was not in a position to really take on the doo-doo. Allergies and other things. I wasn't in a position to carry on with the family farm, so it was real clear. My sister was eight years older than I. She had gone and went to nursing school at Mankato State University. That was that. Needed to move on, and I was more of a person-oriented person. If I could have handled calculus I would have been a meteorologist. Then I went to look at mass communication journalism, news broadcasting. Spent some time there. Realized I couldn't handle the egos that were present in that area of work, so I slipped into sociology. Got my BA degree and spent three summers as the summer rec program director for the Mable and Canton communities. Had this strong love—my first love outside of family is baseball. I spend a lot of time following that when I'm not working. That's kind of that. 
That got me to the Twin Cities. From 1978 to 1987 when I got married and moved up here I worked in nursing homes. I was a short-time activity assistant, activity director, and then spent probably eight years as a social service director. Basically coordinated admissions, discharged planning, addressing psychosocial needs of nursing home residents while in the nursing home. 
Did that, then met my wife and moved up here. Realized I didn't have a lot of job opportunities with just a sociology degree, so I was one of the first graduating class members of—the advanced generalist program—MSW program—at the University of Minnesota Duluth. UMD had basically discontinued their MSW program, and this was the start up of a new program going more into advanced generalist or generalist practice of doing standard basic social work with advanced education. It was a really enlightening experience for me, and it was really unique because in school for the two years in our class of about twenty something individuals I was basically the only one that had worked in gerontology. Everybody else was Children/Family Services. There were two or three individuals that were dealing with chemical dependency, substance use disorder type things. My interest at the time continued to be geriatric, elderly, assisting and supporting individuals going through the aging process. Being able to assist and support them and the families. The aging process is an evolving process of grieving because as we age we transition. When we transition we lose certain skills and/or certain access or stages of life, and we have to be able to deal with that and then go into the next phase of life. As one gets older, as I currently am, even having more realization and understanding what I witnessed and experienced in the early years. 
Got through school at UMD. Had done an internship here at Children and Family Service, which at that time was St. Louis County Social Services. I was able to do an internship at the county nursing home. Finished that. Was later hired as a child protection worker. Commuted for over a year and a half to Hibbing, Minnesota. So it was a hundred and forty-four mile trip each day to work. After about eighteen months of doing that our first child was born and I had the opportunity to work for the state of Minnesota at the Minnesota Veteran's Home in Silver Bay that had just opened. I spent a year there working on admission coordination. It wasn't a lot in relationship to discharge [unclear]. Basically it was kind of a last phase of life for veterans and veterans' spouses, and in the meantime the program was also looking at adding an Alzheimer's or dementia unit to the program. 
I was there for a year. We were starting to train staff as we looked at opening the additional forty beds in the unit for an Alzheimer's group, but then I was able to return to Duluth and get a job at Chris Jenson County Nursing Home as a discharge planner as Chris Jensen was adding a new role in a rehab unit. With my internship and experience I had established nice relationships in the nursing home, and so they were very happy to bring me on board. I spent two and a half years at the nursing home. Came to the realization—I loved the work—but Duluth and St. Louis County Social Services was going to be my employer probably for the rest of my professional career. I needed to come down to the government service center and get myself established here. I came down in 1995. Spent four plus years as a contract manager. Basically working on purchase of service contracts for various units and divisions anywhere from children family service group homes, home care agencies, board and lodge programs, assisted living programs, chemical dependency treatment programs, mental health centers. I had a very wide variety of experiences within those service areas. I did that until April of 2000. 
In April of 2000 I decided I needed a change. I needed to have more experience, so I became an adult foster care licenser. I was an adult foster care licenser for over two and a half years, and then based on some encouragement I had received from one or two supervisors within the department we were going through a succession plan, we had an iconic adult service supervisor who had been managing both mental health and chemical dependency services for fifteen to twenty years—she was very iconic within the human services community here in Duluth and St. Louis County. She was looking at retirement. I filled a position that had been vacant for two years, so I took on chemical dependency adult protection common entry point, and represented pay services, and my responsibilities have kind of evolved and switched, and so since January of 2003 I have been supervising chemical dependency services.
For the first twelve years I was just supervising services in south St. Louis County, and we ended up doing some restructuring at that time. I took on supervision for all of St. Louis County—both north and south. Got Rule 25 assessors in three different offices. We also have a special project, which has been generated through the county board's commitment to support and try to find resolutions to the opioid epidemic. I have been directing and overseeing substance abuse prevention, intervention initiatives since probably April of 2014. 
AS: How have you observed the opioid crisis? You've been dealing with substance abuse professionally since when did you say?
GA: 2003. 
AS: You have a decade plus experience seeing what's happening in your community. What have you witnessed?
GA: Coming in in 2003 the primary substance of choice was alcohol. Alcohol is still seen as number one. There have been a few cycles and trends that have changed. We get into the later 2000s, maybe starting 2006, 2007 we had an incredible upswing in methamphetamine. We were basically dealing with that on two different fronts. Not only the effect it was having on the individuals and family through the use, but also the public health crisis we were dealing with through the manufacturing. A lot of money, a lot of resources were put into that. We actually worked through a collaboration through Children and Family Services unit and through our Financial Assistance unit we were working on setting up a shared family program where basically mothers and/or parents dealing with substance use would be placed into an adult foster home, or actually it would end up being a dually licensed foster home where a parent and child could be placed together to assist and support during the initial phases of the recovery process. A lot of barriers in place from a state perspective in regards to funding. Funding for adults, for residential services through what is called the Group State Residential Housing Program has significant effects on the Minnesota Family Investment Program, MFIP. So using 1) has impacts on others, and I can't get into great detail right now because my memory's kind of faded. We operated it for about two to three years, but there were continuing barriers in regards to getting the appropriate level of funding and getting families to accept what was needing to be done from a financial assistance standpoint. 
AS: So you were trying to put parents in recovery with their children in order so that their children didn't have to be away from them, but they were being supervised by some other caregiver or adult.
GA: Yeah. Monitoring, mentoring, those types of—
AS: And you weren't able to coordinate the different funding streams in order to make it work the way you imagined it? 
GA: It got to be very frustrating. We had actually before I had come into this position there had been ongoing discussions in the past regarding trying to do this for parents dealing with mental illness. This was a continuation. There were some barriers in regards to the funding streams. The state has worked very hard in trying to get things in place in relationship to the efforts to reduce homelessness and provide permanent support of housing services. I'm not sure if some of those things may have now changed. We haven't really taken a look at that. In recent times we've been looking at other projects in relationship to harm reduction for chronic inebriates who face long-term homelessness. We have a program called the San Marco, which was basically a project that has been modeled in several other communities not only within the state of Minnesota, but also throughout the country. Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment and Center City Housing were key players in that. St. Louis County Public Health and Human Services provided a supportive role in the development. We worked with assistance in utilizing a group residential housing financial assistance benefit to provide funding for those individuals meeting those characteristics. As a matter of fact we're having a ten-year anniversary of it's opening on June 22nd. Alcohol consumption is not a—
AS: Do they call those a wet house? That might be extreme.
GA: That's a common term. We've kind of shifted from a wet house to a supportive housing for chronic inebriates. That's just another example of what the collaboration and commitment of a community can do to address it. I wish I still had a DVD—a DVD was made I think two years after the opening—and it's called ""There Are No Losers,"" and it's a very telling story. They bring tears to some. I'll have to see if I can find it in my office. Law enforcement was real, I don't want to say cynical, but they had some real concerns about putting this together, and basically the end of the DVD is a very moving statement by our then police chief in regards to the program and what it has done not only for the individuals residing there, but for the positive impact on the city and community. 
AS: That is a harm reduction model. 
GA: It is. When you walk out of our office, our building, if you look one block over and up San Marco is there. It is 230 West 3rd Street. It actually has seventy units. Thirty is the board and watch component for the inebriates, and we have forty single room SRO units for individuals. Basically the SRO is geared—we have our Human Development Center which is a community mental health center—they provide supportive services for individuals in the SRO in the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment provides the services for the individuals in the board watch. 
AS: To get back to meth—you saw that was a crisis, you tried to do a housing situation, then—
GA: There were a lot of resources being allocated for this. There were enhanced services for Children or Family Services to provide support, direction, and intervention for those families afflicted with the issue. Things kind of, well at least from our standpoint, things fell to the wayside for a period of time, and I think the biggest thing was from a law enforcement standpoint being able to focus and reduce, and not ever totally eliminate, but greatly reduce the labs in the community. 
AS: Were they in houses in Duluth?
GA: Yeah. They were in Duluth, rural Duluth—
AS: I've heard of them in rural areas, but you actually had them here in the city?
GA: Yeah. I can think of at least three or four instances of those being in homes in Duluth. Basically it wasn't necessarily in lower income areas that this was occurring. It had no boundaries in relationship to income. 
AS: Yeah, that myth is being busted right now. 
GA: It's really coming back. Meth is also very, very prevalent. But, things really slowed down probably, and I'm guessing, 2010, 2011. We're just kind of going along. We were dealing with issues, but things were really coming to light, things were really becoming noticeable in 2011, 2012. In late 2012 the then commissioner of the Department of Human Services came up to Duluth with community leaders, I believe our police chief was a part of this panel and presentation, but I want to say it was Lucinda Jesson who was the Department of Human Services Commissioner at that time. Long story short she came in and she was discussing the state's direction to put together and implement a substance use state plan to address substance use. 
AS: She came up from St. Paul?
GA: She came up from St. Paul. I believe there may have been—I think the Minnesota Department of Health and I think another state department was there along with our Chief of Police at the time Gordon Ramsey. We were excited that this was taking place. I attended the session along with our adult service division director Mark Nelson. At the time our north St. Louis County MCD supervisor Mike [unclear], and we also had in attendance a professor from the University of Duluth's school of pharmacy Mark Sneiderhan, and the CEO of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment Gary Olson, Dr. Faris Keeling, and Dr. Beth Bilden from Essentia—at that point it was St. Mary's Duluth clinic. We had some other treatment providers there, but this group started talking after the session, and that discussion led to a series of meetings, which basically was the first step for the development of our Opioid Abuse Response Strategies work group. That's an overview. 
AS: You had seen the impact in St. Louis County in 2012 was still there, right? 
GA: Yeah. At that point in time the primary concern was focused on prescription opioids. As conversations came about reviews, discussions, as time went on basically there came to be greater monitoring and control of prescription medications. When those were no longer easily accessed, the entrepreneurship of others reflecting back on supply and demand basically said they can't have prescription medications, but we have something that will fit their need and we will be able to provide it at a price that will be good for us and affordable for them. That started to swing or shift into heroin. 
The second page of this references an appearance of two OARS [Opioid Abuse Response Strategies] members, which was basically myself and our first Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative team member [Marsha Gertel]. We were interviewed on Almanac North. Almanac North is a spin-off of Almanac on Channel 2 in the Twin Cities. Basically those questions were posed to us and we kind of went through them. There had been a major heroin bust I think the day before—the date we were on Almanac North was Good Friday of 2014. There was a major heroin bust either Wednesday or Thursday of that week, and based on that Channel 8 had called Dana Kazel, the communication manager, and was wanting to get some response from St. Louis County in relationship to this. Through that our department was contacted. Our Adult Service Division director was unable to attend, so basically it went to myself and [Marsha Gertel] and we did the interview with two hosts of the program.
The OARS group basically ended up having discussions and leading up to a proposal put together through our then—I think it was late 2000s—our Public Health department and Social Service department merged into Public Health and Human Services. Our Public Health and Human Services department proposed to the county commissioner's developing our Substance Use Prevention Intervention Initiative. Through a unanimous vote in January 2014 they basically approved the allocation of four FTE's to provide prevention/intervention services throughout St. Louis County to address issues relating to substance abuse. 
That's our latest draft of our pamphlet or brochure. As you can tell—yeah. [shows the pamphlet] So, that basically gives you the description of what we do in relationship to assisting and supporting individuals, families, and communities throughout St. Louis County. We will do things from public education, trainings, we'll do consultations within a department and family members or others that are calling and concerned and wanting direction or ideas.
AS: So people can reach OARS?
GA: We're basically an extension of OARS. It was through OARS that this program was founded. OARS came first. 
AS: That's interesting because what I take from that is that opioid crisis led to thinking about substance abuse prevention and intervention more broadly. Is that true?
GA: I think that's very fair. That's basically what we are looking at. 
AS: You didn't necessarily have coordinated services here, but you decided to expand this to include all substance use rather than just opioids. 
GA: Yeah. We are doing a lot of our focus on the opioid piece. We do what is called expedited Rule 25 assessments for Children and Family Services. We have an incredibly high rate of out of home placement. Kids in foster care or other licensed facilities and programs related to parental substance use. We have a parent or parents that come in who are at risk of losing their children. They are in borderline crisis or in crisis. If they are willing and wanting we'll do the assessment, oftentimes right then if one of our workers is available, either [Matt Johnson] or [Marsha Gertel]. We also have a social worker in north St. Louis County. He's based in Hibbing, but we'll be able to go and if not exactly that day then the next day. It happens very quickly. 
Let me see if I can find [rustling through papers]. Minnesota Department of Health has put together some annual—I can probably forward you through the Minnesota Department of Health—it's basically data, statistics on overdoses in Minnesota. It does a county breakdown. I have basically broken things down for St. Louis County through 2015. The 2016 statistics should be coming out at any point, but we are up to through 2015 right now. You can take a look at the overdoses related to opioids. This is based on admissions to licensed chemical dependency treatment programs. It's not necessarily dealing with individuals, but admissions. 
AS: Because some people might go in three times in a year. 
GA: Yeah, as you well know from personal experience. 
AS: Can you talk to me about the climate of collaboration and cooperation that you think Duluth has, and is doing a good job? Why do you think that is? What are the factors?
GA: I don't know if it is something in the drinking water. I mean it's something that I witnessed when I first came to the community in 1987, and there is just something here that is just part of the culture and the value of being able to work together and support each other even though we may not agree on other various items or values in life. When we have a common purpose or see a problem that needs to be solved we can push our differences aside to work jointly and in a collaborative fashion. We submitted a grant proposal to the Department of Human Services for approximately 1.3 million dollars for the state targeted response to the opioid crisis. The state of Minnesota received 5.3 million dollars for 2017 and 2018 through legislation that was pushed and supported very hard by Senator [Amy] Klobuchar to address the opioid crisis for rural communities. 
AS: Did you say the state got five million?
GA: Yeah. 5.3 million. 
AS: That was for rural?
GA: Yeah. I'll see if I can send you a PowerPoint and some handouts that will give you even more information. 
AS: So you just turned that in?
GA: We submitted that on April 28th [2017]. St. Louis County Public Health Human Service submitted a proposal as the lead partner in a consortium with Duluth Police Department, Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force, Rural AIDS Action Network, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, University of Minnesota Duluth School of Pharmacy, six judicial district drug courts, and Carleton County Public Health and Human Service.
AS: So it's for St. Louis and Carleton County?
GA: Carleton County will receive no financial benefit from the application, but the things that we're doing will allow Carleton County residents access to particular things in relationship to drug court and probably the star component in this proposal is the development of a medically monitored opioid withdrawal program through Duluth Detox. Basically it's a six-bed expansion of the Duluth Detox program, which is managed by the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, who collaborated and helped facilitate the San Marco program. Basically this will be for individuals to go through medical withdrawal with nurses and doctors monitoring. There will be medication that they need. The Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment also has the Clear Path program, which is a medication assisted treatment program, which utilizes both methadone and Suboxone. 
We went through a significant borderline crisis situation back in I want to say 2013. We had a methadone program, and I don't want to get sued for what I'm about to say, but we had a methadone program called Lake Superior Treatment Center. Basically they were going through significant concerns and issues in relationship to meeting licensing. State Rule 31 licensing requirements. I want to say it was either in 2012 or 2013 their license was revoked, which put the state of Minnesota in a crisis situation because they were one of five or six programs under the same company based out of state. In the state of Minnesota when a license is revoked it is revoked for all programs under the parent company. If they would have closed Lake Superior Treatment Center they would have ended up closing I think three or four programs in the Twin Cities, one in St. Cloud, and one in Rochester. 
[section omitted]
AS: But the other place was a licensing issue about the way they were monitoring the methadone?
GA: Yeah, there was a long list, but things are set up where if a provider appeals the revocation they can maintain operation through the appeal process. The appeal process went through about a two plus year time period. During the initial onset of this we were meeting with the Department of Human Services state contingency plans if something ended up playing out and the program was closed. As a result through collaboration with the OARS group St. Louis County put out an ROP for a community based treatment program. We received a number of proposals. We ended up doing personal or presentations by three finals in the area and we basically ended up reviewing and choosing the Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment. Gary Olson, the CEO, had been talking about putting something together four or five years prior to this piece, so this raised the level of need. Gary and the Center are just so reflective of the collaboration and the efforts to do things. 
AS: He's from here? He owns it?
GA: He's from here. It's a non-profit. He's the chief executive officer that's been working and dealing with this stuff for thirty plus years. 
AS: You picked someone that also reflects the community itself. 
GA: Yes. Focusing on community needs. Gary is very adamant about this being a public health issue because it has such an impact on individuals' families in the overall community. It's very reflective of what we are trying to do as the OARS group. 
AS: Is he on OARS?
GA: Yeah. 
AS: You keep all the people who've got their hands in this issue around the table?
GA: Yeah. We meet every two months. Our next meeting is June 15th. If your calendar allows you can certainly—I can send you an appointment. We meet on the second floor. It's a really exciting time. Based on what was sent out in relationship to the grant proposal we might be hearing tomorrow on whether or not—they were talking twenty-one days. It's such a tight timeline. The state submitted their plan in January, and basically these programs are supposed to be running by July 1st. Basically the awards have to be done and then the contract and negotiation piece between the awardees and DHS. They basically have the contract signed and get things in place on July 1st. It's been a real interesting process. 
AS: You were saying one of the things it includes is six more beds, managed detox. What are some of the other parts that you think are special or particular?
GA: A rapid response for overdose victims. We're collaborating with Duluth police, the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force. Jeff Kazel can give you a lot more detail with that. What we are doing through this particular piece we are looking at an expansion of Narcan or naloxone access. Being able to provide naloxone or Narcan and training to use that substance. The target is all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. I think sometimes I get lost in the details—I'm not sure if that's also going to possibly include other emergency responders, but definitely all law enforcement agencies throughout St. Louis County. 
We're going to be partnering through our substance use prevention intervention initiative our social workers to provide rapid response in regard to follow up support. We're going to try to get out and see the individual in one or two days. If it's a Friday evening we probably wouldn't be able to do anything until Monday. Being able to get out to the individual, provide them a Rule 25 assessment, which is the first step in access in treatment, and provide other alternatives or supports that may be applicable or necessary. Trying to establish that contact as early on as possible to get things in place to provide support. 
AS: It's filling a gap where there haven't been enough resources or enough people to treat this quickly. 
GA: We're hoping that this will be a nice fit in regards to the detox expansion. The thing is we all know the need is going to exceed the supply, but Duluth Detox will be able to bring individuals in and provide a place for them to stay so they can get in the program. Gary Olson and Duluth Detox is going to be working with north St. Louis County Range Detox in Virginia [Minnesota] being able to go into Range Detox and staying at Range Detox until they are going to be able to be brought out to the Duluth Detox program. We'll be working on other ways, too. If possible openings are available. There have been discussions about transportation to and from Ely and bringing people down. 
The thing that gets lost with St. Louis County is geographically it is bigger than three states within the mainland. We've got a large geographical area. Another thing too, which we're reminded on a regular basis too, is that St. Louis County is so massive we're dealing with services and issues related to both urban and rural settings. We need to be able to understand and put things in place to address things for both areas. It helps me having grown up on a small farm to be able to better connect and understand some of those things. There are always discussions about, ""This happens here. That happens there."" “Shouldn't it be the same?” Well, you've got an apple and you've got an orange. We can't make orange juice with an apple. We can't make apple pie with an orange. Although we can have apple juice and orange juice. May not have been a great metaphor. 
AS: In an ideal world, from where you stand today, how do you think this crisis can be solved? From your vantage point as being someone who is figuring out where the money is coming from and going. Do you see this being solved anytime soon?
GA: It needs to be a community effort, and that's why we've got who we've got in the OARS group. It's been so well documented throughout the past four or five years from law enforcement and judicial legal system we can't arrest ourselves out of this problem. We need to address this from both a prevention and intervention standpoint. We need to provide the support and services for those individuals dealing with the addiction, and we need to be able to outreach and provide education and support for the community so they have a better understanding of what addiction is, what the substances, the drugs, can do to an individual, and in the process also communicate the fact that individuals are not dealing with this by choice. They are dealing with this because they are afflicted with a disease. 
One of the key points we are trying to work on on a constant basis is the stigma. We need to be able to remove the stigma associated with chemical dependency and addiction. There is a similar effort that needs to be done in regards to mental health. With the stigma it is very hard for an individual to come up and say, ""I'm addicted to heroin. I need help,"" because there are so many signs and reactions from people like, ""Oh, get out of here. You're not worth anything. You're doing this because you want to. You're making bad choices because you want to. Just get out of here. I don't have time to help you."" That type of thing. 
I think there has been some progress made. Just through discussions and experiences, and fortunately I don't have first-hand experience with this. I've been blessed so far with my own family. In listening to others they've seen what's going on with others, their spouse, their child, or their sibling, and they see and understand the fact that they're not doing this by choice. Through that—that just amplifies the importance of the support groups such as Nar-Anon that Verne Wagner is so involved with because it's through those mutual experiences that people share. It ends up being a snowball that we like to have because good things are going to grow through the passing of this information and communication. We need to address things both from prevention and intervention and prevention. We're not going to solve a lot just by addressing one thing. We are reactive instead of proactive and we have to be both. 
AS: How did you come by your education around chemical dependency? Did you go to school for it? Have you learned on the job?
GA: I've basically learned on the job. Through life experience, too. In my younger days when I was down in the Twin Cities and the more social active lifestyle I was in relationships with individuals that started out great and then all of a sudden it was like A, B, C, and D. This isn't good. Ended up leaving a relationship and getting into another relationship and all of a sudden the same thing starts happening. And it's like, wow. The interesting piece—I established a good friendship with one particular individual in grad school who was a part of the CD [chemical dependency] group in a veteran's hospital. Listening to his stories on individuals and the dynamics that were tied in relationship to addiction. Hearing that kind of explained my earlier life experiences. 
Basically through the work. It doesn't matter if you're doing child protection or working with the elderly: chemical dependency and addiction is going to be part of your work. One of the things we are working on from a department standpoint through our Substance Abuse Prevention Intervention Initiative is attempting to put substance use disorder training as a core training function for new social workers, new employees coming into the department. We're not there yet, but we're getting much closer. We have a wonderful training department within St. Louis County. We've done a lot of work with them basically getting quarterly trainings set up. Parental substance use disorder, the ABC's of addiction. We do SBIR [Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral] training—which is brief intervention and referral to treatment—which is a screening piece that can be done by anybody. You don't need a Ph.D. or a master's. You don't need a college education to be able to do this. Basically it's being able to ask some open ended questions and allow an individual to share and be able to listen to their own situation and develop their own enlightenment to the risks that are involved. Where the individual is at it can be as easy as saying, well, you need to get someone to drive you home at night. Or, I have some phone numbers for you to call. I think it would be really good for you to get an assessment to see possibly if you might be eligible or if chemical dependency treatment might be a good direction for you to go. 
AS: Do you see it as an education not just for professionals, but for everyone? We seem to be sorely lacking public education around substance use. It reminds me of sex education and how political it gets, and what a disservice we are doing to young, growing sexual beings.
GA: It's a tough and very uncomfortable conversation, which is conflicting with values that have been installed with us. 
AS: It's as if we don't have any trust in people to make decisions for their own health. 
GA: Absolutely. Part of our program, what I'll call the 'sappy program' is we're trying to get, and we still have to do some work on this, basically being able to—we've had some experiences with school districts throughout St. Louis County. We've worked on trying to provide some support, SBIR training, to employment agencies. 
AS: SBIR?
GA: Screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment. Referral to treatment isn't necessarily going to chemical dependency treatment, but it's referring services. You can find a lot of information on SBIR. It was a best practice established in ERs, not necessarily for substance abuse. It can be a very useful tool. It's something we encourage. We've done SBIR training now for over two years now within St. Louis County for social workers, probation officers, public health nurses. 
AS: People who have contact with other human beings and trying to help. 
GA: Trying to expand a professional or personal toolbox. 
AS: Thank you. This has been really good. I really appreciate the heart you seem to have for this. I don't think people in these buildings with state jobs or county jobs get a lot of credit for the heart that they do have. Even though you're writing grants and doing all this stuff you have your heart in it. 
GA: It's contagious. Basically the energy and the commitment of the others that I work with have and display regarding this. You can take some credit for that too with this interview. I've been in situations where you're talking to someone but you're really not sure the purpose and intent, and you get a little guarded and concerned about how you are saying it. Matt Johnson, one of our social workers, and I did a fifteen minute radio piece with KDAL 610 last Wednesday. Tom Hanson, who was the radio person that we were working with, and he was bouncing in and out of weather and international news and local news and that type of thing, but he went out of his way just for conversation to establish a more personal type of atmosphere. Once things started—it doesn't often happen but Matt and I got done with that interview and we felt really good about what we're doing, what we said, what we communicated. 
AS: It's really good work. I'm really happy to have the chance to come up here. 
GA: It's important. Any time we get the chance to share what we're doing for others to experience or read it's an expansion or an extension to what we're doing. We've got an information card that we're going to start producing. Law enforcement will have it at RAAN [Rural AIDS Action Network] where basically for individuals it's kind of on two sides—it's resources: Range Treatment Center, Center for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, United Way 211 information and referral. That's a key piece. On the inside we're going to have risk reduction points: always use a clean needle, don't use with—harm reduction safety points. I'm blanking on some of the key points. I'll forward you some of the stuff. The Minnesota Department overdose reports.  
AS: Thank you. This was really helpful. "

TB: I think to put it short what we do here has very much to do with a pragmatic approach. Pragmatism is, in my view, the way to go about it along with the harm reduction approach. We ask ourselves what is useful, not what should be, what would be the best possible aim or goal. We don’t think too much about therapeutic illusions or fantasies, which is very common in medication therapy. Focusing on abstinence and considering that the majority of the patients we are treating here is not going for abstinence at the moment. This has to be respected. 
AS: By abstinence what do you mean? 
TB: From any substance. All of the substances. The abused substance has been alcohol. I think that is one of the problems in alcohol therapy. Historically, it is based on abstinence and that is why it doesn’t work that well. That is why it is not that successful. Quite a few of our patients, I would say the majority, don’t want to abstain from alcohol. They are rather thinking about reduction or using in a more controlled way. That is a reasonable goal with most of our patients. They resonate with it. 
The old pattern of addiction therapy has been to push patients into abstinence. Make them think that they want to go for abstinence. It is like a brainwash. In society it is more of a moral thing, in a way. Abstinence is good and substance use is evil. It has to be wiped out. All these fantasies about substance free societies. It is an illusion. It is a ruse.
AS: There are people who can handle substances and there are people who can’t. 
TB: That is one thing. In political discussions when I try to get this over to politicians they still think that substances are dangerous, which is not true. I know that is a provocative thing to say. The majority of people use any substance in a controlled way. This is the case for heroin, which is unknown. Most of the people out there think that heroin is very dangerous and if you use it once you are hooked. That isn’t true. We know from studies -- in Switzerland there was a study, too -- and studies in the UK, there is a big group of heroin users that have no problem with using it in a controlled way and in a recreational way. This is the case with heroin, alcohol, and cocaine. 
There is a minority of people being vulnerable for genetic reasons, growing up in a bad environment that are vulnerable to the action of psychoactive substances in a self medicating way, probably. That’s not their fault. This happens and it is a fact that we cannot avoid. This is about fifteen to twenty percent of regular users with this risk. In my view this is a fact we have to accept. It is part of the solidarity -- we owe it to these people to stand up and help them and not judge them and punish them. We need to try to help them manage their vulnerability as best as possible. This is also possible. That’s another story -- once addicted always addicted, which is not true either. Addiction, or dependency, is a state you can manage. 
There are long-term studies, prospective studies for twenty or thirty years that follow people up. This is also the case when we ask our patients in treatment: What did you go through? They tell us they have been abstinent for ten years and they started to use again and they used controllably and then shifted into out of control use again, dependent use, and then they stopped again. This is not a linear development from abstinence into total catastrophe of addiction. We still don’t quite understand the factors contributing to why people stop after ten years of use. We still don’t know. Sometimes we think therapy might have to do with it, but on the other hand --
AS: What kind of therapy?
TB: Addiction therapy. It might help people come to grips better. Sometimes I think they have decided before they come to therapy that they wanted to change and that’s why they come. We assist in a natural process that they would go through anyways. 
AS: You reinforce what they already are doing.
TB: Yes, what they already want. I’m not quite sure we really contribute. I think what we can do for sure is help to reduce harm. This is for sure. 
AS: Can you talk about what harm reduction means to you as a physician? I was talking with another historian last night who does HIV and drug stuff and he’s saying that what he has realized is that depending on where you are in the world the word harm reduction has different meanings. Can you describe what harm reduction means for you here in this clinic in Switzerland?
TB: One point is that it is something very individual depending on the individual patient. Each person we assist. It is trying to help this person to use substances in a controlled way, in a way with as least risk as possible. That’s it. This is individual harm reduction. 
There is also the political side to harm reduction. We try to involve ourselves into the political process to help get the framework adapted that harm reduction is possible. I think politically there are goals that are not very useful that way. It is not useful to criminalize users. This is causing harm. So, if we tried to engage in harm reduction we have to see that those are adapted. We try to work on that, which is rather difficult at the moment. 
AS: There is political opposition to harm reduction? What is going on?
TB: Switzerland went through a very important process back in the nineties. The situation was that bad. This was the biggest opiate drug scene worldwide. This made Swiss politicians and Swiss society move. That was rocking our system. This made the four-pillar policy possible. 
AS: Because of the extreme nature of the problem. 
TB: There was a lot of pressure. Now, we are suffering of the success of this approach because the opiate scene has disappeared. The opiate dependent people are not seen in public anymore. There is no problem perceived. So, politicians and society have forgotten the lessons we learned back in the nineties. No more problems. The questions coming up about why we should continue to pay for treatments. It is a recession and there is not enough money. People are thinking of how to save money. In times like this you start to think about shortage of budgets like this. The first priority is to cut budgets of minority focus. 
AS: How many patients do you serve here in a year or a day?
TB: It is about two thousand patients. We are running four outpatient clinics. We employ a staff of about one hundred and twenty people. Nine hundred are in substitution treatment, opiate [unclear] treatment, which was our starting point. We were founded shortly before the needle park closed -- was shut down. We started with low threshold opiate substitution -- methadone treatment at that time. That was twenty-five years ago. Now, we have evolved into being active in the whole field of addiction medicine. All substances. 
AS: You’re model went from opiates to everything? We have the exact opposite. 
TB: We transferred our harm reduction approach into the whole of addiction treatment. I’m very proud of that. I’m working hard to push this approach. I think we are getting on in the addiction medicine field. They start to slowly understand this approach. But, not all of them have. 
AS: Even here?
TB: Yes, even here. 
AT: As a therapist you need a personal kind of evolution into that, too. I remember in the beginning when I was more like, “Okay, it is doable. I can do this. I can be abstinent.” Over time you can think, “It’s just not going to happen.”
TB: You’ve got to become and accept things. Accept the patient. Accept the people that come to treatment. It is about respect and taking them as they are. In many addiction treatment programs this still isn’t the case. Still very much like abstinence oriented and not trying to understand about the values of this person. It is about the aim of treatment that will be abstinence. It’s just not perceiving the person as a human being with values and individual goals. That is the point about individualized treatment. It isn’t general goals, it tailoring treatment to the needs of the individual patient. That is one very important part of this harm reduction approach. Accepting that some people have their own concepts -- whatever! I’m not the one to judge who is right and who is wrong. Why they use substances. I’m just trying to help them to make the best of it. 
AS: Would you mind giving me some background on your career? How did you into psychiatry and addiction medicine?
TB: Well, I started as a psychiatrist. When I was in my internship at that time I was forced, because there were vacancies, into the addiction world. I was forced to work there. This is a stigmatized field. Psychiatry is stigmatized in the first place, and then within psychiatry addiction is stigmatized again. 
AS: Why is psychiatry stigmatized?
TB: First of all it isn’t paid well. We are amongst the lowest income group in medicine. 
AT: Child psychiatrists are lower. 
TB: So we are low. 
AS: I’m glad I asked. 
TB: I know surgeons are ten-fold. That is one point. The other point is the perception that it’s a frustrating job with no results. 
AS: Because you are dealing with mental illness. 
TB: No sufficient results. All of that stuff. That is the same in addiction therapy as well. They are lying; it’s not working, and whatever. This is the result of the wrong approach. If you are going into treatment with somebody and you expect them to do something they don’t actually want no wonder it doesn’t work! This has to be frustrating. We try to advocate for --
AS: That is a great point. It is the approach. 
TB: We battle with resistance forever and feel bad and frustrated -- both the patient and the doctor. If you choose to find the right approach and just try to meet these people where they are and invite them into a therapeutic process that’s a collaborative process. I don’t know what is right for this individual guy. This is interesting for me as well to find with every single patient what is important for him or her. What should the goal be? And to develop options. This is interesting and not frustrating at all. 
AS: Go back to how you got forced into it.
TB: I started to find out that the patients there were people as well. They were interesting. I like working with people anyways. I got fascinated with seeing how stigmatized they were and how much they stigmatized themselves. This was such a treat for me. And seeing how much could be improved and done, or how badly the system was working. From then on I was hooked. I was fascinated by how much could be done.
AS: For the better. 
TB: For the better. There is so much that should be and could be improved. There is incredible potential to help and to make things better and create a better society as well. I am still intrigued. I am still fighting and working for this. 
AS: How long have you been here?
TB: I started to work here in ‘97. This is the twentieth year now. 
AS: You said you talk to politicians. Can you describe your job here and what you do outside of dealing with patients?
TB: Arud [Centers for Addiction Medicine] has always been a political organization as well, a pressure group. This is because we are a private charity. We don’t have to obey any government regulations. Most of my colleagues are working in state clinics and they cannot speak up. They have to be careful about that. We try to use this as an asset. 
AS: Do you collect information from them?
TB: Part of my work is to network and try to get specialists and Society of Addiction Medicine to organize that. To get the specialists together to lobby for improvement of policy. We work with the state authorities. 
AS: If you are a private charity do you get government assistance?
TB: No. We actually function like a private practice. 
AS: When you were talking about the government trying to cut funding you meant for state-run agencies. 
TB: We have the four pillars, we have consumption rooms, and we have stuff like that. We talk about cutting budgets of these places. In society we have fifty five percent of Swiss people now that think substitution treatment shouldn’t be covered by insurance anymore because it is their fault. 
AS: There has already been a swing back. 
TB: Yes. There has always been a majority of Swiss people remembering the experience from the nineties where the success was so obvious of the low-threshold harm reduction oriented therapy. The acceptance was high. There was sixty-five or seventy percent pro-substitution treatment. Now it has shifted. 
AS: Do you think part of that is the general swing towards the right that we’ve been seeing?
TB: It is this neoliberalism thing. 
AS: It is not just that the problem of heroin addiction is being controlled. 
TB: Like saying that obese people should pay more for health insurance because they eat too much and that creates problems and causes costs and they have to cover themselves. This is the discussion, which is absolutely useless in my view because this is not their personal decision that they choose to use heroin and are fully responsible for it and they cover all the costs. That is not the way it goes. That’s a discussion in the health treatment system: thinking how we can cut costs. Make the people pay themselves. 
AS: What about the disease model of addiction? We are still talking about this in the United States. 
TB: Yes, I know. Nora Volkow is really strong on that. 
AS: The surgeon general just came out with that. In our society it is still a new concept. I’m wondering if yours is different. 
TB: The disease model has been useful, I think, as a first step to fight stigma. Then it shifted from moral to a disease. Now I think we are stuck with the disease model and it is not that useful in my view. 
AS: How does it fit into this? If you are diseased you have to do what someone tells you to do to get better. 
TB: Yeah. It is not just fate. I think there are factors contributing to dependent behavior and risk factors might add up in a syndrome that looks like a disease. It is not something we have a pill to cure. It is much more complex and there are so many other factors contributing, also societal factors. I think there are societies that cause vulnerability and make people use substances in a problematic way. It is not the individual’s fault. There are so many ways to manage this behavior. It is not just fate and nothing to be done about it. You cannot just take the medicine and see how it develops. I’m not so happy with the disease model because it deprives the individual of their autonomy, in a way. 
AS: It creates a dependency. 
TB: It is a habit that there is nothing to be done about and that is not true. 
AS: A typical addiction doctor in the US would explain it as similar to diabetes. It is a way to frame it because we do care about diabetics. 
TB: I think it is good in the discussion about stigmatization because diabetes is not as stigmatized. If you make the analogy that is good. 
AS: Heart disease is another one that they use. 
TB: Talking about diabetes there are many things to manage besides taking pills. It is about a healthy lifestyle and living another type of lifestyle, maybe. There are many things the individual can do, and that is the case. In general in psychiatry we deal with chronic conditions. It is not so much about healing or making it disappear. It is more about managing something; managing yourself. 
Also talking about schizophrenia for example. We have no right to push schizophrenic patients to medicate with neuroleptics, for example. That is their point to decide whether they want to use medication or not. To decide if medication might help them on their way as one factor or not. It is not the silver bullet. It is just one possibility to assist. This might work for some and others it might not. 
AS: Is that how schizophrenics are treated here in general?
AT: Psychopharmacology is probably the cornerstone of the treatment; you can’t get around it. 
TB: There are clinics where the patients are pretty much forced to take the medication, which in my view is not the right thing to do. 
AS: Even if they were going to self-harm?
TB: People have the rights to self-harm. In my position I try to inform them as best I can of the possible risks. If they still continue to self-harm I think I have to go along with this. That doesn’t mean I am happy with it. I am still, as a professional identity, I don’t approve this, but I accept their way. I think life is dangerous. Everything is dangerous in life. If we wanted to avoid all dangers we couldn’t live. Taking substances is dangerous, driving a car is dangerous, and it is how much danger you want to take that is an individual decision. I think in my view it is free will. I don’t think society -- as long as you harm only yourself, we don’t have that much of a right to interfere. That’s my individual opinion. 
AS: Would you say your opinion is an outlier?
TB: No, I think there is an argument now in general about how much interference of the state is acceptable. That is a public health discussion. How much should the government make their citizens behave in a certain way? There is no right or wrong to that. That is a norm you have to decide on. 
AS: Do you see people here -- patients, is that what you call them here?
TB: Patient, clients. 
AS: How many would you say have a co-occurring mental health issue?
TB: Practically all. That is who we have here that come to treatment. The ones we see here in treatment. There are so many studies in that as well, that co-occurring psychiatric diseases is three to four -- not only one. That has to do with our system of diagnosis, the DSM. You end up having quite a few disorders. There are so many co-occurring disorders. Schizophrenia is about ten percent of the population we treat here. In the general population it is about one percent, so it is ten fold. We see about thirty to thirty-five percent with ADHD. The general population is about four percent. About forty to fifty percent with depressive and panic disorders, or personality disorders. Those are just the psychiatric disorders. Disorders like infections, hepatitis C, HIV, liver diseases. 
AS: When a person comes in seeking treatment for addiction are they evaluated for other things right away? Is that integrated in a way? 
TB: they come here with a substance problem because we are an addiction clinic. Our job then is to try to check them for other disorders, which isn’t that easy in the beginning because they don’t want to see a shrink. They come for a substance disorder, and if you start asking them about psychiatric problems that might be hard for them. That is our job to try to involve them into disciplinary approach. We work in a very integrated way in psychiatry: internal medicine, we have social work. We try to offer everything under one roof because [unclear] are so frequent in our experience I can understand. It is very difficult if you have to see three or four doctors for all the different disorders you have to treat all together in one place. And then we try to prioritize and treat the disorder that is most impairing at the moment for the patient; the problem the patient wants to work on. We try to motivate them to get a sense of their other disorders and motivate them to get into treatment there as well, but we cannot force them. 
AT: It is very modest -- the scope that you can actually engage them to work on. There are low levels of resources then the goals are going to be small. 
AS: The resources in the person?
TB: Yeah. You have to adapt therapy to the resources of the client or the patient. It is a very important process to try to identify how much this person can do, what he wants to do, and focus on that and not try to make them understand that they should do this. It is important to inform them and offer them information and education, but they have to make the decision. To go along with their decision. That is very important.
AT: I find myself trying to tone down the expectations of patients. They come in and are already burdened with all the expectations gathered from the environment they are living in. I say, “No, you can’t do that. We have to take this step by step.” “Yeah, but I want this.” “No, this is what you can do. Then we will see where it goes.”
TB: That is the problem. The extrinsic motivation is so strong. We try to evocate that motivation. It is the only motor that really works. As you said, very often if we see the patients the first time they are in a crisis. What is their first idea when they go through a difficult time in their life? I have to stop using. Then they think that is the solution because that is what they hear from all over: it is bad that you use and you should stop. When they have a hard time when they try to stop -- that that’s the idea -- then everything is okay. If you try to analyze this, if you take your time and talk this through with a patient then they start to realize there is not a single problem to resolve just by stopping the use of a substance. In contrary, it might even make problems bigger. Many of our patients it is the way they structure their lives, their routine. No alternative at the moment. You shouldn’t take it away because nothing is left. That is not a good place to be. We try to explain this to our patients that we have to find alternatives. Before we cut down or take away, it is a much better position to have alternatives already than to decide to reduce or take the substance use away. Never do that without alternatives. 
AS: Obviously then you wouldn’t require someone to detox?
TB: No, it is useless. We have patients here that have been through twenty, thirty, forty times. How many more treatments of that kind do you want to go through? Every time you go for one or two weeks and then you relapse and prove to yourself that you cannot do it. You’ve failed again and you are a failure. What is the use of this approach? It is not really useful. Sometimes people say we are against abstinence, which is not true at all. I think abstinence is a state: it can be good, useful; it depends for who and what situation. It is not per say good or bad. It depends on the context. 
AS: What would you say to someone who said that if they stopped using something like heroin or meth and they see drinking beer as triggering that desire -- I know people who have quit and then they think they can have a beer -- and within forty-eight hours they are using meth again. How would that be managed in this environment? Because that person would say that they should never have a beer again. 
TB: That is our job to work with triggers. I think education is very important to explain the mechanisms of what is happening. I think that is pretty important. People feel less of a victim and it becomes something they can do because there is something happening. There are different approaches to understanding that you can control triggers. This is possible. The earlier that you detect the starting point -- the triggers won’t just go away. The more awareness you develop inside to realize when this starts low. The earlier you intervene the better you can manage. That is what we work on with our patients. That is pretty successful. 
AS: I have been interviewing some people in long term recovery who are also in addiction treatment who are moving towards this model that you are espousing that is more individualized. A couple of them have said that they haven’t used anything for twenty years and now they have decided that if they want to have a glass of champagne or a glass of wine with dinner they do it, but how hard it was to go from the idea that if you ever touch it again you are an addict. One man told me -- he runs a methadone clinic and would be very in line with what you are saying -- he said when he told his friends from AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] they said he was never really an addict. 
TB: I am having a problem with this twelve-step approach because it is too --
AS: Does it have a place here?
TB: It has a place, but not as much in the US. 
AS: By here I meant in Switzerland. 
TB: There are AA groups. I have patients that are in AA groups. There are patients that really like it there and it helps them. I’m not against that at all. There are some pretty good AA groups here that are not that dogmatic, more flexible in a way. They accept the use of substances. They work with people who are still using. I don’t know. It depends on the individual patient. For some patients it is too dogmatic. Then it is stigmatizing again because it makes them feel bad if they use substances. 
AS: Your model is more helping someone early on in the process figure out what they can handle and what they can’t handle versus a twenty year time period and then saying, “I think I could have a glass of wine.” I just think of the intensity of that decision after all that time and then having people who were close to you say that you were never an addict when that person’s life had fallen apart. It just seems healthier. 
TB: This all or nothing approach isn’t really helpful. I am trying to advocate the continuing of possible goals and states. This is not you are either abstinent or an addict. There are all different shades in between. 
AT: How can you achieve a manageable balance? 
AS: Where you are in control of your life and happy. 
TB: The degree of control. Even control is not an all or nothing thing. There are different degrees of control. We try to help our patients to improve control, whatever that means. With one patient that might be to reduce their beer consumption from seven liters a day to five liters. It is still an improvement. For others it might mean they only drink on Sunday once a week, or whatever. 
AS: They come up with that and try it out. 
TB: It is our job to help them find their own goals and what works for them. That starts anew with every patient. There is no recipe that I could offer that would say this is the way you have to go. I think that is what the patients here appreciate about it. Feeling accepted and respected and realizing that we listen to them and we depend on their view. 
AS: How long do people usually seek services here? Aside from methadone. 
TB: Methadone is another point. Saying opioid addiction is a chronic disease. I think it is a chronic disease that we have here in treatment because they were not for their own faults sort of entrenched. That is a result of the political and societal conditions we have had. They were forced into this marginalized lifestyle. They were made chronic. They are so impaired, not by the action of the substance of heroin, but of the side effects of illegal lifestyle and these horrible years they went through. That impairment makes their condition chronic. That is my view on that. There are famous surgeons that have been living with opiate addiction and have been going through a very successful career because they had no problem providing themselves with clean morphine.
I think heroin addiction is not this hopeless chronic disease, per say. There are other factors contributing to this. That is a misconception of it. We treat the effects of the bad conditions they were living under, the impairment of this lifestyle. This is a group -- some of them have been having treatment now for twenty-five years already and they might continue until the end of their life. There is a very small number in that group of people recovering, in a way. Recovery is another term that can be understood in many ways. Recovery in the UK and in the States as well, I think, has been hijacked as a term for abstinence, which is not the idea of it. Recovery means to get to terms with something and to be able to live a normal life with the substance or without, whatever you choose. It is about integration and being part of society with or without substances doesn’t really make a difference there. It is the degree of control. 
There is this group that is in our treatment for long term, opiate addicted people. If, for example, with alcohol or cocaine we see people come to treatment for a period of time and then they go ahead with their life, get to terms with it, and they might come back after five years and get another treatment. That is the pattern we see. Some we might not see anymore.
AS: Do people come for group therapy or is this more one on one?
TB: Swiss patients are going for one on one. They hate groups. I love groups and I think groups are very helpful. We have started so many groups and they all ended up with one or two or no people. I think we are in the luxurious position that we can offer one to one treatment. There are other countries like Germany that have fewer resources. The treatment system depends much more on group approaches because of resources. Here we still have enough funds to finance one to one treatment. That is what they go for. Also, because self becomes stigmatization and not wanting to have other people know they use, or whatever. 
That is another thing I am not really happy about. Our patients are not really ready or up to political involvement. We have this in the UK, for example. We have user unions and advocacy groups. There is nothing here. We do that for our patients and sometimes I feel a little bit sick of it. I voice for the patients who won’t speak up. 
AS: We have had that issue with Alcoholic Anonymous because they want to stay anonymous; they are safe in that space. Lately there are more people who are coming out to say what is happening, parents who will speak out, and advocacy. We are actually getting legislation change because we are speaking up.
TB: It is very important. This is what makes politicians move. Somebody has to step up. Somebody who has a problem. If I come up and say, “I have patients who have a problem” that is not the same. 
AS: That is how we got Narcan to be more available. We have a law called the Good Samaritan Law so that someone will call when there is a person that is overdosing rather than just drop them or leave. It was a group of mothers who lost their children who then lobbied the legislators. Whether they were teary or not they made a huge impression and it was an incredible vote, almost unanimous. 
TB: That is very important, but it is really hard to hear. Sometimes I think it might be our fault because we have been very active from the start and we are used to this. I think we should have pushed them more from the beginning or evolved our patients more from the beginning to the whole political process as well. 
AS: There is still quite a bit of stigma still. It isn’t that you have overcome stigma. It is that you have overcome a different treatment model. 
TB: Yes. There is lots of stigma still. We try to work very closely with general practitioners because I think they see a lot of people that have substance problems but don’t come for substance problems and go for other reasons. I think they have a very important role in screening and prevention and trying to make people realize or understand about risks of drug and substance use. There as well the stigmatization is so strong. General practitioners say they don’t want to deal with it. It is like opening Pandora’s box: “Oh, no. That’s too much. I don’t want to know about that.” That’s a problem. 
AS: We have the same problem. Is there medical school training around addiction?
TB: We have started to improve. There is a new concept now for medical students. The Society for Addiction medicine has been invited to contribute to this program and it is getting better. I think we are learning from Canada. Canada is pretty ahead in that way. The medical students there already have quite a bit of addiction medicine -- because it is so frequent. It is underrated. I think medical students should already practice and get experience working with people with substance use problems. That’s what they emphasize in these courses too: that they should self reflect on their stand on substance use. 
AT: Using a lot of Ritalin to be able to study enough to pass. 
TB: It starts with your own understanding and perception of the problem or the phenomenon. To get a normal approach to that. There is still a lot to do. 
With general practitioners sometimes I think this is a really hard job. They are still very much in this paternalistic way of understanding medicine. The expert: “I tell my patients what they have to do. If they don’t listen I tell them harder, and then even harder. If they still don’t listen I throw them out of the treatment. I don’t want to see them anymore because they don’t want it.”
AT: The other ones you also don’t hear about a lot. I know a lot of general practitioners that have a really good approach to addiction. They are really good. They are the people that people go to, too. 
TB: The ones I am talking about I would say are the old generation. It is coming to an end now. The ones that are in their sixties now. They have just grown up in another way. The younger practitioners think differently, but still aren’t educated well enough in that field. There is a big lack of knowledge. 
AS: The thing I’ve heard is they ask what they would take out and remove from course time because it is so packed. What would they not teach?
TB: What we really work a lot with is the motivational interviewing approach. That is an approach that has been done a lot in the alcohol therapy field. Miller and Rollnick back in the sixties. That was so helpful. This is now getting adopted all over medicine working with chronic diseases. It works with intrinsic motivation: trying to make people want to change for their own sake. This approach is so helpful working with people with obesity, or diabetes, or HIV, or whatever. They have to manage the long lasting condition where they have to have a motivation to do something and be active to manage their health. This approach I think should be already taught with medical students because it is an attitude. 
AS: Do you use that here?
TB: Yes, we do. Understanding that you have to advocate intrinsic motivation and that therapy wouldn’t work otherwise. You should forget about treating people if you don’t know what they really want. That’s where therapy starts. This sounds pretty trivial, but so many doctors don’t really talk with their patients about what they want: “Do you really want to take those pills?” for example. On behalf of adherence. Only half of the pills prescribed are really taken. That is also a result of that. Nobody really cares about what the patients actually think. 
There is this shift going on in medicine at the moment -- slowly, but it is -- that we understand that patients are human beings as well and we do a job together with them. It is not just us saying what they have to do. There is also the Internet and all that stuff contributing to that because patients inform themselves. They are getting out of their role as a victim and getting more active, which is good. 
I think those are the most important points of our approach. Ever since Arud was founded -- it has been twenty-five years now -- we have always been growing. I think this is also a good thing to see. I think this is because we offer a treatment that fits. We still have a long way to go and we will continue to grow because there are still so many people out there not coming into treatment because they don’t find a treatment that fits. They don’t want to hear, “You should stop again. There is no other way. You are bad.” Feeling that their doctor is frustrated and they don’t want to talk about it because they are just supposed to stop. All of that. There is still quite a potential for us to grow. That is what we have always been true to. We never say we are full. If all our therapists are busy then we just employ new therapists. 
AS: You don’t turn someone away?
TB: No, never. I really believe in low threshold treatment. You have to use the window of opportunity. Whenever someone has the feeling that they need assistance you should be ready to offer this within twenty-four hours. That’s what we can do. 
AS: There are some people starting to do that in Minneapolis. 
TB: I think all this waiting is terrible. 
AS: Many of our children are dying because they aren’t getting in at that moment, especially young people. You finally somehow twisted their arm and then you have to wait ten days. 
TB: In the UK and in Scotland I have been several times to assist them. They are about to open a heroin assistance treatment now, but it has taken three years of lobbying and sharing our experiences with them. Up there they have a waiting list of up to six weeks for someone with opioid addiction to get admitted to agonist treatment. This is just impossible. That’s not the way. Here anybody can just walk in and within twenty minutes is in treatment. 
AS: That’s what you call low threshold. You don’t have to prove anything. 
TB: Yes. The only thing you have to do is take a urine specimen to prove there are opioids in the system. 
AS: Is that the only time you would do a UA [urine analysis]?
TB: Yes. We shouldn’t start opioid treatment if someone is intolerant. That would be dangerous. Sometimes you have people coming in and saying they need substitution treatment. I had one patient that was a schizophrenic just pretending to be an opiate dependent. Then you can only tell with the urine analysis. If there are no opioids in the urine then you won’t start treatment. That is the only condition. Then we start right away. 
In opiate assisted agonist treatment what is very important is the individualization to be able to use as many different substances as possible. We started off with methadone in the nineties and that was all there was around. Now we know that, as with any other medication, there are different individual side effects. People tolerate substances differently. Now we use methadone, buprenorphine, slow-release morphine, and heroin, the original substance. That is the very important thing to be able to do. It is long-term treatment and it is about quality of life. You have to find the substance that fits best for the individual patient. That might be methadone, that might be heroin, that might be morphine. In my perspective it is very important. It is amazing to see how life can change for a patient who has been on methadone for twenty years because it was the only thing around and now changing to slow release morphine. We have had patients that say, “This is like a new life. I feel so much better.” Others have the same experience with Buprenorphine. I think it is really important to give them a choice. There is no medical indication for what substance is best for what patient. They have to find out what is the best for them. 
What we really aren’t happy with in Switzerland is the state of heroin treatment. We are still very much restricted by law. 
AT: I was just going to ask I mean morphine, buprenorphine, and methadone can be obtained through pretty much every pharmacy. 
TB: That is regular treatment. 
AT: Do you think heroin should be that available?
TB: Absolutely. There is no problem with that. We have twenty-three years of experience with heroin treatment. We run the largest heroin clinic in Switzerland. We have about two hundred and twenty people in heroin treatment and we have been doing this for twenty-three years. It works exactly as any other agonist treatment. The only thing when we started heroin treatment in ‘94 one hundred percent of users were using intravenously. This is an international, European trend. There are less and less people injecting, which is good.
AS: How do they get heroin treatment? Is that injected as well?
TB: It can be. We offer injectable heroin. The majority of patients now have shifted to oral avenues. 
AT: That was my question. I have noticed some of my patients have started to get oral heroin. How does that make sense? My understanding of the pharmacology of heroin is that it very quickly gets transformed into morphine. Does any of that reach the brain in the form of heroin?
TB: Yes. I was so amazed, but the ones who get the oral heroin tablets use it nasally. There the onset of action is a bit faster.
AS: It isn’t a tablet?
TB: It is a tablet, but they crush it and snort it. I don’t have anything against that because snorting it is still much more safe than injecting. We are very happy with this trend. Only twenty-five of our patients do injection only with the heroin treatment. Forty-five percent have shifted totally to tablets. I think this type of tablet based heroin treatment could be transferred to regular treatment. Any general practitioner could give these tablets away. Nothing speaks against that. 
AT: I am a little wary about injectable heroin because I think there is a risk of doctors becoming dependent. 
TB: Well, we have to live with that risk. I think the injectable heroin is another story. The onset is so fast that it can be dangerous. That is why injecting is still supervised here. They have to inject on the premises. 
AT: In case they overdose accidentally. 
TB: If they have used alcohol or benzodiazepines before and they inject the onset is so fast that you can end up having an overdose within two minutes. 
AS: Are people asked if they are on benzos and alcohol before they get injected?
TB: We know them, and we know which ones are risky guys and use a lot of other substances as well. That’s manageable. We have never had anyone die in twenty-three years. Nobody died on the premises. The only thing that can happen is they breathe less or they stop breathing for a while and you have to assist everything and they come back again. It’s not really dangerous as long as you know how to proceed. 
Anyways, with the heroin tablets we restrict the take home dose to two days. People with heroin treatment on tablets have to show up at least three times a week. Considering that this is a long-term treatment that should enable people to live autonomously and integrate into society and have a job and have a family life. How can you do that having to show up three times a week at the treatment center? Traveling there. It is just not the thing to do. 
AS: Do you think they should have access to more tablets?
TB: This is counterproductive. The aim of those treatments is to help people reintegrate in society and live a regular life. Having these restrictions makes it impossible to engage in a regular lifestyle. 
AS: Can people take methadone home?
TB: Yes. Ninety percent of the patients we have here are on regular agonist substance treatments. Heroin treatment we can only offer in licensed facilities. That is another clinic of ours on the other side of the river. Ninety percent of the patients we treat here in regular agonist treatment have at least one week of take home, which is no problem. They are in control. Why shouldn’t they? Many of them work; they go for business travels and whatever. They don’t have to come here all the time. 
AS: But some people do start out that way and have to come here everyday?
TB: That’s an exception. If they are in a psychosis or a very deep depression and are suicidal or for psychological reasons are not able to handle take homes. They might lose them or are not in control of dosing them, but that is the exception. 
AS: It is very different because we police it very heavily in the US. 
TB: That is useless. That is another way of institutionalization. It is causing harm and impairing patients.
AS: There are all kinds of people who hang around who are trying to sell. It brings the culture that they are trying to get away from right there to the place where they are trying to get better. That treatment now is so stigmatized that so many people won’t even say they are on it. They don’t want to go. Many treatment centers will not refer you to methadone. They will only do Suboxone or Vivitrol. 
TB: I think in the States the general practitioners are only allowed to prescribe buprenorphine. 
AS: Yes. No methadone. They are only allowed a certain number of patients and they have to go through a DEA [drug enforcement agency]. 
AT: Each one of those substances has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Ultimately it’s got to be the user who decides. 
TB: And not the state and not the government. It is really an absurd situation. If you look all over the world you have countries, for political reasons, like in the north -- Finland -- has only buprenorphine. That’s a political decision because they thought any other substance was not safe. Same in France. It has improved now. It is still about eighty-five or ninety percent of this agonist treatment is with buprenorphine because the government thinks that it is safer. 
AT: It is a partial antagonist. 
TB: Yes. That is also called Indivior, the company that manufactures buprenorphine has been very politically active advocating for buprenorphine and getting quite a lot of government on their side. These are economic reasons. 
AT: Drug pushers. 
AS: Thank you, you have been very generous. 
[walking around clinic]
TB: This is the medical department. This is where we treat Hepatitis C and HIV and other disorders. We see an increasing number of age related comorbid medical disorders. The average age of the opiate dependent cohort is forty-five years. That’s the nineties generation heroin and they are aging. There are hardly any newcomers. Heroin is out. It is a loser drug. We hardly see any young, new heroin users. The epidemic is over. What we see is a cohort of aging heroin users. They are twenty years older than their actual age. They have aged twenty years because of the lifestyle they have been forced to live. This lifestyle made them sick, not the drugs. We treat the results. 
This is the lab. This is quite an important machine. It is sort of an ultrasound, but it measures the fibrosis of the liver. That’s very important in treating hepatitis c. This is an issue at the moment all over: hepatitis c treatment is still quite expensive. Gilead, which started the whole thing off, earns billions. 
AS: They have kept the cost pretty high?
TB: Yes, it is about sixty thousand dollars a treatment. 
AS: Where are they based? For how long?
TB: Six weeks. The United States. They didn’t even develop the substances themselves. They bought the patent and now they are making a hell of a lot of money. 
We have this problem that sixty percent of the cohort of the opiate dependent population we treat here are infected with Hepatitis C. Also a consequence of the lifestyle and not of the drug. Actually, we should treat them all with this new treatment. It is very effective and has a ninety to ninety-five percent success rate. We should treat them all; that’s how you treat infections like that, but it’s too expensive. The government decided to make limitations on the treatment, so we can only treat them if the fibrosis has progressed to a certain level. They have to be pretty sick to get the treatment. It would be wiser to treat them earlier before they get to that degree. That is why we measure the fibrosis grade to get them into treatment. 
AS: We had the same thing happen with Narcan. The price went up to two thousand dollars right at the time when all the state governments were allowing more access to it. 
TB: This is internal medicine here and all of the rest of the premises is psychiatry. We work very close together because all of the patients are comorbid and we are trying to get the treatment to fit the needs of the patient. We have five hundred patients in agonist treatments. That is quite a numbers. That’s why we have computerized systems. We get all the medication per patient for the comorbid disorders. This is the amount for one week because most of them come once a week and get all their medication. 
This is a project where we are going to move together the four clinics in Zurich next year to one place. We have centralized the outpatient clinics into one place. We think we can offer more comprehensive and better quality treatment if we are all under one roof. That is going to happen the end of this year. 
AS: You are open six-thirty a.m. to nine-thirty p.m. six days a week?
TB: Seven days a week. Now we think of reducing the service over the weekend because ninety-nine percent of our patients are so stable we don’t have to offer the services. That was important in the beginning back in the nineties when people are still very bad off and they needed much more support. Now it has stabilized. "

Amy Sullivan-AS
LB: I’m Linda LB and I do give Amy permission to record my conversation with her. 
AS: Thank you. Could you start with you childhood? Where you grew up? What your childhood was like?
LB: I was born in Chicago, Illinois and my mother was a nursing student at the time. Single, wasn’t sure who my father was, I was put up for adoption, she went off secretly and had me in Chicago. Nobody knew about it. I was there for about a month and she decided she wanted to take me home after all. She traveled to Chicago and brought me home to Minneapolis and kept me in her little apartment. Finally, my aunt and uncle found out about it because they came to visit her and it was a bar downstairs and she had me down there at the bar that she worked at. They didn’t feel it was a fit environment for a child. Eventually, within a few weeks, she agreed for them to take me temporarily until she got her life together. 
AS: What year was this?
LB: This was in 1951. So, they did. They took me home and took care of me and agreed that they would give me back eventually. That never really happened. I just grew up with my aunt and uncle. It was my mother’s sister and her husband. It was a great childhood, I can’t complain about it. It was good. I had a cousin that was three years younger than me. He was born when I was five. We are three years apart. We grew up as brother and sister. 
AS: Did you see your mom much as a child?
LB: Once in awhile. She was my aunt. I didn’t know she was my mom until I was in my thirties. They told me I was adopted. Well, when I was in my thirties I decided I wanted to try and find my biological mother. I asked them if I could get a copy of my birth certificate. They said they had one and they would help me. They said I was adopted through Lutheran Social Service. They didn’t have any record when I talked to them. I said, “I don’t know what is going on.” Eventually they came down and gave me my birth certificate and on that was the name of my aunt Georgina. I was thinking, “Ok, so she is my mother.” That kind of threw me for a loop. It was kind of exciting in a way, and yet kind of puzzling. 
Anyway, eventually I wrote her a letter because I didn’t see her often. She was the aunt with the sports cars and she was just kind of a cool aunt. I grew up with her kind of in my teens. I would stay with her sometimes. She would let me smoke and have a drink when I was in my teens. She was cool. Very successful as a nurse. She helped start a program that used to be HCMC now, the dialysis unit. She worked with some real famous doctors. She really did well in her life. 
AS: Did she stay single?
LB: No, I was a teenager when she married. I went on to find out though that they didn’t stay married long. She had two other children and gave them up for adoption. One with him and one right after me. Two boys. She was an alcoholic. She told me this when she was drinking one time. I never knew for sure if that was the truth because I think she had a kind of personality disorder when I think back on it now. Very kind, but she could turn around and be horrible. 
I found out she was my mom when I was in my thirties. I did write her a letter and told her I knew. She took a while to connect with me after that. I went down to her home, she lived in Brooklyn Center, went down to her home and talked to her about it. I acted like I was really happy. Inside I was a little confused to be honest. She admitted that yes, I’m your mom and talked about how things were back then. She had hoped to get me back but it just didn’t work out. As it turned out she didn’t visit that often. She just kind of let them have me. She just didn’t seem to have the time or something. She really wasn’t happy about being my mother even as an adult.
AS: No motherly instinct.
LB: No motherly instinct really. Really independent and a narcissist almost. That is how my childhood started out. That’s how, as an adult, I found out she was my mother. We didn’t have a close relationship really. Cancer and she died of cancer, I don’t know, it has probably been ten years ago now or more. She had a living boyfriend that was my age. He somehow changed her will I think, unless she lied to me, but I got nothing from her. She didn’t leave me anything. She said she would. I was the only child that had any contact with her. He took everything and we always wondered if the will was changed somehow because she had said, “You’ll get…” She was very bad before she died. She didn’t know what was going on. He took care of her. He was a terrible alcoholic too. Very chronic. Who knows. 
AS: What a story.
LB: Yeah. Let’s see, where do I go from there. I got married when I was very young. Right out of high school. I was pregnant my last month of high school I remember. We moved out of Minneapolis to Brainerd my last year of school. I went to Brainerd high school, graduated in 1969 and my boyfriend at the time moved up there to go to college as well. I found out I was pregnant in May right before I graduated. We planned a wedding, told my parents, and went through this whole thing. They didn’t care for the guy I was going with, Bob. Not at all because he had long hair and my dad was a barber and she was a hairdresser [laughter]. And he had very long hair and dad didn’t like it. 
We got married in September then. I had my first son, Jason, the next February. That was ok I guess, it went ok. I was so young that I think it went ok because I was so young. Both Bob and I partied a lot, drank a lot. That was kind of our focus then was having fun and partying. Within a year I had another little boy [laughter]. His name was Gabriel. It was very hard because my husband by that time was really a full-blown alcoholic and was never home and going out with other women and girls in high school. We weren’t very old. I was only 18 or 19 when I had Gabriel. 
My aunt and uncle that raised me helped me a lot with that. We ended up going up there and staying a while because he was really abusive, my husband was abusive. 
AS: Was he your age?
LB: A year older. Physically and mentally, you name it. I tried to kind of still stick with that lifestyle of going out a lot, drinking, finding baby sitters. We had his mom and dad living in town. They were great and took them a lot, the kids. Things straightened out a little bit. We lived in a little town west central Minnesota called Cosmos. I was a big town girl. I wasn’t into small towns at all. The only thing we had there was the Legion. We would look forward to the Wednesday night steak fries. 
I wanted more for my life than that. My family was more well-rounded and really encouraged me to do something. They wanted me to go to college, but I didn’t of course because I had kids. It was ingrained in my mind that wasn’t enough living in a small town and going to the Legion on Wednesday nights. I wanted more. I wanted to go to college and I wanted to do somethings in my life. In fact, we built a new house. He worked with his dad they had a Ready Mix company and were doing fairly well with it. We weren’t hard up for money at all. We built a new house and back then of course it didn’t cost very much. I got into that and things settled down and straightened out. We had a pretty good time for a while there. 
It was still partying and then I got pregnant with my daughter. She was born in ‘76. That was really awesome to have a girl. I really focused on the kids. Sewing and I made everything for them. I was really into homemaking at that time. Things seemed good for a while. 
As time progressed, Bob was really an alcoholic and was very physically abusive. I started going out with other people thinking I would find somebody better. He was going out with other people and eventually I didn’t want to be with him anymore and I didn’t want to be in that town. I went out with a guy that I thought could get me out of there. He was just totally not the right kind of person. That didn’t work. 
I moved to the Twin Cities for a while. Left my boys behind and took my daughter with me. Got a job at Simer Pump Company. I will never forget that. It was just a no life job. It was just to make some money to live. I was so lonely down there. I had friends, but it was just my daughter and I. One day my husband and his friend came down and took my daughter away from me and brought her back [with them]. It was horrible. 
AS: How did they manage that?
LB: I was staying with a friend, they came to the apartment, my friend let him in because my friend wasn’t really concerned. She knew him. They just took her. They grabbed her out of my arms and took her and brought her back to Cosmos. Within a few weeks I moved back and went back to him because I couldn’t handle not having my kids. I felt so guilty about my boys and then not having her. He put her with a friend of his to take care of her every day. I just couldn’t deal with that. 
I went back. I tried to make things work with him but I was over him. We even went on a vacation and took all kinds of things but it wasn’t… Eventually the abuse got so bad I ended up calling county social worker. I didn’t know what to do. My parents weren’t really standing behind me because they thought, they were kind of old fashioned. I will never forget a statement my brother made: “Maybe if you stopped making frozen pizzas he would leave.” 
That did it. I called the social worker, I told her I couldn’t live with him anymore, and she brought me to the women’s shelter in Willmar with my kids. We were there for probably a couple of months. I moved out of the house and petitioned for a divorce. They helped me with a lot of things there. We got an apartment and back then there was a lot of help. There was a lot of financial help available through the county that there isn’t now. They helped me pay for an apartment, they helped me get furniture, they helped pay my tuition while I went to the college in Willmar. 
My life was evolving. I missed Bob in a way because I missed the companionship. He could be nice sometimes, but overall it wasn’t good. The kids had also been somewhat… the boys were physically abused and mentally abused. Kristin wasn’t. She was only three and doesn’t remember it. We lived in an apartment then and the life was kind of, I don’t know, it was ok. I was trying to find another guy right away rather than be by myself. I had a series of nothing really. I would see some people a few times and then leave. I had kids and… I was a lot of baggage with all that. 
Then, I met my current husband, and that was in ‘78 when I met him at a bar. He was into racing, star car racing and I really liked that. I don’t know why even. My girlfriend and I would go to races. They had a race track not too far. I knew he raced but I thought he was married but I really didn’t care [laughter]. My morals weren’t too on spot back then. 
I started seeing him out at the bars and eventually he left his wife and asked if he could move in with me. This has been a matter of months. And, “Of course you can move in with me.” He brought his suitcase and he kept seeing other women and I would let him use my car. I was totally desperate for this guy. He had a really nice family that lived out on the farm out there. They were super people. Very Christian oriented, kind of like my family was. I felt comfortable. I joined their church and I became very involved in trying to find a family and … in their activities. For the next two or three years he still continued to see other women that he knew. I put up with it because I was so desperate. 
He was very good with my kids and was like a real dad to them. They would go visit their dad but he was so bad with his alcoholism that he would leave them with his parents and if he did bring them with him they would end up at some party or a bar. One time the county sheriff brought them home from their home visit. He had been put in jail because he had a bunch of trouble in a bar he was at and the kids were with him. They came home and the boys didn’t seem phased a whole lot they just kind of dismissed it. My daughter was kind of scared. She was about five or six I think. 
AS: And they were like 10 and 11?
LB: Yeah. They were also diagnosed, the oldest boys, were diagnosed with borderline, back then, retardation. That’s what they called it back then. It wasn’t disability. I kind of always assumed it was because I drank when I was pregnant. I thought it was fetal alcohol syndrome. I don’t know if that was the cause. They didn’t look like that, but they had some of the issues that went along with that because I went to a lot of seminars later in life. 
We got divorced then, Bob and I were divorced finally. Craig is his name, my husband’s name. He got divorced a couple of years later. He was really down and out, too, because he had lost a business and wasn’t really sure what he was doing. We were broke. He was living with me and I got welfare. That was what we lived on and I didn’t record that he was living with me. He started working some jobs and was starting to make some money. I was in college then. I started college at the community college in human services. I did really well in college. I was surprised I remember because I hated high school.
Things just evolved. We moved into another subsidized townhome and his brother was a very successful farmer. He purchased some land and a house right outside of Willmar. He bought it for us and we took over the payments eventually, but he enabled us to get it. We went into that together. The kids loved it. I felt like at peace out there. It was a lot of work and the house was rickety but his dad helped us with a lot of the work on the house. It was exciting. 
The only thing was Craig would not commit to me and I felt used. Eventually I left him for a while. For a period of time I moved to Willmar. I tried to go out with some other people. I was like this is it he won’t commit to me. He was still seeing other people I believe. The guy I was dating was one of his friends and he decided to go back to his old girlfriend. He left me and then I had to go back to Craig I felt. I cared about him but I didn’t like his lifestyle. I demanded that he married me if he was going to live with him. I wasn’t just going to live with him anymore. We had lived together for ten years. 
AS: By this point it is like ‘88?
LB: It is about, yeah, It was actually ‘87 when we got married. Right before our wedding, three months before, I found out I was pregnant. I thought, “Oh my god. This is not going to look good to his family at all.” I considered an abortion. I had had two before that, earlier. Which makes me sick to this day, but anyway. Three days before the wedding I miscarried twins. What happened was I lost one at home and still was in a lot of pain and went into the hospital and they were going to do a DNC and they did and there was another fetus they said. They didn’t tell me right away. They aborted the second twin. They didn’t own up to it at the clinic. The doctor didn’t. They didn’t tell me they just said there was some fetal material. In the records, there was a gal at work there, and she saw in the records that it…
AS: Why would they keep that from you?
LB: I don’t know. I suppose they were worried about a lawsuit. This woman, because she talked to me about it, she was going to lose her job. She was the girlfriend of the guy I had dated before and she hated me. There was a lot of animosity there and I was scared of her because she had tried to come in my house while he was there and she pushed me down the steps. She was going to kill me. Threatening me all the time. I was afraid of her and I told Craig, “I can’t deal with this. We are getting married in a few days.” This went on for weeks after we were married. I said, “I can’t do this anymore let’s just forget about it and not do anything.” I found out later the clinic was gearing up for a big lawsuit with this doctor because he didn’t do an ultrasound or something beforehand. 
That took a while to get through. I was really depressed and we got married a few days later. That was nice, and we got through it. Got married outside under our pine trees. We still live there. Marriage was fairly ok. A year later I had Seth. He is 27 now and that was in ‘89 I had Seth. We were just delighted. It was his first child, he didn’t have any kids. Seth was everything to us. He couldn’t have been spoiled anymore than he was [laughter]. 
Five years later we had Jordan. Jordan is our youngest, he’s 22. We just did everything with those kids. Craig was one of them to raise. We got them involved when they were really young into snocross racing. They raced snowmobiles. We spent a ton of money. At that time Craig had started his own business again and was doing fairly well. Between that we had milked cows, we had taken over his dad’s farm. We had done a lot of things together. We had quite a history at that point. He was starting a new business and that was going fairly well. We were financially doing a lot better. Fixed up our house. Did a lot of things. Things seemed to be going well. 
The kids loved snocross. We took off every weekend and went to where the races were and traveled all over with them. Seth got to be very good. He was with Arctic Cat with their team. Jordan, he raced, but he was a real big kid. He was really big for his age and that wasn’t good in snocross because you had to be lightweight like his brother was. His anxiety would come out… his boots were this or that. He would just go nuts every time. That was Jordan. That was my first taste of his anxiety was when he was a little kid. He was the one who eventually had the most problems. 
We ended up having to quit that because my husband Craig wanted to get Seth into car racing. It was either that or snocross we couldn’t afford to do both. We had a team of racecars that we had other people drive. Two dirt car models. We had some friends of Craigs’ drive them for us. It was time, he thought, to quit that and get our own kids involved. We got Seth involved and that was 2009. It wasn’t all that long ago. We got him involved and he took off. He was just a gifted racer and just excelled at that. 
I’m going to step back a little bit. When they were in school, because we traveled with the snocross and it was really hard to do school, I started homeschooling them. We were gone on weekends and every Friday and school didn’t like it. We homeschooled and that was not successful at all. Seth did it for a little bit and then he wouldn’t do it. I just let it go and I started with Jordan. Jordan begged me, “Please, I hate school, I hate my teachers.” And he didn’t get along with his teachers at all. Both the boys were horrible in school. They were nice people but they just couldn’t stand authority. Neither one of them. I don’t know if that came from us. I don’t know, I don’t think so. They both had a real problem with authority. 
I tried homeschooling and that didn’t work for either one of them. Eventually I just gave up and they just quit school. They just didn’t go to school. I feel guilty about that to this day that I didn’t push it more. In the meantime we took in a foster son. Like I needed anything more, but we knew this little boy. He was a friend of Seth’s, my older one. We took him along with our family because I had a job I ended up as an independent living coordinator. His parents were in my program. I knew them and they had two babies that were both mentally handicapped and it just wasn’t a good situation so we took him on. 
At first it was so fine because he got to race and we got him a snowmobile. He was with us all the time. Later on that turned out to be a disaster. For a while it was good and we felt like we were doing something good. 
AS: Was he the same age as your kids?
LB: He was Seth’s age, yes. The 27 year old. They were the same age. It turned out they were horrible together. It didn’t go well. 
AS: They didn’t get along?
LB: They were just wild together. I think they both had ADHD. I know he did but I think my son must have had it too. We couldn’t go anywhere with them. They would make a scene, wreck things in the hallways of hotels. We couldn’t take them out to eat for dinner anymore because the two of them together we would have to separate them or something. 
Anyway, I’m probably missing some things. 
AS: I am wondering if we should go outside. It is getting louder in here. 
[pause]
AS: How old are your kids? You have a foster son, John…
LB: That was when my second youngest, Seth, was probably 11 or 12. I think they were in fifth grade. 
AS: So they were big. They could make some real trouble.
LB: Oh yes. Together it didn’t work very well for those two. My youngest son didn’t like him really. They later became very close once, I don’t know, Seth kind of broke away from them and had his own friends. My youngest son Jordan started getting closer to John. 
Little did I know that was when the drug use started. Jordan started drinking when he was like 15 because he went with Seth to a race and Seth called me and said, “Mom, you got to come and get this kid. I’m not watching him. He’s drunk, he’s running around the campground here causing trouble, fighting with people. You have to come.” We got up in the middle of the night and drove up to Huron, South Dakota to pick him up. We were going to go the next day to watch Seth race. Seth was racing. We picked him up to the police station because they had brought him in and charged him with underage drinking. I was on the phone with the police the whole way down there. They were picking him up and bringing him in. We were just sick. 
We had had some problems with Seth, too. Not with drinking or drugs but some mental stuff where he would just go off. We kind of had our fill with that and now we thought, “Jordan! Not Jordan.” He seems like such a good kid, doesn’t seem to be influenced by that kind of stuff, you would hope. 
We went out, picked him up, and brought him home. He was still drunk and it was just terrible seeing him like that. I couldn’t handle it. The next day we told him he couldn’t go back out but we took him back out the next day. That was the beginning that we knew he was using. We thought, oh, he is just experimenting like kids that age do and he just drank too much. “Oh I’m never going to do that again!” Of course.
That was the beginning. Him and John I think then started smoking some weed because I would kind of smell it when I would go out. We had a shop with a kind of office in it that was separate from our house. That is where they hung out a lot because they were working on different things and they would fix bikes out there and they were always doing things and I thought that was good. They were out of my hair a little bit, and yet they were doing good things. One time I remember thinking, “It smells like weed out here or something.” I started suspecting things little by little. Seth had kind of moved out. When he got to be 18 he moved out and got his own place if I remember right. I didn’t think he would do anything either because he wasn’t into drinking at that point really. He was obnoxious but he wasn’t into using I didn’t think. That changed too in a short hurry. We found out he had gotten an underage consumption [charge] and that is when it all started basically.
We went through that with Seth the older one and then the younger ones started picking it up more and more. I think probably at about 18, when Jordan was 18, he’s 22 now, we noticed things started getting more out of hand. He started acting strange. All him and John did was play video games. We had a house in New Ulm as well. My husband worked in a big piping project when the butter plant burned down. They rebuilt it. My husband and his company. We stayed there and rented a house there. Video games non-stop. I’m thinking, “This is too much, video games are going to ruin them for life.”
After that I think was when they started doing more and more weed. Jordan fell down and broke his leg. He had many broken bones over the years. That is when he started on pain medication. Percocet, they gave them out pretty readily then. 
AS: This is how long ago??
LB: This was when he was about 18, yeah, 17 or 18. He had a girlfriend then that he had had for a couple of years. She wasn’t really into using but she noticed too that he was just so awful. Demanding, he started going downhill. We noticed his behavior changing. I thought it was the medication. I said, “Maybe you need to get off this stuff and take some Tylenol.” He has never been able to withstand pain. Even when he was a little kid, everything was horrible if he was in pain. Everybody had to cater to him. 
He had to have this pain medication. I thought, well, I suppose if he needs it. The doctor kept refilling it. He was on different ones. I’m sure he was hooked on it. Then he broke his shoulder, or he had to have surgery on his shoulder. That was about a year later and he was on more pain meds, of course, because he probably needed them at the time. 
I don’t think he ever got off of them. Then he started finding more ways to get them. I am finding out now that he started snorting them. Because I found a pill crusher out in the shop. I started looking for things. Sure enough there was stuff out there. That was a real red flag but when I questioned them they said, “We tried it once.” You know. 
It just progressed and eventually I found out through the grapevine that John was selling drugs. Our foster son. He had gotten on probation for something else. An assault or something. He was on probation because he assaulted someone and got in trouble. He didn’t go see his PO and they had a warrant out for him. I kept saying, “You need to turn yourself in I’m not going to let you stay here. I could get in trouble for this as well. You need to go talk to your PO.” He wouldn’t do it. I called the sheriff and I said, “He is out here and I can’t have him here anymore. I understand he is possibly selling drugs.” They said, “Yeah, we have been watching him and we pretty much know he is.”
They picked him up, ransacked my shop and all my things up there. “Could we search?” Ok. They totally wrecked half my possession up there looking for drugs. They didn’t find any. I’m sure they were hidden well. They did find a little bit of marijuana on him but they did find a gun and he had a felony against him, the assault. That sent him to jail and eventually a prison sentence. 
AS: Where did he go?
LB: First he went to St. Cloud of course and then they sent him up to Moose Lake. He was there for quite a while. He was very upset with me because I had turned him in.
AS: What is quite a while?
LB: Probably a year. In the meantime my son was getting out of hand. He was hanging out with some of the guys. I don’t want to be prejudiced but there are a lot of Mexicans and Spanish up in Willmar. 
AS: Did they work at the Jenny-O plant?
LB: Yes, that was a lot of it. A lot of them have become professionals and there are a lot of good ones. But there are also a lot of drug dealers that moved there from Chicago. Jordan started befriending a lot of John’s old friends. I believe that is when Jordan started selling drugs as well. It was like, “You need to get a job.” 
There is of course a little bit of guilt because maybe we should have… and he wouldn’t have sold drugs. Eventually, John was in prison, he got out, and he came and worked with us in our business. He was a great worker. Him and Jordan hung out together all the time. That is when I suspected no good. They were up to selling, using, they were goofy all the time. We couldn’t count on them to come to work. Jordan would sleep all day. He then moved in with his girlfriend, they got a place, a couple of different places together. Moved out, got evicted, things just weren’t going well. I suspected…
[pause]
I’m trying to think of what order this all took place. Shortly after I discovered Jordan was selling drugs and using pills, I suspected anyway, he got caught selling weed. An informant made a purchase from it. It was one of his friend that had turned into an informant. It was only 60 dollars but it was still a drug charge. He got put on probation. No jail time at that time. He was put on probation with his probation to be removed once he did well and followed all his recommendations with the CD Bell and all the things they put him through. They recommended that he go to outpatient treatment. He did. 
My older son had also gone to outpatient because he had a DUI so I did go to treatment with him. 
AS: One of your oldest?
LB: The 27 year old. I had also gone through treatment with my two oldest boys [laughs]. I forgot about that. I had gone through treatment with Jason, Gabriel three times, Jason once, Kristin no. She was into drugs but she pulled out of it on her own. I don’t know how. Seth was in outpatient treatment one time for a DUI. 
AS: Were any of these inpatient?
LB: Yes. This one [unclear]. That was more recent though. Gabriel. Jason was a long time ago though when he was younger. I am back tracking just a little. 
AS: They are now recommending inpatient for Jordan?
LB: Yes. Then he got an assault on his record next because his girlfriend had a new boyfriend and he was upset. He punched him because she brought him to their house. He wasn’t going to let him in and the guy wasn’t going to let him in and he punched him in the car. They filed charged and he got a fourth degree assault. Second degree assault I should say. 
Eventually, that gave him more problems. He didn’t meet with his PO and he wasn’t doing what he needed to do so he did some jail time. Then he got out and he was back to using and selling. I talked to his PO and I said, “He needs treatment. Putting him in jail isn’t going to help. He needs treatment.” They recommended treatment, he went through a CD .. again and they recommended treatment. This was about two years ago and he went to Project Turnabout. It was horrible. He called me and begged me to take him out. 
AS: They are all horrible. They hate everybody.
LB: Treating him like crap. “If you don’t come and get me I am leaving here and I don’t care if they pick me up.” “Jordan, just calm down” trying to calm him down over the phone. Finally, he settled in a little bit. He actually did fairly well there. This Julie was a counselor that he hated at first and she was very good. She was there when my other son was there, my other two sons were there. I thought, “Ok good this is good.” Started going to meetings, was really good for the first two weeks. I even got one of his friends involved and he got sober. He was going to start taking charge in group. It was more than two weeks. It was probably a month. 
And then it fell apart again. I could tell his behavior was different again. He was sleeping all day, wouldn’t come to work with my husband, he just wasn’t himself. I suspected he was right back into it again. He wasn’t doing his probation stuff again. He got called in again and he ended up having to go to court again for not following probation. No, we didn’t go to court again. Back up a little bit here. We didn’t go to court. He was at our house because him and his girlfriend were split up then. While he was in jail she moved out. We helped her move out in fact because we were still kind of helping her and we pretty much raised her. She was so young when they started dating. 15. He was at our house one night and this was about a year ago. He was just out of it. Craig called me and said, “What is going on with Jordan? He is crazy out here. I am burning brush and he fell in the fire. I had to pull him out.” He told Craig, “Yeah, I just want to die.” I thought, “Oh my god.” Then, he came in the house and I tried to calm him down but I was pissed. I was like, “What are you taking? Did you drink? Did you take drugs?” Because he acted like he was overdosing or something. He was like, “Oh, nothing.” His younger brother was in the living room. His older brother Jason, Jason is an alcoholic. He is just kind of a half-way functioning one. We gave up on him kind of. He is 40-something years old. And he is telling Jordan, “You can’t have any more of my cigarettes I gave you half of them.” and Jordan said, “I just want a cigarette.” And Jason said, “You are such a spoiled little brat” and got him going. Aggravated him to the point where he got up, went to the kitchen, got a poker from the fire place, and came in there after him. He hit him once. He was going to attack him. I went and grabbed the thing out of his hand. My dog came up and bit him, bit me because I am trying to get him away. Then, he went outside crazy, crazy, and he had done this before. Gone through these episodes when he was younger, but not when he was on anything. I don’t know what he was on, if he was on K2 because he talked about that. He went out in the shop and Craig called me within a few minutes and said, “You have to call somebody he is trying to kill me.” And he is standing over his dad with his big, huge… knocked him down on the floor and was going to hit him and said he hated him and wanted to see him dead. I called the sheriff. I said, “I don’t know what is wrong with him. I think he is drinking on top of it. We don’t know what to do here. He needs some help.”
They came out and he ran off. This had happened one other time too and we turned him in and he would run away in the yard and hide. I was scared. I locked myself in the bathroom because I didn’t know what he was going to do. He probably had a gun somewhere. I didn’t know where they were. The dispatcher stayed on the phone with me and I heard him come in the house and go upstairs. That is where he was when we found him. The deputies followed me upstairs and he finally surrendered. “You promise you won’t charge me for fleeing?” [laughter] It’s like that is the least of your problems! 
I felt bad because he is laying on this bed and I thought, “We kind of got this going. Maybe we should have been calmer and not got him riled up like this.” Anyway, they took him out, arrested him, and put him in the car and got him in jail. I knew it was court the next morning. I went into the courtroom and I was met by a lady from the women’s shelter. I was a victim. They charged him with domestic abuse, they charged him with terroristic threats. We didn’t want him charged. We just wanted them to help him. He was charged with two felonies. It ended up being two felonies. The deadly weapon… it was big. It was big. 
He was in court the next morning balling his head off. “I don’t remember it. I don’t remember doing any of that. I can’t imagine. That’s my mom I wouldn’t hurt her. I would never hurt my mom. I love my mom I love my dad. I don’t know what I am doing here.” He couldn’t remember any of it. My heart was breaking. He is in jail, he doesn’t remember it, and if he does he would have said something I think. I was just devastated. There is my, what do you call it…
AS: Your disaster.
LB: My disaster. The biggest disaster I had ever faced. We could have maybe prevented it by not overreacting the way we did. Although, we were scared. We just wanted them to take him and bring him somewhere. To the mental health unit or something. That is what I am thinking. I am thinking mental health here. Maybe detox at the most, but mental health mostly. 
AS: Is there any kind of facility out here like that? Or is there just the jail?
LB: Well, they have the HMU and they have a crisis center. I am thinking “Help.” This isn’t on my mind.
AS: Right. When you say help that is different than what they…
LB: they came in and interviewed us that night and I said, “I am not charging him. I am not saying anything.” They said, “We have to. This is the state.” I knew that but I didn’t think  of it at the time. Craig said, “Oh yeah, he said he wanted to kill me and all this stuff.” And oh my god it just mushroomed into this horrible, horrible thing that we had been involved in and kind of felt like we had caused. We didn’t really, but we did. We got him going. We were yelling at him instead of calming him down. 
AS: Right, but you were also at a point by then where you’re frustration with his drug use. Your own reaction seems understandable, but you didn’t know what he was on.
LB: I didn’t know at that time. 
AS: He wouldn’t tell you.
LB: No. I had no idea what was going on. I thought he was going to die. 
AS: Right because you had asked him what he was on.
LB: He said he wasn’t on anything. 
AS: He had fallen on the fire. Is this the same night?
LB: He just kept saying he wanted to be dead. He had said that many times before but we didn’t take it serious because he kind of always said that. You know how you get immune to it almost? You shouldn’t, but… Anyway, they did drop his charges somewhat. They did a plea bargain and this went on for months. He was in jail for months. We couldn’t see him. We were victims so we couldn’t see him. We did at first because they screwed up. Once they realized we were the victims we couldn’t go see him at the jail. His ex-girlfriend went there everyday and I think was a poor influence. He would call her and then I would talk to him, which wasn’t legal but I didn’t care. I’m talking to him. Throw me in jail. He was just so depressed. They took him off adavan. He was on adavan for anxiety before that because he had panic attacks real bad since he was young. It probably wasn’t the best drug to put him on because it is very addictive. They took him cold turkey in jail, took him off that. That is part of why he went so berserk in jail and got thrown in the hole umpteen times. He was in there Candyhow County has DOC people out there they take from prisons. They mixed the whole population he was in. His cellmate was a sexual offender plus he had committed a murder. This is what he was dealing with. 
AS: And he is an addict. 
LB: He’s not really a criminal. He ended up a criminal because of it but no, he hadn’t committed a murder. He didn’t do a crime against people, really, it was himself. I was just beside myself the whole time he was in there. I shut it out of my mind because I had to go to work. I was just distraught. Everyday I was just sick. I would go to bed and ball myself to sleep. My husband was feeling a lot of guilt and then sometimes I would just get angry and “Well maybe he deserves to be sitting in there and maybe we should have been …” You know, you just go back and forth with it. Maybe I should have been tougher. Maybe I had made him finish school and then we wouldn’t be in this situation. I went over that so much in my mind. I guess I just talk openly about it to people because I didn’t care. I was like, “Yeah, my son has an addiction problem.” That is when I joined Moms of Addiction.
AS: The Addict’s Mom?
LB: Yes. 
AS: The Addict’s Mom on Facebook?
LB: Yes. I saw it on somebody else’s website, or on their Facebook. I thought, “Ok I am going to look into this” and it was very helpful. I put quite a bit of things up there about what I was fighting.
AS: When was this?
LB: This was last fall. In October. 
AS: Not that…
LB: Beginning of November, yes. Of 2015. 
AS: What other support did you get?
LB: Well, his probation officer is really a pretty good guy. I talked to him about the fact that he needed help, that jail and prison wasn’t going to do him any good. He would probably just reoffend and he needed help. He was a really good person. I believed in him. 
Then, this advocate from the attorney county attorney’s office. She was very helpful too, honestly. And the advocate from the women’s shelter, which I had worked at at one point. They were both helpful to me. I kept saying, “I really don’t feel a victim in this whole situation.” I just kept trying to push that. 
Eventually I met with a prosecuting attorney. I said, “I want a meeting with him because I want to explain this whole thing to him.” I just jumped in there and fought for this kid. “He needs help. Prison is not going to do him any good. Can’t you see this? You can save yourself some money by doing something different with him. He needs treatment. Yes, he has been through treatment once but one time probably isn’t good. He needs more.” 
They did do a plea bargain then. I got to be pretty, you know, the prosecuting attorney was actually pretty caring after all. 
AS: You think that was probably due to your influence?
LB: Definitely. They were going to throw the boat at him. He is 22 years old. I’m thinking, well he wasn’t even 22 yet then. I did everything and it consumed my life outside of my job. I had to go do my job working with mentally ill people. That was stressful. I was just wound tight. I was running from place to place on the phone constantly trying to find a treatment center that didn’t do the 12-step. I didn’t think that was real successful for him. 
Then they did a CD evaluation and recommended inpatient treatment again. I wanted to find a good treatment center this time. I found Villa National in … I called his PO and said I found this treatment center. The lady that did the CD eval, I played phone tag with her I don’t know how many times. I couldn’t get a hold of her. She wouldn’t call me back. Finally I went in there and I said, “Look, I found a treatment center I really want him to go to.” “Well, we usually do this. We usually recommend…” I said, “That’s not going to work for him. He needs something other than 12-step.” He was getting out of jail soon and I wanted to get this situated so he could go right from jail to treatment. I thought if he comes home it’s not going to work. 
It didn’t happen. He got out of jail.
AS: Why didn’t it happen?
LB: Because we couldn’t get it set up fast enough. People weren’t…
AS: People were too slow?
LB: The process was too slow. Villan was good but they couldn’t get his MA to go through. He got MA, they couldn’t get it to go through, call them up, “No, he doesn’t have it.” Over and over. Call the county. I went through that whole process. “Yeah, they should have it.” This went on for three weeks. He is at home and I’m thinking any minute he is just going to say, “Screw this.”
AS: He is going to bolt.
LB: Right. He is going to leave or just start using and say, “I don’t care.” Because he had been sober. He was in jail for five months. Four months. Yeah. He just went into treatment this spring. Early spring. Late February, early March. November, December, January, February. He was in about four and a half months in jail. 
Then, another three weeks before he got into Vinland. They came and got him, brought him down there, and eventually it worked. He did very well there. He actually kind of liked it there because it was a different approach. It was just a nightmare trying to get it set up. I couldn’t think of anything else. 
It came between my husband and I. My husband had an affair during this time. We’ve been married for 30 some years. Suddenly, my older son came and told me he said, “Dad is seeing somebody.” I feel apart. I totally fell apart. I couldn’t take it. I was like, “Are you kidding me?” I had no inkling.
AS: You were kind of distracted. 
LB: Yeah. I think he just… I don’t know. I don’t know what happened. Then he told me, “Yeah, I don’t really, I think we have been married a long time and sometimes don’t you feel like you need a change?” And this was all during this time. My world fell apart. We were best friends. He was my best friend. We did everything together. We went through thick and thin with all the kids. It was horrible. I had to go to work and pretend like it was ok. 
Finally, one day my supervisor came to my job site for a staffing or whatever and I just fell apart to her [laughter]. Totally fell apart. I said, “I’m a mess. I don’t know if I can even do this job.” She said, “You are doing fine.” She was very supportive, which I didn’t expect. I would burst into tears at the dumbest places. I just couldn’t do it. 
AS: I cannot imagine. 
LB: I kept thinking, “Other people go through worse things than this. Get it together. Hold it together. Some people their kids kill themselves and they have to deal with that. My kid is alive.” I kind of felt guilt like “Oh god, pull it together.” And I would see all these other people and their kids had committed suicide or overdosed and I just felt for them. I just thought I don’t know how I can even do this anymore. I was close to giving everything up and saying, “I can’t do this anymore.” You get to that point but something keeps you going. It kept me going, I don’t know what. I guess I had hope. I would pray and pray and pray. I was a Christian but I wasn’t real sold on the whole idea totally. I thought what is my other option? I don’t have any other option. That is what people say. It has got to be god. I had nothing to lose here. I prayed and prayed and prayed. 
Jordan did well in treatment. He got into lifting weights, he got into meditation and yoga because that was part of their activities there. It was more realistic. They had groups all the time where he could talk and talk and talk. He really liked his counselor. It was a beautiful place. I went down there every weekend to visit him and eventually came on home passes and I would bring him home and bring him back and bring him back. I didn’t care what it took. It was awesome because I felt like he really connected with himself. We would go down by the lake and have long talks down there. It was the first time in years that we had really connected. 
Anyway, they wouldn’t do longer than 30 days because he had already been in treatment once and the county didn’t pay for longer. I’m thinking 60 days at least. Once he caught wind of that, “Nope, I’m getting out in 30 days. I’m ready, I’m good. I’m good.” He got out and he came home and he was very motivated to get a job. I got to get a regular schedule in my life like I had there. I need to get a membership at an exercise place to work out. I love that. Everyday I do it. 
I couldn’t afford to sign him up right away. We had lost our business last summer that kind of went downhill. We didn’t have hardly any income other than mine. My husband get social security but that wasn’t enough. Then Jordan needed all this stuff all the time. Cigarettes and clothes. It was just constant. Treats and, “Bring me this, bring me that.”We didn’t have much income so I couldn’t get him his gym membership and he was like “Oh, whatever.” It was so stressful trying to… I was nervous about him being home. 
His girlfriend had just totally done him in. She turned into an I don’t know what. She had mental illness issues big time. Her and I were close and she just turned on you. Just turned on you. That is what she did to him. She wanted him back but she was living with a new guy. “I’m not coming back to you if you are living with him” “Well we’ll just hang out then.” I said, “Jordan, don’t go for that. I know you love…” “I love her! I love her and I love my dog.” After he got out he realized that wasn't good for him. She’s a bitch anyway. Just get rid of her. I said, “Well, it’s probably a good choice. If she’s not doing you any good. She’s messing you up. Telling you she cares but she’s with somebody else. 
I took him all over to apply for jobs. First of all, he called and asked this girl out that worked at the jail when he was in jail. And I thought, “Oh good, here we go, another relationship.” I said, “What did they recommend in treatment? Don’t get involved and work on yourself for a while here.” “I know mom, but you aren’t me.” He starts going out with the girl from the jail and he moved in with her after a week. He moved in with her. He has been out of treatment for two weeks. She had a little boy and I know she had tons of problems. Nice gal, but just…
AS: Is this just this spring?
LB: It has been a couple of months. He got out in May. I could see some of the patterns starting with him again. He wasn’t handling his anxiety and he was on all these different meds and they changed them all around and they put him on not suboxone but a different one with the opiates that would keep him from craving it. 
AS: Methadone?
LB: No, a different one.
AS: Vivitrol? Epinephrine?
LB: Yeah the vivitrol I think.
AS: A shot?
LB: No, he takes a pill. I can’t think of the name of it now but it was one I recommended and he started on it there and he said it really helped because he wasn’t thinking about using. He wasn’t thinking about drinking. He said I am just focused now. I feel better. I got on a different antidepressant and that seems to be working better for him. His anxiety was still there. They took him off the ativan and wouldn’t want to go back on it. He wished for that because he felt better on it. 
He is living with Taylor and her little boy and he loves the little boy. He loves kids. He stayed there and then he decided he had to get a job because we didn’t have work for him in our business because our business… we were forced out of our business in town. We got evicted and we couldn’t pay the rent there. We moved everything out to our farm which was unorganized and we couldn’t do what we were doing because we didn’t have any sales. Everything was downhill. He said, “I need to get a job somewhere and keep myself busy.” So he did. He got a job, went to about 20 places interviewing and got a job eventually with Jesse Trouble doing basement foundations which was a horrible, hard job to do but he stuck in it. I kept feeling sorry for him thinking, “I got to pull him out of this. It is too hard for him. He has to get up at 5 in the morning and drive to Litchfield.” 
AS: Poor baby!
LB: I feel so bad! He doesn’t have any money. I would scrape up a little for cigarettes for him thinking I want you to quit but whatever. At least you’re not drinking and using drugs. I can’t take everything away from him. 
He worked and he was very reliable. He talked about maybe being a supervisor eventually but he only got 11 dollars an hour. I mean oh god, that is terrible for the work you do. Then Craig got into this thing recently where they repair semi trailers out at our place. At first it was slow but now it really picked up. Now they have a chance to make some pretty good money doing it. This guy also sponsored my son in racing. Everything kind of looked up. In the meantime we were losing our home. It was in foreclosure. The sale was set for June 7th. It has passed now. We did come up with the money. We didn’t know how. It was like some people came forward that we didn’t hardly know and they helped us. It was like an angel stepped into our life. We weren’t planning. We’ve got six months to move out and we have been there for 30 something years. It was a total disaster. This spring was a total, in some ways, he went to treatment, did good, then he got out and things were just stressful. We were losing our house. He was in limbo I felt with his use. Now, we did get the house saved. We owe tons of money to people to pay them back. I don’t know how we are going to do that. 
Anyway, Jordan… him and Taylor were not doing well. The new girlfriend. She went out with some old boyfriend. He found out about it. She thought he was seeing Caitlin again, the first girlfriend and he really wasn’t. Anyway, he didn’t have any income because he quit his job. He finally couldn’t take the job anymore. My husband talked him into coming back to work for him. I was leery, I thought, “There’s not a lot of order around here. They’re kind of unorganized and it is dad and it is easy to say I’m sleeping in today.” 
That’s exactly what happened. He just started sleeping all day. He wouldn’t get up. I’m thinking, “Oh god. Don’t tell me he is back into pills or something again.” I thought, “He can’t because he is testing randomly for his probation requirements.” I would look up warrants everyday because I don’t really know at this point what is going on with him. 
AS: He is still living with…?
LB: He is living with us now. He moved out. She kicked him out and said he is crazy, she can’t live with him. He did come out a couple weeks ago on a Sunday and I said, “Jordan, what is wrong?” He came in the house. “I don’t have any effing money. I’m sick of living like this. I’m not doing this. I drive a piece of crap car. I had everything at one time. I sold drugs and I had money. I am so tempted to go back to selling drugs again.” I said, “Jordan, you have that choice. But do you want to sit in prison? You say I’ll just do my prison term and get it over with. Do you realize that once you got in there it is worse than jail and you would regret your decision?” “I know I would but I don’t care at this point. I’m so sick of everything. I don’t want to be sober all my life. I would rather be drinking and using drugs because I felt a lot better. This is crap. I’m not living like this for five years I’m on probation. I can’t do it. I can’t do it.” They almost set him up to fail. They give him five months probation but it seems like eternity at that age. It is a long time. 
I am living in limbo now with him. He is at our house, Taylor won’t let him come back even though he’s got half his stuff there she won’t let him come back and get it. He is going to have to figure that out he is trying to be nice so he can get his stuff back. He wants to see the little boy again because he misses him. In the meantime his ex-girlfriend took his dog. She came out one night when she had found out he had a girlfriend and she came out one night and just took the dog from me. Just came to our house and grabbed this big german shepherd that we loved. We took care of her all these years because they couldn’t have her in town and took her. Jordan was just upset. He loved that dog so much. Now he is starting to see her a little bit again so he can see the dog. 
A couple nights ago Craig came in and said, “He’s got to be using again because he is acting so strange. He sleeps all day and he is talking stupid and he is getting all anxious and worked up and mad like he used to and I don’t know where it is headed. That is basically where we are at right now with it. We don’t know really. I had a talk with him yesterday and I tried to stay calm and not question him constantly because sometimes he will give information if I don’t ask him. 
AS: If you just surround…
LB: Yeah. He did say Taylor doesn’t want him back. I heard him call her and she said, “No, you can’t come back. You are crazy.” He had some outburst with her crying. He was at our house one day because they were going to cook out because she is kind of demanding. “We need to do fun things on the weekends. You can’t work every weekend.” Well, sometimes that’s what you have to do. She didn’t, of course, she is kinda idealistic. She wanted him to pay the rent. I think she kind of took him in because she thought he had some money coming in. I don’t know.
This is where we are at. He is living… he sleeps pretty much everyday. He wants money and I say, “Jordan, you need to work. You only out in a couple hours all week. We can’t pay you for what you haven’t worked. We want to help you but you need to help yourself somewhat here. You need to start going to meetings again. Don’t you want to…” I’m through all that crap. I’m not doing any of that stuff. As soon as I am off probation I am going to start using again. I like my life better like that. 
AS: In five years he is going to do that?
LB: He thinks he might get off sooner although I don’t think so. Because they already took that away from him. Whatever that is called. He is walking the fence right now. Some days I think, well, I read some of the stuff people post: Let them go, you can’t… And I understand that part of it but it is my kid. I love him to death, he’s got so much potential. He is a loving, sweet person inside. He is the closest to me. He was my baby. He was sweet. He had episodes but, you know? I can’t imagine seeing him in prison. I keep thinking that in my mind. I want to … his PO and his dad… I better try to stay out of it. 
Everybody has got their own opinions. I saw this thing the other day. “Give your child what they need, not what they deserve.” It is like yeah, that is where I am at. I am a terrible caretaker. I know I am. 
AS: You mean you are terrible in that you care take and you’re saying that that is terrible?
LB: People tell me it is terrible. My daughter yelled at me the other day. She is almost an RN now. She has turned her life way around. She is very successful. She knows all the answers. “Mom, you’ve always been like this.” More or less saying that I wasn’t a very good mom because I took care of everybody too much. She fails to remember what I had to go through with her and if I hadn’t hung in there with her I don’t know what would have been. She got into drugs too when she was young. Somehow overcame them on her own. 
AS: But you were there for her. 
LB: I was there. I pulled her out of a drug house one night after work. I have been there for all the kids like that. 
AS: You have been there for all your kids but now you’re thinking of yourself as not a good mother?
LB: I feel like I have been, not that I have failed, but I feel like I should have this, I should have done that. I don’t dwell on that because I know I can’t change it. I have to move forward and do what is good for me. But then again see my husband is not like he used to be. He’s not a caring… we don’t have a very good relationship ever since he has had this affair. It just took something out of it. I tried to overcome it. I got into therapy. He keeps telling me how strong I am and that I can get through all of this without falling apart, but I feel like sometimes I am falling apart inside because I can’t remember things. I can’t focus like I used to. I just have this in the back of my mind all the time. I am worried with Jordan now. I am worried about everybody. I am worried about all the kids. I have a 46 year old living in my apartment above the shop that is a chronic alcoholic. 
AS: That is your oldest?
LB: He is my oldest. People say kick him out. Tell him to get out of there. We would have to foot the bill if we kicked him out. It’s not an option. I can’t stand it. I’m getting so I can’t stand him. He’s my kid and I can’t stand him. I love him and I feel bad for him but I can’t stand his behaviors. Taking care of everybody. That is what I am doing. I don’t see an end to it really. I don’t know where the end is ever going to… until I die probably. I’m going to be 65 soon. I think, “Geez! This isn’t what I had planned for at 65. I just thought things would be more settled or something. I don’t know why I thought that.”
AS: What is Seth doing?
LB: Seth was working for a company. He was working with my husband in this business. Seth kind of took over the financial end of it. He is very good with that. Although, some of the decisions… he made my husband and him… this business kind of tore the family apart. 
AS: What was the business?
LB: At first they did work in food processing plants. They traveled all over putting piping and machines in and equipment. It traveled all over the country doing that. We sold out and then we started a local business in Willmar called Candy Coatings. They did sandblasting, painting, and powder coating and that kind of stuff. That led into… my husband has been in and out of many businesses. He is very good coming up with something. But he is not good at keeping records, following through. Anyway, Seth took that over and I think he is good at it but he would spend money on things he thought was important and Craig didn’t agree. 
AS: It pulled them apart. Is Seth sober that you know?
LB: No. He is a social drinker. I don’t know really. One time I thought he was more than that but I think he is straightening out. He has seemed to identify what is good for him and what isn’t. He is growing up a little bit. He is 27 and his adult brain is starting to function and his frontal lobe or whatever is kicking in! [laughter]
He has tried to help us figure out what to do financially. He races stock cars and he’s very good. He has won some huge races. He is famous out in west central Minnesota. I am just so proud of him with that. Jordan has always felt second to Seth. He has always felt he is not as good, he is big, he should have been in football. He is like a football player. He is huge. That kept him from snocross racing. 
AS: He didn’t find his own way.
LB: No, he didn’t. Then, my husband always told him, “We want to get you into racing too. We will build a car for you.” We have never been able to afford it. Jordan has had to work for things more so than Seth. Seth kinda got things handed to him. He was older and he got spoiled. He is a real achiever. Jordan isn’t as much. He’s very intelligent but he just doesn’t have that spark to… plus he has some mental health issues that Seth doesn’t have. 
AS: Have you ever had him diagnosed?
LB: Yes. We sent him to St. Cloud. When he was in treatment he went up to St. Cloud, I can’t think of the name of the place now, where they diagnosed him. He went and did a lot of testing. Yes. It came back with him having defiance disorder, which doesn’t mean a whole heck of a lot. I have a little bit of background in psychology, not that I remember all of it. It was like a blanket coverage, typical things that I kind of already knew. We didn’t find anything alarming or… Yes. He has anxiety and depression and he has always had that. As a kid even. He just wasn’t diagnosed back then. He has always had a lot of anxiety even as a little kid he did. Seth will just brush things off and go think by himself. Jordan will act out and scream and holler.
AS: Do you have any good mother friends?
LB: Just through work. A couple ladies that I work with. One has gone through a little of this stuff. I think she has a real mental disorder too. It is hard. I have to overlook that a little bit to share with her. I mean, she knows what is going on. She is nice. She is very nice. I don’t put her down for that. 
Not really. I have lost contact with some of my friends partly because I feel like for one thing I had kids later. People my age their kids are all grown and gone. I have six grandkids with my older kids. The younger ones, I was the old mom in school. [laughs] With Jordan, I was 42 when I had him. It seems like people my age or people that I was friends with have moved on in their life. They are retired, they are going on trips. They aren’t mothering anymore. If they did have problems they are off dealing with them on their own. I am still dealing with my youngest. 
My therapist says I am the one that always feels like I have to take care of everything. What is going on with this today? Are you getting that trailer done today? I am constantly having to be on top of everything. I think that comes from the jobs I have done too. I have always been at the top trying to lead everybody. I try and do that with my family and that doesn’t work. It drives me crazy. I have to let go of some of that. 
I think that was part of the reason I wanted to do this. “Oh, I get a chance to talk about my problems.” Nobody wants to hear them! 
AS: Hopefully your therapist does. 
LB: Well, he does, yes. He does. He is good. He is old. He is like in his late 70s. I have known him for a long time and he kind of runs this whole place. He had a lot of therapists and stuff. I think he is getting Alzheimer's. He forgets what we have talked about. He will start something…
AS: You might need to find someone else. 
LB: That is where things are at. I may have missed a few things along the way. 
AS: How is Gabriel? He was the one who was three times…
LB: Yes. He had a kidney disease we discovered when he was 14. He started drinking probably in his early 20s. My oldest didn't do that when they were young. They started doing it when they were later. Their dad is a chronic alcoholic. He turned himself around eventually. Their grandpa was. Gabriel has a lot of health issues. He had two heart attacks already. He is only 45. He turned 45 in May. Like I said, they were borderline. Both the oldest boys went through special ed back when they didn’t mainstream kids. They kept them in a room all day no matter how bad they were. They didn’t really get what they needed in school I don’t think.
AS: For the IEP.
LB: Yes. I think that really affected them a lot in thinking that we aren’t really good enough. We aren’t very smart. Yet, they are, they are very intelligent. It’s not that. They just have a hard time applying themselves to things. 
Gabe was married and got divorced. He has three kids. That was terrible. They had money, they had fitness centers, and they went broke and lost everything. He just went through all kinds of stuff too. He has all these health issues. His hips are collapsing. He weighs almost 400 pounds now. He used to be real fit. His whole life has collapsed around in. I stepped in and took care of that because I had to. He needed help. Nobody was really there for him. It is so hard to get anything from the community anymore. As far as social services. We fought and fought for disability. Finally got him disability. He worked at a job for many years, … Manufacturing. They got rid of him because of his health issues. It wasn’t really even legal I don’t think. We just didn’t have the money to fight it. We didn’t have the money to get an attorney. We didn’t call for assistance with it. Just had to let go of it and say, “Let’s get disability then so you have something to live on.”
AS: You have been through some stuff. You really have. 
LB: Well, yeah, you kind of wonder why some people don’t go through all of this. Then you kinda start thinking maybe I brought a lot of it on myself because of the way I am so caretaking. But what do you do? Ignore it when it is your kid? It doesn’t matter how old they are. I still, now I am taking him down. He went through treatment like three times. He almost died twice from alcohol. I was with him detoxing in the hospital. They had to detox him in the hospital because his heart and his liver and everything was bad. He wasn’t functioning well at all. They had to really watch him. 
AS: How old was he then?
LB: That was two years ago.
AS: So that was recent?
LB: Yeah. He is not drinking now. He went through treatment three times like I said. I think he is still sober. We hope he is. He seems to be. Now, he was going to get a weight loss surgery because they can’t operate on his hips until he loses some weight. They thought it was going to be too hard on his body. They recommended weight loss surgery. We went down to Abbott. Got that all set up and then he started drinking again so he couldn’t go through with it. He was so bad he would just lay on the ground. We would try to get him up. His son starting racing. My grandson. He had a first race. He was laying out in the yard. We should have brought him to the hospital. He was probably near death. I don’t know how many times we have gone through that with him. I think he is sover. We are going on the 8th again to redo all the stuff for the weight loss surgery. I am taking him down there on the 8th. We had an appointment the other day and then his car quit. I didn’t have tabs on my car and I had forgotten about it so I didn’t want to take a chance of driving a car down there so we will take his car. His son had taken it and didn’t tell him the battery was dead. It was a big mess. We had to cancel and reschedule. 
AS: Do you think he will do this surgery then?
LB: Yeah. He wants to. He just hates himself the way he is. He is self conscious. He doesn’t feel well. He can’t get around. He can’t climb steps. It has just taken so much away from him. 
AS: Where does he live?
LB: He lives in Hutchinson. He lives in an apartment that I got him. I had to get him housing and get him assistance because he just couldn’t do it on his own. There was nobody to help him really. 
My daughter has taken over some of it. She is a nurse. She took over his medication and stuff because I said I can’t do all this. I am trying to work. I am trying to deal with my own family. Put out my own fires. I can’t physically or mentally do all this. She took that over. Still helping him with his meds. Then she did end up having to take over his finances too because he wasn’t doing a good job of it. He was just giving money away. He is real vulnerable too in some sense. 
AS: Is there anything else?
LB: No, I can’t really… I feel like ever since I had… I don’t know. I feel like my life has been kind of a disaster ever since I was in high school. [laughter] It is just one thing after another. I keep thinking, “Do I bring this on or are these things that just happen to me?” 
Being a parent has been a chronic… something thrown at me everyday it seems like. 
AS: Which is interesting thinking about your mother.
LB: We are almost the same probably. I don’t know. 
AS: I don’t know, no, I just mean she just gave her children away. 
LB: I am going to do a DNA test to see if I have any matches anywhere. If anything would show up. If anybody has tried that. 
AS: To see if your father?
LB: It is like 100 bucks but I am going to save up and do it. Try to find my father. He is probably not alive but maybe my brothers. She said I have two brothers. One would be 10 years younger than me and one would be a year younger. I don’t know if she made that up because she was a storyteller too. 
AS: I don’t know why you would make that up.
LB: Why would you? No one else in the family ever heard that from her. She never said that to anybody else. Nobody knew she was pregnant.
AS: They wouldn’t have found you if she hadn’t brought you back. 
LB: No. No. She had hidden that from everybody. 
AS: So she has a record of being able to do that. 
LB: Yes. Yes. And she tried to play grandma to my kids but I was just like no. Yeah she was real frugal. She had a lot of money but she was real frugal. She would give them all a pair of socks for christmas and I got those at Goodwill and I only got them for 50 cents. 
AS: Oh great grandma!
LB: Thanks! Just what we wanted. A pair of argyle socks or something. Just goofy. Yet, there are so many similarities we have. She loved collecting and antiques and I am so into that. We have some similarities. And art. She was an artist and I kind of took that up when I was younger. I don’t do it now. Funny how life can… 
Then my cousin who I grew up with as a brother, all the parents have passed away now. They are all gone it is just my brother and I and we have a couple cousins in the family. Not many left. We have a strange relationship too. He never married, never had kids. He bought my parent’s home. He is still there. Has a dog and a cat and he had retired when he was really young. He was living in Miami for many years. He worked at immigration and had a very powerful job with that and made a lot of money. He moved up here and worked for Todd County for a while in the court system. Now he retired for good. He decided he wanted to go back for a while and he did. He was real tight. He didn’t want to help with the house thing. It is like, “Really? I would if I had the money. I would help you.” I didn’t say that to him because I can’t talk to him like that. I’m not real close to him.
AS: Right. But you asked. Which takes a lot of courage.
LB: Yes. He did help us one time a while back. We never paid him back a thousand bucks. Because we just never could do it. I was like I can’t ask him again. It is just one of those things. You just have to...
AS: You just keep on. 
LB: It’s like, well, it’s kinda sad but you move on. We are what we are. We aren’t going to be real close probably ever. Because I was the warrior in the family. I was the one that did smoke and drink and he read books and sat in his room. Didn’t go anywhere. Went to college and I pumped out kids left and right and drank and partied. Good grief. I didn’t fit in that family very well. [laughter] My dad was a politician. A barber and a hairdresser then he was the mayor of our city. We lived in a suburb of the cities. 
AS: Which was that?
LB: Lexington. He was on the metropolitan council. He was very political and it drove me nuts. I was never into that. I was a hippie back in the 60s. Hung out at love ins at Powderhorn Park. It was fun.
AS: Thank you. This has been really interesting. 
LB: I hope there is something that will be helpful. It was fun to get together with you anyway. This was kind of a treat for me to get away and do some … sometimes. It feels that way anyway. There probably are people out there that can help but you don’t really know how to find them sometimes. 
AS: My question is why do we continue to critique and judge our mothering? We are either mothering too much, as you think you are, or not mothering enough. What do you think about that?
LB: I think it is women in general. I think we are raised that way. I think it is put into our mind from an early age that the mom is the feeling part of the family and the caring part of the family. The dad is more the breadwinner. They don’t talk as much. They aren’t quite as feel-y as the moms. 
AS: But why wouldn’t they be the ones responsible for all the troubles? Why isn’t there that sense of how “Oh I failed my son.”
LB: My husband does feel that way. 
AS: He does.
LB: He does. He does a lot. He knows that he probably spoiled him and gave him too much and didn’t tend to the issues as they arose and instead was just waiting. He doesn’t like confrontation. I think he does feel bad about some of that. 
AS: Maybe they just might not want to speak about it very often. There is not the cultural expectation of caregiving. 
LB: Right. I agree that is a big part of it.
AS: I wonder if that is going to change a little bit. 
LB: I wonder. 
AS: I see dads doing more.
LB: Oh, yes. Much more than when I was a kid. Dad would come home and mom would have the table set, mom would clean up. That is ok if that is what you want to do. It’s not bad but things have changed. In some ways I think it was good because I think the family dynamics were a little bit closer back then than they are now in some ways. I don’t agree with everything. But I think families are really not together like they used to be. At least I have experienced that myself. We are encouraging kids to be so independent and involved in this and involved in that and do this. They’ve got to go to college. I don’t agree with that either. Kids have different interests. In that respect I think I did ok. Even trying to homeschool. Even if it failed. Seth went on to get his GED and he is fine. He went to college for a little bit and didn’t like it. They hate school. They like to have hands on jobs. That’s fine. Whatever works. I feel like I wish I had done a little more with myself. I mean I got a degree in psychology and communication. I worked in jobs and it helped but… I never really made any money doing anything with that. 
AS: What is it that you do exactly?
LB: Right now I work at… I took this just as part time because I wasn’t working at all when our business was succeeding. It is called Chyrsalis in Willmar. It is a friend of mine owns it. It is mentally ill, mentally handicapped adults. Right now I am just working with two women part time in their own apartment. I go there a couple hours a day. It is ok. It is some money. It is a job. At lesat I am doing something.
AS: And it is part time?
LB: Yeah. she would like me to do more. 
AS: You have a lot on your plate. 
LB: There is a lot going on. Defintiely. 
AS: At least for that kind of work. IF you were to do other work maybe it shouldn’t be caretaking.
LB: And I had a si… program. I worked at the women’s shelter as an advocate. I went to court with a lot of women. I worked at a facility for teenage girls for 12 years. Just a lot. I worked at the crisis center. I worked with a boys group. Sexually abused boys. I had that group for a long time. I guess that is what I felt comfortable doing. I loved doing that. But it does take a toll after a while. You know that I am sure. You kinda just get where you lose yourself in it almost. I can do this sure. I can help them yup. I can help them yup. What is your problem. And then it is like what am I going to do for myself. Where did I go?
AS: Thank you. "

At the Narrator’s Home
Chanhassen, Minnesota
Janie Bining Colford-JC
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I’m with Janie Bining Colford at her home in Chanhassen. It is June 29, I think.
JC: Yes.
AS: Janie would you state your name and say that you give me permission to record this interview?
JC: Sure. Janie Bining Colford and I give permission for you to record this. 
AS: Thank you. Can you just start by talking a little bit about your childhood and where you grew up and where you went to college? Just to kind of give us a little life background.
JC: Sure. I grew up in a suburb of, in the country outside of Cincinnati, Ohio on a farm. It was mostly a grain farm but we had cows and pigs and chickens. I was one of three girls. Although I do have a half-brother from an affair my father had. A pretty normal farm girl childhood. I went to Claremont Northeastern School, high school. I have a horticulture degree and worked in the horticulture field for a number of years. Then moved to Minnesota and worked, I think I was twenty-one maybe, when I moved to Minnesota. I worked for a landscape, lawn care company in Roseville. Albrecht Landscaping, actually. Just did that for the summer. Decided that horticulture wasn’t really a good year round thing in Minnesota. So I started working for Prudential.
I came here, actually this is maybe key to the story. I came to be in Minnesota because a guy that I met while in college that I was sort of engaged to, although I think it was more kind of a fling. He came here for chemical dependency training. After he got out of treatment he stayed here. I moved here and we lasted maybe a month. Another guy that he lived with, that also had been in treatment, he and I started dating. We ended up getting married and having two kids. My ex-husband, is the father of my two older boys. He was in recovery for a number of years, although now he drinks and smokes. As far as I know that’s all. I don’t know what else you want to know. I was twenty five or twenty six when I had my oldest son. Then two years later had Chance. Now I have three other children with my second husband.
AS: So how long were you married to your older boy’s father?
JC: I think I got married in 1989. We got divorced in 1997. We split up in 1983.
AS: ‘93 do you mean?
JC: ‘93. Yes, ’93, so not very long. [Laughs].
AS: Were you single parenting the boys for a while?
JC: No, I had for probably a year and a half, I had them during the week and every other weekend he had them. Then we switched to I had them for a week and he had them for a week. He moved to the same town that I was in. So we were able to make that work, same school district and everything. [Side conversation]. 
[Recording resumes after break]
So we did week to week for the boys which worked out well for the most part. Although different parenting styles in each house I’m sure was one of our biggest challenges. The fact that the boys stepmother, who was very controlling and very much wanted to be their real mom, made it a little bit difficult. Anyways we did that pretty much up until they were out of high school. Probably at least until the older one was. When Chance, he’s the one with substance abuse disorder, when he was in high school he started using. Maybe even before then. When we started to become aware of that that was when he was in high school. I think it was his senior year that my husband, my current husband, did a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. We had to move down there. We moved to Jacksonville Beach for a year. Chance was going to stay here with his dad and finish high school. Then he never quite made it to his senior year because he had a DUI. I shouldn’t say he didn’t make it to his senior year. He didn’t make it back to Champlin Park High for his senior year. He went to some alternative sober high school. In January of his senior year, which would have been 2008, he moved to Jacksonville Beach to live with me and my husband. At the time it was just Emma. So he went down there and he got into the public school down there and finished high school. 
AS: How was it when you first started noticing problems with him in high school? What was your approach as a mother towards his problems?
JC: What I knew was that he was smoking weed. I did not know that he was drinking alcohol and doing other drugs, which apparently he was. I didn’t really think it was a big deal. [Side conversation with kid].
[Recording resumes after break]
AS: You were saying that you weren’t concerned about his pot smoking. It seemed kind of within normal teen parameters?
JC: It did, except there were a couple times when he was in trouble with the police. He was smoking weed in a public park and he got picked up. We did what we thought was the right thing at the time, which was send him to do an assessment and then just an outpatient treatment. He went to Anthony Louis Center. We just kind of monitored him. Probably didn’t have my eyes wide open at the time because according to him he was doing many other things besides marijuana that was not obvious to me. I earlier said that he came down to Florida to live with us. That really came about because right before senior year started he was picked up for a DUI. He went back to treatment at that time, back to Anthony Louis this time as an inpatient. That was when I was in Florida.
AS: Where is Anthony Louis? Is it around here?
JC: It’s in Anoka I think.
AS: Okay, I’ve never heard of it.
JC: They have On-Belay House which is in Plymouth, so it’s part of that whole group. Anyway, he did that and he went to Anthony Louis Center. Then he went into sober school. I forget which one. He’s been to like three of them around here. That may or may not be in existence now. Then he started using again. He went back to Anthony Louis Center for a third time probably within like a year and half period. Went right from there to On-Belay House which is a halfway house, or transitional house, in Plymouth. He was going to a sober high school and got kicked out of there. Not for using but for attitude. Imagine that, an addict with an attitude.
AS: Yes or a teenager with an attitude. Imagine.
JC: He got kicked out of there. He was hanging out with kind of…his dad would not let him back in his house.
AS: You were in Florida.
JC: I was in Florida and this was winter. His dad took him around all the homeless centers one night. They were full. This is a seventeen year old boy. I guess he was playing the tough love card. Nobody had any room at the inn. [Laughs]. So he ended up couch surfing for a few days. Then we bought him a ticket to come down to Florida, which was an experience because he got down there and we immediately got him enrolled in the high school. I’d come to find out he needed like one class. This was January into his senior year and he’d been to school maybe a cumulatively three weeks out of that whole senior year so far. He only needed one class to finish up school in Florida. We made him take a full load and he got a job at the local, little pizza shop down there. Again, kind of eyes half closed, he got into drugs down there and was drinking. Keeping it relatively secret not so bad that it became obvious. Until a couple months before we moved back here. His boss caught him sneaking beer while at work from the tap. Confronted him about it and addressed it and then he kept his job. He was better at sneaking the beer I guess. Am I rambling too much?
AS: No, no, no. At what point does it start to get worse?
JC: So we came back here, this was 2008. He graduated from Neptune Fletcher High School, or something, down there. It was in Jacksonville Beach. That was like in May. In July of that year we moved back up here to Minnesota. At the time we lived in Champlin. He got a job and he started community college. Things were going okay. 
AS: Was he living with you?
JC: Yes, he was living with me and my husband. By now I was pregnant with the twins. That went on and I’m sure he was using and drinking a little bit. It didn’t seem out of control. He was, like I said, working. He was going to school. He was getting good grades. Then it was August in 2001 when he went out to New York with his dad and stepmom and brother to his cousin’s wedding. While he was there he was talking to his cousins. Apparently he told one of his cousins that he was using heroin. The uncle, the cousin’s dad, overheard this and told my ex-husband. Then John, the dad of the cousin, my ex-husband’s brother, called me to tell me. We just weren’t sure how to address this. We didn’t know what to do. We had never in our wildest dreams thought he would be using heroin. Apparently he was unique in that he never used prescription drugs. 
AS: Oh, he just went straight to it.
JC: He just went straight to heroin. I want to say probably went straight to injecting. We decided that he was such a good negotiator and such a good liar that if we just tried to talk to him without support we wouldn’t be successful. We hired an interventionist from somewhere in Ohio. Her name was Jane Metts. She came out and we did some planning. We decided on Promises Rehab Center out in California. We had this big thing worked out. The morning of it my husband and I kind of made up some, “We’re going somewhere” you know and got Chance. It was at his dad’s house. We had someone watching the little kids at my house. We got him over there. I’d already had a bag packed assuming this would all go his way. We do this intervention and then Jane said, “You’ve heard from your mom and dad. We’ve got this treatment center.” The director the treatment center had flown out. She was there. This cost us a lot of money. [Laughs]. “You’ve heard all this and we’ve got this treatment center, Promises is all picked out for you, they’re ready for you.” I can’t remember her name now. “She’s going to fly back with you.” Patricia. Patricia Meyers. “So what do you think?” He goes, “Well what are my other options?” Jane said to him, “You don’t have any other options.” He said, “Okay, well then I guess I’ll go.” So he went, did ninety days at Promises.
AS: Did you confront, is that the first time you talked to him about his heroin use? Did he admit to it at that point?
JC: Yes. He was always, and always has been, and still is very forthcoming once you confront him. Once you get him to start talking about it. He’ll do the whole denial thing like, “What are you talking about?” [Yelling kids]. 
[Resumes after break in recording]
He’s always, once you kind of get past the bullshit, then pretty open about his use. Has generally, when push comes to shove and it’s time to go to treatment, he goes. He’s been in inpatient treatment eleven times.
AS: Eleven.
JC: Eleven times. Some of those times was us saying, “This is your only option.” A couple times he’s asked to go back. So he went to Promises. Is this the kind of stuff you want to hear?
AS: Yes, yes.
JC: He went to Promises. He was in Promises for ninety days and then went to a very structured sober living house in Venice. He was at the West LA Promises, not the Malibu. West LA is more for his age group. Then he did, I think it was about five months, of sober living at a place called Casa del Oeste which is a great place. Then he and another boy from there moved out into an apartment on their own. I say boy, I think he was twenty nine at the time. They both relapsed. We didn’t know that for a little while. The other boy died, not of a drug overdose, but of septic shock.
AS: From?
JC: From intravenous needles. Yes. It was definitely drug related. Chance initiated going back at that point to the sober living house.
AS: Just back to the house?
JC: Not back to treatment at this point. 
AS: They let him?
JC: Yes, they let him which seemed to work out just fine for a while. He stayed there for another four months. He got a job and he was working at a golf shop and playing golf when he wasn’t working, doing the whole recovery thing. Then he met this girl at work. Summer was her name. I don’t know if she was ever in recovery but at the time that he met her she was using. So he relapsed. By the time he relapsed he had moved out of the sober living house and was living with two other people in recovery that had long term recovery under their belt, still in Venice. They found out he was using and they called me to let me know that they would be asking him to move out. He moved in with this girlfriend. No, no, no. He didn’t. He was on the street for a few days and then he went back to Promises. He didn’t stay the whole ninety days. He stayed maybe a month and a half. Then he moved in with this girlfriend.
Then it got really bad and he and his girlfriend became so, I don’t know what the right word is, they were both using so much. Things were getting out of control. They were scaring each other. She finally called me. I’m trying to remember when this was. It was like 2012 I think. He came back here. I convinced him that morning to get on a plane. He came back here and did a detox, went straight from the airport to detox then to treatment. Then relapsed and just kind of over and over. He went to a couple more treatment places. He wasn’t living here, he was renting rooms. Did a sober living house for a little bit. Then he ended up going out to Utah for treatment. He came back here, went back out to Utah again. [Talks to child]. There’s just treatment, after treatment, after treatment. Relapsed. Some of those treatments, ninety days, a few of them were ninety days. He went to Hazelden somewhere in between there. He went to a couple different places here. One was Lake Place Retreat. He’s been in different sober living homes. 
AS: How are you managing at this point?
JC: At this point?
AS: I mean during all these treatments, are you involved in finding them all the time?
JC: Most of the time.
AS: Are you coordinating? What’s your role as his mother at this point?
JC: Yes, doing all that, almost always looking for the place, finding it, arranging for him to do the intake, to do the assessment. He’s always had private insurance. So he’s never had to do a Rule 25 kind of thing. Part of me wonders if some of that was a disadvantage, me always doing all this for him. I mean I would be the one making the phone calls. I talked to more treatment centers over my lifetime than I ever thought I would. I was just trying to find one that’s different.
AS: That would actually work.
JC: One of the treatment centers he went to in Utah, he was there for thirteen months. It was really comprehensive, they had a great transitional program, and he did great while he was there, which is his story. He does great when he’s in treatment. He’s cooperative, he’s probably manipulative. He does great and then he gets out and he relapses. Yes, I just managed the crisis. [Talks to kids].
[Resumes after break in recording]
AS: So do you feel, is there a kind of a breaking point for you?
JC: There hasn’t been yet. [Laughs]. Maybe I need to have a breaking point.
AS: I’m not suggesting that. I’m wondering how you’re managing with three small children and this constant.
JC: I don’t know. I mean I’m sure somewhere someone is suffering in terms of not enough attention. I don’t know. Everybody seems to be holding together right now and has. I don’t know. I just do what needs to be done and get extremely overwhelmed and extremely stressed but somehow manage it. I’ve never been a person that believes that hitting rock bottom is what’s needed. I believe that rock bottom is death and why would you wait until that happened. I know that that’s not what other people believe and that’s fine. To me, I’ll do what I need to do to convince him to get treatment if I think things are out of control or when things get out of control. It’s stressful having him here right now. I know he doesn’t always want to be here. It’s also a peace of mind because I’m not wondering, when he doesn’t answer his phone, where he is, is he alive. There’s been too many times when that’s happened. I don’t know if you want to hear stories.
AS: Of those times? Yes. The whole thing I’m thinking about is the disaster of addiction and what that’s like for a mother of an addict child.
JC: It was, I’m not sure I’m going to get these years right.
AS: It’s okay.
JC: There was a point, a couple years ago, when he had been to New Roads Treatment Center in Utah. That was the place that I was mentioning that’s long term. The first time he was there he just really did their inpatient. He didn’t do their transitional living. He chose to leave before that, lived with a girl that he met there. That ended up being a disaster. He overdosed while living with her. She called 911. Fortunately, he was saved with naloxone. They lived together for about eight or so months. Then they broke up, he really didn’t have anything keeping him in Utah and he came back here. 
He was living with us for a couple of months. He got a job but quickly went back to hanging with his friends in Champlin that were still using. Quickly he got back into heroin. Quit his job, started doing odd jobs with this guy that he…He, I knew when he started using because he stopped coming home. He knew that if he was actively using he couldn’t live here at the time. He got pretty deep down in the hole very quickly. Which I know happens. That would have been around May when he moved back here. It was mid-July when he finally asked; he called me one day and said, “Can I go back to treatment?” I’m like, “Yep. When and where?” He wanted to go back to New Roads. I made the phone calls, I got him an airline ticket, and he went out there. 
I knew that he was going to hook back up with this girlfriend. They had been communicating. She did not have any insurance. Or no, I take that back. She had insurance, but a really high deductible. I knew that if he went there and she wasn’t going to go to treatment or get well it would end up being a disaster. So I even made tons of phone calls for her. Worked out an arrangement where I found a treatment center that would take her and waive her deductible. Made all the arrangements for her, made all the arrangements for him. She was going to meet him at the airport and they were going to then go to their respective treatment centers. Well they didn’t. They went to a hotel and used that whole night but called me to let me know. 
AS: That they weren’t going to treatment?
JC: They weren’t going to treatment right away. 
AS: The one more night thing.
JC: Yes. It was like two more nights. They were going to spend that, he didn’t get in there until like nine, they were going to spend that night, the whole day and then go that following morning which would have been a Wednesday. As it turned out, he was not only using heroin but using Benzodiazepine. That next day, I had been in communication with them both all day. He was so out of it he couldn’t understand me when I talked to him. I had, unbeknownst to them, it was like four or something in the afternoon our time. I called both of their treatment centers and I said, “I know you guys are scheduled to pick them up, respectively, at this time tomorrow morning. Can you go pick them up right now? They’re both at this hotel. Here’s the address, go get them.” Well, her treatment couldn’t. His treatment said, “Yep. We’ll be there.” This was in Salt Lake City; they were like two hours outside of Salt Lake City in Provo. They said, “We’ll be there in a couple hours.” Well I then called a girlfriend that I knew of hers and said, “She’s going to be there overnight by herself because her treatment center can’t. Can you go stay with her? So she’s not alone.” So this girlfriend was going to go stay with Jerrica. Chance’s treatment center was going to come. 
In the meantime, I get a call from Jerrica saying, “Chance just took off and I don’t know where he went. He told me he was going to go mow his neighbor’s lawn.” She goes, “I’ve been trying to call his cell phone, and he’s not answering. He just took off without shoes. He had his jeans on and his t-shirt but no shoes and just took off saying he was going to go mow his neighbor’s yard.” I’m like, “Jerrica what is he using?” She tells me. I’m like, “He’ll be back.”
AS: That’s the benzos?
JC: That’s the benzos. I’m like, “He likes his things. He’s not going to sleep on the street.” He didn’t come back that evening. By like seven or eight I’m getting worried. She’s already worried. I’m calling the police. They said, “Well he hasn’t been missing that long, we can’t really do anything.” By ten o’clock that night I’m calling the three area hospitals every hour, all throughout the entire night. I’m calling the jails. I’m looking at the jail roster. I’m calling the police pretty much every hour. They’re getting sick of me. Finally, the next day at around ten thirty I manage to go into work somehow. 
AS: Where were you working at this time?
JC: I was working at Prudential. We had a nanny. The nanny was with the kids. I went to Prudential, I went to work. One of my girlfriends said, “Call the police one more time. Tell them it’s been almost twenty four hours. You need to file a missing persons report.” They finally said to me, “Was he a Utah resident?” I’m like, “No, he’s a Minnesota resident.” “Well you can’t file a missing persons report anyways. You have to file that in Minnesota.” “Well what the fuck good is that going to do? He’s not here.”
AS: He’s not in Minnesota.
JC: “Well you could file an intent to locate report. You could have done that last night.” I’m like, “Thanks. Okay. How do we do that?” Anyways, that got the ball rolling.
AS: Do the police at this point know that he’s an addict?
JC: Yes, I’ve told them.
AS: All that stuff and they don’t say you could file an intent to locate?
JC: No. My friend Belinda Stockman, who is the one that I mentioned to you that may be interested in doing an interview. Her son, who’s also an addict, at the time not a heroin addict but a meth addict, not meth, like synthetic drugs I think maybe meth too. Anyways that’s beside the point. She happened to be out there because he was in Utah in Drug Court and all caught up in that because he had a few felonies. He had gone out there because he was on the Olympic Team. He was supposed to go to Sochi. Then he got messed up in drugs, ended up in jail. Anyways, she was out there. I called her. I said, “Chance is missing. Here’s the area he was last seen in. Can you and AJ go drive around and see if you can find him?” So she did. She picked up Jerrica and they drove around. Of course they couldn’t find him. They did stop and talk to the police, gave him a description. He’s like, “Oh yes. I’ve gotten a few phone calls about him.” They knew everything. They knew the story.
I file the intent to locate report, I fax them a picture of him, tell them where Jerrica is, and tell Jerrica here’s what I’ve done. About fifteen minutes later I get a phone call from her all panicky. She goes, “The police are at my hotel door, they’re knocking, and they want to come in.” “So let them in.” She goes, “Well there’s drugs here.” I say, “Stuff them under the mattress. I don’t care Jerrica. The police need to talk to you.”
AS: I don’t really care what you do with the drugs.
JC: The police are knocking on the door saying, “Jerrica if you’re trying to hide your drugs we don’t really care about your drugs. We’re here to talk to you about Chance. Just let us in.” So they come in, they had my picture, the picture I faxed. They talked to her and got some information and then they leave. About five minutes later she said they came back and pulled up a photo on an iPad and said, “Is this him?” They had him in holding. They had had him in holding since three in the morning. They didn’t know because he didn’t know who he was. He was in his boxer shorts. We don’t know where his wallet went, we don’t know where his clothes went, and we don’t know where his phone went. All of that was gone. 
AS: Oh my Gosh. And he didn’t know his name?
JC: He didn’t know his name. He didn’t even know where he was. He thought he was in Minnesota. He didn’t know his name or was unable to say it. He was in the holding tank. He was charged with public intoxication and indecent exposure because he was in his boxers. I bail him out but I don’t just bail him out. I bail him out with the understanding that they’re only going to release him to the treatment center. The treatment center was going to pick him up. By the time all this got processed it was like eleven o’clock Wednesday night, Utah time. The treatment center goes to the jail to pick him up, he’s not there. They had released him earlier. He was waiting for them. They just couldn’t find them, sitting outside the jail. They get him, they start driving back to Provo, and they get to Provo. The other thing that when I arranged for Chance to go back to treatment, and I had told Chance this but he was high pretty much all the time while this was all being processed, that when he went back into New Roads that he would do the full program, that he would, after he got through the withdrawals, he would start on Vivitrol. When the guy, the director who picked him up from the jail, told him that Chance flipped out. He said, “I’m not doing Vivitrol.”
AS: So he knew what it was?
JC: Yes, because he had been on it before. 
AS: Oh he had. Okay.
JC: One o’clock in the morning my time I get a phone call from Chance saying, “Mom you’ve got to find me another place.” I’m like, “What?” He’s like, “They’re not going to take me.” I said, “What do you mean they’re not going to take you?” “Well they’re not going to take me because I don’t want to do Vivitrol and I already told them that. So they’re not going to take me.” I said, “Put Brandon on the phone.” I’m like, “What’s going on?” He goes, “Well I told Chance about the Vivitrol and he doesn’t want to do it.” I said, “Really? You’re having this conversation with him? First of all he knew that. He was high. Second, you’re having this conversation with a guy who is on so many benzodiazepines and heroin. You pick him up from the holding cell.”
AS: This is the conversation you’re going to have?
JC: I said, “Can you just wait? Put Chance back on the phone. Chance, here’s the deal. This is where you’re going. You don’t have a wallet, you don’t have any ID, and I can’t get you into another treatment center without that stuff. This is where you’re going. You need to just get your head straight and then we can figure out what’s going on.” This all happens. He gets there, well then he calls back to tell me, “Well we’re not going to detox him at New Roads. We didn’t realize how much benzos he had been taking.” Like sixteen a day, sixteen milligrams a day. The average dose is two to four. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be quite dangerous so they wanted to put him in a medical facility, a hospital, to detox. They took him to a hospital to detox. The next day I’m in a number of conversations with the people at New Roads about him being, I can’t think of the right words, belligerent and not grateful. All the things you would expect. 
AS: They’re telling you that he’s being that way? Like they haven’t seen that before?
JC: Right. “We’re not sure this is going to work out.” So I’m in the meantime trying to find another treatment center and telling them, “Here’s the deal. He doesn’t have an ID. Here’s our insurance. He’s in Utah now but we may need to move him.” I find a couple other places just in case. I think it was a week after. They weaned him off of the Suboxone really quickly because they wanted to get him on Vivitrol. 
AS: When was he taking Suboxone?
JC: He used Suboxone in the withdrawal.
AS: Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay.
JC: To help with the detox. He wasn’t really on Suboxone as a maintenance drug. 
AS: It was just during that detox.
JC: This is probably the worst story. That’s why I’m focusing on it. One Friday I’d been out on the boat almost all day and I didn’t take my phone. When I got back I have like six missed calls from New Roads and messages that, “Chance is trying to leave and the only reason that he hasn’t left is because we won’t give him the money that’s in his commissary account.” Or whatever you call it. I put $90 in there for miscellaneous expenses. “The only reason we’re able to keep him here is because we won’t give him that money.” I finally talk to Chance. I talk to Chance and he’s like, “Mom I’m leaving. Tell them that they can give me my $90.” I said, “First of all you’re not leaving. Second of all it’s not your $90.” He’s like, “Well then I guess I’ll just sleep on the street.” I’m like, “No, I think you’ll stay there.” He goes, “No, it’s already done. I already signed myself out. I’m leaving. They’re not going to take me back.” I’m like, “Yes, they are. I already talked to them. They’re going to let you stay.” He’s like, “No, I’m not staying.” I’m like, “Well, you’re not getting your $90. I hope you decide that you’re going to stay.” That was the hardest thing I ever did. I did not know if he was going to stay. I kept calling them to say, “Is he still there? Is he still there?” He was. 
AS: So he hadn’t really signed himself out?
JC: He had. He had actually signed himself out. He just thought I would tell them, “Give him the $90.” I’m sure he was going to buy drugs with it. His thing was he was going to get a hotel room.
AS: For one night if even.
JC: His girlfriend was in treatment. Her treatment center picked her up.  A few days later he did get the Vivitrol shot. Things calmed down, he stayed for thirteen months. It was the probably the scariest week in half of my life. I just didn’t know, especially the day, the twenty four hours that he was missing. That just made things maybe not so intense but they just keep happening. 
AS: Right, they just pile on. 
JC: His last relapse was also in Utah. He was there for thirteen months. He got out and lived with a couple other guys in recovery, about a year’s worth of recovery all three of them had. He and another guy there relapsed. The only reason I knew was because, there should have been red flags in talking to him and as I look back there were. He was working so he had some money. When he’d ask for a little bit of money here and there it didn’t seem so out of the ordinary. He was paying rent and utilities and all this stuff. He had a car and gas. He was going to college. 
He called me that he had had an accident, a car accident. That he had walked away from the scene. I said, “Well what happened?” “I don’t know. All I know is that I couldn’t stay there.” I said, “Did you hit someone else?” He goes, “I don’t know.” “You don’t know if you hit someone else? You don’t know if you hit a pedestrian? You don’t know if you hit another car?” He’s crying. I’m like, “Chance you need to go back to the scene of the accident. You need to find out if you hit someone else.” He’s like, “I can’t.” I’m like, “You can. I’ll stay on the phone while you do that.” So he does and he walks back to the scene. He doesn’t get all the way to the scene because the police are looking for him. He sees the police, he waves them down. Fortunately he had not hit anyone. He had hit a concrete barrier going about eighty miles an hour. His car was totaled. 
AS: And he was okay?
JC: He was.
AS: In shock but…
JC: Yes. So because of the adrenaline he was pretty coherent at that point. I’m talking to him thinking he doesn’t sound out of control. 
AS: Right, he’s kind of in the shock.
JC: He had blacked out and I’m sure the adrenaline, but he had two black eyes. He had a huge knot on his head. He had trauma to his chest. Which was minor compared to what the car looked like. I don’t know how he walked away. I’m assuming he had his seatbelt on or something. They took him to the hospital. They did not take his driver’s license right then and there. They didn’t smell any alcohol. He was drinking alcohol, he was using heroin, and he was taking benzos. I know this because the police made him hang up. I didn’t hear anything for a number of hours. 
Finally I get a call from him, from the hospital. I could barely understand him. They hadn’t sedated him or anything but by now the adrenaline’s gone and the drugs are there. I asked him, “What’s going on?” “I don’t really know.” “Well can I talk to a nurse?” He’s like, “I don’t know how to get a nurse.” Finally I call back and I get the nurse’s station and they’re like, “Well I can’t tell you what’s going on.” “Can you go to his room and get his permission to tell me? He’ll give it.” They did and they’re telling me, “Physically he’s probably okay. We did a CT and everything looks okay. We’ll probably be releasing him tonight.” I said, “What’s the tox screen say?” That’s how I knew alcohol, heroin, benzodiazepines, or opioids and benzodiazepines. I said, “Can you have him talk to a social worker or something? Don’t just like release him and call me before you release him.” None of that happened. They released him. 
He tells me, he calls me later after he had been out and one of his buddies picked him up. He calls me to say, “It was just a slip, I hadn’t been using very long. I’m kind of glad that this happened because I didn’t know what else to do. I was going to kill myself.” I’m like, “Oh my God.” He tells me this over the phone. I’m thinking, “Okay. Well that’s really scary but you’ve only been using for like a week.” He’s like, “I’m just going to stop. I’m going to stay in school and I’m going to get back on track.” Within the course of a couple days it became really obvious it wasn’t just a slip and it wasn’t just a couple weeks. He wasn’t managing to stay sober. This all happened on a Tuesday evening, Friday I flew out there. I got him to my hotel room and the next morning went back to my apartment to get his friend who was also using. I tried to help manage those two. I convinced him to come back here. That was in November. He came back here kind of under the pretense that he would detox for a week. He was so concerned that he didn’t want to drop out of school. I’m like, “Okay. We’ll detox for a week and then you can fly back.” No intention of really helping that happen from me. 
AS: No intention for you getting him back there to finish a semester?
JC: Right. He was really pissed off at me. He was like, “I’m just going to get a ticket and fly myself.” I said, “Good luck. I don’t know how you’re going to do that. I’ve got your ID; I’ve got your bank account card. You don’t have a job. Your dad’s not going to be helping.” His trust fund was paying for his rent.
AS: Oh his dad, he has a trust fund?
JC: He has a trust fund he does not have access to unless he’s in school. Then he still doesn’t have access to. The trust pays directly to school; the trust pays directly to his rent. He stayed here, got on Suboxone.
AS: Has that helped him? Have any of those medicines…
JC: The Suboxone, I think, helped keep him off heroin. There needs to be more for him and probably everyone. He wasn’t and hasn’t been willing to do 12-step meetings. That doesn’t do anything for him. He’s not a 12 Stepper whether or not he’s really given it a chance. I’ve got to think he has because I mean he’s been in treatment, pretty much every treatment place he had to spend some time in 12-steps. While he’s on it, if he’s taking it he’s not taking heroin.
AS: But he’s had trouble giving up other substances?
JC: Yes. Like weed and alcohol. Again, I don’t care about the weed. I really don’t but the alcohol. He can’t.
AS: That’s a real problem for him.
JC: I think the weed really helps his anxiety. Any other thing that he does he does to excess. 
AS: And he’s twenty six now and he’s relapsed again recently? How long has he been living at home?
JC: Since November.
AS: Oh so this was that, the November you were talking about or is that a different November?
JC: Yes, a couple weeks ago he relapsed again. This time it was a very short period of time, he went through all of his money. It didn’t last very long. He is now back on Suboxone. 
AS: Does he want to stay sober?
JC: He says he does. I don’t know. His actions haven’t really supported that. When we met with Charlie yesterday he told Charlie, “I want to get off heroin but I don’t want to give up weed.” Charlie’s like, “I don’t have a problem with that. If you want to use weed, if you use Suboxone daily and you want to keep using weed and you don’t use alcohol and you don’t use benzos or any other substance besides weed and Suboxone I’ll support that.” He asked me if I was in support of that. I said, “Yes, I’ll support that but if other substances start being used then we need to revisit this.” We’ll see. That was just yesterday. 
AS: Could you talk about how you got involved with Steve Rummler?
JC: Sure. So my nephew in 2013, I believe it was, died of a heroin overdose. My sister’s oldest son, Drew. [Long pause]. He died of a heroin overdose.
AS: When was that?
JC: That was in May, March or May. I think it was May of 2013. No, it was March of 2013. He had been using, he and his wife. He has a daughter that’s the same age as my twins. He had been in and out of trouble, with possession and intent to sell. Not that he really was selling but he had enough on him to qualify for that. He had been a drinker. He had some DUIs. He and his wife were both using. A few years prior to him dying my sister and Ashley, that was his wife’s mother, got physical and legal custody of the daughter and shared custody. Rory, the granddaughter, had already been in my sister’s and the other grandma’s care. Drew and Ashley, they lost their house that Drew had bought. He lost his job. They didn’t really have anywhere to live. They were living with Jackie for a little while but things got crazy. So Jackie said, “Drew you can stay here. Ashley you cannot.” Ashley went to live with her mother. Drew’s living with Jackie. Jackie’s husband who really, they weren’t really together but he was still living there. She couldn’t just get him to go. He is an alcoholic; he was an alcoholic he recently passed. 
Drew was living with Jackie; Ashley was living with her mom. They would still see each other. Drew was taking Suboxone or Subutex, whichever he could get. He got a prescription for Suboxone but he was sharing it with Ashley because Ashley couldn’t get in to see a doctor or wouldn’t get in to see a doctor. So he would inevitably run out every month towards the end of the month of his Suboxone because he was sharing it. He would go buy Subutex because it was easier to buy Subutex than Suboxone. One time, it was a Friday, he and Ashley went to buy Subutex and they also bought heroin. Nobody but he and Ashley knew that they each had heroin. 
They each went back to their respective parent’s house and they used that Friday night and Saturday. Then it was on a Sunday when he was at home in the basement of his mom’s house. Jackie had just talked to him. He’d gone downstairs and she was doing some laundry. The laundry room is downstairs. It’d been ten, fifteen minutes. She went down to switch out some laundry and she heard a noise, kind of a gurgling noise. She’s like, “Drew! Drew!” She found him on the floor, needle in his arm. He was still warm. They figured out between text messages that it couldn’t have been more than ten minutes because he had just texted Ashley and Ashley had texted him back. Then by the time she got down there it had been about ten minutes. She doesn’t know if he used right after the text message. 
Long story short they live in the country so it took the EMTs a long time to get there. The sheriff got there fairly quickly. Jackie in the meantime had been giving him CPR. He had aspirated or had vomited and had aspirated they think. By the time the EMTs got there, they had naloxone because the sheriff didn’t. He had been down at least twenty minutes. They weren’t getting a pulse. They got him to a hospital. By the time they got him to the hospital it’d been about forty five minutes after Jackie had found him. They had been working on him. They finally came out and said they had a pulse. My niece said, “You have a pulse because he’s living or because of what you’re doing?” They said, “Well we have a pulse.” So he was on life support for a few days but no brain activity. They pulled the plug on; I think it was Wednesday of that week. What got me involved was that my sister was just kind of beating herself up that she didn’t have naloxone. I had never heard of it at this point.
AS: She knew what it was?
JC: She did. I hadn’t heard of it. In Ohio you couldn’t get it.
AS: This was in Ohio?
JC: This was in Ohio. I had flown out there that Sunday evening. I was like, “Well what is that?” She told me and I’m like, “Oh yes. I’ve seen something on Facebook about that.” I’m like, “Jackie even if, you couldn’t have had it. You can’t get that as an average citizen in Ohio.” When I got back to Minnesota I started thinking, “Why can’t they get it?” I called the Drug Policy Alliance to find out. How can we get this in Ohio and how can we get it in Minnesota? I found out that someone in Ohio was working on it and that someone in Minnesota was working on it. They gave me Lexi’s and Judy’s, I think I had called Cathy King Willis, I don’t know if you know who she is. She’s in Illinois and she works for Roosevelt University. She works for the Illinois Drug Consortium as well as Roosevelt University. I had called her because I’d seen stuff from her on Facebook about naloxone laws in other states. She put me in touch with the Drug Policy Alliance in New York who then put me in touch with Lexi and Judy.
AS: Right, here. 
JC: I called to say, “I heard you guys are working on this. I want to help.” I started meeting with her, at the time it was Lexi, Sarah Gordon, Julia Pownell, Julie Hooker.
AS: Was that the opioid…
JC: No, this was just working on the Good Samaritan Law. They had already worked with Senator Eaton to get it drafted and were just starting to find a co-author. They were starting to get in touch with Dan Schoen. He co-authored it. When I got involved the bill had already been drafted. They were trying to work on how it was going to get introduced in the next session for 2014, getting public awareness prior to that. That’s when I got involved. We would meet weekly at the Recovery Church in St. Paul which is where MRC was housed at the time. That’s really how I became involved. 
Then I started, by then my son had been Hazelden earlier in 2013. He went right from Hazelden to New Roads down in Utah. It was kind of a door to door thing. Hazelden was recommending long-term programs. Chance found this place in Utah which looked more appealing to him I guess. They had outdoor activities and stuff. Then I started thinking, “Is Utah doing anything?” They were as well. I kind of kept up with what Utah was doing and what Ohio was doing, really more actively working on what we were doing here in Minnesota. The Utah thing, it got passed right around the same time ours did. By this time Jerrica and Chance were living together. I kept keeping them informed. “It passed so if something happens don’t be afraid to call.” Which when it did happen she wasn’t. She did call. That was good. 
AS: When he relapsed?
JC: When he overdosed in Utah. He says he’s been revived with Narcan three times. I was only aware of the one time. Apparently there have been a couple other ones.
AS: Yes, it’s a familiar story. What do you do now with…?
JC: So now I’m on the board of directors. I’m also the vice chair of the board which really doesn’t mean anything unless the chair leaves. I’m a volunteer. Right now I’m more involved in the overdose prevention program which was one of the three programs of the foundation. The other ones being prescriber education, and advocacy. I’m mostly doing community training. Most of my training has been one on one with other parents, training and distributing naloxone. 
Right now though we’re at kind of a stand still because we have very few vials of naloxone left in our source for getting naloxone has dried up. We were getting free product, the auto injector product from Kaleo. They’ve stopped our last application to get some they denied and said that they would be reconsidering applications. It wasn’t just ours that they denied, they didn’t approve any. They’re not doing their charitable piece right now which is a whole different story. This is the company that raised the price from $750 to $3,500.
AS: $750 for one?
JC: For two.
AS: For two doses?
JC: Now it’s $3,500 for two doses. 
AS: They just did this because the demand rose.
JC: The cynical part of me says that they give all these free doses away because who would want an auto injector instead of a vial and needle?
AS: Have those gone up too, the price of those?
JC: Yes, those have gone up as well. 
AS: What’s the name of the company again?
JC: Kaleo.
AS: How do you spell that? Is it with a “C?”
JC: No, with a “K.” This is the auto injector. So two of these is $3,500. They were giving all this away. Now they’re not. I’m sure hoping that the organizations they were giving it to will say, “Well we can’t afford that.” 
AS: No, how could anybody afford that?
JC: Right. If you get a prescription of it your insurance will cover it. Mine would. 
AS: But you have to be given a prescription.
JC: Right. You can go to any doctor and they’ll more than likely write you a prescription but most people aren’t going to do that.
AS: Not those users of heroin.
JC: A lot of moms who have shame aren’t going to do that either. They’re not going to go and get it. When we give it out we do training. We give you a kit, not just the medication. We give the training that has the instruction card. It has stuff in it. Then we were also getting IM from the Harm Reduction Coalition.
AS: What’s IM?
JC: The needle, vial. So we’ve had that as well. We were getting that for sixty nine cents a vial. Through the Harm Reduction Coalition which was getting it from Hospera which is the manufacturer, who’s now been bought by Pfizer. They had a program where they were giving it to Harm Reduction Coalitions and other charitable people who their requirement was that whoever they’re selling it to for sixty nine cents a vial, now it’s like $18 a vial, but that’s the charitable price.
AS: The eighteen is now their charitable price?
JC: The retail price is $45 for one. So sixty nine cents for one was totally reasonable and that’s what we were paying. We were getting it through the Harm Reduction group which had this arrangement with Hospera. Now the Harm Reduction group doesn’t think we’re grassroots enough. There’s a perception that our program with the hospitals is that we’re giving this to the hospitals. It’s like no. We’re supplying it to the hospitals to give to the people who have ODed, who come in to get revived.
AS: When they leave, because they’re just letting them back out. They’re not like taking them to treatment.
JC: Right. The hospitals weren’t going to do this. The hospitals weren’t going to pay for this. So we’re having it stored at the hospitals so the hospitals can get it to people.
AS: Just for distribution, that point of contact.
JC: Right. We have it at Methadone clinics for the same exact reason. We have it at sober living houses so that when someone decides to fly out the door because they’ve had enough they can throw a kit at them. When they’re leaving as overdose prevention they can give them a kit. 
AS: Because so many people are dying after they leave sober houses.
JC: Or even while they’re in sober houses. Now all the sober houses that are a member of MASH, we’ve trained all the staff.
AS: What is MASH? 
JC: MASH is the Minnesota Association of Sober Houses. If you’re a member of MASH they require that all their houses have our kit, not necessarily our kit, but have naloxone and that the house managers all know how to administer it. They’ve all moved to a second tier now which is that when a person leaves their sober living, whether they leave because they’ve progressed far enough to where they’re ready to be on their own or they just leave, that they give them a kit when they leave. That’s because we’ve been able to supply that. We’re getting it to the people on the street but the Harm Reduction Coalition thinks because we’re not a needle exchange that we’re not getting it to the people who need it. We’ve got that perception to change. So right now we have like a hundred…
AS: Which is again a stigma that comes from the Harm Reduction people about who the users are. About who the addicts are. Even when all the evidence shows us a whole new group of users.
JC: Yes, yes. Very true. We have about a hundred vials left right now. We’ve got so many requests for training.
AS: That’s so upsetting.
JC: It’s crazy and we have no money because we’re such a small organization. We don’t have any expertise in fundraising. We’ve got some hurdles that we’re trying to…
AS: The kind of sick thing, in my opinion, is your having to fundraise to pay this huge markup on a product that actually saves a life immediately.
JC: I’ll tell you what. Even if we had enough money to buy this now I wouldn’t because why the heck would they charge $3,500.
AS: Right. That’s just obscene.
JC: The needle and the vial is just fine. Their markup was not anywhere near.
AS: Right and most heroin users are not going to be afraid of a needle and a vial to save a friend. 
JC: And a parent that finds their kid, they’re not going to hesitate either. I get why law enforcement wants to have the nasal. Those are like $75 through the charitable program. You can get the nasal.
AS: This is just on the arm.
JC: Or the thigh. This is the auto. Like an epi pen kind of application thing. That’s just my bias. That’s what I do for the foundation. Right now we’re trying to figure out how to get naloxone, what source we have. We’ve tapped into a few resources but aren’t having any luck. Now we’ve got to focus on how to get more money. Even the $18 a vial is out of reach. We ask for a $25 donation for our kits. If we had to put two doses, which is what we put in a kit, that’s $36 right there. If someone doesn’t have the $25 to donate we give them a kit anyway. I’ve given a ton away. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. 
AS: What would you say, just changing the topic a little bit, did you have a two thirty?
JC: I thought my daughter’s friend was coming around that time but I guess she’s not here.
AS: Are you okay to keep going for a minute then? I’m wondering what the most shocking or alarming thing, or out of character thing you’ve done as the mother of an addict? That you would have never, ever done in another circumstance.
JC: Giving my son money knowing full well he was going to buy heroin because he was in such pain that I couldn’t watch him.
AS: Because he was in withdrawal?
JC: Yes, basically buying heroin for him. And not being truthful with my spouse just because I didn’t want to deal with that right then. It was more important for me to focus on getting Chance stable. And worry about this other stuff later. I never thought I would be as deceitful as I have been. 
AS: In what way? Just with your spouse?
JC: Yes, keeping secrets mostly with my spouse. Keeping secrets to protect my son, in theory, whether it really was protecting him or not. Who knows?
AS: You don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to. How has your marriage been through this? Has he been a support? Have been you been able to parent Chance together at all?
JC: Oh not much, no. Really that was never even when he wasn’t using. When he was young John would participate in things but he was never felt like it was his job to be the dad. 
AS: So most of this, would it be fair to say, most of Chance’s addiction has been yours to deal with?
JC: To some extent his dad and his stepmother have been involved but it’s always been, when it’s convenient for them or when I pull them in. It’s not generally, they don’t generally make it a point to call him and talk to him and find out how he’s doing and really listen. That always comes back on me. Why didn’t I tell them? Why didn’t you ask? When this stuff happened in November, I never give my husband enough credit because when this was happening in November.
AS: Remind me what was happening in November?
JC: That was when he relapsed in Utah. Sometimes I’m so afraid to even tell my husband because I don’t know, he might say, “Well he’s never coming back here.” I just don’t know. I told him and he’s like, “Why don’t you just go out there? Why doesn’t Chance just move back here where we can see him?” It just amazes me, sometimes, that that’s his reaction. I expect this, “I don’t really care.” I didn’t tell his dad right away. I didn’t really know exactly what was going on. I figured, “His dad can talk to him. Or Chance can talk to his dad. It’s really not my place.” Part of me thinks if it had been on the other shoe, I would want his dad to tell me. There’s this whole struggle. Part of me is trying to protect Chance. I know that if his dad knows there’s no chance of him going back to school right away, if this really is just a little slip. In my mind I try and manipulate things too. 
AS: Right, because you’re trying to affect the outcome.
JC: I am which is not healthy for anyone. 
AS: Well it makes you feel crazy.
JC: Right, it does. I’ve learned that and I keep relearning that but when in crisis.
AS: And when you’re in crisis continuously, episodically, it just keeps happening. Having a time when you can try to learn to change your behavior without a crisis happening. It’s really hard if you’re constantly in crisis.
JC: Thank you.
AS: You’re welcome. This is something I’m just learning with my daughter now coming up on two years. My old patterns they still want to be there but there’s not a crisis for them. I’m kind of having to learn what it’s like to live not in crisis with her. It’s awkward. At least in an inner way, it’s awkward kind of in my own psyche. 
JC: When this all happened, like you said, trying to affect the outcome. Trying to figure out when do I tell? What do I tell? I went out there on a Friday; I got in back here on a Sunday. Sunday, night I sent a big long email to his dad and stepmom. The next morning I got reamed by the stepmom for not having told them last Wednesday when Chance called me. I’m like, “Okay. Here’s the deal.”
AS: He’s twenty six years old first of all.
JC: Right. There’s many things but the one thing that kept popping into my mind that I just kept throwing back was one of the times when I helped get him back from another state, to get him into detox, when I called his dad to tell his dad. “I’ve got Chance on a flight this morning from California to here. He’s going right from here to detox and right from detox to treatment.” His dad response was, “Good luck with that.” I said, “If you don’t want updates from me on your son then just let me know because I won’t waste my time giving them to you.” He said, “The next update I want is when he’s sixty days sober and has a job or he’s in a box.” I said, “The next update you get on your son will be from your son not me.” 
I got over that anger and of course have given him updates since then. I said to Linda, the stepmom, I’m like, “You guys want to be involved, and you want to hear all this.” She’s like, “He’s telling me that you’re drug testing him and you’re telling me you’re not.” I said, “If he’s telling you that I’m drug testing him and he’s telling me that you’re drug testing him shame on me for not following up with you and asking you if you were and shame on you for not following up with me. If we don’t believe and the history has been that this continues to happen. It’s not just me not asking the questions. It’s you guys too.”
AS: At some point, Chance has to live with what he’s doing.
JC: Right, right. 
AS: And how he talks to his family.
JC: Right.
AS: His parents.
JC: I don’t know why I brought that up. 
AS: I think it’s related to how we try to navigate what are already complex, blended family situations with an addict child. From your ex-husband’s perspective it’s either he’s sober or he’s dead, don’t tell me about it. That’s such a common response among some parents. They get to their threshold, they get to their point where they just can’t. If you’ve always been there doing what you’re doing then you’re an easy target. 
JC: I know you had asked me also what the thing that I did that I never ever thought I would do. I’ve not just done that once. It’s that whole, when you know he’s in lots of pain and you’re not going to be able to get into detox for a couple days.
AS: That was the situation? It wasn’t just…
JC: It wasn’t just he’s out of money and I know he needs to use.
AS: It wasn’t that. It’s always your waiting for a detox.
JC: Or you’re waiting to get on Suboxone.
AS: Access to care is a huge barrier and makes you do things that you would never, ever consider doing.
JC: We’re one of the lucky ones because I hear from other parents that are on wait lists for weeks. We’ve really never had to be on a waitlist for more than a couple days for a treatment center. I don’t know if it’s because we have private insurance, I don’t know if it’s because it’s the type of insurance that we have, I don’t know if it’s because I’m so aggressive, making so many different calls. We’ve had; fortunately, the opportunity to send him out of state if that’s what’s needed. Or send him out of state if that’s the only place that’s available. 
AS: He’s really, in some ways, alive potentially because of your ability to do what you do.
JC: Probably. That and his willingness to finally say, “Yes, I’ll take help.”
AS: When he slips up.
JC: The fact that he’s not stuck with state insurance. Not that they’re bad because they work for other people, but you hear more horror stories and people that can’t get in because their on state and so there’s a big long waitlist. I think people who have private insurance get better treatment which is not fair. I’m glad he’s been in that position. Sometimes I feel guilty. 
AS: It’s the system. It’s a bigger issue.
JC: Our insurance has always been so good that…you hear those stories where they get fourteen days and their insurance stops paying, that’s never been our case. I mean even with Hazelden, they were going to approve him to stay in the long term plan there. That was probably the facility we waited the longest to get in. It was three days. That wasn’t very long but that was the longest he ever had to wait, when he was ready. 
AS: He’d be detoxing at home or?
JC: That time I think he was at Fairview. He detoxed at Fairview and then went to, no he didn’t. He didn’t detox at all. He went right there using to Hazelden. When I found out he had relapsed, I thought he was in recovery, when I found out he had relapsed I was in Hawaii. His friend, who actually has since died of an overdose in January of this year out on Park Avenue Treatment Center, he had called me and said, “Don’t tell Chance I’m telling you this but he is using with my brother.” I called Chance right after that and said, “Do you have anything you need to tell me.” He’s like, “No.” I said, “Think about that. I probably won’t be asking if I didn’t know something.” He said, “I’m using.” I said, “Here’s the deal. You need to come up with a plan. Why don’t you call me back when you have one?” About five hours later he called me and said he had talked to Hazelden and he had initiated an assessment. By the time I got back, this was towards the end of our trip there, by the time I got back here I had to do a couple things with insurance and the next day I think I took him in. He was, I’m sure, high when I got him there. 
AS: This is good.  Thank you so much.
JC: You’re welcome, a lot of stuff. 
AS: Yes, it’s a crazy road we’re on. 
JC: Yes it is. "

St. Paul, Minnesota
Emily Brunner-EB
Samantha Aamot-SA
SA: First I’ll have you state your name and say that you give us permission to use this recording. 
EB: My name is Emily Brunner and I give you permission to use this recording. 
SA: Great, thanks. Do you want to talk a little bit about your childhood and where you grew up and your family?
EB: Sure. I grew up in Ridgefield, Connecticut which is a small town in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I also briefly lived in California--Palo Alto--and  my father is a physicist and my mom is a choir teacher, but she didn’t go back to work until I was about nine, I think I was in third grade--no I was in middle school, but she was home for most of my childhood. She never drank or used anything and neither did my father, but we had a history. My grandfather on my mother’s side was an alcoholic and that was why she didn’t drink. I kind of knew that growing up. 
SA: You were in California at this point?
EM: Both California and Connecticut. I just remember that being talked about very early on. 
SA: And did you grow up having that idea for yourself?
EM: Yeah, I definitely remember at one point my grandma offered me a thousand dollars if I could get through college without drinking alcohol, but it wasn’t worth it. [laughs] She had watched how problematic that was for my grandpa. He ended up going to alcoholics anonymous and periods of sobriety, but then he would relapse. 
SA: And this was your mom’s parents?
EM: My mom’s parents. And then my dad’s family all lived in Wisconsin and a lot of them drank heavily and they were often drunk when we saw them. It looked fun, but like my parents didn’t drink and they were also kind of awkward people and that seemed connected to me, I think. They were sort of embarrassing. I don’t know. I guess every kid thinks their parents are embarrassing, but I certainly did as well. 
SA: Did you see your mom’s parents’ drinking affect your mom in any way that you remember?
EM: I think she was just very clear that we don’t drink because we have a history of alcoholism in our family. I think she probably puts a lot of characteristics of adult children of alcoholics, but I wasn’t terribly interested in much of that when I was younger. I just thought, You’re awkward and embarrassing.
SA: And it was because they didn’t drink. 
EM: And it’s because they didn’t drink. Well, I mean I think I was pretty committed to the idea of not drinking when I was younger but maybe developed that later on. I certainly had a pact to like never drink.
SA: Did you have any siblings?
EM: I do, I have three younger siblings. I was the oldest of four. Two younger brothers and a younger sister. 
SA: Do you want to talk a little about your high school years or deciding that you wanted to go into medicine?
EM: Sure. And I didn’t decide in high school. It’s actually kind of a funny story where I went to college because--so I was like an uber nerd with not a lot of friends. I had one very, very close--two very close friends who I am still very close with who were kind of like siblings because I wasn’t close with my siblings. We were one the debate team--one of them and me--and we went to a junior year debate meet and went to MIT to a frat house and I got super drunk there.
SA: And this is in high school?
EM: Yeah. It was a trip where we went to Boston [Massachusetts] for a weekend and my parents weren’t among the chaperones and we were all such good kids that they gave us the freedom to not have anyone check on us at night, and so we developed the plan to infiltrate a MIT frat party. My dad went to MIT. He was a grad student there, but I always thought MIT was a place that I could be cool basically because it was so nerdy. And so I tried to go there. 
SA: What else happened at the party?
EM: I certainly don’t remember that much of it, but I kissed a boy, which was a thing I had never done before. I loved being drunk. 
SA: Was it one of your first experiences with alcohol?
EM: It was definitely my first. Wait, no. It’s always hard for me to remember the details because it’s amazing the power of minimization. I had gotten drunk at a family Thanksgiving sort of sneaking sips of wine when I was thirteen. I remember dancing on a table. Then I actually took everyone else’s wine after they left the room. I also blacked out that night. I always loved to drink. When I would drink I would drink to blackout basically from the beginning. 
SA: So beginning junior year did it start escalating or were these just a few instances?
EM: Just a few, discrete like--because I got in lots trouble after all of those things happened. In fact after the debate team thing happened I got kicked off the National Honor’s Society and had to do Saturday suspensions. I think it was only three or four instances. I also didn’t have access to it. I wasn’t really hanging out with the cool kids. That experience at MIT by the way I liked so much that I went there for college and drank many times. 
SA: So you went to MIT knowing you wanted to go to medical school?
EM: I didn’t actually. I was interested in being an engineer.
SA: What changed?
EB: I hated engineering. [laughs] I sort of theoretically wanted to do it because not many women go into engineering, but I didn’t like it at all. I switched to environmental engineering as a major, I thought that was neat, a lot of it, but finding out that the practical job applications were sewage treatment plants was interesting to me. I think it was late junior year that I loved science and I loved talking to people and I wish there was something that combined those things and someone was like, “Idiot. That’s what being a doctor is.” So I decided to be pre-med at that point. So it was pretty late, but at MIT you were required to do an amount of sciences that fulfilled a lot of the prerequisites, so I had already done all that. I just added on some biology and then I took the MCAT and took organic chemistry my senior year, and actually I loved that. 
I drank heavily during college, but when I decided to apply to med school I was able to sort of pull it together and stop for a while in that period. 
SA: What year was that?
EB: Junior year of college. 2000. I graduated high school in ‘98. 
SA: Do you remember every thinking you were drinking too much or wished you drank less in your college years, or was that just kind of normal for you?
EB: Yeah I certainly had a lot of negative experiences related to it and I stopped drinking for thirty days once just to prove that I didn’t have a problem. The thing that sort of perpetuated me thinking it was okay was that I continued to be able to pull it out for tests, and so I had a pretty high GPA and it wasn’t interfering with that aspect of things and that made it feel okay. However, I isolated a lot of people who I had been friends with. I definitely gravitated towards people who drank heavily and I blacked out a lot, but I liked it. I really liked it. There was a period of time where [unclear]. It’s amazing how potently biological that part was. 
So, I eventually sort of got things together. I worked at an environmental engineering mechanical device company that was in the Boston area after graduating while I worked on getting into med school. I had a year between college and med school. During that period I did not drink or use very much. I should mention in college there was an experience I had where I took ecstasy a few times and I really loved that to the point where I remember thinking I’m going to use this until someone stops me. And that scared me so I stopped. I never used it after that again. After all of that stuff it wasn’t actually alcohol that got me into rehab, personally, it was opiates and benzos and those came a lot later. 
I had a period where I had it fairly together. I would drink every one or two months always to excess. I had met my husband at this company I worked at. We were fairly serious fairly quickly and he would sort of drive me on those times. He drank heavily when we met, but actually just sort of stopped as he grew up in a normal way, but I continued to escalate. During med school it was always in a very, I don’t have class tomorrow so I can get drunk tonight. There was an element of responsibility, but it was always to the point of blacking out. 
When I went to med school I was most interested in cardiology or something like that, but after rotating--
[pause in conversation]
I also like egotistically wanted to be a kind of doctor that was hard, but in rotating around I really, really liked family medicine. I felt it was a field where I could actually do the kind of medicine I pictured doctors doing when I was little and could answer questions for my family members. I really liked the variety of it. I have always really liked people’s interesting stories and family medicine has a lot of that.
While I was in med school I got a tumor and my experience of being diagnosed was I was on rotation and I was sleeping in the hospital two or three nights a week. Not really sleeping--not sleeping in the hospital two or three nights a week. [laughs] I found a stomach swelling and went to the doctor who said I needed to get an ultrasound and the ultrasound lady knew I was in med school and tipped it around so I could see and there was clearly a giant abnormality and I asked her what is was and she said, “You know, I don’t know. I need to get the radiologist right away.” And it scared the crap out of me even though it turned out to be--anyway so at that period of time I had to take a medical leave from medical school. I had to get a surgery and when I was getting the surgery I was consented to have all my ovaries and uterus taken out. At that time I had not really thought much about having a family or the future, but I really started to want one. I had also had sort of strong feelings that strong women don’t get married and at that point sort of changed my tune. I had been living with my now husband for a couple years. I don’t know, I hadn’t thought much about making a family. So that was really frightening. Then first doctor I talked to said, “I am going to give you this ativan. Take it as much as you want,” and I took a lot. I loved it. It was sort of pill alcohol. 
SA: What year was that? 
EB: 2006. I stayed on the ativan intermittently since that time until I went to rehab in 2009. So after that I got pregnant my first week of intern year at St. Louis. So sort of fastforward: decided to get married and have a family. We started trying--the plan was to have a baby during residency and it would probably take us a while to get pregnant because I only had one ovary and one fallopian tube; the others got taken out. It turned out that the tumor was benign, I forgot to mention that. I got PTSD around that time. It was frightening. I ended up getting pregnant in 2007--right at the same time as I started residency at the University of Michigan. It was really challenging to be pregnant and an intern. I really tried to not do anything differently than the other residents because they were sort of irritated with me because if I was out they would have to do more work. In fact one of them the first day of our residency tried to have us make a pact that none of us would get pregnant during intern year and I said, “I’m not making that pact.” It was uncomfortable. 
I was really sad during that period of time. I had close friends in medical school and then I moved away. At that point I got married. I didn’t really bring up that my husband was Lebanese, but there were all kinds of sort of complications with his family because of that, but really they were wonderful people. But it was like sort of one more thing that was unknowable, and my response to things like that was always to use. I loved family medicine; it’s really hard and it’s hard to juggle everything and the training where I went. It was really physically and mentally challenging at that time to go through residency. I ended up on bedrest because I was trying to work too hard. I went twenty-one days without having a day off when I was about twenty weeks pregnant. I started having contractions. I ended up having a short cervix. I went on bedrest, and during that period of time I wasn’t drinking or using while I was pregnant, but I had this bottle of ativan that I would just count sometimes. That was a little weird. It was awful being on bedrest, and I sort of sunk into isolated depression because it wasn’t like the people at residency had time to visit me or anything, you know, so I was just kind of alone. I was at Michigan at this point and all of my family was in Connecticut. 
I delivered then. It was a little bit of a scary delivery. That was in October--sorry, that was in March of 2008. I got a huge supply of oxycodone after delivering, which was kind of my first exposure to opioids, and I absolutely loved it. I was given like one hundred pills with a refill and then I called to get more refills. There was a comfort that the doctors were prescribing to me because I was a resident. At that point I had never heard anyone say addiction was an illness. I thought the way I drank was probably not right, but I really didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was trying all kinds of anti depressants, I had postpartum depression, and it was really just an awful period of time. I loved my daughter so much, I had never experienced anything like that, loving someone so much, and when I had to go back to work it really broke my heart and I didn’t want to, but I felt trapped. I talked to the residency director who was a douchebag and he basically said, “Well either come back or don’t come back, but there’s no way we can work out any kind of schedule,” which actually isn’t true, but they weren’t really willing to work with me. 
Around that time I started drinking more and more. Well, so I sort of held it together because I ran out of--when I went back to work I didn’t have anymore oxycodone, I wasn’t using it, and I started going to this like secret residency doctor to help with mental health of residents, which is a nice resource to have but she was giving me a lot of ativan as was my primary doctor and they weren’t really cross-checking and I started using a lot of that and combining it with alcohol. I had some back pain which I think was pretty legitimate, and I also remember thinking, I know medicine and no one can tell me I don’t have back pain, and so I was doing physical therapy but also using oxycodone. At first it was prescribed and then I was just picking it up and taking it and just crossing all kinds of--I mean I descended into a person I didn’t recognize quite quickly. Got in trouble in October of 2009 in terms of--that’s when I went to rehab. That was a terrible period of time and I don’t want to go into too many details except that I became a person I didn’t recognize rapidly and ended up going to Talbot in Atlanta. For me I got sober largely through a twelve-step, AA based program in a place--Talbot treats doctors and pilots and is very expensive, so my parents had to get like an RV in order to send me to rehab. I will be forever grateful for them. So that was seven and a half years ago. I actually have not drank or used an illicit drug since that point. I was put on opiates once when I had a nose surgery, but I was under the care of an addiction medicine doctor who like--I went into a monitoring program, I still go to AA now, my recovery has been a really important part of my life. Actually, I am very grateful for the experience. 
I will transition into talking more about the addiction medicine because that is how I became interested in it. I was like, What the hell this is a disease? No one--why didn’t someone tell me? 
SA: Why didn’t I learn this in medical school?
EB: Yeah. I really had not--I had learned the side effects of liver disease from alcohol, but not that there was any hope for people stopping or that there are medications to treat alcohol.
SA: Or about prescription opioids.
EB: Right, well we were taught that they were safe. I went to med school during the period where it was like if you have pain we have to treat it. Pain is a vital sign. You can’t get addicted to opiates if you have real pain, which is wrong. I had always done well on tests and stuff, and had the ambition to be able to make some sort of impact in the field of medicine and became by far most interested in--also, I got really lucky because the doctor who sent me to treatment and evaluated me was probably the best addiction medicine doctor I’ve ever seen practice. His name is Pat Gibbons. He has passed away since, and I’m pretty sure he’s available regarding historic--he was like an amazing, wonderful mentor and doctor and I hated him at first because he held really high standards for how he would treat you. There were also a number of doctors in my area that were in recovery, had been sober a long time, and took me under their wing. I had an amazing sponsor who was a cardiothoracic surgeon who has been sober for twenty-three years, so she was like invaluable. Early sobriety--I was out of work for eight months, and when I went back it was with restrictions and I was on a monitoring program and had drug testing every one to two weeks and calling every day for three years. That structure--I wouldn’t have stayed sober without that. I wasn’t really interested in [unclear] and I wanted to keep my license. And I loved my daughter. 
At first I was still mad at my husband for making me go to treatment. I was like obsessed with the idea that we needed to get divorced. He was like the most wonderful, amazing guy and kept our family together. I got to fall in love with him all over again in sobriety, as well as sort of expand the interest in addiction medicine. I did family medicine as a second year resident they made me repeat my second year, which was, you know, they should have, so I got to really thoroughly learn that, and then after that I started working at a clinic in Michigan as well at a place called Pain Recovery Solutions in Ibsoleny with two doctors, three doctors who were really excellent at doing addiction medicine and I was there one day a week. You could do an addiction medicine study specialty without doing a fellowship, and you still can, but that’s going to close now. I decided that that was going to be my goal and started doing that in 2012. I got boarded in 2014. That was around the time I wanted to have one addiction medicine job and moved to Minnesota to work at Hazelden. Also, I had met Bob Levy at conferences and we were friends and he worked there at that point too. 
SA: So you got to Hazelden in…
EB: December of 2014. This whole period of time in 2012 to 2014 there was this escalating opioid use epidemic and a lot of talk about whether suboxone was just another drug replacing a drug and that was very controversial in doctors who were also in recovery. The CMO of Hazelden had decided that they were going to be both abstinence based twelve-step as well as using medication so it was kind of a big deal. I was excited to be able to come be a part of that and I wanted to be able to do studies on it and stuff. I was primarily at Hazelden treating opiate use disorder. Most of my patients were eighteen to twenty-six, and severe opiate use does have a huge amount of comorbidity, mental health issues, profoundly ill. I became struck by how much more effective suboxone was than vivitrol as well as than nothing. Suboxone is so much more effective than nothing. Than treatment alone. I developed a belief that treatment alone for opiate use addicts who are younger than twenty-six is inadequate. That’s my personal opinion. But it was hard to watch that happen. It’s hard to watch all the misinformation about suboxone go through the world. It is a medication that reduces the risk of relapse and death by fifty to seventy-five percent and is hugely effective and we do not employ it with the vast majority of patients. They’re dying. I’m tired of watching; it breaks my heart.
SA: What sorts of things struck you about how Dr. Levy and other doctors that talked about addiction when you were learning about them or went and saw them?
EB: It just was inspiring to me. I knew so many people from recovery who had been sort of shamed by their doctor. I think addicts have the world’s most fascinating stories. That was always something I liked about addiction medicine. It was probably Herb Malinoff and Pat Gibbons, these doctors in Michigan, who got me the most interested. I mean if you interviewed Herb Malinoff on the phone and he was okay with it, he’s like an amazing practitioner in Michigan. I just wanted to learn to do what they did. I would see it being handled in my primary care clinic in a horrible way. 
SA: Do you have any examples that come to mind?
EB: I just remember in residency my last year spending an hour and a half with a patient who wanted oxycodone for back pain and ativan for anxiety, which weirdly were my two drugs of choice, and just recognizing that they were having a problem with it and trying to give them these tools of other ways to help with back pain like acupuncture and they were just so angry and like immediately went from complaining to about what a bad doctor I was. Luckily at that clinic they were like, “That’s exactly what you should do.” Around that time there was a doctor from Chelsea who had really high doctor Yelp scores who was selling--was cracked down on by the federal government for selling oxycodone. Anyway, it really struck me that the doctors I looked up who were getting one to two star reviews because they pissed people off because you really shouldn’t be doing what your patients want you to do, you should be doing what is in their best interest. Even though you should do it in a kind, loving way. That was what I really admired about those doctors was they were not mean or shaming or unkind or judgemental, just like, “Here’s what I can safely offer you,” and that’s what I wanted to learn how to do. Because you don’t really learn those skills about how to have difficult conversations with patients. But in a deliberate way you sort of end up learning as you go. 
SA: When did you leave Hazelden?
EB: I left in 2016. It was not out of any kind of bad feelings in anyway. It was a wonderful place, but I missed the medical system and being able to get labs rapidly, see patients efficiently, see patients on Medicaid because they didn’t take Medicare or Medicaid, so it was a really different patient population. So I had met this doctor from Health East at the Minnesota Society of Addiction Medicine conference who said they needed new doctors and like a year later I contacted her and said, “Do you still need new doctors?” [laughter] “I kind of miss medicine.” Not that it wasn’t medical there, but it was like [unclear] a new clinic and it was primarily for seeing counselors. And I had three kids. 
I really love what I do. I feel really blessed and proud and happy and it’s kind of not where I ever thought I would be. I had no plans to move to Minnesota, be an addiction medicine doctor, and have a lovely family, like objectively that was not the plan. It’s so much better than I would have guessed. 
SA: That’s amazing. Do you still do family medicine with addiction medicine?
EB: I mostly do addiction medicine. I would like to do some family medicine again someday, but right now there’s such a vast, gaping need for addiction medicine doctors. 
SA: Have you seen the field growing?
EB: I think more people have talked about it in a way that has minimized stigma, and it is certainly a great thing that there’s a formal, medical subspecialty board, but I think it’s a field that if the Medicaid expansion is taken away it will be decimated. So, I’m very worried about the safety of my patients. 
SA: Do you want to talk a little bit more about what has been going on or what you see for the future or what your worries are?
EB: Sure. I think that it’s pretty scientifically established how you treat opiate use disorder. I don’t see that being implemented the way that it needs to be. I’ll just say I think making an opiate commission headed by Chris Christie is asinine. I think that we should just be expanding funding for treatment right now and finding in-house places for people to recover. One population that is very dear to my heart is mothers with addiction issues, and there’s no social supports for them, we’re not well networked between medical field, the healthcare field, even the research field, and the CD world, and the legal world. It’s all split up, and that kills people, and I hate that because it’s actually not that complicated to treat. We just have not had the resources to do it. 
SA: You mentioned more focus on treatment. In your day to day is that what you wish there were more avenues to?
EB: Yeah, and to find an addiction medicine doctor in the Twin Cities is tough. We don’t take new ones at the clinic I’m at unless they go through the residential, so there’s really limited options to step in with an allocation [unclear]. A lot of them are cash only. There are some great doctors that are cash only because it is really hard to deal with the insurance companies. But it sucks. It puts up a huge barrier. Often the mental health comorbidities aren’t well managed. There’s still certainly a lot of pejorative stigma surrounding suboxone, language around not being clean if you’re on it, which I think kills people. If I’m prescribing someone a medication they are taking as prescribed then they are abstinent. I hate when people tell them that they’re not. 
SA: That goes along with AA’s--
EB: Well, AA has a pretty clear--it’s really different now how they implement it. It’s pretty clearly delineated in there that, “We’re not doctors, we do not mean to interfere with physician treatment,” but there is sort of a historical stigma that has preceded--and actually when I was in residency I had to do a research project and I did mine on stigma across different levels of the healthcare field, and the trend was that you got more of it in med school and residency and people had less preconceived notions about addicts and we intensified those with exposure to people. You don’t really see--when I go to the doctor sometimes I say, “I’ve been sober for seven and a half years,” I tell it to them the first time I go, but there are a lot of people in sobriety who don’t. Doctors can be real idiots about treating it. I went to the ER six months ago for an ear infection and they offered me morphine. They didn’t ask me. 
SA: And then it’s up to you to say no. 
EB: And I was able to but, you know, there are probably days where that could have ruined my life. 
SA: Or killed you. 
EB: I think just because I got sober without suboxone doesn’t mean that’s the right thing for everybody. That was--first of all there was a period of time where lots of other people I went to treatment with are no longer sober or alive.
SA: We can go through a typical day you have in the clinic. 
EB: I primarily now see outpatients with opioid use disorder. I would say one to two of them are in active relapse everyday, and so a lot of what I do is try to check for mental health, talk to them in a way that’s non judgemental and exhibits caring and--you know I get urine drug screens from everyone I see regardless of how long they’ve been sober because you just never know. I try to be a sort of safe point that they can access, but you know, one or two no shows, one or two people that are high on a day to day basis, and some of them are doing really well. It’s really rewarding. Again, I just really love what I do. It’s pretty cool. I use suboxone a fair amount. The majority of my patients are on it.
SA: Do you prescribe methadone at all?
EB: That’s only in specific clinics. 
SA: Are you limited in prescribing suboxone?
EB: I have a limit of 275 patients and I don’t really see myself ever hitting 275 because it’s pretty unusual to see them any less than monthly. I think it is really stupid that there is a limit because fentanyl is so much more dangerous and has no limit and any doctor can prescribe it. If there’s one thing I could change and promote about addiction medicine changing it is getting more doctors to get a suboxone waiver and treat with it in primary care. I think if you’re going to limit something it should be [unclear] not suboxone because it is very safe if you use it as prescribed. 
I think there is going to be a trend of a benzo epidemic and I see more and more people using meth and benzos. Meth is pretty frustrating to treat because there’s not a lot we can offer to help. 
SA: Why do you say that?
EB: I have been seeing more and more patients using those things. For benzodiazepines there are pretty good New York Times articles showing that fourteen percent of people over the age of sixty-five use them on a daily basis. That’s not good. They aren’t really recommended for any long-term purpose, but they are used that way often by people who don’t understand the risks of doing that. It’s basically pill alcohol. 
SA: Do you think a change in educating young doctors is what it is going to take to--
EB: I think that would be helpful. I don’t think that that’s going to happen. I think Bob Levy may be the sole zion of that. That was part of why I came to St. Joe’s to be able to-- and I still am connected to Hazelden in the sense that I work with them doing consulting to go do training to other health systems for how to treat opioid use disorder and implement the COR-12 program [Comprehensive Opioid Response with the Twelve Steps]. I am able to do some slight advocacy stuff. 
SA: One last question and we can wrap up. Can you talk a little bit about being a woman in your field, and anything that goes along with that?
EB: Yeah, so addiction medicine has this definite old boy club with like long term AA men flavor. I started going in my first year of sobriety to this international doctors in AA conference that has addiction medicine as part of it. I go every year and actually bring my family. Whenever I go, even now, when I have been going for six years, everyone thinks my husband is the addict and approaches him. It’s just really--in all of medicine there is that feel of there is still a difference of a gender bias that occurs, but I think there have always been pretty amazing and now like Nora Volkow, who’s the coolest. She’s awesome. 
So, I think there is a different experience of interacting with patients that can feel more physically frightening I think because a lot of them have also had violence towards women in the past and stuff. It’s certainly very possible to sort of move through that stuff. I had a lot of advice on that from my sponsor, so I saw it role modeled really well just sort of how to integrate. She was awesome. 
Now I’m part of the executive council for the Minnesota Society of Addiction Medicine; Bob Levy does that, too. We’re trying to build more of a place for that to be a kernel of learning, but there’s not a lot of funding unfortunately. 
SA: Thank you so much. 
EB: Sure. It’s great you guys are focusing on this topic. "

Interviewer
April 2, 2017
At the Home of Amy Sullivan
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Bill Cole          -BC
Amy Sullivan   -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I’m at my home in Minneapolis with William Cole. Bill Cole. It is April 2, 2017. Bill do you give me permission to record this interview?
BC: I do. 
AS: Thank you. Let’s go back to what you were going to say about birds and childhood.
BC: We were just talking about; Amy has a stack of bird books here. I like birds, nature. We were talking about pets. Growing up I had all kinds of pets but never had a single dog which is kind of funny. I grew up in East Africa where my parents were missionaries. The mission forbade missionaries to have dogs because they were afraid of rabies. We had everything else under the sun. Different kinds of monkeys and baboons and antelopes and wild pigs and birds. 
AS: Where in East Africa did you grow up?
BC: I was born in Ethiopia. I live there until I was fourteen. Then I moved to Southern Sudan. I was going to a boarding school in Kenya when my parents worked in Sudan. Different way of growing up. 
AS: Do you want to talk about that a little more? When were you born? How old are you?
BC: I was born in 1962. That makes me fifty five. I was born in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. My parents worked in many cases in very remote areas. We never owned a vehicle in Ethiopia. There weren’t roads; the only way in and out was by airplane or by foot or mule. No electricity, no running water. A very full life. A lot of adventure. I went to boarding school in the capital. 
AS: At what age?
BC: I started when I was seven. My brothers started when they were six or maybe even five. We would spend four or five years in Africa and then come back to the states for a year or to Ireland. My dad is from Ireland. Then we’d come back and be on furlough. We’d go back and forth. Boarding school was an interesting experience. Not all bad, not all good. 
AS: You were in boarding school in Kenya or in Ethiopia?
BC: When we lived in Ethiopia I went to boarding school in Ethiopia in the capital. We would travel back and forth on vacations to see my folks.
AS: But your parents would be kind of out in the bush?
BC: Yes.
AS: Did you have a home?
BC: In the bush, yes. My dad was a builder. He would go into a place and he’d build a clinic. My mom was a nurse and she ran the clinic. My dad would build school buildings and houses. He would hire Ethiopian teachers to teach and he’d administer the school and they’d move on to another place.
AS: What was the church affiliation?
BC: It’s an interdenominational Protestant organization. We had all denominations.
AS: What was it called?
BC: It was called Sudan Interior Mission. At the time now it’s called Serving in Mission. 
AS: So it’s still going?
BC: It’s a pretty large organization, well known. They do a lot of development work as well as evangelical work. 
AS: Where are your parents now?
BC: They’ve both passed.
AS: Did they continue to do this even into your adulthood?
BC: Oh yes. I lost my mom when I was sixteen. Then my dad remarried another missionary out there. The only reason why they came back was because of his health issues. He loved being there. That was his life. He loved wild places and wild people that lived in them. 
AS: People kind of untouched by…
BC: He never really felt that comfortable. I don’t know how to put it. In formal urban settings. He’d freak out if he got into an elevator. He just didn’t like it. 
AS: He was from Ireland? Tell me about him a little bit and your mom?
BC: He grew up in Northern Ireland. Went to school until about eighth grade equivalent. He did an apprenticeship under my grandfather. Then had a conversion experience and decided that he wanted to be a missionary in Africa. His father, my grandfather, said, “You’re out of here. I don’t want to see you again.” That stayed. My grandfather died a very bitter man unfortunately.
AS: Was it because of the religion that your dad professed? Was it all Protestant?
BC: It was Protestant. But my dad’s taking it seriously. I think my grandfather was upset that my dad wasn’t carrying on the family business. He was a joiner or carpenter. That was upsetting to him. My mom came from New England, from Boston. Her family was really from Nova Scotia. They moved down and she went out unmarried. 
AS: She went into missionary work unmarried?
BC: Yes. 
AS: They met later?
BC: Yes. So for my dad he was very adventurous and I could see him doing that. For a single young woman from a proper Boston upbringing to go and do this thing was just amazing to me. They met and married out there and had four kids. I’m the youngest of four boys. The things that my mom put up with. Before they were married my dad would take off. The mission would want to learn about places in Ethiopia, remote places. They said, his name was also Bill, “We’ll send Bill out and find out what’s going on out there.” My dad, he’d have a schedule. He’d say, “I’ll be back in January.” March would come around and he still wouldn’t be back. There’s no contact at all. You’re out there. Crazy, crazy experiences. Once they got married that settled down. 
AS: She went with him?
BC: Yes and they were established in one place. She would run a clinic. I have a lot of admiration for my mom. She was an amazing person. Some of the things that she would do is just crazy. Sometimes there’d be tribal warfare going on. She would have to take care of people sometimes with no anesthetics. 
AS: She’d basically be the only medical person.
BC: Right. My dad would help out where he could. The level of commitment that they had was amazing. Just incredible. The love they had for each other and this common purpose is just astounding. There’s one time where there was a tribal skirmish going on. Our station was neutral. No fighting at the station because all the wounded would be coming in. The fighting would flare up and the women and children would all come to our station. They would stay there and then the wounded would start coming in. And the tension.
AS: Because it would be women from both sides?
BC: Both sides, right. The wounded from both sides. Anytime that my dad wanted to leave the station, the home tribe, they were one of the warring tribes. They really respected and appreciated my parents being there but if we wanted to leave the station the chief said, “You can’t leave unless you have seven or eight young men around you, armed men, to make sure that you’re protected.” It was really touch and go sometimes.
AS: You said you moved to Sudan?
BC: We went from the kettle to the frying pan or something. That was a dangerous place too. It’s an interesting upbringing. In a lot ways I sensed a lot of freedom, being able to move around. But there’s also a lot of danger too. There’s a certain element of danger. I kind of like that. Everything’s an adventure there. 
AS: You don’t have to go find out. 
BC: Exactly.
AS: They exist simultaneously. What about high school? Your brothers, did you all go? How long were you educated in Africa?
BC: Almost all of us through high school. Then we all came back to the states for college.
AS: Is there a big range in your ages?
BC: Ten years. I came back when I was eighteen. I took a year off in high school and spent part of the time in Sudan with my dad. Then I came back and spent the rest of the time working to get enough money for college. When I was in eighth grade I was in the states and I had a paper route. I saved up five hundred dollars in eighth grade. That was a lot of money. I put it in a bank account in New York because I knew that I would need it someday. I came back to New York and picked up my five hundred bucks and I was on my way. I grabbed my Greyhound ticket and I was going.
AS: Back up and tell me how did your mom pass?
BC: It was a car accident in Sudan. We were both in the same car accident. It was a pretty rough experience but a pretty amazing experience too. We were in the back of a heavy pickup and it flipped over. My mom and I were in the back. She got thrown out. We both got thrown up. It landed on top of me.
AS: The truck?
BC: Yes. They tried to lift it off of me and they couldn’t. I was conscious the whole time which was even worse. I was in shock. There happened to be a bulldozer down the way. This was in a part of Sudan where there are no paved roads within hundreds of miles and maybe ten working bulldozers. It was just amazing this thing was there. It was able to lift it off of me. This is kind of an awful story. They pulled me out and they took me to this nearest village where there was a medical, what they called a dresser, a paraprofessional who happened to be drunk at the time. I didn’t know. My mom seemed to be doing okay at the time. She’s hurting and her side was injured. From my waist down I had been crushed. He had grabbed my legs and was moving my legs around. Just then these two Europeans came into this hut. Big, kind of balding but young European guy grabbed the dresser and just decked him. Just knocked him on his butt. He saw what he was doing. This guy was a doctor. He was working on a startup sugar cane plantation down there. He grabbed us and hauled us out to his facility. I had injured my hands and he was stitching it up and stitching up my head and stuff. Then the next day we flew up to Khartoum. 
AS: Were your legs broken?
BC: My pelvis was crushed in four places. That’s what we knew at the time. We were in this place in Khartoum that wasn’t very good. That’s where my mom, I think she had a blood clot or something. It really was kind of awful. We’re both in the same room. I can’t move. I’m paralyzed essentially from the waist down. She expired right there. It was kind of brutal. It was tough. They flew me back to the states after that. My mom was buried in Khartoum. They flew me back to the states and they found out one of my vertebrae was cracked too. At that point I was able to start moving my legs around a little more. I didn’t have very much feeling in my left leg. The doctor was saying, “You’ll be very fortunate to walk unaided again. You’ll be here for at least a year.” 
AS: That was in the US?
BC: I was able to leave in a couple of months. I was fortunate. I had a killer physical therapist, Patty. She was great. Then we moved back. 
AS: I was just interested. Thanks for sharing that. That must have been hard though on everybody.
BC: It was hard. It was really hard for my dad. 
AS: They were a team.
BC: It was hard on his and my relationship. I was coming home from school, from boarding school, and it would just be he and I. Maybe sometimes some other people. You’re dealing with those teenager years to begin with and there is all this tension. It was hard. 
AS: Where did you go to college?
BC: I went to a small Christian school in Arkansas called the John Brown University. Have you heard of John Brown?
AS: I grew up in Tulsa. 
BC: Did you? We’re close to Tulsa.
AS: John Brown University is in what town?
BC: Siloam Springs.
AS: I was going to guess somewhere around there.
BC: I chose that school because I knew people that I grew up with there. I had one cousin in the U.S. and all the rest of them were in Ireland. I had no connections here. It was a great experience. That’s where I met Laurie, my wife. 
AS: Where is she from?
BC: She’s from Minnesota.
AS: Wow, and she ended up down in Arkansas.
BC: She wanted to head south and get warm.
AS: You guys met and then tell me about that and how you ended up here.
BC: I was smitten I guess. We met; we were friends for a long time. We did a lot of fun stuff together. We used to run together a lot. We’d go out and just have fun. Then we started dating. That was a great way to go about doing things. We got married on graduation day.
AS: You’re like twenty two, twenty three?
BC: Yes. Twenty three. All of our friends were there. Why go someplace else? We knew we wanted to get married. Why get married and have everybody come to us? We planned everything and it was so low-key. It was so fun. It was a really simple thing. Our families were all coming anyways. It was such a small school too. At graduation they call your name and you walk across the aisle. “Bill Cole is getting married this afternoon.” It was a great school experience.
AS: What did you major in?
BC: Biology. I love nature. 
AS: When did you guys get married?
BC: We got married in ‘86. From there we went to Florida, Fort Meyers, and lived there for a year. I did an internship for a non-profit called the Educational Concerns for Hunger organization. They provide technical assistance to agriculture workers overseas. They have a seed bank. They redistribute seeds and collect information. We lived in a small trailer in Fort Meyers, it was great. From there we moved to the Bahamas and lived in the Bahamas for a year, a small island. There were like twelve people on the entire island, it was a research facility. From there we moved back up to Minnesota for the summer and then down to Alabama for graduate school. I did my graduate work in fisheries and aquaculture. Laurie did hers in library and information sciences. I went to school at Auburn. She did her coursework at the University of Alabama. If you know anything about those two schools people could not believe that we were married because there’s such a focus on football. 
AS: As if that dictates all relationships.
BC: It does down there. It’s crazy. We finished up graduate school. We got to California for a year. I worked on a commercial fish farm out there, a tilapia farm. Then from there we moved to the Virgin Islands for seven years. Will, our son, our one and only son was born down there. He’s actually born here but then we moved. Then we left there when he was one and a half maybe. At that point we totally enjoyed living down there. It was a great place to be at that time. We wanted Will to have some roots someplace. We thought that was important. We moved back to the States, back to Alabama for a year. I was working for Auburn in the fisheries program. We moved up to Minnesota when Will was like two and a half. Then we’ve been here for nineteen years. Hopefully the math adds up.
AS: How does that feel after moving around? You moved a lot as a kid too.
BC: I have a hard time being in one place for too long. I’ve gotten more used to it. That said, we’ve always told Will that once he’s out of college that all bets are off. Once he’s out of high school all bets are off. We’ll go wherever we want to go. I’ve no qualms about picking up and moving at all. I love experiencing other places and other cultures and other people. Everything around it. That’s the spice of life for me. 
AS: Talk about Will. Was his childhood pretty steady, pretty stable?
BC: Yes, I would think it pretty typical. 
AS: I’m just guessing, I don’t mean to put words in your mouth.
BC: I think you’re right. A pretty typical suburban, middle class upbringing. Both parents working. He went to a daycare fairly early on. Developed friends from that daycare at an early school experience that he still has today. Really good friends. It’s really good that he still stays in touch with them. They really have a very close bond. That’s a really fun thing. That’s good. He went through the Minnetonka school system? He was very social, very active, and athletic. He loved sports; he loved running around and games. He was an avid reader. I remember him reading the Harry Potter books, he was really young. I remember reading to him when he was at a certain age. I remember him reading to me and me falling asleep. It was great. It was a lot of fun.
AS: When he was like ten or something?
BC: Yes. We did a lot of stuff together. We did martial arts together which was fun. It was a great father-son activity. We’d both get into it. We got our black belts. He continued on and I ended up teaching for quite awhile. He dropped out after his black belt. I don’t blame him. He achieved something that was really good. He said, “I just want to try other things.” “Fine, that’s great.” It was a great experience. He played football, basketball. He got into lacrosse. He was a very good lacrosse player up into high school. When he started using then he totally dropped out. It was sad. One of those things you give up.
AS: Do you want to talk about that? When you first started noticing stuff?
BC: I think Will being as social as he was and always wanting to be around people and be doing the “in” kind of thing. I think he started smoking weed when he was around fourteen. I think it started out occasional. It just fully progressed. It got to the point where in high school I think he was smoking almost daily, at least numerous times a week. He started using other drugs, opioids at around seventeen. From what he tells me the first time he ever tried them was one of his friends gave him some pills. His friends had this sports injury and had some extra pills that he gave to Will. Will took some and Will knew right then that was his drug of choice. That was what he was looking for. That was it. Other drugs, primarily benzos and Xanax. Those kinds of things. He started out with Vicodin and oxycodone and then I learned this a little bit later but he got into fentanyl. He was doing IV fentanyl a couple times in high school and then much more later on. It was kind of a downhill slide through high school. We tried to get him into outpatient up at Hazelden. I think at the time we just thought it was pot but it was heavy use.
AS: This was? How old was he?
BC: He was a junior. He continued to use and he got kicked out of the program. He tried some other counseling. He does have a history of anxiety issues. I will back up a little bit. When he was fourteen he was inpatient for anxiety at Riverview. 
AS: Fairview?
BC: Fairview Riverside for a week. I don’t know if that was the best experience for him. I think he was introduced to the drug culture there. I think it was kind of traumatic on him too. I don’t know. 
AS: The institutional part?
BC: Yes, the institutional part and being away from home and being stuck in this place where he couldn’t leave. I think that’s definitely influenced his story. Fast forwarding into high school, he entered his senior year using pot. I think that’s what we knew what he was doing at that time. His grades were always pretty good. He was always a good student. Then his behavior was starting to change more and more. I didn’t know I really didn’t know what was going on. The signs of opioid use, the nodding, the pinpoint pupils. I didn’t know at first. I knew he was doing something, some kind of drug. It was so insane to me. I remember telling him this, “Will, if I knew that you weren’t doing drugs I would take you to the hospital right now because of the way you’re acting. I know you’re doing drugs, I know the reason.” It’s so irrational, why don’t I take him to the hospital right now? It’s insane. It doesn’t make any sense. Somehow I justified it in my mind. We definitely sought treatment for him. Once we understood what it was then we sought care. 
AS: You’re saying that the fact that you knew he was using drugs didn’t prompt you to take him to the hospital.
BC: To rush him to the hospital.
AS: Because you knew it was drugs. If it had been anything else you would have seen how crazy, what bad shape he was in. 
BC: Yes, somehow it made it not okay but I thought I understood what was going on. It’s at that point, I didn’t rush him to the hospital but we said we’ve got to get really serious about it.
AS: Did he ever admit what he was using? At that point if you had said, “What are you doing?” Would he have…?
BC: I don’t recall when I first found out that he was doing opioids. It was sometimes later in his senior year. At that point he was crashing pretty hard. He was all set to start school at University of North Dakota. I’m trying to recall the treatment he had done. I think he’d done some other outpatient.
AS: He first went to treatment at Fairview when he was fourteen. Did he go into other outpatient?
BC: He did.
AS: Did it interrupt his schooling or was he able to go after school?
BC: It didn’t interrupt his schooling. 
AS: Then the first inpatient after Fairview?
BC: It was after his graduation from high school.
AS: He got all the way through high school.
BC: He was almost through senior year and it got so bad we told him, “You’re not going to college. We can’t support you in the state you’re in. You cannot survive there. You need to get into treatment.” That’s when we first started battling insurance companies. Getting his initial inpatient was really difficult. 
AS: How so? Why?
BC: We really felt like his life was in danger. 
AS: I thought you were talking about insurance companies. That was difficult?
BC: That was too. This dealing with a situation and knowing how severe his addiction was and trying to get help for him and trying for Laurie and I to be on the same page was really challenging. 
AS: Talk about that a little bit?
BC: I feel very fortunate to be married to Laurie. We both see things pretty eye to eye, most of the time. Dealing with a difficult issue like Will’s addiction can definitely put strain on one. Having the both of us has been really helpful. When I’ve felt strong and rooted and confident in a direction she might feel low. I can bring her up and vice versa. I’ll feel low and weak where she feels confident. I don’t know how single parents do it. It’s got to be extremely difficult. We do see things for the most part eye to eye. There’s been some tension for sure.
AS: Based on decisions about what to do or how to influence him or get him to do things?
BC: Exactly. 
AS: When did you first learn that he was using opioids?
BC: The first shocker I guess, what was most memorable was finding Will passed out in his bathroom. He was out and had been smoking opiates, what we found out was fentanyl off of foil. His friends happened to be coming over around that time. His friends didn’t use opioids but they did use other drugs. They saw what was going on and they said, “Get him to the hospital.” We found some packets. One of the guys knew, “This is fentanyl. He’s been smoking it. He’s really messed up.”
AS: Was he using the patches? Fentanyl patches?
BC: No.
AS: Where was he getting this?
BC: It was a synthetic powder. I don’t know if I can talk about that. There’s an ongoing court case. 
AS: That Will is involved in?
BC: Tangentially. I took him to the Mission detox and brought him there. They go, “We don’t want him here. He needs to go to the emergency room to get stabilized.” They thought he was overdosing. I guess he was.
AS: Were you able to revive him. 
BC: Yes, and keep him awake. I was driving and kind of shaking him. I didn’t have a Narcan kit with me. We got him to; I forget what hospital in the emergency room. I don’t know if that’s the first time I found out about opioid use but that was a very memorable time when I found out that he was using fentanyl. We had just recently completed a Rule 25. To do that I chronicled everything in Will’s history. I should have brought that.
AS: You can share it with me later. 
BC: It’s all kind of a blur. His first inpatient…
AS: He’s only nineteen right now. Right now you are in the middle of it. This is just since 2015? Would he have graduated high school then?
BC: Yes, 2015. 
AS: There’s been no clearing in your brain for any kind of normal, I just feel like things are really jumbled in your brain right now because you’re still in the thick of it. Would you say that’s fair?
BC: Yes. We did have one three month stint where he was out in college in Southern California. He did stay clean, he said he did. I believe him otherwise I don’t think he could have been out there and been able to do what he did. Then he relapsed. He came back from college for Christmas.
AS: It was just last fall?
BC: Yes. I don’t know if you want to attempt to do it chronologically or just go with like when he came back from college.
AS: Let’s go from there. The other thing is how are you functioning as a dad at this point? That intrigues me. What are you facing that you hadn’t faced before as a parent? You were just describing driving to the hospital with him trying to keep him awake. Laurie wasn’t around?
BC: At that particular time she was on a little vacation with her friends. They were in Wisconsin. It was just me which was scary. I’ll describe what happened when he got back from college and I can tell you about how I was feeling. He came from college and both Laurie and I could sense that he wasn’t going back. I even asked, “Are you going back?” “We’ll see.” That’s strange he should be saying, “Yes, I’m going back.” He was definitely prelapsing. He was on Suboxone since 2014 I think. But he cheats. He doesn’t take it when he wants to get high. Then he saves it up and there’s value to it and you can sell it and get drugs. He had a really good Suboxone provider here in Minnesota, very responsible. He another one out in California which not very responsible at all. He was stocking up on the Suboxone and not using it but some point right before coming back for Christmas break. He came back and he started using pretty heavy. Then I found him again in his bathroom passed out. That’s when I realized that he was IV fentanyl. I grabbed him and had my Narcan kit with me. I didn’t administer it at the time. I took him up to the emergency room. The put him right on a Narcan drip. What they said was for heroin users they give them one shot. They had him on a drip for four hours or something. Just to keep him awake. He was not happy about this situation at all. Then he went into treatment again. I had a hard time getting him into treatment even after overdosing in January. He went to Beauterre to treatment there. He came back, relapsed and now he’s in Hazelden. 
AS: Where’s Beauterre?
BC: It’s in Owatonna. It’s a good place. He’d been there twice. How I’m feeling, right now it’s just now that I’ve come to the really true realization that I can’t do anything for Will. As much as I try to get him into treatment that’s not helping him. It’s great that he’s there, don’t get me wrong. He’s there and he’s not using. Any day that he’s not using is a victory. I don’t think he can live at home. That’s a sad thing. It’s not my choice. It’s what it is. 
AS: You haven’t had really a break since he got home in December from the chaos of addiction?
BC: Right. He was in Beauterre for thirty days. You’re still not away from it. 
AS: You’re on because you’re visiting and you’re checking in. This is his sixth time in inpatient?
BC: Yes.
AS: Did he go willingly? Do you want to talk about what you said early when you first got here about what you had to say?
BC: A few times, probably three out of the sixth times, we’ve told him, “It’s either treatment or you’re out on your own.” That’s what it came down to this time too. 
AS: Has he ever left?
BC: I think he maybe spent one night out. That was it. “I don’t want to do this.” It was really hard to get him to treatment this last time. I think it gets more and more difficult as I get older. I told him, “I’m either going to take you to treatment or I’m calling the Eden Prairie police to tell them you’re unwelcome here and you’re trespassing and I’ll press charges.” That’s ultimately what got him out. He was high at the time. 
AS: When?
BC: When I took him to treatment. Then it was hard. I think that he felt like he was being abandoned. He said as much. That we didn’t care for him. I explained from my point of view that we cared deeply for him and that’s what we’re doing what we’re doing. He really needs to start caring for himself. We haven’t abandoned him. There’s nothing further from the truth. He’s really abandoned us, his family and everything that’s been good in his life. He’s abandoned it because of his love for this drug. It’s just all consuming. It is. One way to describe it is a love affair. You can’t get enough of it. Your whole being centers around it. 
AS: Do you have any history of addiction in your family?
BC: Yes. My brother, one of my brothers, is a recovering alcoholic. He’s doing really well. He had some really dark times. We had to do an intervention. He got his life turned around. He suffered some losses that resulted in his addiction. On Laurie’s side there’s some addiction issues there and anxiety issues as well. I think there is a genetic component to it for Will. 
AS: But it wasn’t something you and Laurie battled on your own?
BC: No.
AS: There was no problem in his childhood. It was his social group and access. You said none of his other friends were using opioids?
BC: Some of them were. I found out later. It’s really funny. Some of his closer friends, they smoked quite a bit of weed. They did an intervention for Will. 
AS: Unknown to you guys?
BC: Yes. Just an informal, ad hoc kind of a spur of the moment thing. They sat him down and said, “What the hell are you doing?”
AS: When was this? His senior year?
BC: Yes, I think so. They were worried about him. 
AS: That’s impressive. 
BC: These kids that I thought were way out there. 
AS: You couldn’t imagine them ever doing that?
BC: Right.
AS: We judge them.
BC: Exactly. 
AS: We judge those bad friends right? And then it’s our own kid. What’s this been like for you as a parent and as a dad? His adolescence has been clouded by addiction. How about your friendships or being a parent in public spaces? Has that had an impact on you?
BC: Absolutely. There’s been times when I don’t want to see people that I know, that know Will. I don’t want to have to explain. I don’t want to have to hear about how their kids are doing so well in college. “How’s Will? Where’s Will?” I’ve gotten over that. I feel like I can really be happy for people and what their kids are doing, Will’s peers. I think that’s great. For the most part I’ve gotten over being able to talk about Will’s situation. I don’t go on necessarily broadcasting it but if somebody asks me, “What’s Will up to?” I’ll say, “He’s in treatment. He has…” What’s the proper term now?
AS: Substance use disorder.
BC: Yes. I’ll talk about that. I think it’s important to talk about that. If we’re not open about it then as a society we’re not going to get on the solution side of it if we’re just closed up. I think it’s important. At work there’s some people that know just because all of a sudden I’ll have to take a day because something is going on. It’s important that some of them know. It was really hard. I mentioned that he was a good lacrosse player. In junior high he had a lot of potential going into high school. He made the varsity team. He was a starter when he was a sophomore. That’s when he started really getting into pot and other drugs. I remember in his senior year he still made the team, barely. I remember going to games and just hated going to games. I hated it because they never played him. These other parents, there was this parent sport culture. It gives me the willies. They’re talking about their kids’ stats and stuff. They’re all up there and Will’s on the sidelines. Whereas a couple years before he’d been starting. He never got played. I remember getting really mad, and I usually not like this, I approached the coach and said, “What is up? Why aren’t you playing Will?” I thought the coach was being a jerk. I wasn’t one of those parents. He just said that Will wasn’t doing anything in practice or anything. 
AS: You didn’t know that.
BC: Eventually it became obvious. I wanted to support him and wanted to be there but I just hated being there. 
AS: It’s kind of right in your face.
BC: Exactly. It’s just a silly thing.
AS: It’s just an example of what it feels like to be in public. Did he ever have any issues with the law?
BC: No. One of his friends overdosed and died. There’s a pending lawsuit around that. Will’s caught up in that. 
AS: Was Will with him when he purchased it?
BC: Yes.
AS: How did that death play out in your family? Can you talk about that? This is a young man from Minnetonka?
BC: From the area. 
AS: If I recall, nineteen or twenty. 
BC: What was shocking to me, what was so disheartening was that you would think that this would be a wakeup call. This was a good friend of Will’s. They had a strong friendship and he cared deeply about this person. I thought it would be a wakeup call for Will and it wasn’t. He and I went to the funeral.
AS: Was this like a year ago? A year and a half ago?
BC: A couple years ago. I don’t remember. It was just crazy. That he still didn’t want to seek help for himself. He stayed in touch with the family, with the mom which was really cool. He went to visit her when he was on break. I can’t imagine what they’re feeling, what she’s feeling. Especially towards Will because Will was a part of this thing. To let Will into their house and to accept him that’s pretty amazing. I think addicts think they’re immune to death and overdose. It’s so crazy what’s happening all around. 
AS: It’s that part that I have trouble bridging. No matter how many times I hear stories and how much I try to empathize that fearlessness around death. To me it has to be that, it has to be fearlessness or something. They can’t be thinking they’re immune to dying when they’ve known so many people who have died. What is it? That’s the part I don’t understand.
BC: I don’t know. Maybe it’s something that the draw of getting high is worth the risk. It’s not rational. It’s not. It’s irrational. 
AS: It reminds me of when Bob Levy was talking to our group about the nurse who stuck her hand in the sharps container and was risking every known human pathogen just to get to a little bit of dilaudid. That’s an example of the power. So what about death? 
BC: There’s got to be something else that motivates them besides dying. That’s kind of what he was saying about pilots and doctors. They’re more worried about their license. One thing that’s been driving Will is college.
AS: He does want to?
BC: Absolutely. That’s what’s driving him. He’s all mad at us. “What about college? I’m supposed to start summer classes at Normandale.” That’s a good thing. It is something to work towards. It tears me up as a father, how do you not squelch that drive, take away that drive and get him to a length of sobriety that he needs in order to sustain going to school for a longer period of time. I don’t know if I have the answer for that. That’s one of the tensions I feel. Another tension that I feel, I’ve heard other parents of addicts talk about you eventually come to a point where you accept the fact that you could lose your child. To be brutally honest, I don’t know if I’ve come to that point yet. I can see that maybe, I don’t know if that’s a goal.
AS: If it’s a goal to realize that your kid might die?
BC: Yes. I don’t know. That sounds stupid. 
AS: No, it doesn’t sound stupid. 
BC: This is crazy to think about. In reality I’ve been losing Will since he was sixteen, seventeen slowly. I’ve been losing him. I feel extremely ripped off in this whole thing. Other people have got to experience Will when he’s been on a sustained period of sobriety. Even if it’s for a thirty day treatment, he’s been sober and his old self is starting to reemerge. When he was at college for three or four months other people got to experience that. I didn’t. I’m just ripped off. I don’t get to experience that. It’s a drag. I’ve watched another sad thing is watching his friends slowly drop away too. 
AS: You mean losing his old friends because of his addiction?
BC: Yes. I’ve mentioned that he had some really good friends from when he was very young. A couple of them have really stuck with him which is really fun. Otherwise people just kind of drift away and do other things. 
AS: You said earlier when we were talking before we started the recording that you thought you’d be a good bad example of a dad. Can you talk a little bit about that?
BC: I don’t know. 
AS: What do you think you did that was bad?
BC: I guess really in a very general way not realizing the seriousness of where he was at. 
AS: Two years ago or before?
BC: Maybe even a little bit before that. Not being a little bit harder on him, making him more accountable for his decisions. He got high and had been using whatever vehicles in order to enable him to be high. Not saying he can’t use the vehicle for another month. We did some of that but I think I would have been a little bit harder on him.
AS: Do you think that would have changed anything?
BC: I don’t know.
AS: I’m just being the devil’s advocate right now.
BC: Right now I just know it’s not very good. Maybe if I would have done something like that it could have been worse. I don’t know. 
AS: What you’re really talking about is how we judge ourselves as parents and how we grade ourselves as if we are somehow implicated in the addiction or that it started. That we somehow had some control over it. 
BC: That’s step one. I still struggle with step one to be quite honest with you. I do. I didn’t cause it; I don’t think I was a primary cause of it. I don’t know how all of that plays out. I definitely contributed to it.
AS: In what way?
BC: Not having good enough boundaries for him. The thing is I think you can’t raise kids in isolation. They are who they are. They’re going to gravitate towards certain activities. 
AS: Do you think him being an only child had any impact on what you see as being a boundaries issue? Because he was the only child did you have in your family dynamic what was his role? You don’t have other kids so you don’t know what that is like but you were a sibling. 
BC: It could very well have. I think that families that have more than one kid have to split their time up between those kids. As a result you’ve got four kids running around the house the parents go, “This is your boundary. You better understand it.” With one kid it’s a little bit softer. If that makes sense.
AS: I think that’s a good way to put it. You don’t have to be as strict. You can do more negotiating and coming to terms and dealing with each other. 
BC: I think that’s right. I think my own upbringing kind of influences my approach as a father. Growing up in boarding school, very restrictive, especially the first boarding school I went to. Not only physically restrictive, there was a fence all the way around with barbed wire on top. Mostly for our protection. We’d sneak out and stuff. Also, all your time was occupied. There’s very little freedom. We were up early in the morning for Bible study, breakfast, school and we had rest hour right after lunch. We had to be in the dorm and lying on the bed and be quiet. Back to school and then sports and then supper and then study hall and then to bed. Saturday was glorious. Saturday was your day. One of the punishments was they’d take away your Saturday and make you stay in the dorm room on your bed and you had to be quiet all day. Besides they whipped you too. 
AS: Did you get in trouble?
BC: Yes, I got into trouble a lot. There was this real restriction and control. I resent to this day. Critical thinking was not encouraged. Being able to explore things was not encouraged. This is the way you think and that’s it. Now as a parent I push away from that. Maybe I give Will more freedom than he really needed. I’m not judging myself this is just what I’m perceiving. I want Will to know why he believes what he believes. I want him to be his own person and be able to think critically. Maybe I drove him way too far the other way. We had boundaries. We were relatively strict with things. The thing about negotiating was interesting because there was some of that too. Will actually benefitted from that because he’s a real good negotiator. 
AS: He’s been interacting with two adults which can be a really great way to be raised. 
BC: He had friends.
AS: Right, I meant in his kind of formative relationships. Anything else? We didn’t talk about your struggles with insurance companies.
BC: I don’t know if I should name the insurance company. 
AS: Go right ahead. I can strike it if I want to later. 
BC: Blue Cross Blue Shield Minnesota. When we were dealing with Will’s treatment initially, that was tough. Even after overdosing. Trying to get in inpatient. I don’t know if it was the insurance or Hazelden. With Hazelden you don’t need to do all the insurance. We had a heck of a time trying to get him in inpatient.
AS: This time?
BC: No, his first time. That was a real struggle with the insurance. I remember we had to wait like two weeks or something. That seems like forever.
AS: It’s a horrible travesty. To me it’s one of the cruelest parts of our treatment system and the most dangerous. 
BC: Your kids at risk. 
AS: When they know they’re going to treatment they start using as much as they possibly can.
BC: Absolutely. To be fair since then we’ve had a good experience with them. They’ve been pretty quick. They do initial ten day coverage and then a little bit more. Not beyond thirty. That we’ve found.
AS: Not at Hazelden?
BC: No, Will was at one place Fountain Center in Albert Lea. It’s a Mayo Clinic place. He was there thirty days and the counselor down there was great. He said, “He needs more time. He needs to go into extended care. Your insurance won’t cover it so kick him out of the house, Rule 25.” We did that. Will got into extended care through that. There was another sixty days. He didn’t quite make it. Almost but then he bailed. The insurance has been good. They were fighting tooth and nail initially but they get on board pretty quick but it never lasts more than thirty days. Thirty days is not a long time.
AS: Did you do Rule 25 for him this time?
BC: No. 
AS: This is coming out of your employer’s?
BC: Yes, I don’t know how it is with insurance. Do insurance companies get to a point where they say, “This is untreatable?” 
AS: I don’t think they can anymore. I thought that was part of the ACA. 
BC: Have you heard of insurance companies carrying more than thirty days?
AS: They will through Medicaid. Minnesota Care. They’ll do ninety. That’s if he was independent and on his own. That’s the state and they take opiate addiction really seriously as far as I know. That’s been my experience; it’s more than thirty days. 
BC: We need to start thinking about that right now. His after care. Have you had any experience with Hazelden?
AS: I’m just going to stop this recording. Thank you Bill.

B: ...I don’t know how long it was, but I remember spending a lot of time trying to hold my head up. My head just kept going like this. Later on, I found out I had gotten into some drugs that my mom had laying around. That was before I could see over the table. I remember being really low and being eye level with the handles of the cabinets. I also remember that at a very young age I learned that if you see one of those needle things on the ground you have to walk around it. You can’t step on one of those. I don’t remember if I ever did or not.
My mom is a meth addict. She didn’t want to grow up and be a mom right away. I don’t know if there was a catalyst to this happening, but I was sent to live with my grandmother. She is the only person in my family that never gave up on me. She always knew there was a good person inside of me. She raised me; I sat in her lap all the time. I guess I used to play with her ear a lot. I kind of remember that. That was just the kind of relationship me and my grandmother had. I called her ‘nanny,’ she was my nanny.
I stayed there for a while. She got me out of the situation I was in because nothing good would have come out of that at all. Except, I think it planted a seed in my head that that kind of shit was normal. The drugs, the bad behavior, and being afraid of adults. That was all normal. I stayed with my grandmother; a lot happened in between. I don’t think I developed a self. I don’t think I actually developed a person that I was. I don’t know how to explain it any better than that. It always felt like I had this empty hole there where, now that I think about it, it’s that warm feeling that people had for their parents and for being at home. I never had that. That was just an empty hole. It was filled up by my grandmother but I couldn’t always be around her. 
My mother decided to somewhat get her shit together. My dad got into some big shootout in Laughlin, Nevada. I can’t remember how old I was, but I think it was around ‘88 or ‘89. My mom left my dad and hooked up with this Jewish guy with a hard core work ethic. He would provide for her. Being a little kid, I just wanted to be a little kid. I didn’t want to pay attention to if my mom was still doing that same stuff that she did that scared me. I remember having a fear that someone was going to put that white powder shit on my lip while I was asleep and I would breathe it in. That was a legitimate fear that I had. I don’t think any kid should have that kind of fear. I’m not trying to break your guys’ hearts or anything, but that was the reality of being an eight year old for me. Howard tried. He really tried to turn things around for me and my mom. 
AS: Your stepdad?
BC: Yeah, my stepdad. He had a really weird, strange way about it. I was bad at this point in time. I couldn’t listen to what people told me to do. I wouldn’t do it. It wasn’t because didn’t want to. I don’t know why but I just could never follow rules at this time. I liked to be alone a lot at this time and I developed a passion for reading. I was reading big, thick novels about whatever when I was a youngster. 
At this point in time I’m living in Denver [Colorado]. We moved from Denver to Arkansas and back to Denver, then to Texas, and then to Arizona. He worked for a chain of restaurants, but he worked for the corporation that owned the chain of restaurants. I think they owned Chili’s and all those mall-type restaurants. He moved us out to Arizona. When I got to Arizona I met another kid that was just like me. His dad was a big, mean, abusive alcoholic. We just had this kinship. We were just good friends. We came to be like brothers. Absolutely. My mom took him in, as much as she could. His mom took me in. Our addictions started together and flourished together. 
My mom is the one who turned me onto meth. Right at the beginning of high school, maybe I was even in junior high at this point, I was having trouble with my homework; I just didn’t want to do it. She told me, “This will help you concentrate on your homework.” I don’t blame her. She still uses to this day. She has never had to face the consequences of her use because of her privileged place in society. She stands behind her rich, white male. He gives her a safe place to do everything in. I’m not sure if he knows that’s what she does, but I don’t understand how he couldn’t. Some days when I would go over and see my mom I’m just like Jesus, it’s bad. I always thought I was bad and that’s how I know I could do more drugs was I wasn’t as bad as my mom, you know.
I’m trying to make light of it. It’s just a serious thing in my life. This is the third or fourth time that I’ve told my story. By the end of it I can see people on the edge of their seats sometimes. It kind of makes me feel -- I just hope this is helping. 
Me and Nick started shooting meth. 
AS: How old were you?
BC: Fifteen. I skipped the whole pipe thing. I wanted to be high right away. I honestly don’t know how I made it so long. Two years straight of doing that. This is over countless broken relationships. I’m just giving a summary. Just think of everything that is possibly shitty that could happen and it happened to me. I don’t want to say it happened to me because I did it to myself. The whole time I saw exactly what was happening to me. I just didn’t care because I was so good at manipulation and so good at talking that I would just talk myself out of something. 
When I was about seventeen -- it took me about two years of not sleeping to want to sleep. Another friend of mine said, “You can do some heroin and go to sleep.” Right away again, at seventeen, I didn’t smoke it; I dove in head first into that addiction along with my meth addiction. You can imagine what happens from there. This is ‘95. ‘97 I started shooting heroin. 
In ‘98 it was my first offense and I went to prison for four years in Arizona. It’s not the kind of place you want to get locked up in. I probably would have taken any Minnesota prison over an Arizona prison any day. [laughs] I still wasn’t grown up yet. I still had to grow up; I’m talking like physically. Like knowing that it’s better just to keep your mouth shut; it’s just better to keep your eyes forward. I learned that pretty quickly when I went to prison. There were a lot of really traumatic experiences that happened in there. I’m not going to go into detail, but it was pretty bad. I got out and just went right back. I couldn’t seem to conform and it was just an easier way. I could inject a chemical in my blood and run around and not care about anything at all; knowing that life is building up and reality is going to come crashing in. 
At this point in time I learned that you really could just pick a direction and go that way. I learned to sneak on trains and ride them to the next state. I would hop off and immerse myself into whatever drug culture they had wherever I got off. That’s where I really learned how to not give a shit and hide from myself. You call it traveling but I just call it running. That’s what it was. It sounds cool but there’s no word for how lonely I was. And how scary it was that I could just come to and be somewhere that I had never been before and not even realize how I had gotten there. I’m not talking about at some new house in St. Paul [Minnesota]. I’m talking about Bourbon Street in New Orleans and being on the street with people going through my pockets trying to take my stuff. 
St. Louis [Missouri], man. I almost want to tell you the story about St. Louis. I really think I’m traumatized. I’ve tried to tell that story a couple of times -- yeah, I’m not going to tell that one. I just can’t. 
I think it was 2006 when I tried to get clean. I had had enough. I had gotten jumped so many times. I had been beaten up and left for dead because I didn’t care who I ripped off. I didn’t care what they did to me when they found me. I would rip off the Mexican mafia and sleep on a guy’s couch. He would want that free bag of dope he would get if he called the guys I had ripped off and said, “Hey, he’s sleeping here on my couch right now. Come on over. But you’ve got to give me half a gram.” I would get woken up by being pistol whipped by crazy Mexican dudes speaking Spanish really loudly. That was the scariest thing. I thought I was going to die and I really didn’t care. My eyes were already swollen shut from a fight the day before. Once you get bloody and beaten to a certain point it doesn’t matter anymore. That’s where I was. 
I don’t even remember who but somebody cared enough to stick me into detox and get me clean. I stayed clean for a little bit and I met this girl. We stayed together for a little bit and I had a boy, his name is Dorian and I had another little boy and his name was Deven. I was still using, but somehow I was providing for them. I wasn’t providing them a safe father to be around. I saw the exact same thing happening to these little boys that had happened to me. I saw it right in front of me but I couldn’t stop. 
The one part I remember over everything -- you’ve heard this before -- there really isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about this. During that time I was doing a lot of speed balls, which is coke and heroin. For some reason, I liked how the shower sounded when the rush hit me. It was like a tunnel sound. I was at home with the boys and I just went into the bathroom and shut the door and did my thing. Before I knew it, this had never happened before, my eyes started going like this [shakes hands quickly] and the whole world started going. I remember laying back on the toilet and waking up. I go to go out of the bathroom and I can’t open the door. I pushed it open a little bit and looked out. Both of my boys had their pillows and blankets and they were sleeping outside the bathroom door waiting for their dad to come out. That is burned into my memory; that will never go away. 
At that point, like I said, I didn’t care. I didn’t even see that while it was going on. My mom, the insane person that she is, decided that I wasn’t fit to have the boys. She takes them, I don’t know how she does it but she does it. That just gives me an out: my boys are safe and I’m hitting the road again. Just when I was getting my stuff ready to go, I hadn’t quite left yet, Nick, the guy I told you guys about -- we had this ritual. At the time I had a ‘63 Lincoln Continental and there was an eight track player in it. The only eight track we had was Al Green. On Fridays our dealer wouldn’t drive into Tempe [Arizona] to give us dope. We would have to drive out to Glendale [Arizona] to get it. There’s this freeway there called the Loop 202 that just goes around the whole valley. That car pretty much drives itself so I would put my arm over there and he would hit me up and then he would shoot himself up. We would just drive in circles listening to Al Green. 
We played this game where whoever was driving, if the other person nodded off we would whack their heads against the window. It was just this stupid game that we played. He didn’t come to when I did it. I’ve only seen it in movies where people overdose and they have foam coming out of their mouth but that actually happened this time. No other time has that ever happened. I guess his heart exploded because the cocaine was really good and it made his heart explode. First, it brought him down -- it was just all wrong. 
I was high too, really high. I missed the exit to the hospital three times trying to get him there. Finally, I got him there and I ran around to his side of the car, but for some reason his door wouldn’t open. It had never happened before. So, I ran back to my side, drug him over the seat, and put him in a wheelchair and wheeled him into the emergency room. I ran back outside, grabbed my keys, started the car, and drove around the block. I stashed the dope and everything in the bushes, turned around, and came back. When I came back the cops were there. They put handcuffs on me and told me I was going to jail for, I don’t remember what he called it, but it was accessory to something. 
It still hadn’t dawned on me what had happened. We had both overdosed tons of times, but this time got him. The cops told me, “He’s dead. You’re going to have to call his mom.” I called his mom. It still hadn’t really hit me until I was cleaning out his apartment. His mom called and she said, “I can’t do it. I need you to go over there and do it.” That’s when it really hit me. After that it just seemed like my mom was blaming me for it, my baby’s mom was blaming me for it, his mom was blaming me for it, and I was blaming myself for it. I just left town and I stayed gone. I can’t even tell you all the places I went that time. I was just drifting, floating. 
My friend Matt, a kid that I grew up with, got a hold of my mom and said, “Have you heard from Brandon?” She said, “No, but when I do can I get him on an airplane and send him to Minneapolis? Or else he’s going to die.” That’s pretty much what happened. 
AS: Was Matt here?
BC: Matt was here. He had an uncle or something that lived in Isanti, Minnesota. He came here to get clean. He got cleaner; he wasn’t shoving needles in his arm every day until I showed up in Minnesota to get clean. I think part of his motivation to get me here was because he’s not the kind of guy that can just go out into a city and find dope. I just have that resource, or something. I can just find it wherever that it. 
I came out here and learned what Rule 25 is. Rule 25 is the first step. I don’t know what about me made people want to help me. I was really more interested in what people had in their pockets that I could get. That’s really what I’m more interested in at this point. I was the worst kind of person. I hated myself. I couldn’t even pinpoint when I started hating myself. As long as I can remember there was just something that I didn’t like when I looked in the mirror. When I was a kid I always lied about myself. I didn’t want people to know who I really was. If I saw somebody that I thought was cool I would take some of their story and take that on. I was ashamed of what I had: my mom, my dad. 
I came here and did a Rule 25. I went to this place called Dellwood [Recovery Center, Cambridge, Minnesota]. They were like, “Well, you can’t get clean on your own. You’re going to have to do Suboxone.” I was like, “Okay, I’ll do whatever it is.” This was when Suboxone was pretty new because I didn’t really know about it. 
AS: When was this?
BC: 2012. Suboxone didn’t work. What it did was give me a way to make money. At this time you could get twenty to forty dollars for a little pill. I got one hundred and twenty a month. That became the hustle. I didn’t have to go out and rob and steal. All I had to do was sell my Suboxone. Then I found dealers that would take the Suboxone and give me anything for it. 
I still lived out of my backpack. I slept by the river, slept in squats, slept wherever I could if I slept. I went to treatment again. I went to the Pride Institute [Minneapolis, Minnesota]. That’s where I met Maddie. We actually stayed clean together for five months. Then head first, right away. We hit the road again and she had a habit of overdosing. She overdosed so much. Luckily in Minnesota, Valhalla has it, [Valhalla Place, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota] you can get a little bottle of Narcan. You don’t have to hit a vein you can just go for it right in the shoulder if somebody is overdosing and it will bring them right back in five minutes. 
Over and over again this is how it would happen. She wouldn’t overdose for a couple of months and then she would overdose. I overdosed a couple of times between there. I think what really made my decision was I had watched everyone around me die: the kids I grew up with, people I considered my brother, people I knew. I didn’t die. I stayed alive through gutters and shit and everything; I stayed alive. I didn’t want for her to die and me to still be alive. I just knew that was what was going to happen. I love Maddie so much. I was to the point of leaving: “I’m just going to disappear and you’re never going to see me again. I am going to go to treatment and I hope you are going to go to treatment.” 
I actually went to treatment and wanted to get clean. Twenty years of being homeless, not knowing what home feels like. Just the looks I had gotten for twenty years. I’m lucky to even look the way I do after twenty years of this. I don’t have the greatest self esteem in the world but I don’t have shitty self esteem anymore. 
I don’t know what it was. I was lucky to have a spiritual awakening; not everybody does. I was awake for it. It happens every day, all day; it’s just whether people choose to see it for what it is. Every day something like that happens for me just to let me know that I’m doing the right thing. If you guys had seen my daughter -- that right there just overwhelms me with that feeling that I never had my whole life. Now my little boys come here on breaks and stay with me and I have an extra room to provide them a room. I have fucked those little boys out of something that I have given to my daughter. My daughter has never had to know me the way I was. I have been an excellent father to my daughter and she will never know anything different. It rips my guts apart to know that my boys could have had that had I just woken up a little bit sooner. 
I try not to keep myself in that thought but all I can do now is go from here. I wake up every morning and I don’t stick a needle in my arm, I don’t fuck people over, I don’t lie to people. When I look at a person now I smile at them no matter who it is. All these different things that I always wanted to tell myself that I was I actually am now. I’m actually happy and I actually care about things. I care about myself and I want to help people. I know that it is an uphill battle but all I can do is the next right thing. That’s how I live my life: from one right choice to the next. If I lose sight of that in an instant it will strip me right back to where I was. I think that’s about the skinny of it. 
That’s the best way I can do it. I make amends to people that I have hurt in the past. That’s really hard to do.
AS: You’re using the twelve steps?
BC: Yeah, I’m using the twelve steps. For me personally I don’t see any other way. If I don’t make my whole life about it in one way or another.
My body does this thing where it will try to convince me that I can control it [my addiction]. My body actually tries to fuck me over. My head actually tries to convince me that I’m so uncomfortable that I need to get high. I know it will make me feel better, but you just have to do the harder thing which is to not do it. I just have to not do it one time. I just have to stay clean for today; right now. I’m not worrying about tomorrow until tomorrow. That’s the only way that I can do it and I have tried every way possible. Because I have lived as long as I have -- that’s why I’m clean. Twenty years of misery is enough. 
AS: And that you survived through all of that. 
BC: I survived. I did. I can still articulate sentences. [laughs]
AS: You can still read, you are about to finish your GED [General Education Development], and you have a full-time job. 
BC: I can still read. I can do all kinds of stuff. I’m actually doing the kinds of stuff that I should have learned to do in life already. Now I do it and I’m really nervous about it. A lot of the stuff I’m doing today people learn to do when they are eighteen years old. I’m thirty-six. Just now I’m starting to live my life. I’ve done everything and been everywhere and none of it means anything because I wasn’t really there. I was just a husk of a person until I decided to look around and saw that there is life around me and I can participate in it in a positive way. 
I try to sit there and think -- I don’t know if this is just the way my mind is -- but there’s no way, looking at my daughter, that there is any way I can do the things I did when I was around my sons around her. The way that I am now it just isn’t possible. I can’t fathom it. That’s a big shift. That’s a huge shift. Never would I have thought that I wasn’t a piece of shit. 
AS: There is a lot of really judgmental language about how stupid meth heads are. We were talking about how it comes from people in communities that have been particularly ravaged by meth. As a class, we’ve struggled with all the stigma. We think, Why does everyone write about it this way, perpetuating these myths about addicts? How can we change this whole problem if we still think about people as bad and morally bankrupt? It goes along with all these vivid descriptions of what meth does to your body, that it makes you do crazy things. Do you think that these portrayals are honest? Do you think that they are fair? Because you just talked about yourself in a lot of derogatory terms.
BC: Yeah, and there’s no way to even get the way that I felt across to you guys. 
AS: Do the stereotypes have a use?
BC: Yeah, they do. It is what it is. It doesn’t deserve to be fluffed. It doesn’t deserve to be --
AS: What doesn’t?
BC: Meth. The way some people act. I think that when people do crazy shit when they’re on meth they have a dual diagnosis. They might have prior mental conditions and then they put meth on top of it. Schizophrenia does two things that I’ve seen happen directly in front of me. Some Schizophrenics, when they get completely high, their voices get completely quiet and they don’t hear anything and they can concentrate. Some Schizophrenics it’s the opposite. The way that this guy described it to me was that his personalities took on different personalities. He had gotten used to his mind the way it was. A lot of it is preconditioned. It depends on the way they are before they start doing it. 
US1: You talk a little bit about the personal stigma that you’ve faced and how people have looked down on you, or look at you a certain way. Do you feel like people still look at you and behave at you the same way? If so, how do you deal with that based just on the way that you look?
BC: When they do it now, it’s interesting to me now. It’s funny at first I would think, “I know what that guy thinks of me. If he only knew.” That’s my ego kicking in, though: “You’re so much better than that now, and he just needs to know that.” It just depends on the day. Now, I can be sad about it. At the same time I deserve that. I have twenty years to make up for. I do it in whatever way I can. There is this lady that cleans the apartments that I paint sometimes and she has a hell of a time getting around to all these places so I get her bus cards and give them to her. Just little things like that that I do to try to make up for the things I’ve done. 
There’s no way to make up for all the shit that I’ve done to this world; this negative imprint that I’ve left on people’s lives that I don’t even realize. I just try to be of service as much as I can. That’s how I deal with the stigma. I make it a priority to go just a little bit further for a person even if I don’t know them. Especially if I don’t know them because nobody expects a person that looks like me to do it and be smiling the whole time. [laughs] That’s the only way that I can make it okay with myself and think that I am trying to fix the wreckage. 
There’s stuff that I’ve done that I can’t even fix but it wouldn’t even be healthy to try to fix because it would do way more damage. That’s like the amends. We try to make amends to people wherever possible except when that would do harm to them or others. 
I really try to think about things more now. I’m more quiet; my voice isn’t as loud as it was. My head doesn’t get held up as high. 
US2: Earlier you said Minnesota was probably the best place to get treatment. Why is Minnesota different than other states? How do other states do it?
BC: It’s their resources. 
AS: Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota], Willmar [Minnesota]. It was the beginning of the recovery scene.
BC: I’ve been on the streets in a lot of the states. I’ve hit a bottom in every state and tried to reach for help there. Never have I found it except for in Minnesota. Minnesota really picked my ass up and dusted me off. It is still helping me. I’m help-able I guess; I try. 
I hope I enlightened you guys. Next time will be easier than this time. [laughs]
There are some days when I think the cravings are going to get me. The meth cravings -- heroin not so much -- but the meth cravings are out of this world. They have my hands sweating sometimes. Maybe even a song will trigger it. Any time I go into a public bathroom I get them because of being on the streets. That’s where you have to use when you’re on the streets. 
I’m just a survivor I guess; I’m just one of those people that can survive. "

Samantha Aamot-SA
SA: Okay, I'll have you state your name and tell me you give me permission to record you.
JD: Jamison Danielson, I give permission to be recorded. 
SA: Do you want to start with talking about your childhood? Or we could start with the work you do here. Really wherever.
JD: There's a lot of space between that, holy shit. So, I have a very interesting past. I am one of five children and four of us are living. My life changed drastically the day that my sister died. She died when she was nineteen days old of SIDS and it was extremely rough on my parents. They couldn't bring themselves to stay in the house that she died in, and they couldn't bring themselves to not stay in the house that she died in. So, their grief stricken course of action was to stop paying the mortgage and pretty much stay there as long as they could, but also being forced to leave, which was, I don't know, I was in second grade, so it was complicated in my mind. Eventually, we got our twenty-four hour notice. From there we stayed with my mom's friend, who was pretty toxic. Her husband was an alcoholic. 
SA: You and your four siblings?
JD: Yeah, me and my four brothers. I am the oldest--now I'm twenty-eight. My other brother is twenty-five, my next brother is seventeen, the next one is eighteen, so there's a bit of a gap in between us. 
SA: This is in Duluth?
JD: Yeah, here in Duluth. That all went down in 1996. From then we stayed in campgrounds and hotels and it was just kind of a rough go of things. Then we were able to access transitional housing through Salvation Army, and we were like on an on-sight managed program for some time just to see like, ""Are these people respectful? Do they behave? Are they worthy of our resources and time?"" So after, I don't know, six months or a year there we were given an opportunity to live in a house instead of a managed house, which is really rad because the Salvation Army has three of those on Park Point. So, to be a poor kid and get to live out on Park Point coming from nothing was really fucking rad. Yeah, it was really cool. Like I said my sister passing really damaged my family, and so I grew up in a pretty toxic household. There was a lot of emotional abuse and physical abuse, and me and my mom just didn't get along. I acted out quite a bit as a teenager due to that. I ended up on probation as a teenager. I was locked up a lot. 
SA: Do you remember if this is middle school or high school?
JD: This is, I don't know, however old you are in ninth grade. I don't know, high school was really abnormal in comparison to most people's experience. So, yeah, however old you are then. I just couldn't live with her. I acted out because when the social workers would come over she would behave, the house would be clean, because they would say, ""Hey, we are going to come next Tuesday at four."" So they aren't getting an accurate view of what my life was like. My brothers were younger and just didn't experience as much as I did, so they defended her, which we have had conversations about now that we are older. They feel bad for not speaking their truth, but I can't fault them for that. So, yeah, I was just kind of locked up a lot. When I was fifteen years old I moved into Renaissance, which was a transitional housing program for teens in Duluth ran through Lutheran Social Services. That was where I came out as gay. It was a really cool experience for me; a lot of the staff around me were also gay. I lived with two lesbians, a bi man, and a gay man, so that was really rad to experience that at fifteen years old. That was one of my comings out. So, I lived there for a while. I just kind of went through a lot. No one would rent me, so I was just kind of stuck in that space for a while. Then eventually did rent my own SRO, or single room occupancy. Just kind of a shitty room like this. It was better than being outside where I have slept before in my life. 
SA: Especially here. 
JD: Yeah, yeah it's cold much of the year. That's why I try to get outside as much as I can because I've got like a three to four month window otherwise it's Netflix and snacks, which would be why I'm a big dude. [laughs] I lived there for a while. I then was in a long term relationship for five years so lived with her. That was kind of messy. I think the first time you love someone is messy, especially when you're young. You don't know what the fuck you are doing and there's a lot of great things that happen; you make a lot of mistakes because you just don't know better. You just don't know how to value something or care for it. It's kind of like if somebody gives you some kind of rare plant and says, ""Good luck,"" and tells you nothing. [laughs] Half the plant might live, half the plant might look like shit and you are like, ""I don't know what I'm doing."" So that relationship ended.
SA: Five years is a long time. 
JD: Yeah, I was with her from sixteen until I was twenty-one. I guess that's kind of where things get a little messy. I am trans. I am a trans guy, but I didn't want to be trans. Being gay was hard enough. I was really struggling with that, and I pushed my ex away a lot. You know, I have my own drug history. I was using, I guess I'll say I was a garbage can user; anything that came my way or whatever. Anything that made you feel good or made you feel nothing was something I was really interested in. 
SA: Did that start earlier? Eighth grade, ninth grade?
JD: Yeah, I had always been a pot smoker. Pills here and there, and a fuck ton of drinking as a teenager. Fuck tons of drinking. Yeah, I mean I kind of dabbled in stuff. As I got older it escalated, and I had friends who were heavily using. I've never injected myself, but I did use a lot of hard core stuff. I damaged or lost a lot of important things in my life due to that. There kind of came a point where I had to deal with my gender identity stuff. Well, I guess I hate the word 'identity' because I don't identify as, I am. For lack of better language tools I'll say that. So, yeah, I really had to deal with that because it really came to a point where I felt like I had to transition or I was going to die. There was just no in-between. Oh, I found it. Okay, when I was a teenager--so I'm twenty-eight years old--when I was a teenager I remember Googling trans things and being like really fucking freaked out. Trying to delete everything, every time my mom walked by I clicked onto, I don't know--
SA: The newspaper.
JD: Right, right. [laughs] Anything but that. I remember when I was reading about trans people and people who had transitioned the only stuff I really read about were people who were using hormones and people who were having surgery. At that time the concept of hormones was like a whole new thing, so I didn't know how I felt about that, and surgery from the get-go was something I just never really wanted because I was comfortable with my parts and what was going on, but I didn't like myself when I looked in the mirror. When I Googled these things a lot of people were like, ""If I don't have bottom surgery, I'm going to kill myself."" And I could never relate to that. I stayed closeted as a trans person for many years because, ""I'm not trans enough to be trans,"" you know. When I look back on that--and I help quite a bit with the trans group here in Duluth--I'll have a lot of people who are just starting their journey and they'll come to group and they'll be like, ""Well, I don't know,"" and whatever and it's like, ""Dude, you are trans enough to be you. You are enough. You don't want to have to have hormones, you don't have to medically transition. If that is who you are then that's who you are."" I decided that testosterone was for me, but still no interest in surgery, which is kind of an interesting concept for people because a lot of trans people that know me view me as some super macho dude, however my nickname is Daddy Twink Bear because there's a good mix of both!
SA: Did you come up with the gummy bear road? [laughs]
JD: I did not, that's all Maggie! [laughs] But it's hilarious. So, yeah, I came to a point where I was going to take steps I needed to take to transition or I couldn't see myself being on earth. I don't know if you know much about trans stats or anything, but forty-one percent of trans people attempt or complete suicide. That was a very real thing for me and the way I felt was very scary. Living in Duluth there is a population of eighty-six thousand people. For many years I didn't know or hadn't met anyone like me. Yeah, I felt really, really, really alone. I educated myself on the path I needed to take to start T, and so I was like okay I need to talk to a therapist, they write some kind of letter, then I see a doctor who looks at the therapists' letter that says I'm good enough for hormones. It didn't go well at first. I found a therapist and I remember walking into his office and he had his degree's on the wall and his name was very religious. I was like, ""Okay, that doesn't necessarily mean anything."" Then I take a bigger look around and there are crosses, and he was looking at me like I was an insect. What the fuck is happening. I was like, ""I don't give a fuck. I need that letter really bad."" So, he wants to talk to me, I lay out my whole story, and then he says, ""Well, thanks for sharing, but I don't do that. I don't do that."" You think he would have stopped me like fifteen minutes in and been like, ""I don't need to hear anymore. This is a waste of your time, this is a waste of my time."" I felt like he was super judgmental and then obviously couldn't help me and had no one to refer me to. So I was like, ""Cool, now I'm just stuck back at square one."" I let a couple more months go by because I felt discouraged, and just didn't know any resources or anyone. Then think I did some Googling, but there was a woman here and she had gotten her degree, I don't know much about college shit, she got her degree and had to do like supervised hours. She wanted to gain some experience writing letters for trans people. I saw her. I didn't really like her, but I was like, ""Alright, I have to jump through your hoops to get what I want."" I remember one day when I was seeing her--she had couches in her office--and I was sitting in the recliner with my feet up, but she was talking about my ex that I was with for five years, and she had asked if I would attempt to get her to come to a session because she thought that would be helpful for us to maybe have some peace or whatever. That made me really angry. So I was sitting up there with my feet and stuff, but I did get like loud, but I didn't move or anything, and she was like, ""You're acting aggressive,"" and I was like, ""Or I have feelings and you brought up a touchy subject and I'm going to get loud about it."" 
SA: She asked.
JD: Right, like don't fucking ask me things if you don't want--I'm not a robot. I'm going to react to stuff. Then I felt kind of icky about her because she was like, ""Testosterone can make you aggressive. I don't know if you're ready for that. She pretty much, I felt, was just waving my letter above my head, which was really hard. It was especially hard to see a cis person about this kind of stuff, and I still think that that's not something trans people should have to do. I have to go convince a cis person why I'm trans and have them diagnose me with being trans and have them decide that it's time for me to start T? Like bitch I know. I know myself. 
SA: And then tell you it's going to make you more aggressive. 
JD: Yeah, which actually I've been on T now for two years. I think that when I get angry I'm able to manage myself a lot better. I think that has a lot to do with just being happier as a person. Being able to be more present with myself. I got my letter, and I had to wait fucking ninety days until the endo had an opening. Even though you receive your letter they have to get a fax from the office. So I finally got this golden ticket, which is fucking worthless, and then they tell me ninety days. But then I had an appointment, took my first shot, and it's real fucking rad. There was a trans group that was kind of meeting that I heard about and so I guess this is before T, so I'm telling it a little backwards, whatever. I had an incident one day when I was really close to starting T before my coming out thing, and one of my ex-girlfriends was a TERF, or a trans exclusionary radical feminist, so I told her what was going on, and she was fucking horrible to me. Said some of the worst things I've heard in my life to this day. Then I decided that I wanted my ex that I was with for five years to come comfort me. I decided to--I was drinking because, you know, that's intelligent when you're angry [laughs]--and so she came and met me at the bar and she was sober and I was just drunk and belligerent and I made her bring me through Hardee's and I just acted a little crazy, I bought cheeseburgers, I whipped them around her car because I was angry and whatever. She kicked me out of her car. My phone was dead, and I just wanted to get from Superior [WI] to Duluth. I walk into this bar and I ask to use the phone and there's this female bartender and one guy sitting at the bar--pretty dead. So I walk in and I show her my phone and I was like, ""Hey, I have a phone but it's dead, I just really need to use the phone."" She looks at the dude, she looks at me, and she just kind of laughs. She comes over and slams the cordless down on the bar and she goes, ""It, or whatever, needs to use the phone."" So I grabbed the phone, you know, and I've already had a really emotional day, and so I use the phone to try to call my parents, they didn't answer, I go to make a second, local, free call, and she goes, ""I said you could make one call."" So I was like, whatever, I continued trying to use the phone, and I got off the phone and she just starts calling me and 'it' and she called me a 'cunt' and so I whipped my fucking barstool at her. I was drunk. It was probably the worst day of my life, one of them. Of course she called the cops, I was arrested for disorderly conduct, and I was booked for one night in Douglas County [WI] and then you get there and they aren't competent with trans issues, and so when it came to handing over the binder they assumed I was smuggling drugs, I must have this strange vest or something stuffed with cocaine was what they thought I had! [laughter] It just couldn't be a binder, and I was like, ""No, it's like a binder,"" and I broke it down for them and on my personal inventory list they wrote down 'binder question mark' and I was like, ""No, that's not a fucking question mark. Google this!"" They didn't know where to put me because they have zero experience with trans people, so I sat in a little cement room by myself the whole night, which was a good time. Fast forward, on T. So right after that jail experience I found this local trans group that was meeting, so I sat in a room of five trans women I had never met and just started crying about my jail experience or whatever, and then kind of connected with them, took the journey that I explained to you about T. And then that group kind of died off. There was one person running it, and it's fucking exhausting to be a community organizer and have so many people heavily relying on you and looking to you for everything, so I understand why she did that. So, me and a friend and a couple of other people--I guess he wasn't really a friend at that point. There were a couple of trans people in town that decided like, ""Hey, let's sit down and see what we can do."" And so that's when I met who is now one of my best friends, and we decided to revamp the group. It's now called Trans Plus. We have support group and work group. Work group is kind of like what can we do to change things on a local level, and, you know, advance our place in the world because not a whole lot of people care about our community. So we kind of revamped that and that's been going on for a couple of years now. We have, I don't know, anywhere from ten to thirty people attend group, which I never thought in my life I would ever know thirty trans people from Duluth. And now I, I don't know, I see a trans person just living their life every day and say, ""Hi,"" to them on the street. Some of my best friends are trans. My partner is trans. And so it's really a night and day difference to my world. 
I'll talk a little bit about my work stuff. So I initially started doing harm reduction work for Center City housing, and I worked at their San Marco location. So, it's a harm reduction facility for alcoholics who are actively using. Before San Marco existed in Duluth many of them were making frequent visits to hospital, jail, detox; it was costing a lot of money, and these people had no where to live. They were just going through this revolving door, which just wasn't helpful to our community, and to those people, you know, more importantly. So they opened San Marco and there are two sides: one is low-income housing side. Some of them drink, some of them don't. They don't require much care from the staff. They just kind of exist. And then the other side--I can't remember the exact number, I'd say somewhere around thirty. It's for people who are chronic alcoholics, so they are often drinking to the point of black out daily. There are just different ways we treat, you know--some people had to have alcohol plans, so maybe instead of a liter of vodka they got a pint of vodka daily and a six pack of beer, or something. But I felt really good about doing that kind of stuff because of their addiction they have nothing and no one. A lot of their families won't speak to them. While that's sad, you know, sometimes we have to suffer the consequences of our choices while we're using. So, they hadn't personally impacted me so I was able to be friendly and talk to them and be open to them. 
SA: What do you think got you started with harm reduction? Like walking in the door and knowing you wanted to work there?
JD: I guess because I like to live really authentically. I'm a trans guy who works at a needle exchange and lives in an artist coop. [laughs] And so I never like did the college thing because, yeah, money is cool and you need it to live, and whatever, but I'd much rather be rich in happiness than be rich in green pieces of paper. 
So I had worked at a group home with individuals who were mentally ill, chemically dependent, or both sometimes. I was onsite staff there, and I was just kind of sick of living where my, you know I had my own apartment, but I was kind of sick of living on sight. So I looked around and found out about San Marco, and then a friend of mine is the sight director there, and she has known me since I was eleven years old. She was actually my parent's case manager at some point. So she knew everything. She knew that I really got it. I really--having been in dark places, dark times in my life, I really want to do that kind of work because I know that those kind of people--nobody wakes up and decides, ""I'm going to be an alcoholic"" or ""I'm going to be a drug addict."" Those things are because of trauma and disconnection, and I really understand those things. So I wanted to not wear a suit and tie and be able to say, ""Fuck,"" at work if I wanted to say fuck. [laughs] And I wanted to be able to be useful to people, and really let them know that somebody was there that really understands it and doesn't judge them. I think I'm really good at making clients feel that. I'm often told, you know, ""You're easy to talk to. I feel comfortable talking to you. It feels like you get it."" Clients are going through things and they bring stuff up, you know, not to take away from their experience, but I'll minimally insert something about my life so they know, you know--in the winter we have clients who come in here and they are cold and they are like, ""My feet are wet."" We get sock donations from a thrift store down the block. And so I'm like, ""Hey, man. I've fucking slept outside. I fucking understand."" And we look through the socks and wet socks are the worst. Exactly. So, yeah I just wanted to live authentically and actually make a difference with people. 
And then I really liked my job there, but that's kind of where I went through my name transition. A lot of them were older, white, cis men, veterans, and those are not very open minded people. So I had a guy, he came up and whipped a Bible at my head and told me that's what I needed. Some of them threw all kinds of, you know, their booze bottles at me, or an open beer can so I'm covered in beer and trying to work. Some of them would come up to the desk and be like, well, you have these parts so that's what you are. Or Kyra, who was the site director there, ""Kyra says we are supposed to call you this now, but this is your ﻿real﻿ name.""
SA: Not a safe working environment.
JD: Right. And the staff at Center City were excellent to me. I have not a bad word to say about them. But, you know, kicking these clients out because they are treating me this way is not an option, or not what I wanted because they are the hardest people to house. And it just wasn't working. They just weren't getting it and I was not able to--I just couldn't do it anymore. 
So one guy came up one night and he was just especially awful to me. And instead of reacting to it because often times when clients go off I don't react to it. I'm just calm and cool and like, ""okay, whatever."" So he goes off on me and expects me to probably engage with him. And I ended up shutting--we had half doors and then top doors if shit go rowdy. So I pulled both the top doors and I sat down at the computer and I just took a deep breath, and I started writing my two week notice [laughs] And I was like this is recording. So I left there because of that. 
And I was looking around for jobs, and so I was browsing Craig's List and there was an ad that was like, I don't remember the exact language, but 'working with difficult populations, need to have a sense of humor, maybe some life experience, a degree preferred,' which was a turn off for me, and so I almost didn't apply for it. But I sent an email and I said, ""Hey, this is a little bit about me, blah blah,"" and I knew when I was looking at the article I was like this is some kind of harm reduction thing. They don't want you to know what they are because--they are just being really veiled about this ad. So I was like this is totally probably a syringe exchange for sure. So I emailed back and forth a bunch with Maggie [Kazel] and then we set up a time when I could come in. And she was working solo at that time, which I don't fucking know--she did that for six months. I work solo for like three days if she is on vacation and I'm like, ""I'm going to die.""
So we had set up the time for me to come in--
SA: Do you know what year this is about?
JD: This is early 2015. So yeah I came in and she had a couple of people in the lobby. She was busy doing other stuff, and I later found out she just wanted to see how I would interact on the fly, you know. 
SA: Wow. 
JD: Yeah! [laughs] I came in and she was like, ""Uh, go keep those folks busy."" Or whatever. And it was a group of young Native girls. They were obviously pretty high on what I assume--what I think is meth, actually, and they were just coloring and talking and having a good time. So I just--I don't really treat clients any differently than I treat my friends. I mean there's some shit I wouldn't tell them. But beyond that I just walked up to them and was like, ""How's it going man? What are you coloring? What are you doing today?"" Just making convo. So Maggie kind of saw me do that. So the ad said degree preferred, but I had almost ten years of experience working with mental illness and chemical dependency and harm reduction stuff, so I had some really solid letters of recommendation, and she saw me interact with those guys. I guess she had interviewed like ten people maybe, and I'm sure several of them had degrees. So, I don't know. She offered me the job and here I am. 
SA: Was your use ever to the point where you had to go to treatment?
JD: I did go to treatment as a youngin because they didn't know where to put me anymore. So I didn't really need treatment at that point in my life. It was just the place to put me. The state put me in a place because it was convenient. Which, funny enough, so I was seventeen when they did that to me. I was, I don't know, I think I left in like two weeks. I'm not trying to get up in the morning. I don't want to go to no fucking group that I don't need to go to. And I don't want your shitty breakfast. [laughs] No thanks, no thanks, no thanks. So they didn't really like me. And then so minors in treatment--but I shouldn't be smoking cigarettes, so they kicked me out for using tobacco as a minor on their grounds. How they kicked me out they were like you have a half hour to figure out how you are getting yourself--and it was from Cloquet to Duluth. I don't drive. [laughs] And so they were like you have thirty minutes to figure out a ride or a sheriff can come pick you up. I was like that sounds fucking terrible. So I ended up calling my ex that I was with for five years at the time and she was in high school. And at the time I obviously didn't sound like this, so I called her high school and talked to the secretary and I was like, ""Yeah this is her aunt so-and-so. There's a family emergency."" So they went and got her and I was like you better come pick me up right now or a cop is going to pick me up."" I don't know how she did it, but she made it from Superior to Cloquet in like twenty minutes. So that was rad. [laughs] But yeah, so that was an unnecessary adventure. But there were periods of time in my life where I was using a lot of opiates. I have experienced withdrawal. I have experienced just not liking who I was and what was going on in my life. I think a lot of that probably had to do with the crowd I was hanging out with too. I had a lot of friends who were IV using. I'm really thankful that I never did because I probably would not be sitting here because drugs are fun. They make you feel good. If I liked snorting pills or smoking them off tin foil or whatever I'm sure I would have loved injecting them. So I'm glad I didn't choose to do that because I would have been lost or dead. 
SA: Do you want to just go through what you do here? Or what a normal day looks like if there's such a thing as a normal day. [laughs]
JD: There's not! [laughs] That's a cute question. There is not a normal day. Every single day of my life is different, which I really appreciate. I have a lot of friends who do the same monotonous thing all day every day. That's just not for me. So what I do here is syringe exchange or syringe access. I do HIV testing. I do Hep C testing. I do Narcan training and give out Narcan kits. Really, I mean it's hard to describe what I do because I don't have any degrees in counseling or any degrees in anything, but I feel like daily I'm a counselor. I help people find housing. I don't know. I had a guy come in and he's pretty seriously ill and he needed three bucks for his co-pay. So I gave him three bucks for his co-pay. I really do just about anything that needs doing. Sometimes there will be a young mom in here. She's got her kid. Maggie is really good with the young mom's, so I'll babysit the little kids. They look at my piercings like holy shit this guy! I just try to interact. Yeah, so really a lot of everything. 
SA: Have you seen harm reduction change since you've been--you've been working with it for a long time. Through a lot of different places. 
JD: I think one of the main things is that people are becoming more aware of it. People are a lot more accepting of it, which I think is really necessary. One of the comparisons that Maggie likes to make that I really appreciate is sometimes when we do presentations we bring out a shot glass. We go, ""How many of you have used this in the mast month or the past six months?"" Most people raise their hands. Well, alcohol is a drug, and a shot glass is a way you administer the drug. It is a drug utensil. So why should we look at people who are using a different drug and they need a different utensil? We are all altering our state of mind just in a different way. So I think I'm seeing a lot of people coming around to that. Or people who have never heard of it and I explain it and they are cool with it. Just, ""Wow, I've never heard of that, but that's cool."" 
I guess when I first started doing this job I was talking to my grandparents about it and they were like, ""Wait, wait. So you're giving syringes full of heroin to people?"" And I was like, ""We do not have a budget like that!"" [laughs] Right, like--I mean supervised injection and all that shit is really rad, I wish we could do that. Maybe some day. But yeah, just taking them from a very ground level and being like, ""No, honey. No."" [laughs] 
I guess while I'm on this little tangent I'll talk about something that happened just recently. So I posted an article from December 2016 that was posted by NBC, so really mainstream--I find that sometimes when I post stuff like that on Facebook they are more receptive to it. However, I totally post cowgirls riding syringes that say ""fuck safe shoot clean"" so there's a little bit of everything in between there. But so the NBC article was 'overdoses now kill more Americans than car crashes.' I had, I don't know, twenty-seven comments on that status from people all over my life. One of which I was really surprised with. We used to work together. He is religious and he is now a police officer. He was like, ""How can I get Narcan? Do they sell it at CVS? I really want this."" And so I did not expect him to be open about it at all. There's a shit load of positive comments between he and I. And then at two in the morning this fucking idiot that I used to work with at San Marco, so he's done harm reduction with alcoholics, comments and says, ""Well why do we give a fuck if drug addicts overdose?"" Right. And there's been people in my life that I've told this story to recently and most of them are supportive. I'm part of an intersectional feminism group and I told them this story and it got a couple hundred likes and people were all over it. So anyways he comments ""Why do we give a fuck about drug addicts overdosing."" So, I won't use his name, but I said, ""You know,"" and I tagged him in the comment, ""I want to write this big long thing and break it down for you, but we fucking work together doing harm reduction for people using alcohol, so I don't understand why you don't get it."" Then last year, sometimes we'll browse Craig's List ads just kind of to--what's the fuck climate in Duluth? What are places we could target for testing? Or whatever. So I remembered last year I was browsing Craig's List and there was an ad titled 'tranny,' which is you know a horrible trans slur. So it kind of irritated me, but I was curious because Duluth is so small. I was like I kind of want to fuck with this person and get them to send me a face picture. So I played them and I got them to send me a face picture. Well it turns out it was the guy who commented 'why do we give a fuck about drug addicts.' So there's that back story. So, yeah, 'you should get it, we've done harm reduction work together, also I know for a fact that you're cheating on' and I tagged his girlfriend's name. They live together, they've been for four years. I said I'm too tired right now. It's three in the morning, but hey girl let me know if you want that screenshot tomorrow.' And I dug it up and I sent it to her and she broke up with him. So he could have just scrolled by, but his hate and his stigma for drug addicts was so strong that he felt the need at two in the morning to say why the fuck do we give a fuck about these human being dying!
SA: And differentiating them from alcoholics. 
JD: Right! And he is at the bar every single night. I would feel comfortable saying he's an alcoholic as well. So there was just something really satisfying about him trying say bullshit and I'm not terribly close to either of them, but I felt bad for his girlfriend ever since I have had that information, and it's a face picture of him with their dog. And so that's what I sent--and it had the title of his ad and whatever. And so he got that bomb dropped on his skull because he had to go be hateful for no reason. He could have kept scrolling and thought whatever thoughts he had to himself, and he still be in his relationship and everything would be find. [laughs] Karma rained on his skull! I've since been unfriended and blocked. But his ex-girlfriend is still my friend. So there's that.
SA: Any stories that you feel comfortable sharing about clients that have come in that have really affected you?
JD: I have so many fucking stories. One that always sticks out to me. Young guy, early twenties. He robbed a gas station and he stole a couple rolls of lottery tickets and cigarettes, whatever, and so he got caught and they just flew his fucking mug shot all over social media, all over the newspaper, just everywhere. He was booked. He was there for only a couple of days. So he gets out and he came in and I could tell he was just like looking at the floor like really embarrassed or whatever. So I just walked up to him and like playfully tapped his arm and I was like, ""What up, Mr. Famous. What's going on."" And it made him giggle. So he was able to kind of come out of his shell a little bit and he was able to ask for what he needed. And he overdosed and he died that weekend. I know that at the end of his life he was experiencing some really hard stuff. And to have him feel comfortable enough to walk in here and have that happen to him, and be able to kind of--
SA: You made his day. 
JD: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that felt really good. It's just so hard to think of like individual stories. One thing I guess I'll say though is I live like three blocks from the exchange here, and so people see me all over all the time. It's really cool because a lot of people are really comfortable  talking to me in public, and they talk to me like I'm their friend. I can walk down the street and say, ""Hey man, how's it going?"" And talk about the Wild game, talk about my dog, or whatever they did last night. 
Another thing that's been interesting working here is you know Duluth is small and I know a lot, a lot of people. I've had friends of mine come in here--people I've known, and one of them is just like--well one, came in, saw my face, turned around and walked out. Facebook messaged me and came back a few days later. Then another friend of mine came in and we just had a long discussion and I was able to hook her up with stuff and she was just really thankful that I didn't judge her. Obviously I would never speak to anybody about that. That's her business. She, you know, she probably thinks I saw I wouldn't judge you to her face because I'm trying to make her feel good or something but I'm sitting here talking to you and you don't fucking know her and I don't judge her at all. I'm happy she came in and talked to me and was comfortable coming in to get stuff and is using clean stuff. That's good. Like I said there're just so many clients. 
SA: Anything you wish you could do here and can't because you just don't get enough funding? Any way you'd like to see this move in the future?
JD: There're only two hundred and twenty exchanges in the country. I wish that there was more access for people who use drugs. I wish that there were more places like this so I could talk to people who do the work I do because that's one thing that's really hard about doing this work is, you know, I can talk to my partner about it. My partner has a really long title, I can't exactly remember it, but they're the GLBT director at the University of Minnesota Duluth. So I can talk to them, but what we do for a living is very different. My day has often started before I have my first sip of coffee with somebody coming and being like, ""I need Narcan. My friend died last night. I brought him back to life. Oh my god."" So I'm holding space for that person before--I'm not even awake. I don't have coffee with me. I just unlocked the door. I've barely got the lights on. So I can unpack that with my partner and they are fucking fantastic, you know, they are really kind and understanding and listen to me. But it would be a world of difference if I could call the harm reduction center in West Duluth and say, ""Hey, you know how this goes. Can we meet up for coffee sometime this evening and just unpack this."" Especially with client deaths or really traumatic client stuff. So I'm super grateful for Maggie. Yes, we are co-workers, but Maggie is my family. I call her mom-dad. That's my name for her. We are there for each other through a lot. We are able to talk to each other in a way that most people who work together can't just because of the intimate work that we do. So that's really valuable. 
SA: Is there any place like this anywhere nearby? 
JD: There is. It's across the bridge in Superior. They have a syringe exchange. It's AIDS Resource Center Wisconsin. There is one staff member that works at that location. And she also does HIV case management for positive clients in six northern Wisconsin counties. So she's almost never there. And then as with anybody in the world we all don't get along and whatever. I don't feel like her and I click. I would never call her and talk to her about anything. We see each other at World AIDS Day, and we see each other at Pride. We have our friendly small talk. I don't want to talk to her about my shit. No thanks. But it would be cool if there were people I felt comfortable talking to. And people that I could bounce stuff off of or whatever. Or just get their tips and tricks about this stuff because I've been doing this for a long time, but I'm not perfect. Harm reduction work is--you don't have much time to think. It's a lot of on the fly reacting. I have to be different with every person. Even tone and the way I say things. If some rowdy guys come in I have to be like, ""Hey guys, one at a time. You need to go back and sit there. You can come up it's your turn."" Whereas maybe the next minute I have a young, single mom come in and she's crying. So when she comes in maybe I'll go up there and offer her kid a coloring book. I'm kind of softer with her and I'm like, ""Hey, want to come up? What's going on today? You look upset. I've got some cookies. I've got some hot tea."" You know? So you really just have to know how to interact with people in different ways very quickly. And I can oftentimes have those interactions back to back. I really have to be mindful of myself, too because if I'm having a fucking shit day and someone comes in I need to be able to hold that space for them and put my own shit aside because the way I serve them could determine a lot about what they are going to do in that day. I need to be mindful that I just need to be a certain way sometimes. Which, you know, I often on the weekends like to drink beer, go hiking, play with my dog, be with my friends. I have to do the stuff I love. Being a native Duluthian I am always doing something in Lake Superior. I have already been kayaking this year, which was frigid. I went underneath the lift bridge in between the canal--in between the piers. A fucking big boat was coming out. A big thousand footer. I was with a friend I was like, ""Rachel I'm going to die!"" She was like, ""Just keep paddling, Dory. Just keep paddling."" So I wave my paddle in the air and I'm like, ""I hope you see me giant ship!"" Try not to tip and die in this current. The water was super cold. The surface temp right now is like thirty-seven degrees. And she--so my friend is tiny so all her life jackets are mediums, so I'm like it's on the kayak and I'll grab it, but I'm not wearing that! So, yeah. I definitely have to find ways to relax and just kind of decompress in my life, which I'm pretty excellent at given my own trauma. I know stuff that I've had to deal with and apply that. I've had to be a grown up for a lot longer than most people my age. 
SA: Do you see any difference between Minneapolis--the cities--versus up here in Duluth? Are you in contact with anyone down there?
JD: I've talked to some people who do similar stuff down there, but they're busy as fuck. We're busy as fuck. So we see each other at conferences or trainings, but I won't get a change to really know them. I don't really go to the cities that often. Everybody is like, ""Ooh, the cities!"" I go there for sports. I go there for concerts. I go there for work. But it's big. It's full of people. There's no grass. Where would my dog pee? So that's just--I really like being in the woods and being away from people. I don't really care to go there. 
SA: Anything else we didn't talk about that you want to bring up? Anything before we wrap up?
JD: It's been a log day. It's been a long week. So, I think--I probably said a lot. 
SA: A lot of great things. Thank you so much. 
JD: Yeah, thank you. "

Stephanie Devich—SD
Zachary Malett—ZM
ZM: I just need you to say your name and say you're okay being recorded.
SD: Sure. This is Stephanie Devich, and yes, I'm okay with being recorded.
ZM: So where Amy has historically started is just talking a little bit about you. A question she likes to start with is what was your childhood like?
SD: [laughs] My childhood. I grew up here in Minnesota. I grew up in Minnetonka. Only child. Parents were together, and no communication in my home. We just didn't talk about anything. So when I started using alcohol at the age of thirteen dad kept that hidden from mom when I got caught. 
ZM: At thirteen?
SD: Yeah, at thirteen. And he never said a word to her. He just cleaned up the vomit. [laughs] So I learned early on if mom doesn't find out think are okay, and how to keep a secret. From there it just, for me it was drug abuse after that. I went on to weed, pot, or LSD, PCP, mushrooms, and kind of continued on. I graduated from out here, but I was high on graduation day. [laughs] Yeah I was on PCP when I walked. So, yeah. My childhood, you know, no abuse. Some verbal abuse and such, but my family history on my mom's side definitely a lot of mental health and drug addiction problems. All on my mom's side. 
ZM: Where you aware of this when you started experimenting, or not?
SD: No. Saw it later on. I noticed it with my mother. I recognized it now that she had a problem with alcohol. Her mother definitely, and I know my aunt had prescription painkillers were her thing for many years. So she's part of the opiate problem. 
ZM: What happened after graduation?
SD: After graduation a few years later I moved to southern California. I had done some traveling to San Diego and decided after we had that Halloween blizzard. You're probably too young to know about that one. [laughs] But in like 1991 where we got hit with like a foot of snow and I decided to get the hell out of here so moved the day after Christmas that year and moved to San Diego, but all I did was bring my own stuff with me, for the most part, so it was just me bringing my problems and unhappiness along with me and started using methamphetamine out there. Got very much into using whatever was in front of me. It did not end well for me in California. [laughs] California I have six felony convictions from living out there. Sales charge, transportation of narcotics, went to prison for a couple years in California. Got out of prison June 30th, 2009. Moved back home on parole [unclear] in Minnesota. I was on parole here because they transferred me up here and California parole ninety days later I moved back out here. Got off parole after a year. Started using again. Crack cocaine was my thing. I tried heroin. Did opiates for a little while. It wasn't really my thing. I definitely liked the upper thing. Crack cocaine, needle abuse, like everything. I overdosed on cocaine. Died. Wound up in a hospital ICU for several days. Woke up in handcuffs. Went to prison from there. 
ZM: That was back here?
SD: That was back in California and then moved back up here. Then moved back out here shortly after I got out of prison. Did a couple of years in the prison system in California where they set you up to fail. Send you with two hundred dollars gate money when you get out of prison and nowhere to go. [laughs] As a drug addict and a drug dealer there's only, you know, I don't really have too many options of things to do. So, I tried to get out here as fast as possible and move back out here and started using about a year later again. And put myself in treatment. While I was in treatment I applied for school, and wanted to become a drug and alcohol counselor. [laughs] Figured who better! All based on a journal I had written in prison and I was reading it while I was in prison and one of my goals was to become a counselor and I thought, sure, why not? 
So since then I have my license in alcohol and drug counseling from Metro State. Bachelor's from there as well as a certified prevention professional, and have been working at Valhalla Place for two and a half years after working somewhere else a little bit. So I've been in the field going on four years now I think with internships and everything. 
ZM: Great. 
SD: Yeah. [laughs]
ZM: You've only been working for four years, but what do you see?
SD: What do I see? I guess where I really started to notice things in, you know, I saw this in California when I was living there because I was selling drugs out of a house holder. It was like a low-income kind of housing thing where a lot of people were getting medications. So they were trading their medications for cocaine. And so they would trade me oxycontin, things like that. And I would take that, trade them crack for it, and go and sell the opiate medications to somebody else that would go and sell them to rich, affluent housewives in [Loyola], California area which is pretty affluent. So I saw it back then and how it was really affecting people, but I saw more of the upper class people using it. Heroin wasn't really something I saw too much of. I used heroin for about a month when I lived in California because it was just what was out there for the time, but it was black tar back then. But I remember the friends I used with having to need it on a daily basis getting sick, and us having to drive around just to get ten dollars worth of heroin. And slapping people around. The old way of trying to reverse an overdose. Throwing them in my bathtub in cold water, and things like that. Trying to bring them back. And luckily that apparently worked. [laughs] Because it really doesn't. 
So I saw it out there, but I guess I started to see it more when I came into the field, and in my internships a few years back that more and more people were coming in for opiate use. For treatment. And I think that's when my harm reduction stance changed, because I went into treatment where it was like abstinence based. You go to NA, you go to AA. That's the only thing that's going to work for you and if you don't do those things you're going to die. That kind of stuff. Those were like the messages I heard from going to those meetings. And I stopped going because I didn't want to live in fear the rest of my life. I had lived in fear all my life as it is. And I just thought if this is what I have to do forever, and the other thing is like meditation and some of this other stuff isn't good enough. I don't want to do that. It didn't make sense to me. So I stopped the NA thing years ago and started implementing harm reduction in my own life. I drink alcohol. But I don't use drugs. I just can't use illicit drugs because I don't do them well, or I do them too well depending on how you want to look at it. [laughs] I've had enough of those. I'm still around luckily. 
But I think I saw in my internship like I said was that I had a lot of clients coming in that weren't willing, or weren't ready to stop using everything. And so I was referring people to places like Minnesota Alternatives, which is more of a harm reduction program. I don't know if you've heard about that. I heard of Minnesota Alternatives. I went to a conference out here called MAARCH [Minnesota Association of Resources for Recovery and Chemical Health] years ago early on in school. Paula DeSanto is the owner, former owner I believe of Minnesota Alternatives, which is like a harm reduction based program where they teach people how to lessen their use. Because if I don't want to quit drinking completely, but I want to learn how to drink three alcohol drinks a night, or whatever it is and be successful that's how they work instead of kicking them out of treatment because you haven't stopped. And so it had a lot of people coming in that just weren't ready to stop all drugs. And for me to set them up into my program or to an inpatient program knowing that they're going to need to use and they're just going to get kicked out made no sense to me. So I was referring outside of the company I worked for [laughs]. I was like it's not about my treatment; it's about their success. 
So I decided to look into a different realm, and wanted to do something that was more harm reduction and methadone was really interesting to me. I kept seeing like I said more and more clients coming in that had either been on methadone or were using heroin or prescription pain killers who had lost a ton of people in their lives based from overdose, and I just thought this is where I need to be. And came to Valhalla Place two and a half years ago now almost. What else do you want to know? What am I seeing now? 
ZM: Could you just describe more of what you do at Valhalla? And what Valhalla does?
SD: Absolutely. Valhalla is a medically assisted treatment program, so we provide methadone or Suboxone to patients that are opiate dependent for at least one year. So they have to have been abusing an opiate for a year prior to even being eligible for our program. 
ZM: Is that like regular—daily, weekly?
SD: You know, it depends on the person. So whether it was something they were maybe originally getting prescribed, and they're supposed to take three of them a day and now they're taking maybe six or eight or ten. But they're seeing withdrawal symptoms when they don't have them. Or if it was heroin on the streets. Things like that based on use, and not being able to use as prescribed. Or if it's illicit use and having withdrawal if they don't have their substance around. We can come in and help them with giving them methadone, Suboxone, which can eliminate the withdrawal and the cravings so they don't have to use those substances anymore. 
ZM: And the year cut-off—is that just an arbitrary line?
SD: Yeah. It's kind of a weird line that's drawn in the sand that, you know, now it's kind of hard because there are people that will call that are at eleven months, but they just don't qualify for the program. I believe that's federal. Like a federal guideline that there's this magical number that a year I have to have been abusing these things. Even though some people can do a lot of damage in six months. Especially now with what's out there. They just wouldn't be able to qualify for the medication. Their insurance won't, and they're not appropriate for treatment here, which sucks. 
ZM: Do you see people attempting to fabricate—
SD: Yes, oh absolutely. 
ZM: How do you tell?
SD: Absolutely. Every now and then we will see people who come in—because we do a screening process with everybody whether it's over the phone, or they physically come in here. A lot of times, especially in certain communities, the Native communities especially some of the reservations where they don't have treatment options. They really don't have the resources out there. We will sometimes see families trying to come in, or sending their family members here, and they go through the screening process and you can kind of tell they've been coached on what to say. But if you word things differently, and I've been trained enough to—and being a former...when every word that came out of my mouth was a lie in the past, I'm pretty good at seeing when people are not telling me entirely the truth, or don't know what to say. So I can word things a little bit differently. There have been times in the past where I've done a chemical health assessment on them first to just kind of get what they've been using, get some more information versus just the screening process of it. And they haven't been coached enough for that. So then I can see, you know, you're not going to qualify for our program. I think the bigger idea hopefully is that they're family or somebody is trying to get them in here so that maybe they can get the medication for another family that can't get here, or doesn't have the insurance, but for us to admit somebody that doesn't need this program, all we're doing is opening a door to something that's going to cause more harm. Especially if they're an opiate naive person or not, using opiates to start them on methadone or Suboxone is just going to...cause an addiction problem they didn't have. 
We do a little bit of things around that. For the most part I think people are calling because they know it works, and they don't want to do this anymore. We answer our phone here twenty-four hours a day. If the phone rings and somebody's trying to get in here on a Sunday night and they qualify for our program we'll try to get them in on Monday or Tuesday morning and get them their medication, and start them with counseling here. 
So, my job here is a counselor here. I am an LADC, licensed alcohol and drug counselor. I'm also a certified prevention professional through the Minnesota board out here as well. But I still created a new job a year and a half ago or so here, so I'm like the harm reduction specialist is my title [laughs]. Sort of that I made up. I saw a need in the community, not only in our facility, but outside of here where people weren't getting Naloxone. They didn't have the education; not understanding why medication assisted treatment is so beneficial for opiate addiction. Colleges, even the colleges I went to—we didn't talk about methadone or Suboxone. We didn't talk about harm reduction in school. It was like a five minute little thing. I see how beneficial it is right now especially with what's going on in the state. That there's a huge need for education out there, so I've spent my own free time educating myself as much as possible. Going to conferences, flying to San Diego last year for the harm reduction conference. Just trying to get as much information as there is on harm reduction services, be it there's more than just needle exchanges. I spend probably about forty percent of my time outside of my office doing Narcan trainings throughout the state. We are the largest provider of Naloxone in the state of Minnesota.
ZM: Valhalla?
SD: Yeah. We dispense, last year, over six thousand kits I believe. We provide Minnesota AIDS Project with their Narcan. Rural Action AIDS Network. I've been working with Little Earth, the Native American community over in South Minneapolis for about a year and a half now. I used to sneak in Narcan through people I knew lived there, and teaching them how to reverse an opiate overdose, but the tribe at the time wouldn't really let it happen. I couldn't actually go do a training for the community. We just kept sneaking it in because people were dropping like flies. They were overdosing daily over there and nobody was doing anything about it, and the community was begging for help. I've got friends who live there, I've got a lot of clients over there. I really have a great passion for the Native American community. So, over the past year or so I've probably donated four hundred, five hundred kits to Little Earth. Last year—reported to me, not 911 calls, because they don't call 911 too often—we had eighty-six opiate reversals. I only know of a few deaths over there so far. It has made a huge difference.
There're certain areas in Minnesota, especially the rural areas, but some of the poorer areas, where they don't have the services and no one is doing anything about it. And Little Earth is one of those places that I think just continues to get the short end of the stick because they don't have the resources. And they're a poorer community. They're all Section 8 GRH [group residential housing], so low-income housing. Just in the neighborhood the park is infested with needles. People are actively using and overdosing all over the place. It's just—something's got to give. So I try to give as much of my time to them as possible because nobody should have to die from this shit. 
ZM: Succinctly put. 
SD: Yes, yes.
ZM: I just had a follow-up about Valhalla. Who funds it?
SD: Minnesota is amazing. We are really lucky in this state because treatment is funded through most insurance companies. So, whether somebody is straight Medical Assistance and they don't even have a provider yet, if they're straight Medical Assistance whatever county they're in will pick up the tab. We fill out some paperwork, have them sign some stuff, I do a chemical health assessment on them, I shoot it over to whatever county they're in, and say hey, they need methadone or Suboxone, will you pay for it? And they'll sign off on it. The counties will pay for it. If they do have state insurance, say Medica or Blue Care through the state based on low income that will pay for it. If they're private insured most times that pays for it. Sometimes there's co-pays. And every now and then you get people that don't have an insurance even though we're supposed to and they'll pay out of pocket. But if they're low-income or no-income we cannot take their money. We have to fill out the forms and do the stuff to make sure their county will pay for it. We can't legally take somebody's money that doesn't have the capabilities. It's like twenty-two thousand dollars a year, which—
ZM: And I'm assuming anyone working here wouldn't—even if it wasn't a requirement. 
SD: No. So we just kind of go through the rigmarole to get them whatever coverage they need to get the methadone or Suboxone. Methadone for sure will be covered by all providers. Suboxone—it just depends because it's more expensive. And so then the county won't pay for it. [laughs] Yeah. So, there are certain barriers. Like especially Hennepin County, that's the county we're in, the largest county in Minnesota, and they will not pick up the tab for Suboxone. 
ZM: What's the price?
SD: Methadone costs about eighteen dollars a day. Suboxone is twenty-six. Nine dollar difference, or so. But if you figure on how many people are currently in treatment, and maybe how many people they're funding—thousands and thousands of dollars. You know? Residential treatment program, thirty days—if people are sending people to there they're shelling out eight grand a month. Year's worth of dosing. If they're paying for that for a year or even six months you're looking at three, four, five, six thousand dollars. You times that by however many are in treatment. In our clinic alone I think we have about eleven hundred clients just in this clinic alone active dosing right now. Valhalla is the largest provider of medicated assisted treatment in the state of Minnesota. And there are seventeen programs in Minnesota. We have currently now four. We were recently merged with Meridian Behavior Health. So Alliance was another methadone clinic that's now ours. And then Pinnacle up in Brainerd is now ours as well. So they're all turning into Valhalla's. 
Valhalla is—I'll give you a background of Valhalla's because the story is awesome. [laughs] Valhalla is Norse mythology, but it's basically the fight between good and evil. Our former owner was a patient on methadone at another clinic. He was a business owner, had a tremendous amount of finances and things, and just didn't like how he was treated at the other clinic that he was at. So he had missed an appointment with his business partner and he was supposed to fly out to Arizona and was late for their meeting. When he got there she was like, ""This is baloney. We can't keep doing this. This is a hassle. What do you want to do?"" He said, ""I want to open my own clinic."" And so that's how we were built. We were built on somebody that gets addiction because they've been there. Understands methadone, and had an opiate problem, which I think makes us different than a lot of other places because we're really about the client. We're about the people, the person. 
ZM: If you could in more detail describe your experience in treatment versus the treatment at Valhalla. 
SD: I think—my experience as a client in the past? I've gone to treatment in California on a couple of occasions. I think three maybe? Three or four out there. My experience out there was that I was the same as everybody else. We all did the same stuff. Nobody asked me questions about my history, or maybe trauma, abuse, things that I had been through. It was cookie-cutter treatment. We were all the same. We all did step one, two, and three. It was a lot of abstinence-based for sure. 
ZM: Was it like Minnesota Model, twelve-step?
SD: Minnesota Model for sure. Absolutely. But, they throw around words now and you hear 'client-centered' or 'client focused' or whatever it is, and that wasn't really the case. We were all the same. So I never got treatment that was catered to what I needed. I got treatment that was catered to what people thought I needed. And they thought I needed the same treatment as the next guy right next to me. And that doesn't make sense because we've all got our own story. And the same expectation that I've got to quit everything right now. That's a lot of pressure because if I look at it and I had had a magic medication to get me off of crack cocaine because there's minimal physical, a lot of mental that came with it, but I still got to smoke some weed along side of it I might have been like, okay, I can do that. I can do one. But that wasn't an option. You get kicked out. You use and they kick you out to the curb. And what else am I going to do? I'm going to go to the same thing I've always done. I'm going to pick up again and continue to use. 
My experience out here I think was a little bit different, but I think it was because I was different. And I think I was ready to do something different. I realized where the ball had been missed in the past and went and like [unclear] and said, this is what I need. And told them the things that I had been through because I knew those were certain things that I know if I didn't work on I would get help on them and really put forth a different effort. Although, the programs I went to were still Minnesota Model for the most part. 
ZM: Right, so it required a change in your attitude.
SD: I think so. I think a lot of it was because I was ready. I don't think necessarily that a person has to—I think that people can still be successful if they're per say mandated to treatment because it's jail or probation that's making them go. I mean the choice is still theirs because unless they're in a locked facility they can walk out. There's still, even back then on probation you're required to go to treatment pretty much every time. It's not that I didn't learn anything. I still remember some of the things I learned. I just probably wasn't there at that time, but I didn't feel like an individual. I just felt like a number. And being from the prison system I didn't really need to be another number. I'm cool on that. 
ZM: Right, so that was mandated out in the state of California?
SD: Yeah. 
ZM: Something that I'm currently interested in and researching is just were those costs borne by the state of California?
SD: Yeah, California paid for those things there. They have something called Prop 36, which funds for treatment and it comes with like the criminal justice system somehow gets it out of that. [laughs] So those were all paid for.
ZM: Were those treatment courts?
SD: I did not do drug court. Drug court out there is different than drug court in Minnesota. Drug court out there you're mandated to. They choose you to go to drug court. Drug court in Minnesota—you choose to go to drug court. I sat in courts at times in California when I was waiting to go to probation and out there is was extremely shaming if you had came in a couple minutes late to court you were handcuffed immediately. You were arrested if you'd missed dates. If you used you were incarcerated for thirty days. When I've sat in on drug courts and worked with my clients even on drug courts out here it is so uplifting and supportive where the clients choose to be in this program. For one, they know how long the program it is, so they say, yeah, I want to do this. Even if they pick up, they use, they relapse, whatever it is they don't get kicked out. They don't get arrested. They continue to work with the team of the people they have. They are like, what did you miss? What do you need? When they graduated I've seen the judges come out from behind their chambers and give them tokens and certificates and hug them and treat them like they're real people. You don't see that super disconnect and that power differential out here as you did in California. It's just something that if I had a choice between that and Minnesota I might have been more successful a lot faster. 
ZM: So in Minnesota it's not contingent on sobriety?
SD: Not necessarily. Yes, they want you to be sober, but you're not necessarily going to go back to jail. 
ZM: Right. My understanding of treatment court was if you break sobriety you're incarcerated.
SD: No. If you continue, yes. But out here they will work with you on certain things. Maybe you need to do treatment. Maybe outpatient isn't enough so they'll continue to monitor these things and what's going on with you. Then they earn phases and things like that. Then I believe at the end of their time their record is expunged. Which is great. [laughs] If you've got some charges on you like I do that would be great to have that stuff disappear. It's really empowering here in like how the clientele moves up. In certain phases they have to write a letter on why they think they've earned that phase increase for drug court and why they shouldn't have to come to court as often or whatever the phase increase stipulates. Yeah, out here it's just completely different. It's about the person. Everybody's different, and I think that we've missed the mark, especially the Minnesota Model. I think that they've just thought that everybody is the same, and addiction is all the same, and it's really not. There's some brain chemistry and science behind it and genetics and things like that, but the stuff we go through in active addiction isn't the same as what the next person went through. Even if our story is exactly the same how I perceive it and how somebody else does can be two totally different things. 
I think we've missed out on specializing on certain things and having more involvement when it comes to trauma, and being more open to even the THC thing. If you smoke weed you get kicked out. I think we need to be more open minded, and that's why Valhalla I think it completely different. Even if you're still actively using you don't necessarily get kicked out of here. We'll work with you. We've got a 'it depends' model. [laughs] There's a lot of 'it depends' here. Ideally we ask for one source of opiate, so that means us. If you're choosing to get your medication from us that means you cannot be picking up prescriptions from another provider. So we will check to make sure. We'll run their names in a prescription monitoring program [PMP] to make sure they're not picking up opiates from a provider. Things like that. 
ZM: Is that a statewide network?
SD: Prescription monitoring is actually a program that actually is all over the United States. Anybody can use it. Anybody can run a PMP on somebody. Any provider. You need to have some credentials. But any doctor, any prescriber can run somebody's name to see if they've been picking up prescriptions or whatever it is. 
ZM: That was post oxycontin bullshit?
SD: Yes. So now a lot of states are mandating that if they are going to write a prescription for an opiate that they run a PMP on somebody. Minnesota does not have that. It is still an option. We do it anyway. But the average prescriber doesn't necessarily do that and then we have a lot of shoddy prescribers out here. 
ZM: Still?
SD: There are still some out there, yeah, absolutely. There are some names that we see and we're like, oh we cringe when we see they are picking up a prescription from somebody. Some of the pain clinics, some of the prescribers out there still definitely need to the DEA pay them a visit sometime in the near future. The difference with us is that we don't necessarily kick you out based on elicit use. If the opiate thing still isn't working maybe we'll refer you to a higher level of care, which could mean outpatient on top of working with us here going to like groups. We have an outpatient they would attend for like three times a week for nine hours total. If that's not working maybe we do look at residential treatment, but that doesn't mean you stop here. You still work with us. You still get your medications.
ZM: This is medication and some counseling at Valhalla?
SD: Yes. So, federally, methadone clinics are required to do counseling. It's not just what I've been called, a legal drug dealer. They think the clients just come in here and get their medications, walk out, and there's no treatment involved. They are required for the first fourteen weeks to meet with their counselor for at least fifty minutes a week. We do a creative treatment plan with them, we do a chemical health assessment, or a Rule 25, on them just to get a baseline and see where they're at. If funding were to drop we have that done. We can shoot that off to the county. And then we update them yearly to kind of see where they're at and where changes have been made. 
After the first ten to fourteen weeks they're required by the federal law to meet with us for at least one time a month for fifty minutes. If they are willing to do that, then yes, you can earn a spot up in here as long as you qualify in the other areas, too. You have to have counseling with it. There's a reason why we use. There's a lot more to it than that. We do provide the counseling and there're groups and a lot of other things here that they can get. Mental health services, and such, as well from us if they want to do that. 
We don't freak on THC. For us, clients can continue to smoke their pot. 
ZM: Does it even come in any kind of chemical analysis?
SD: We do do drug screens on them, and it will show on that. Obviously if the county is picking up for the treatment costs here sometimes they have a problem with it. If the THC use is not interfering with their life—I think sometimes the county people that maybe don't spend a day in a clinic such as this don't realize that for us—most of these clients aren't sitting smoking bongs everyday, and I think a lot of times that's they're perception. Somebody that may have THC in their system. But for us I see a client that may have walked in here on day one with a two gram a day IV use habit of heroin that six months later maybe has used twice. But, that's a huge success, but they've smoked pot the entire time. So, when you're looking at drug screens a lot of times across the board that's a failure. For us that's a huge success. You're not going to overdose on that. There's no 'harm'. The risk over harm is so much lesser that many of my treatment plans say I'll smoke more weed instead of shoot heroin. Cool. Smoke all the weed you want. My friends smoke pot and own businesses, and they're able to function and do their job everyday. If that's the lesser of the risk, if that's the worst thing someone's doing, smoke the fricken weed. If it's unmanageable then we discuss it. I have some clients that realize it has become a problem. Great, then let's look at stopping your weed. Let's stop the THC use as well. 
There's a lot of other drugs we see as well. The amphetamine use has made a huge comeback recently. A lot of that I think is due to the strength of the opiates out there. The reports I get from a lot of my clients is they hate how high the high is because of the fentanyl that's in there. They're like, I want to be high. I want to be well. I want to be high, but I don't want to be falling out high. So, then I use some meth because it kind of evens me out and gets them a little bit more leveled out on that end. You know, the opiates that we are seeing out there—it's insane. The stuff that I'm seeing, that I'm hearing, the education I'm doing with the carfentanyl now being out there. I saw that coming last year. I knew that was going to hit us eventually. Ohio had two hundred and some odd overdoses in a small amount of time. So I've been talking about carfentanyl with my clients and the education that I do outside of here since August of last year waiting for it to hit us. First of all it was cheap. You could get it for two thousand dollars from China and send it over here. When it wasn't classified it was super easy. I'm a former drug dealer, so I would have been all on board if I could have gotten crack really cheap from somewhere else sent to me. It would have been an easy deal. 
But the potency of the stuff that's out there right now, and I saw a carfentanyl overdose December of last year because it took eight shots of Narcan to revive somebody. Luckily when it happens in front of me and I have as much Narcan as I want I'm able to save somebody's life. But the average person is going to have one kit with two doses. By the time 911 gets there and they've got maybe two nasal things there the chances of them surviving still are slim to none. They're not going to be able to do that. This kid, you know, with the amount of shots I put in him plus the EMTs coming along he never should have survived. He never should have survived, and there's no doubt in my mind it was carfentanyl. And the five we've had this year I knew two out of the five people. And now we're waiting on five more pending that we're hearing that probably is. 
I know when it comes to this epidemic, and I use that term loosely, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better. I hate to say that. I would love to say this year things are going to get better because we're paying more attention, and because we have more access to Naloxone and things like that. The reality is the drug is too fricken potent out there right now. It doesn't matter how much Naloxone I walk around with. If there's carfentanyl in it, or the amount of fentanyl in there, or noscapine that's now in the stuff. There's too many fricken types of opiates that people are getting their hands on. Noscapine is called C3. It is normally used for cancer patients after chemo for a pain reliever. But it has hit Hennepin County in December. Last year Hennepin County put out a little blip that it was out there. December 2016. So, that was being sold as heroin. The prescription painkillers are being sprayed with liquid fentanyl. We had the liquid fentanyl bust in November of last year. 
Nothing is getting any better. We are taking notice because this epidemic—because a lot of more rich, affluent, white people are dying from this disease. It's become a more noticeable problem because people are speaking out. I think that people are speaking out or people are potentially being more heard because a lot of times who they are. Families from Little Earth are losing handfuls and handfuls of their loved ones in that community. No one has been listening to them for years about what's going on. But, if I speak out and I live in Edina, suddenly I get heard. As long as people are hearing something and saying something now and we're doing something I'm all for it, but I think we could have done something about this a long time ago. 
I've watched it just escalate. The numbers are skyrocketing. The amount of deaths that I hear about on a daily basis from the clients that I work with—it's unbelievable. The numbers that we have for here aren't true numbers of how many people have died. Because not everybody first of all are going to do tox screens on everybody. We don't know how many people are truly dying from the opiate itself. They look at complications in other things. I think our numbers, and I don't even have the totals yet for 2017, but I'm guessing in the seven hundred for Minnesota statewide. For Hennepin County one hundred and fifty three. It went up to thirty-nine percent from 2015. 
ZM: I noticed that when I was driving up here there was a billboard. 
SD: Yes. No Overdose Hennepin County. So, I'm working with the sheriff's department. Hennepin County decided to do something this year to do kind of a no overdose thing and do as much education as possible. 
ZM: This is paired with mandating EMTs and firefighters carry Naloxone?
SD: It is kind of paired with that, and then just doing as much—right now what I'm seeing is that the billboards are out there, we're doing monthly meetings where a lot of providers and people such as me and parents of people that have lost their loved ones, police departments showing up with what we're doing, but I think everyone's afraid finally. They should be because for the longest time it's been this whole NIMBY thing, not in my back yard, that if it doesn't affect me, it doesn't affect me. But it does. We are losing everybody. Every time you turn around it's another person. I've lost too many fricken clients. We've lost too many here, and the reality is we've lost way less here as a clinic than my clients have lost with people that are not currently here, and that should be maybe in treatment. But I think that because they're getting the treatment services and things like that and they have access to Naloxone with us, all those kind of things, and they are very much educated by the staff here, and the use obviously isn't as big as a problem as if you weren’t here, but I think that we're still missing the mark. 
ZM: Is there protocol for Naloxone distribution for clients? 
SD: For us to give to clients?
ZM: Is that allowed?
SD: It is allowed! So, if you are any sort of treatment provider, treatment program you can administer Naloxone as part of Steve's Law. There are some kinds of stipulations that you fill out some little form and it's written in you variance in your program thing saying, we can administer Naloxone in my residential treatment program so they have it. I go and do a training. They fill out this little form. That way they don't get a fine for—the reality is if they get a hundred dollar fine versus somebody dead I'd rather pay the fine. There are stipulations that other programs have to do in order to administer Naloxone. For us we have a variance because we have prescribers. We have a doctor that prescribes a medication, it is basically a [unclear] medication in here. Because Naloxone is now available anywhere, any pharmacy, over the counter. Any pharmacy. It used to only be CVS pharmacies. I don't know. They are the only ones that kind of have an open mind. [laughs] I don't know! They were the only ones that were willing to test the waters even though not that many of them had it. You would have to call and make sure and then explain to them what it was half the time. Shit show. But now any pharmacy in the state of Minnesota can give out Naloxone. They just have to have a prescriber. If they don't have one they can use the medical fricken—the main medical guy for Minnesota. Whatever it is. 
But for us because we have a standing [unclear] medication our doctor prescribes it. All we have to do is train the client. Train the trainer kind of thing. I train the client on how to reverse an overdose. I fill out a little bit of a form. I don't really get much information I just want demographics on where it's going. The year they were born, culture. I want to see where it's going. I want to know where it's going and then I want to know if you used it I want you to come back and tell me. I want to know how fast it worked. The more and more I know it was successful the more and more I can get it out there. 
We dispense a huge amount. This year alone, what is it May 1st now? I've dispensed probably thirteen, fourteen hundred kits so far this year. Yeah. Huge amount of them come out of here. Clients know that I am the self-proclaimed Narcan queen. [laughs] Narcan girl in the community. 
ZM: Still the drug dealer!
SD: [laughs] That's right. I'm dealing drugs on a different level now, though. A completely different level, which is funny because on Sunday I met a friend of mine the last place I ever used at. I met him at Cub Foods. What he was bringing me was the auto injectors for Naloxone because they're expired and I give them out to some other people that are out on the street. Because they still—
ZM: Is that like through your position at Valhalla, or do you just do that to do that? Training and stuff. 
SD: It's now my job. It is now part of my job. But before it was something that I just started doing almost a year and a half ago. A year and a half ago I had my first client overdose. 
ZM: And you were like, I don't want to do that again?
SD: Yeah. I sat here until eight-thirty at night. We leave at two o'clock in the afternoon. I was here until eight-thirty at night waiting for his family to call me and tell me if he was alive or not. I couldn't go home until I knew what I was coming into the next day, or if I needed a day off, honestly. I couldn't leave. I thought to myself, if I'm feeling like this and this is my client I can't imagine what a family member, or somebody that really knows somebody personally on a different level than I do—even though I probably know more about my client than their family does quite often—but how it affected me feeling and waiting to find out if they were okay or not that nobody should fricken have to feel like that. So I started to go just kind of haywire with the Narcan thing. 
ZM: How did you transition that into a part of your job?
SD: A lot of it was with Little Earth. I went a did a training with them finally. I'd snuck it in a few times, and did a big training for the community there. Then started doing some education at the colleges. MCTC, and Century College. Got some of my professors talking about medically assisted treatment. By word of mouth people started hearing my name. It turned into a bigger, way bigger than I expected. My caseload got dropped because this is part of my job now. 
I was just kind of doing it on my own time. I had a full caseload. On Sunday's or at three o'clock in the afternoon, or if it was in the middle of the day I would schedule my work around it, and I would just do whatever it took to make sure I got this stuff out there. I was just like this is it. I found my niche. And then talked to, you know, our bigger bosses and things like that. Chuck Hilger, who is one of my bosses here and the VP of our program here. He knew what I was doing. He gave me—he pointed Amy in my direction! It was something that I just—we were missing it. Where else do you get Narcan from? The average person is not walking into a fucking CVS pharmacy and saying, ""Can I get Narcan?"" Because first, I'm going to be judged. Do I have to give you my name? Am I going to have to pay for it? An active user sure as hell isn't going to go and get Narcan from a pharmacy. They're not going there to get their needles anymore because they usually don't give them to them. So, why would they go. 
I just started doing as much with the clients and the staff here and just, yeah. Word of mouth. I've trained from here to Kenyon police department, which I didn't even know the town of Kenyon existed. Very small, like a thousand people. I went and trained their narcotics unit, the police department, and the first responders, but the first people to respond in a small town like that are the police. So, they all have our Naloxones. I've been to Kenyon, I've trained as many treatment programs as possible. Meridian did not have Narcan at all in their patient residential sites open until I came along. I was like, ""This is bullshit. If we're going to work together you guys have to have that."" I've trained all their staff, all their nursing, all their residential programs have that. 
ZM: Are they an abstinence based sobriety—
SD: They're abstinence based, absolutely. But that doesn't mean people don't die. So, I was like, you know, we still should have that. And have been educating more about harm reduction and methadone. I was at RCCS—restoration, counseling, and community services I think it is—last week doing Narcan training with them. MAT, methadone assisted treatment 101, kind of education with them. Anybody that's interested. I do EMTs, I do Save-A-Life Corporation, which is like first responder classes a couple times a month. I just come in, spend thirty minutes doing Narcan training, talk about opiates, and get out. [laughs]
A lot of it originally was volunteering. It's like I said no one—to start my day off is checking to see how many of my clients didn't dose the day before. And if they're not normally people that miss days in a row, if I notice that they've been gone two or three days and that's not their normal m/o I start looking through the jails to see if they've been arrested. And then I look at obituaries. And the fact that my day starts at 5:30 in the morning with me looking at obituaries to see if I recognize any names is bullshit. That shouldn't be my job. That shouldn't be anybody's normal day. It just really, really shouldn't. Until we do something and really address the problem and fill the gap and talk about this stuff it's not going to matter. We're not going to make a difference. We haven't talked about it. We ignore it. We ignore drug addiction. There's so much fucking stigma that comes along with that. 
ZM: Especially with something that's so prevalent. 
SD: Yeah. Addiction is not going anywhere. Hasn't gone anywhere in forever. It's not going anywhere now so why should I have to be anonymous? And why should I be shamed because I'm on methadone or Suboxone if I go to a twelve-step meeting? Why can't I say that I'm using this as a tool along with treatment. 
ZM: Is that not accepted?
SD: Not so much. Depends on the group, but they quite often get shamed and told that they're not clean. We try not to use words like clean and dirty here because if I'm clean that means at one point I was dirty. As a person that's been in active addiction and has shamed themselves to death nothing you say can do any worse than what I'm telling myself all day long. So I don't need that from people that are supporting me. You can't tell me how to recover. The only way to not recover is to die. It doesn't matter. I don't fucking care how you recover if it's a light bulb and some methadone and a plant is going to work for you then do it. I don't care. Or if smoking pot is going to do it for you, or if the risk is going to be less than the IV use and I'm going to start smoking it, and then hopefully maybe I slow down and I go a different direction and I add methadone into the mix or IV treatment, or it's Teen Challenge. I don't care. I don't care. But I think that we've told everybody that there's one way to do things and that's the only way to do it. The reality is that's bullshit. We have extremely high success rates. Medication assisted treatment is extremely successful for long-term use. Most people need to be on methadone or Suboxone for at least a year. Anywhere from 365 to 442 days is the research I've done. But it took you a year to qualify for this program, it's going to take you probably about a year to get your life together. 
ZM: Is that the average length you see?
SD: It all depends on the person. Some people are here for a year, year and a half, a couple years. Then they are kind of ready to titrate or taper off of the medication and go on their merry little way. Some people have no intention of ever leaving and that's okay. And some people don't know, they say they're not quite done yet, and decide to back out for a little while, and then they come back. And we always just hope they make it back. We have a lot of clients that readmit to our program over and over again. And shit, I'm just thrilled when they walk back in the door and they know they made it because a lot of them aren't. 
We need to do something different out here. I think education is a huge part of it. Educating and being honest. I think the education piece needs to be done by people who get it. People who have been active users—even the ones that are actively using. People who are maybe on methadone and are doing well. People who maybe still are actively using. And then the families. By people who get dirty and see it. Because the suits, and society, or people that maybe trained in certain things but don't see it all the time. I think we ignore a lot of stuff. I think we've been ignoring it for a long time. Even the fucking war on drugs. That worked out real well. [laughs] ""Just say no."" I'm a product of ""Just say no."" It didn't work. What that did was gave people the idea that you had a choice. 
ZM: I also think it was a race thing. 
SD: Absolutely. It didn't work. And, ""If you just say no you'll be okay."" But if you say yes then you're weak because you had a choice to say no. And that's what it freaking put on everybody because society still sees a thing, ""Why can't you just quit?"" Why would you need another medication? Just stop. It doesn't fricken work. Having to explain that to my father years ago, you know, when you said you were going to quit smoking and then by six a.m. you're at the Holiday gas station buying another pack of cigarettes—that's how I am with crack cocaine. I can't not stop it. And so if, you know, for him to try to quit smoking you guys have one of those little inhaler things—that's my methadone. He was like, oh, this is like my methadone. I was like exactly! That's harm reduction. That's less harm and you're weaning yourself. However you've got to do it I don't care. It absolutely works. 
I think we need more access to treatment. I think that we need programs—for the opiate piece—we need programs that accept everybody no matter what medication they're taking including methadone and Suboxone because not everybody does. And I don't think it's fair that you can make a deciding factor on what somebody is taking for their medication because you're going to take them if they're taking lithium or gabapentin and those are abused drugs. They can cause sedation, they can cause a combination of things if you take them with other fricken medications. So who are you to say we can't take them because they're on methadone. We'll take them on methadone, but they have to be on sixty milligrams or less. Well who the fuck are you to say what that person's magical dose is? Because you don't know anything about them. I think you should leave it up to the experts such as us and our doctors and things here to make that decision before you say they can't come to our program. Because then again you're outed and there's that shame and that stigma of, well, I'm not good enough to go to that program. Only a couple of them will take me. No sober living's will take me. It's just not fair. We're alienating a huge population of people that the most amazing people I've ever met in my entire life that don't have a fricken fighting chance because we won't allow them to based on judgment and a lack of education. There's my soap box. 
ZM: That ties in nicely to where I wanted to go. Do you have any other policy changes that you would like to see in an ideal world where Steph was in charge?
SD: In an ideal world where I was in charge I'd get a raise! Then I think that naloxone should be with every first responder, police included, because quite often they are first to the scene and not every police department carries them. I'm speaking Minnesota only—we should be able to open the doors to anything. Continue to educate each other. This should be in the school systems. We should be educating clinicians going into the field. I think that the doctors and the medical field needs to be educated on what's going on out there. I don't think they really have a clue, and when another person comes in on an overdose there should be a referral process going through. There isn't one. You're usually in there for about three hours and then you get discharged. 
It depends on the program, the facility. North Memorial starting the eighth of this month will be giving out an optional Narcan kit to anybody that comes in on an overdose. That comes with some referral information and stuff like that. So, they're finally getting it. But even talking to the providers there in the emergency department: why are we giving them needles? Is the response. So, there's always this stigma and lack of education. We're like, well, this would be partially cost, but this is the reason because dead people don't recover. That's my short answer for you, but why would we not? Because this could be your kid. 
I think that the problem is not enough of us have been affected. And that's shitty that we all have to fricken have lost somebody or see somebody struggle in order for this to be a big deal. Because we just don't know. I think that we need to—Minnesota being the land of ten thousand treatments we have a million and one treatment programs that anyone could get into, but I think Narcan should be on site at every single one of them, they should be opening the doors to anyone on medication assisted treatment, I think our detox processes of people are going to straight detox and doing a detox program instead of doing MAT or anything like that—it's scary. I think having to wait to get in is a huge barrier because if I'm going to have to wait two weeks to get into freaking detox? I'm not going! Forget it. And the perception of addiction that I need it right now—that's why we answer the phone all the time—is that you don't care. Well, they didn't answer the phone and they only answer Monday through Friday from eight to four. Well, two weeks from now? That person might be dead two days from now. So the urgency and trying to just get people straight through. And that's part of the policy piece here. A straight shot from that phone call they make that maybe there is a bed waiting in a detox and maybe then we give them that option to do you want to start on Suboxone or methadone? Is that something that interests you? Get them started on that because the withdrawal while waiting to get into treatment you're not going to stay. You're going to walk out in two days if you last that long. So from that getting them set up and somewhat stable, or at least somewhat comfy for a few hours out of the day, and then going from there to any treatment program if that's something they need. But having everyone's doors open and the problem is there's always going to be a waiting list for treatment because there's too many clients and not enough programs no matter how many we have out here there's always going to be a wait list, and then there's going to be the ones people want to go to or are referred to more often than others. 
For us for the opiate piece there are certain areas—no one's going to take anybody that's in withdrawal. We have to figure out, you know, we're referring people to treatment there's dimension one, which is all about withdrawal. And if they're at too high of a number they're not going to take them. You've got to go to the hospital first. Well, great. I've missed my bed. No one's going to hold a bed for you because they're going to put the next body in there. So, we're just missing a lot in order to do so. I think we all have to act like I guess the AIDS crisis, which you know took us forever to fucking recognize too. 
ZM: At least the nomenclature of epidemic harkens back to that sort of level of—also level of ineptness to deal with it currently. Just to sort of sum up it sounds like you're recommending an integration of harm reduction into the already prevalent Minnesota Model, twelve-step in-patient as well as on-site withdrawal? Maybe?
SD: Maybe. If they could figure something out like that that would be great. If somebody was willing to do that. At least always having special beds available in like St. Joe's or Fairview for people that don't want to get on medication assisted treatment. Yeah, something to that effect. Or if they're going from one treatment to another, especially for the overdoses, if someone overdoses there should be an automatic phone call. Let's make a phone call to this place. Or at least, you know, here's a card. Call these people. It doesn't have to be Valhalla. This isn't a plug for us, but you can't just have somebody come in from a near death experience and say, alright see you later. Nothing. Even quite often when people overdose they don't know or remember what's happened, but the family knows what's happened. We see it. We're affected by it. Society as a whole has a huge fucking ripple effect. So then why aren't we doing something?
ZM: Aren't there similar requirements for suicide attempts and things like that?
SD: There are some, yeah. Similar things. You hold them for seventy-two hours or ten days depending on the situation. If there's going to be some serious medical problems coming along with it then why aren't we holding them for ten days? And then we go from there to the next thing and setting them up with psychiatric help? Like you would for a suicide then why wouldn't you set them up with treatment and whatever and having choices. People need to have choices. 
ZM: I think the agency is crucial. 
SD: These are some choices. What sounds good to you? Because when I have a choice I'm much more successful. 
ZM: Even if they both don't sound great at least you are picking. 
SD: Exactly. At least one might sound better than the other. Our clients walk in and they aren't mandated to treatment here. Nobody says you have to come to treatment at Valhalla Place. I think there was maybe one person that probation said they had to come here. Our clients come in because they want to come here. Wherever they are in the state of change. Whether they are here just because it's going to fill in the blanks between their use, or because they really want to stop. However they get here they get here and they fricken walk in, which is the hardest thing for someone to do is say, you know what? I can't fricken do this anymore and I need some help. And when somebody does that we should be high-fiving them and giving them kudos and support and acknowledging that instead of shaming and making them feel like shit because you couldn't just quit. So, we're missing a lot of stuff. 
And we need a whole lot of money. Narcan, grants, all kinds of stuff we pay out of pocket. Not everybody can afford that. Oh, and the jail system. That's my biggest goal is the jail and prison system. Naloxone is in there, but New York has an amazing program out there that all their jails and prisons, and I think they have fifty-four jails and prisons in New York state, but prior to an inmate being released they have the option of having a Narcan training and having Narcan in their property. How fricken amazing is that? The highest risk of people coming out is treatment and jail of overdose, so why wouldn't I set them up to protect them and having their family be trained as well? Why wouldn't we have that? And then why should we cut them off cold turkey if they're on methadone or Suboxone when they get incarcerated? Yeah I made a mistake, yeah I did this and that, but all I'm doing is setting them up for failure if they're in there for three days, ten days, three years if I don't have any treatment and no coping skills I'm going to get out and do the same damn thing. Opiates don't go away short term. And they don't go away because you're in a bubble. ""Well, you've been in jail for two years. You'll be fine."" I did prison for a couple years. I still wanted to smoke crack when I got out. So, the craving process when I'm in a safe little bubble was sights and smells and sounds our memory sticks to those things, so why wouldn't we start somebody up even if you're not doing them while you're incarcerated. But sending them up prior to that. ""I saw that you maybe used opiates in the past."" They talk to somebody about, you know, medical people there and some of the treatment programs. Setting them up with something is an option coming out in our jail programs. 
ZM: Have you attempted to speak with anyone?
SD: Shit. I've gotten into Create, which is an out-patient program out here but they do Telasis, which is the Hennepin County jail. Kind of gotten in that door there. 
ZM: You've been sneaking in Narcan to prisons?
SD: A little bit! I'm trying to get in. With the state and the counties there are all these kind of hoops you've got to jump through. I only need one. I need one fricken jail to get on board. And if it's successful the rest will follow because we love to copy each other. So if I can just get one program. 
ZM: No one wants to be that jail though. 
SD: No, so I've got to find the right one and get the right person that'll at least hear me out and let me show what New York has done because they have an amazing program. We would eliminate recidivism as well. Along with the death toll that comes along with it. But, showing some care and compassion on the way out because they're people. Yes, you committed a crime but you're still a fricken person. We still feel, and we still bleed the same. I think we forget about that just because we have made some mistakes in our lives. 
I would love to get in there and have a Narcan program. Send that out there. I would love medicated assisted treatment to be allowed in the fricken jails continued. If they arrest one of my clients why should they get cut off cold turkey? I shouldn't have to write letters to the judge to beg him to get them out, which I've done. But the only time a person will get their methadone or Suboxone is if they're pregnant. And once they have the baby they're cut off. So, you're going through the trauma of having a baby in jail in handcuffs, not having the baby with you because you're going back to jail after delivery. So you've got a shit ton of trauma and are also going into withdrawal a couple of days later. It doesn't make any sense. 
It's very successful to have a baby while on methadone or Suboxone. I work with pregnant clients. Better than nothing. Better than nothing, and it works. But that's the only time we give a reprieve is if that's the case and they are pregnant. I have a client in Shakopee prison right now. We delivered her medication. But when she has the baby three to five days later she'll be done. I can't imagine what that's going to be like for her on top of what she's already going through. And then being in the prison system on top of all of that. 
ZM: Is it hard to just separate your job from emotional investment?
SD: I've gotten better at it. I've gotten much better at it because I've learned that I can't take everybody's stuff with me or I'm not going to be able to function. I have to take care of myself. So, I have learned over the years that at the end of the day I try to leave my stuff in my office, and then go back and be Stephanie and take care of Stephanie. I can't take care of everybody all the time. My job isn't to take care of them. It's to support and guide them and be there for them and listen to them and make sure they know they're heard. All those things. There have been times where you've got to really let go. 
We're great here. We're extremely supportive of each other. If I need a break I get a break. When I've lost clients or found things out in the middle of the day and I'm like, ""I'm out. I have to go."" Or, ""I have to go do something. I'll be back in an hour because I just need a little bit of time to get out of here and decompress."" And we get a great amount of PTO, so we get a lot of time off which is nice. Most places don't that amount of time off that we get here. They do want us to take care of ourselves because it's hard. It's a hard job. 
ZM: When I moved from just studying this in an academic sense last semester to actually doing interviews—this is the first I have conducted on my own—but I sat in on a trial run with Amy when she was interviewing another parent in NA and I was floored. I was wrecked for the rest of the day. I was like how am I going to be able to do this? This is insane. I can't even imagine.
SD: It's hard. But there are times when we sit with our clients and I'm crying and they're crying too. And then there's bad times. I have a client who's terminally ill, and I know it's coming sooner than later. And he's always like, ""Why are you crying?"" And I'm like, ""This is hard for me! Because I'm trying to prepare for your death."" How can I prepare for that? Because I'm trying to grieve and you have to allow me my grieving process, too. And that he could understand, but he was trying to not deal with it in his own right, and I can't imagine being in his seat. 
I think it's important that they see that we're real people, and not a machine. I'm human, and I do share my story when it's going to be good for the client. If it's something that's going to help them to connect, to realize that they're not alone and it's not going to be harmful then absolutely I will share stuff if they ask me certain questions. I don't have anything to hide. If it's going to help them absolutely. Because I've been through a lot of shit. I share my story when I go to treatment programs and speak a lot of times. I wouldn't wish my story on anybody, but I think they need to know I have been there. I know what it's like to sit in that chair. I know what it's like to be you. I know what it's like to have a record. I know what it's like to be judged. I know what it's like to have labels all over me. And guess what? I got a job, I have an education, I have a career all after I did all that other stuff. I think I'm proof to many people that you can get out. And you can do something different. Don't let society, or your background, or whatever it is write your freaking path because it's bullshit. If I had done that I'd be dead by now. There's no way I would have made it. 
ZM: It seems like the whole individualized and humanized and personal element is what you do at Valhalla.
SD: Yeah. I think so. I think a lot of programs do that too, but I think it's just very individualized. The same thing can happen, the same person here—like two clients in the same situation going on, but the circumstances still could be different. This is a newer client. This one's been here for two years, so they know these things. This one maybe doesn't. So, as I said we have our 'it depends' thing around here. ""Well, this guy, this is what you guys did."" ""Well, this is different."" ""But it seems the same."" Well, it's not. 
Our job is to fight for the client. Sometimes there have been times when fighting for the client means I have to discharge because it's a higher risk for me to have them continuing treatment here than it is to let them go. That one sucks, but at the end of the day I have to protect myself, protect my company, and protect that person. I work with some more difficult patients. I also am working with clients that are committed; they're on a full chemical dependency commit. They go into law facilities sometimes at Care Anoka, and I am one of the counselors that was going there for them, and so we provide them they're medication and then I go and see them and meet with them. In order to commit you've probably done a lot of things. Numerous overdoses, suicidal attempts, hospitalizations, in and out of the systems. Things like that. You're either really good at what you do or not so good at it depending how you want to look at it. But those are some high risk patients. I have to make sure they're safe. Sometimes saying methadone is not appropriate for you anymore because I have to make sure you're safe is my decision. I'm always hoping I'm making the right decision for everybody. 
ZM: That's the difficult part of the job. Not having a road map really. 
SD: I have to weigh the ficken pros and cons, and what's going to be less harmful. Sometimes the less harm is saying, ""You can't. This isn't going to work for you anymore."" And letting them go, and hope that they find another way. It's a hard fricken job. I'm surprised I didn't cry today. I'm usually a squishy one. [laughs] Every now and then certain stories... But I'm extremely passionate about making a difference out here. 
ZM: I can tell. Is there anything else you think would be important to know?
SD: Dead people don't recover. No stigma. My little hashtags: Carry Narcan Now! That's what's important. And thank you for letting me hopefully be a part of this because this is important. And I'm glad that patients such as mine are going to be heard in this project. This is amazing. Because they need to be heard. Thank you. "

Maplewood, Minnesota
Rae Eden Frank-RF
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: Rae, would you state your name and tell me I have permission to record this?
RF: My name is Rae Eden Frank and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this. 
AS: Thank you. Do you want to start with where you were born and your childhood and whatever you want to share? 
RF: I was born in Boston, Masachusettes. My family moved to Long Island, New York when I was an infant. We moved to the Twin Cities, Minneapolis, when I was six years old. I was in first grade. I had a pretty -- how would I describe my childhood? My parents -- my mother and father -- were married until I was nine. They got separated. I have one brother who is two years older. We, for the most part got along. The biggest trauma for me was when my parents got divorced. My father was still very active in our lives. He basicially wanted to be an active participant. There was a lot of grief and sorrow that she had -- she was not expecting the break up. She fought very hard to keep us for one hundred percent custody while he was fighting for joint custody. We were caught in this battle and that was pretty impactful in my childhood. 
AS: What year were you born?
RF: I was born in 1969. We are probably about the same age. [laughs] There was no substantial chemical use in my imediate family. My father never drank. No one ever drank in my housefold, not even social drinking. My parents didn’t smoke. Chemicals were not a part of our family or our life. 
AS: Was that due to a religious upbringing?
RF: I know my dad’s parents were heavy smokers so he could never stand the smell of cigarette smoke. He never drank. My mother tells stories and she tried drinking and she didn’t like how it felt so she didn’t do it. That’s just not what they did and that’s just not the people they are. Do you want to know about my chemical use? Do you have other questions about my childhood?
AS: Sure. Well, where did you go to school? Were you raised in any religion?
RF: My heritage is Jewish, but when we moved to Minnesota -- this is the story my mother tells -- she couldn’t find a synagogue that she liked so she started going to a Unitarian church, which she was familiar with because her mother had been a Unitarian. In Minnesota we started going to a Unitarian church and I was raised Unitarian. My father’s heritage is Jewish, but he’s not very religious. 
AS: What did you parents do for a living?
RF: Well, you know my mother. I was thinking how long can I go before this comes up? You have interviewed her, I believe. It is really interesting to me because of the parallel. 
AS: Who is your mother?
RF: I was like I’m going to be saying these things and then if you know that are you going to compare notes? But it is kind of fascinating. 
AS: Who is your mother?
RF: Kathy Frank.
AS: Kathy Simon Frank? Oh, I love your mother. 
RF: She’s very lovable. I didn’t want to tell you until you figured it out. Then I was like I’m saying all these things about my mother and you know my mother. 
AS: Well, I don’t know those things about her at all! So, you and your mother must have figured this out?
RF: We figured this out about a week ago. She was talking about a friend of hers who is doing this research project and a story and blah blah. She was telling me about the project and I was like, I think she’s interviewing me next week! [laughs]
AS: What a small world. We are great. You just keep going. Your life is safe -- 
RF: I’m at a place in my life right now where I feel really comfortable talking about things. My mother and I have had some really hard conversations about what the dynamic was between the two of us growing up and my experiences as a child and my experience being parented by her. 
AS: She is so open. 
RF: Yeah. She was a stay at home mother until my parents divorced. Then, she worked at the University of Minnesota in the sociology department for many, many years. My father was a professor of math at the University of Minnesota. My stepfather who my mother married when I was eleven was a professor of electrical of engineering at the University of Minnesota. My stepmother, who my father married when I was thirteen, has always one way or another been in the family of social science department as an instructor. Very infused in the University of Minnesota!
I went to school. I lived in a neighborhood in southeast Minneapolis. We lived two houses down from the school. When I was in elementary school my brother and I would walk home for lunch and have lunch at home and we would walk back. When she started working, that was when I was in third grade, that changed because we couldn’t come home. 
AS: Was that hard for you?
RF: That was, yeah. 
AS: The whole divorce.
RF: The whole divorce, the whole being stuck in between these two parents. 
AS: Did you end up getting to spend time with your dad?
RF: I did. It slowly crept up to half time. It was two nights a week, then it was three nights a week. When my mother announced that she was marrying my stepfather who I did not like at all -- I had great disdain for him when I was younger -- I told her that if she married him I was going to live halftime with my dad thinking that then she would say she wouldn’t marry him. That was really why I was saying it because I knew it was the most painful thing I could say. The most hurtful thing I could do to my mom was go live with my dad halftime. She just broke down crying and I was like, Well shoot, I guess I’ll go live with my dad halftime. 
AS: You were eleven at that point?
RF: Yeah I was eleven at that point. He had rented a house in the same neighborhood. They both worked at the U -- well, she didn’t work at the U yet, but she then did. Or, by that time she did work at the U. He had always stayed close. He had rented a house and then he ultimately bought a house. They live two blocks away from each other. They now get along. We have family holidays now. It’s so interesting. 
I went back and forth. First it was week to week. I hated it. I absolutely hated it. When I was fifteen I got really drunk and locked myself in the bathroom at McDonald’s in Uptown and ended up in what they called twenty-twenty, which was the detox unit on Franklin and Cedar Avenue. Then ended up in the children’s adolescent unit at Fairview Deaconess. Again, these places don’t really exist anymore. 
AS: Fairview -- the one up by the U?
RF: It is now Fairview Riverside but it was Fairview Deaconess. They had what was known as the STOP Unit. Before that, when I was there, it was just called the adolescent evaluation unit. I was there for two weeks. When I got out of there I went back to my father’s house because that’s where my stuff was -- that’s where I was when I went in. The day that it was supposed to go back and forth was upset because I had been away for two weeks. So, then I just stayed at my dad’s and we started having all these family therapy sessions and they said, When do you want to go back to your mothers? And my mother was asking when I was going to go back to her house, and I was like I’m not. I was done going back and forth. I didn’t get along with my mom very well at that point. I got along with my father a lot better. 
From fourteen to sixteen I lived fulltime with my father. I was hellbent to get out of my parent’s house -- I did not want to live with my parents at all, but they wouldn’t let me move out until I graduated from high school. I fast tracked high school and graduated when I was sixteen and moved out the summer -- I have a summer birthday, and that summer I turned seventeen. Then I moved out. 
AS: Did they have emancipation?
RF: I don’t think they had to because I graduated from high school. I don’t know. There wasn’t anything illegal or anything. 
AS: Tell me more. Where did you move and what were you doing?
RF: I moved to Uptown because that was the cool place to be. I was a punk rocker in high school, an eighties punk rocker. We would hang out in the Lake and Hennepin area. The McDonald’s was an open plaza and so we would have out at the McDonalds. We all had fake IDs and we would go to the Uptown bar and First Avenue and see bands and get drunk and do acid and smoke pot. Drug use and partying was just part of the punk rock music culture. It wasn’t independent, like just getting high. It was just part of the scene and the lifestyle that included getting really fucked up. 
At that point I was using alcohol, pot, and psychedelics for the most part. I had friends that were slightly older who used heroin. They would inject heroin and use needles. I thought they were really, really cool. That was who I idolized; that was who I wanted to be. It is interesting because in some of the Narcotics Anonymous texts they talk about “We didn’t want to be addicts” and I’m like, I didn’t want the misery and the heartache and the trauma. But, those were the people that I idolized. They were the singers in the bands and they were just slightly older than me. They were the dark-siders and they shot heroin. That was appealing to me. 
I grew up -- sorry I’m going back and forth. I hated life. My prayer every night before I went to bed was, Please God take me away and don’t let me wake up in the morning. Every morning I would wake up and just be like, Fuck, here I am again. There wasn’t severe abuse going on. There wasn’t abuse, there wasn’t neglect. We were a middle-class family, always had my needs taken care of, always fed, always clothed. I’ve never been hungry, I’ve never been cold. I have so many privileges and so much gratitude -- now I have gratitude. 
I have so much privilege, but I had severe depression. I don’t even think I knew it was depression. I just hated life because I thought it was this terrible thing. All I saw was ugliness, destruction, war, hate. When I was very young I read these books by Torey Hayden who works with severely abused children. She is awesome and she is a child psychologist, works with severely abused children and I was reading her books at ten and eleven years old saying, See, people suck. 
AS: What age were you when you started feeling like you didn’t want to wake up in the morning?
RF: I think it was eleven, twelve. Yeah I mean I was just like, My life sucks, the world sucks.
AS: Well, your parents split up when you were nine. 
RF: Yeah. I didn’t really like people and I didn’t like what they were doing to the world. I didn’t like what people were doing to animals. I didn’t like what people did to each other. I just thought the world was a terrible, ugly place and I wanted to be taken out of it. 
For me, using drugs was an escape. It was also a part of the punk rock culture -- we all hated life. The music was always like, Fuck you! The music was about how the world sucks. That was my whole essence of being. 
AS: And I’m angry about it. 
RF: And I’m angry. In college I joined the political student organization and did a lot of demonstrating and at some point I can talk about what my degree is in, too. I did find some outlets other than drugs, but for the most part it was just, Get me out of here. 
AS: You were talking about the people you idolized that used heroin. 
RF: Oh, yeah. I had moved out with a best friend of mine and, I don’t remember what happened, but once we started living together we just weren’t getting along well. I knew there was a room for rent in a house that some of these people that I thought were really cool lived. They shot heroin and they were the bomb. I asked this woman if I could rent the room and she said, Yes. I started living there. That’s where I first used heroin, but I didn’t get strung out at that point. I did not live there for very long. I think I went traveling that summer and so I moved. Circumstances of looking back and I’m like, Wow, I really dodged a bullet. 
AS: What year is this?
RF: I am seventeen, maybe just turning eighteen. I graduated in 1986 so this is probably about 1987, now. 1988. 
AS: Did you use heroin just a couple of times?
RF: I just used it a couple of times at that point. 
AS: You didn’t feel like you had to have it?
RF: At that point, no. I didn’t get into the physical addiction part of it. Part of it was access to it. At that time, in the eighties, it was before a lot of the pills were available. In Minnesota at that point it was the white powder. It was very difficult -- there were basically one or two people that sold it and I didn’t have access to that person. I had to get it from my roommate who got it from someone else who got it from this one person. It was very hard to get.
AS: And there are no cell phones. [laughs]
RF: There are no cell phones. Right. 
AS: It was a word of mouth circumstance. 
RF: We had telephones, we had landlines. [laughs] We had those! It was very much like somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. My basic understanding -- I never got that close to it -- that there were one or two people in Minneapolis that sold it and you had to go through people to get to that person. It was white powder, which I don’t even know if that’s on the streets now. I ended up traveling that summer and moving away. I moved to New Mexico. 
AS: Where in New Mexico?
RF: Outside of Santa Fe. I was going to study with an herbal medicine woman. I hated the cold so I went there to get away from the cold. Not aware that the elevation makes it cold and snow! It was milder than here, but it was kind of funny because I was thinking New Mexico -- that’s the south, it must be hot. Not in Santa Fe. 
At some point I had equated misery with drug use and I had stopped using. It was right after I had moved out of the house with these folks, so maybe that was part of it -- being so immersed in it, seeing all these people that were pretty strung out. There was some pretty serious health stuff going on. Some pretty severe dysfunction. At some point I was like, Okay, I’m miserable and I’m using drugs, and if I don’t use drugs that will help meeley the misery. 
When I first moved down to New Mexico I was not using. I met a woman who I just fell madly in love with. She was just this mountain woman and she was everything that I wanted. She was counter culture, she had this similar ‘society sucks’ mindset, and she had managed to live outside of it. She was off the grid. I thought, this is the life. I’m off the grid and I’m not dependent on this society that I am totally opposed to. She was a very heavy drinker and pot smoker. I spent the next couple of years being a complete co-dependent. She was miserable and unhappy and had a way worse childhood than I had as far as abuse and stuff. I decided that my life goal was to prove to her that she was lovable and that the way she was going to find happiness was to stop drinking and to stop smoking pot and I was going to be the one to show her the way. 
That wasn’t very successful. I became very miserable. We were now living in the mountains of California where it is just beautiful. It is also a very heavy pot growing community. At that point -- now it is the early nineties -- cocaine has come up from the cities into the mountains of California and it is just rampant. Methamphetamine was being made all over in the mountains. I started using meth and found that I -- I didn’t share this earlies, but part of growing up I was very shy and very quiet. I hated myself for that and I always wanted to be talkative and have things to say. I wanted to be able to engage with people. I just couldn’t because I was shy and I was quiet. Fast forward to about nineteen years old and I used methamphetamine for the first time and I loved it. I could talk, I was all energized. I don’t remember the first time I used needles, but I was very attracted to going back to the heroin crowd. There was a part of it for me -- I know you are kind of focused on the heroin --
AS: No, no. 
RF: The injection part of it, there was the appeal of that; it was my route of choice for admission -- was needles. I started shooting meth, started selling meth. 
AS: Are you still with this woman?
RF: I’m still with this woman. Things are absolutely terrible. She is smoking crack, I’m shooting meth. Things got really bad, really fast. Her and I have a terrible breakup. I start living with this man who has a frame shop in this small town in northern California. I knew him because I sold drugs to him. I’m thinking that he’s got a business, he’s got a straight life, I’m going to start living with him. I don’t know how much of this was conscious; part of it was. And, I was going to stop selling drugs. I don’t know if I was going to stop using drugs but I was going to stop selling drugs. I was going to be on the up and up. I think I was going to stop using. 
I stopped selling and I couldn’t stop using. That was the first time I realized I was an addict. I love how this is, to kind of watch how the history goes back and forth. I told you about being in the adolescent evaluation unit when I was fifteen. I was diagnosed at that time at being borderline chemical dependent. That was 1985. They don’t use that diagnosis anymore, but that was what I was given in 1985. I was told that if I stopped using I would be fine, but if I did use it was a progressive disease. I didn’t get that I just got that I was borderline. I supposed to not use, I had to sign contracts with my parents that I wasn’t going to use. 
AS: But something stuck in your head that you were borderline, you’re not an addict, you’re just on the edge no matter what you did. No matter how far you went. 
RF: I’m not an addict, I’m borderline. Fast forward to the frame shop in California. I couldn’t stop using and this man who became the father of my oldest daughter, also a very heavy user, says to me, Do you think you’re an addict? I said, No, I’m not. I was diagnosed when I was fifteen as borderline. 
AS: The frame shop guy?
RF: Yes. He just looked at me and said, You have gone across the border. You have crossed the border. I’m like, Wow, here’s this guy -- I don’t know if I thought he was an addict, I don’t know what I thought -- but that was the first time that it occurred to me that I was an addict no matter if I wanted to or if I was trying to. It just wasn’t happening. I got pregnant and that was when -- this is 1994, now -- I got really scared because I didn’t want to be pregnant and using. I didn’t necessarily even want to be pregnant. Because life sucked and life was horrible and it was already over populated because people sucked, my intention was never to bring another human being into this world. That was a terrible thing to do. I did like kids and I thought someday I’ll try to adopt. 
When you have sex with women and you don’t need to use birth control, I don’t know if you want to know this, but then you start having sex with men and there’s this thing called birth control and I kind of forgot! [laughs] I’m pregnant and he really wants to have the baby and I’m like, Okay, I’ll have the baby. I’m twenty-four years old, strung out on meth, great. At that point I was like I need to stop using and I’m pregnant. There was a woman in that community and she had two young children. At some point, I don’t remember when, she was had shared that she was using but she had stopped during those nine months of pregnancy because those nine months may be nine months of her life but it was the entire foundation of her kid’s life. That had really stuck with me. I could not stop using. That was a second ‘Ah Ha’ moment. I have a problem. I am an addict. I’m judging this woman because I think she is a junkie, and yet she was able to stop using when she was pregnant and I cannot stop using. We moved. 
AS: What do they call that? The geographical --
RF: The geographical. We loaded up the frame shop. We left a lot of stuff, got a U-haul, loaded up the frame shop, loaded up our stuff, and moved to Seattle, Washington. 
AS: What were you going to do there?
RF: I had no idea. I had a friend who lived there and we stayed with her. She is someone I knew from college. She was one of my protest friends who does not use. She was not an addict. Turns out her roommate was a heroin addict. We move in with her. We find this out about her roommate but I didn’t start using at that point; that comes later. We learn of this picture frame shop for sale. We buy this picture frame shop. It is already an established, up and going frame shop, so now we have another business again. Within a couple of weeks we find meth again and we are both shooting meth again. 
I have my daughter and she is basically full term. She was due around April fourth and she was born on March, 26 1995. She was four pounds, six ounces. They said that even though she was basically full term, over a third of her placenta was dead from the meth. She was otherwise fine developmentally. She was little but she had all of her eyes, ears, all of her senses, and all of her functions. I immediately tested positive -- I don’t know how all the processes work, if I told them or what -- because I had been getting prenatal care. I know at one point they had wanted to drug test me and I had kind of talked the doctor out of it or something. 
AS: Do you think they suspected because her growth was so small?
RF: I think what happened was we were in the hospital and I was having contractions and they found that the umbilical cord was being crushed, and they were recommending a C-section. I thought they are going to start doing medical interventions, they are going to start giving me anesthesia, or whatever they give you, and here I am I have meth in my system and I need to tell somebody. That’s what happened and I did tell the doctor. 
They brought in CPS [child protection services] and the case was opened. I don’t know if this is because it is 1995, I don’t know if it is because -- I do believe a portion is because I am white and my daughter’s father is white, and we own a business, and we had an apartment. There were cultural things and we didn’t fit the stereotype. Even though a case was opened, we were required to go and give UAs to pee. I was court ordered to treatment, but I started going and I stopped. We had to go pee, but I was unobserved so we started peeing in bottles and putting it in the fridge and bringing it with us. I don’t remember if they were testing the father as well or just me, but for sure me.  
At that point was when I started doing heroin again. I don’t remember why we went from heroin to meth at that point, but it was Seattle in the 1990s and meth was very accessible and heroin was also very accessible. It was black tar heroin, which was different from what I had used in Minneapolis, but it was very accessible and comparatively cheap, I guess. We started using heroin when my daughter was about six weeks old. Again, IV. Even in the eighties the whole overdose thing -- I know you are interested in the overdose thing -- that has really been an epidemic from what I see from the 2000s. We would shoot up a lot. I don’t know if it was the pure heroin. People did overdose but very few people overdosed and died.
AS: In the nineties. 
RF: In the nineties. The eighties and nineties. If they did it was a mixture of alcohol and other things. 
AS: So maybe it wasn’t as pure? That’s what I have heard.
RF: Or it was just heroin and not mixed with all the other stuff. Fentanyl I know is what is happening now. People would be like, Let’s see how much we can shoot up! The quantities were large amounts. I was around people who would nod out, but I was not around people that totally stopped breathing. The big thing then was Hepatitis C. At that point it was non-A and non-B. They hadn’t even identified it as Hep C at that point. Needled exchanges were springing up. I had learned from a friend of mine in Seattle about how not to share needles, cookers, and cottons. There is a lot of that kind of education going on, but not so much about the overdose that is going on now. 
I then went on a run for almost two years of heroin. The physical addiction part was just -- I mean when you talk about your daughter and how the overdose happened and she continued to use it is so insane but I understand it completely. That is how insidious it is. Addiction in general, but also specifically heroin use. That physical component of the use is just overwhelming. Detoxing from it is the most horrible thing I have ever done in my life. I am actually glad I am talking about it because it reminds me that I never want to go through it again. It was a nightmare. 
When my daughter was about a year old I remember I put myself in treatment. A couple of things happened. I didn’t want to raise a child as a using addict. There were pieces of me that were still sane. I was like I love this child and I did want to give her a chance and a life. What kind of life was I going to give her while I was using? I tried to quit a couple of times and absolutely could not. I did the detox thing and went through hell for three days and then get out and start using again because I was so miserable. I tried to get on methadone but the waiting list was really long. I then got into a mother daughter treatment program. It was three days of detox and was absolutely miserable, but I then went into an inpatient treatment program and I was just so sick. I remember for six weeks I didn’t sleep. I would wake up every hour on the hour. It was miserable. It had helped to care for my daughter but it was just exhausting. They recommended me for a six month program. I was from Minnesota, which at that point the standard treatment was the twenty-eight day model. I wrote my own treatment plan and I said, You are recommending me for six months and that’s absolutely insane. I will stay for sixty days because that is double the twenty-eight day program. That is twice as long. They were telling me that I had to stay the six months but on that sixtieth day --
AS: This is a place that was recommending six months and your daughter could live there so there was surround care? I’m assuming this was a nice place?
RF: Yeah. I was kind of in a house --
AS: You’re not leaving because it’s substandard care. You were just leaving because you didn’t want to do six months.
RF: Exactly. 
AS: I just wanted to understand that. 
RF: I was getting a lot out of the program and bonding with some of the other women. I knew what I needed and I only needed sixty days. 
AS: Are you still with her father at this point?
RF: I’m still with her father. He is still using, although I think at that point he was on methadone. I don’t remember what I was telling them. I do remember physically I had been so sick and the only thing that kept me in there was each day saying, I do not want to go through day one, two, three, four again. Like I was saying this on day five. I don’t want to do that again. I was so physically horrible. Saying that to myself: how I didn’t want to go back again. Each day I stay clean and don’t use heroin I’m one day further from that. 
Day sixty I leave and go do meth. I was thinking about not using heroin again. I wasn’t going to go through that detox again. I leave the program -- this is over twenty years ago now -- I went and used meth with my daughter’s father. We were still together. We are off and running on meth again. I was still thinking that I didn’t want to raise my daughter while using. We decided to move again. We sell the frame shop. Some of these things I’m like, How did we manage this? But we did. 
AS: To pay bills? Live a life? Is that what you mean?
RF: Yeah, and how things fell into place. We knew this person was a businessman and he bought the business from us. 
AS: Because you were so strung out you don’t remember it? 
RF: I don’t remember the intricacies of how it happened and also when I look back I think about the chances of all those things happening and all the things falling into place the way they did.
We sold the business and we moved back to northern California, but a different place. My daughter’s father’s father was a -- I don’t know if you know about the Anananda community? They follow Ananda I think is his name. It is an Eastern based philosohy of yoga, meditation, vegetarian eating. They have a community in Nevada City, Californina. My daughter’s father’s father lived in Fresno, but was a member of this community of Ananda. We find out there is a retreat house and we can go there and do work exchange. We drive to this beautiful, moutainous place, and they put us up in a yurt and they are all vegetarians. We live in a yurt and are doing work exchange. Then, we find another place to live right outside this Anananda community. I am going there to meditate and do yoga in the community center and it is beautiful. Then we find meth. 
AS: How long did that take?
RF: Weeks. 
AS: Several weeks in?
RF: Yeah. 
AS: When you say you found meth, what do you mean? Explain that to a non-meth user. How you could just find it at a yoga center. 
RF: [laughs] Some of it is that there is something about people that use drugs and that radar kind of thing. There is something else I just kind of believe that the energy you put out is the energy you get. Some of that new-age stuff I really believe. I was still emitting that energy and attracting to me, not consciously thinking I want to do this thing, I wanted to get away from this thing, but I was still drawn to it. 
My daughter’s father was looking for a job and we were told -- this is all in the same area -- there was a guy, he wasn’t apart of the Anananda community, but he had a sawmilll and he was looking for people to mill the wood. He got a job there, and the owner of the sawmill smoked meth. Here you have somebody who is just trying to be clean and not really and he finds out this guy smokes meth. It was small, it wasn’t a big business. The two of them were working together and he catches on that he does meth. They start talking and then I’m like, Oh yeah, I’m there too. They were smoking meth but then I started shooting it because that’s just what I did. That went on for another year.
 Finally, during that period of time I was just getting more and more desperate. Things were falling apart between the two of us and we were not parenting well. We were fighting constantly and I was miserable. I remember saying to this woman, I really want my daughter to grow up and be happy and healthy. She said to me, The most important, number one thing you can do to ensure that happens is for you to be happy and healthy. It was one of those so simple and so deep profound moments of my life. I was like, This isn’t the way it is going to happen. 
My stepmother knew I was miserable and she said, Why don’t you come back to Minneapolis and visit? Some plan was formulated that my daughter and I were going to come back to the Twin Cities and I couldn’t figure out how to pack. Simple daily things I couldn’t figure out how to do. My mother ended up flying out. The nearest airport to the place I was was Sacremento. My mother bought us roundtrip tickets, she flew to Sacramento, drove for three hours to the mountains, picked us up, drove back to Sacramento, and flew to the Twin Cities. That was January 18, 1998. 
AS: Why do you remember that date?
RF: January 18, 1998. That is the last day that I injected or used drugs of any form. That is the date that recovery in earnest started. My clean date I call January 19th. The day after. The last day I used drugs was when my mom was driving down the driveway to come pick us up. I did not come back out here to get clean. I was miserable and here was this imitation. My intention was to come out here and spend some time with my family and then come back to California. I had a round trip ticket. I didn’t have a ton of stuff because we lived in a yurt. I came with a suitcase and that was it. 
AS: How long were you planning to visit?
RF: I don’t know. [laughs] Opportunities kept presenting themselves. I kept saying I was going to go back after I did this. I didn’t have a driver’s license anymore because I had let it expire and so I was going to get my driver’s license then I was going to go back. Then a friend of mine was teaching this play therapy class and she asked me if me and my daughter wanted to participate in this class and I said, Sure. So then I was going to take this play therapy class and then I was going to go back. At a certain point I was just like I’m not going back. 
I started attending Narcotics Anonymous right away. 
AS: You didn’t go back into treatment?
RF: I didn’t go back into treatment. I was living with my mother and my stepfather in the house I had moved out of when I was fourteen and had never moved back into. 
AS: How old are you at this point?
RF: I am twenty-nine at this point.
AS: It has been half of your life since the time you had been there. 
RF: I come back to mom’s house and she nursed us back to health. She financially provided for us while I got on my feet, I went back to school. 
AS: Had you started college before you moved to Santa Fe?
RF: I had started college. I was in a program called the Program for Individualized Learning at the U of M. It doesn’t exist anymore.
AS: A lot of schools had something like that. 
RF: I could design my own major. I had designed it around political activism and community organizing and things that I loved to do anyways. I was getting some kind of credit for this herbal medicine internship. I could do projects and get credit for them. When I was in California I had worked on this reggae festival. I was the handicapped support crew person. I had done a project around accessibility at large venues or something. I had to find professors at the U of M who would work with me on it, but I had always managed to do that. 
As all of this is going on I am doing a project here and a project there. At some point I completely had stopped going at all. I come back to Minnesota. I had finished the core of what I needed to for the Program for Individualized Learning, but I had to do a senior project. I really didn’t know what I wanted to do. I then found the Alcohol and Drug Counseling Education program which is a two year program at the University of Minnesota. They had another program called the Inner-College program, which I think they still have, where you could take minors from two different colleges. My stuff was basically from the college of liberal arts and the alcohol and drug studies was from family and social science. I could take two of those things and put them together and have a degree. That’s what I did. 
I dove right into school, I dove into NA, the alcohol and drug counseling education program, and I got my degree in 2000 I think. 
AS: What was the turning point for you? You said things in California were going poorly. You got this invitation. Had you reached out at all? Did your family back here know that you were in really bad shape or was it kind of a surprise?
RF: They knew. I don’t know if they knew how bad, but they knew. 
AS: By the time your mom came to get you, you were ready to be done. Did something precipitate that? Was it falling out with him? 
RF: That was an event. It is always like how people talk about what their ‘bottom’ is. 
AS: I just mean that it seems like they came and got you and then you started going to NA. [laughs] If that is your story that is totally fine, but I was just wondering if there was some other precipitating things. You had moved before to try to stop, so I’m just wondering what it was about this move. Maybe I interrupted you earlier when you were trying to say something. 
RF: Part of it was I think I had isolated myself from the community in northern California. Even though my community there, the family there, the saw mill family became my family, they had kids and we spent time together. I had isolated myself from them and I really had nobody. I was in this yurt all day with my daughter and had totally isolated myself. Him and I were not getting along. I had had this conversation with this woman about being happy. Just all these little things that kind of added up. 
Although I didn’t make a conscious decision that I was going to come back here to be clean it kind of fell into place. Also, being at my mom’s house where there was no alcohol and drugs. Of course, as I told you before, I could have easily found it, but something just changed. Something had changed when I had got on that plane. Part of it was the desire to use was lifted, which is unexplainable because up until that point, part of how I defined addiction was that I couldn’t stop using and I had this compulsion and obsession. If anytime I had tried not to use I was just so overwhelmed that I had gone back to using. Somewhere between traveling from California to Minnesota that obsession was lifted. When I arrived in Minnesota I didn’t have that drive. I think if I had I wouldn’t have stayed clean. That miracle had happened despite any intention that I had. 
I got internships. I worked at mothers and daughters programs because that was my own personal interest. I worked at a methadone program. Then I started learning about harm reduction. I had always been interested in needle exchanges because another part of my story is that I don’t have HIV or Hepatitis C. I didn’t contract those diseases through all of that using. PArt of that I attribute to the education I got in Seattle from the injection drug users there who were very much about educating each other through peer to peer education. I had always had a very favorable view on needle exchange and harm reduction. 
When I came back to Minnesota and I started connecting with some of my old friends many of them were dead through either overdose or suicide. One hundred percent of those people, like those roommates I talked about that I had injected with in 1984, had Hepatitis C. Again, I really dodged a bullet here. A couple of them had HIV, but one hundred percent of them have Hep C. I found out about a needle exchange that was hiring. It was called Woman with a Point. Later we changed our name to Access Works. I started working there in 2000. Yeah, because the internships I did while I was in school were with the methadone clinic and the women’s program. My first job was as an HIV tester and Woman with a Point. It was a federally funded program to do HIV testing in the drug using community. I worked there until 2007 and I went from being an HIV tester to a program manager to the executive director. 
AS: Is this with Access Works?
RF: This is with Access Works. From 2003 to 2007 I was the executive director. During that time we started an overdose prevention program. Fentanyl had hit the streets. There were these pockets of overdoses happening. Mostly they would be tied back to a single source. We started doing things with alerts like if there was bad dope we would have bad dope alerts. We had a users group so people could share information. It wasn’t a safe injection place it was just an information thing. We exchanged needles. We gave clean needles, syringes, education, HIV testing, Hepatitis C testing, counseling. 
We got a grant from the Collmer Foundation to do overdose prevention. I had leraned about Narcan and there was a program in Chicago called the Chicago Recovery Alliance that was giving Narcan to people on the streets along with their syringe exchange. I contacted the director there and developed an overdose prevention program based on that program where we teach rescue breating and CPR. Once people had been through this training that we gave we would give them a prescritpion for Narcan. At that point I had found a doctor who was willing to write prescriptions. We couldn’t get the Narcan and give it to people, but we could give them a prescription and they could go to the pharmacy and they would fill it. I think that’s how we started. 
AS: Who was the doctor?
RF: I can get back to you on that. I don’t remember how I got connected to him. I think I was just talking to people and networking. I also connected with doctors at the University of Minnesota that were looking for community based experiences. We started a wound care clinic because another thing that was happening were huge abscesses and people being afraid to go to the doctors. We had medical insurance come on site and do wound care. 
AS: That became part of what Access Works did?
RF: Yeah. 
AS: Where were you located?
RF: Eleven West Fifteenth Street in Minneapolis. Right off of Fifteenth and Nicolette. 
Minnesota Aids Project also had a needle exchange. I don’t know exactly the history of that. I think they started around the same time in the nineties. We were basically the only ones doing overdose prevention in that time. 
AS: Do you remember when Women with a Point started?
RF: Maybe ‘95, ‘96. The founder of that, Sue Purchase, would probably love to talk to you. She is delightful. 
AS: I would love to talk to her. 
RF: I think she lives out in Colorado now. She is still actively doing work with women drug users. She has a program now called the Morpheus Project. It does needle exchange and I think overdose prevention. She’s got a ton of historical stuff with heroin use in the Twin Cities and establishing needle exchange and stuff. 
AS: I want to know about the stigma about abcesses. People were getting these and not getting treated for them because they were afraid to go to the hospital to be drug tested. What was their fear?
RF: One of the fears was how they were treated. Another fear was being disrespected. They were also not given pain medicine because they were heroin addicts. That kind of thing. We would see people oozing, just really horrific wounds caused from injections. 
AS: You found medical students from the U of M who would come and treat wounds off site?
RF: It was at Access Works. That only lasted one semester. Then we developed a relationship with the Uptown Community clinic. 
AS: Was it called NIP?
RF: On twenty-fourth and Hennepin?
AS: Yeah, right across from the Walgreens. It just closed down. 
RF: Did it close?
AS: Yeah, because of the Affordable Care Act. 
RF: Really?
AS: They had so many outstanding bills. It is completely closed down. 
RF: I think of her name, too, but whoever was the medical doctor there started something where they would see people when they dropped in or at certain times, I can’t remember, but we had some type of direct relationship with them where we would send our clients to them for wound care. 
AS: Did this include antibiotics?
RF: Yes. Packing, teaching how to pack and repack wounds. 
AS: Was that anything that ever happened to you?
RF: No. My daughter’s father got some serious abscesses and he had to have both of his biceps taken out. I didn’t ever have to do anything like that. 
AS: You listened to the advice. 
RF: Part of that is that people that get abscesses from muscling -- when people can’t find veins anymore, so they muscle -- I didn’t do that. Oftentimes people go into the vein and then miss it. The drug residue goes elsewhere. I didn’t ever have any of that. 
AS: You’re the executive director of the program until 2007. Does it still exist?
RF: It does not exist anymore. A series of events happened. I look back and I think if I had made different choices things might have happened differently. I got the opportunity to be the executive director of Foundation. I was like, Oh, I’m the executive director! And I loved it. I wasn’t paid a whole lot because it was a tiny organization, but I was the executive director. I got this position with Sobriety High Foundation. It is twice the salary and I decided I wanted to go for it. 
AS: What is that?
RF: It is a foundation that -- it doesn’t exist anymore either; I leave this trail. [laughs] It was a foundation that ran three or four sobriety high schools. One in Edina, one in Maplewood, and I can’t remember the other one. They ran sober high schools, which still exist, it just doesn’t exist in this manifestation. Pease Academy, Insight in White Bear Lake. There are a number of them. It was really just a big fundraising arm, it was kind of a clunky thing. It was a fundraising arm for these schools. I had gone from being involved with the communities, developing these programs and I didn’t realize how much I loved that. I was also really an effective fundraiser. I was really good at networking and finding resources and grant writing. I had built a strong foundation of a lot of the family foundations in the twin cities that supported us with the needle exhchange. We had the Department of Health grant, the CDC grant, we had the Hennepin County grant. I thought a bigger, better, more money, whatever. I can be the director of this foundation. The 2008 the crash happens and no one is giving money anymore. I was this brand new executive director trying to fundraise in the most horrible time. It wasn’t happening. 
The same thing happened to the new director of Access Works. She did not have the ties that I had. I tried to pass things onto her, but her personality was such that -- it ended up being that her personality -- people would say, Oh, she took it down?
AS: People would say that about the new director at Access Works?
RF: She was in the same position as me as this new director and agency. You don’t have the footing, you don’t have the history, it is 2008 and the market has crashed, no one is giving money, foundations are closing, money is drying up. They ended up in 2008 or 2009 shutting their doors. 
AS: Right in the middle of a crisis. Right when it was needed. 
RF: Minnesota Aids Project was still doing the needle exchange. It might be interesting to talk to someone there because I don’t know any of their overdose prevention stuff. Here we are with the Narcan doing the overdose training, distributing Narcan right then in 2009 and the doors shut. 
No one I know really picked up the overdose stuff that I can see until the Steve Rumler Foundation. 
AS: That was in 2012, 2013. 
RF: They have done amazing stuff bringing it through legislation. 
AS: Are we still missing this other piece that Access Works provided? Are we still missing user groups? Counseling? Alerts? I’ve seen the Rumler Foundation try to do alerts about bad heroin, but when they come onto my Facebook page I think there is likely a gap between the Rummler Hope Foundation pager that you were dealing with at Access Works. 
RF: We were definitely the face of the epidemic as far as Native Americans, Hispanic, African American, people of all economic backgrounds. 
AS: Do you know where the records are from Access Works? Who would have them? Just the paperwork, your notes from board meetings, your fliers.
RF: We could ask Sue because she might know. I can send an email to one of the board members. She contacted me a few years ago to talk about something else. I might have some flash drives. I don’t have any of the paperwork but we had a whole access database system where we tracked things. 
AS: This is not what I expected and is making me very excited. Just because these organizations were arising in a crisis for care for people. It is just interesting to me as an important part of the history because so far all you would know if you knew anything about this in this area in the last five or six years all you know about is Steve Rummler. Unless you happen to know people in methadone clinics who are giving Narcan. 
RF: I don’t know if you have talked to people at Valhalla Place yet. 
AS: Yeah, Chuck. 
RF: Adams?
AS: I haven’t interviewed him yet. He works for somewhere else now. I think he works for White Earth. They are doing Narcan now. It is out there, but this organization, especially Women with a Point --
RF: When we first started we had outreach workers on the streets. Even the stuff that Minnesta Aids Project, I don’t know if they are still doing the van. The person behind that the mainline, he died a number of years ago. His name is escaping me. 
AS: What was main line?
RF: It still is what Minnesota Aids Project calls the needle exchange program. 
AS: So, in 2009 you are at the Sobriety High Foundation. 
RF: I leave Access Works and go to Sobriety High Foundation. Access Works closes and I leave Sobriety High after one year. I’m not sure if it was during that year, I’m not sure of the date Access Works closed, but I left in october of 2007. I was the director of Sobriety High Foundation until October of 2008. Not a good fit for a variety of reasons. One was that I was in this fundraising position and I cannot raise funds. Another was that I knocked heads with some of the board chairs. It just was not a good fit. I learned that I liked that program development piece so much more than just the solid fundraising. I left there in October in 2008 having no idea what I was going to do. It was pretty scary. 
This is a whole other thing, we may have to meet again! The other thing that was going on in 2008 was that my now thirteen year old daughter, the trouble started when she was eleven. Things got really unmanageable. She started cutting. I know there were things that I was feeling ready to move away from the needle exchange, which coincided with my daughter starting to use. I felt like my whole life was around using. Even though I loved working at Access Works and loved the participants they were still using addicts. I was in recovery and I was a mom and my daughter was starting to use. 
I go to Sobriety High Foundation, which is now still in the same field but now these are supposedly people in recovery or whatever. I end up putting her in treatment and there was a lot of in and out. 
AS: She was in treatment as a young teenager, then.
RF: Yeah.
AS: And that is based on your experience. You saw it. You could see it.
RF: Oh, I saw. It was kind of funny because there were times when I would be with my mother and she probably never knew that I was using because there were times with Brianna that it was so obvious. I would just be like you are so high! And my mother was still totally oblivious to it. I was like, No wonder you didn’t know! I can see it. 
AS: By thirteen she’s in treatment?
RF: By thirteen she’s in treatment. Not only is the economy crumbling, but it is totally chaotic with her. All this advice. I never went to Nar Anon partly because I was in NA and I had that as my foundation and my step work and my sponsor. With all these other things in recovery and change with all these people and places and if you don’t like it walk away. I couldn’t not parent my daughter. I couldn’t kick her out. I had to be immersed and deal with it. 
This chaos is going on. I leave that position. I’m unemployed for six months. It was actually one of the greatest times. At this point I have another daughter who was born in recovery. She’s fifteen. I was with her father and it was a planned pregnancy. Totally different story. She is a totally different human being. I am applying for jobs like crazy, don’t find anything, no one is hiring. I am going on all these informational interviews which is another great thing I did. I was also able to be present for my daughter at that time that was helpful. There was a little reprieve and I was able to be around a lot. I think she was in eighth grade at that point. 
My next job was as a licenser for treatment centers with the Department for Human Services. Now I am back, well, I guess I never really left the field. Now I have. I finally left the field. [laughs] 
AS: You have? What do you do here?
RF: I am a planning specialist. I work in public health. The reason I got this job was because it was public health and I have so much public health background. The division I am in is in environmental health and I do policy planning around solid waste and recycling. [laughs] Not doing chemical dependency stuff anymore. 
AS: You became a licenser for treatment centers --
RF: In March of 2009 I start working for the Department of Human Services licensing treatment centers. I got assigned all of the methadone clinics because I wanted to help make the law, Rule Thirty-one work for methadone clinics because it doesn’t work. In the Rule Thirty-one it says your treatment goal has to be the cessation of treatment. That doesn’t work for methadone because methadone can be this long --
AS: Yeah, that’s the whole point. 
RF: There have been some changes made in statute that happens around some of these -- I don’t remember the exact language now it has been so long -- but there have been some changes to the methadone rules. There is more flexibility. We weren’t citing every single program for a violation. 
AS: Does Rule Thirty-one give them federal funds?
RF: Rule Thirty-one does not give the federal funds. That’s through Rule Twenty-five. The Rule Thirty-one was a real specific thing that said that you had to have a treatment plan, you had to have treatment goals.
AS: Okay, so it is about how they run?
RF: Yeah. I am a licenser for these programs and my daughter is continuing to get worse. Finally, she goes to Andale, I think that is the girl’s program in Eden Prairie. I am a licenser and I am licensing programs and now I have a daughter that is in a treatment program. She didn’t ever use heroin that I know of. She was using meth, psychedelics, and alcohol. She was just going off the deep end. As far as I know she has never injected. As far as I know she has never used heroin. As far as I know she has overdosed. 
AS: Is she sober today?
RF: She is not sober. She drinks socially. I don’t know what -- you know? She is young. She is twenty-one now and she has a son. I have a three year old grandson. She is doing really well as far as her relationships. She has graduated college, she has a degree from Hamline, she has her real estate license. She loves parenting, she loves her son and she has been really present for him. She did stop using for quite a long, substantial period of time. At some point she decided to start drinking again. Sometimes she drinks. I don’t know and sometimes I try to pay attention: Are you where you say you are going to be? 
AS: Right, the bigger things. 
RF: It was in that period that she was in treatment. I saw this job in Ramsey County as a health educator. I put an application in. When I was interviewing for the position I was thinking that this was a pretty big deal. I have worked in this field for so long and in so many different capacities: a counselor, a director, a licensed. And I’m in recovery and my children are using. It was refreshing to have a professional life that was outside all of this. I have been at this job for five years. 
AS: You are a health educator?
RF: I was a health educator and now I’m a planning specialist. 
AS: For recycling? You’ve got to explain this! Or, you can tell me in an email. 
RF: Part of this job is to get the information out to communities so that we recycle more. There is a state mandate that we have to recycle seventy-five percent of our solid waste by 2020. We are developing policies to try to get us to that. I don’t have to raise money anymore. I don’t have to supervise staff. 
AS: Tell me what it was like for you to be going through recovery and having a daughter going off the deep end into substances? How was that emotionally and psychologically?
RF: It pissed me off. I thought it was really unfair. I had done all of this work on this road to recovery, to be surrounding myself with all these positive people and good quality of life. Following a spiritual path. Now I have to deal with all this shit and it has to be in my house again. I was really, very angry. 
AS: How did you manage that with your daughter?
RF: I don’t think I managed it very well. I was working in harm reduction so I could have great compassion for all these people that I worked with --
AS: And then come home and freak out with her. 
RF: Part of it was not so much the use, but the result of that use was that she was so incredibly disrespectful and such a little monster. That would just set me off. How dare she speak to me like that in my house? There became a lot of power struggles. If I could go back and do that part of my life differently with more compassion then I maybe would. It was very contentious. I didn’t know how to help her. 
AS: Isn’t that odd? Isn’t that a peculiar thing? It makes addiction just one possible element of a teenager’s struggle. Even with your history and awareness of what was going on it didn’t change how difficult or painful it was for you. You worked a progam. Is that righ?
RF: Yeah. I still have a sponsor and I sponsor other women. 
AS: When it is your child --
RF: Yeah, because there is one part of wanting so much for her not to have to go through my experience herself. I already went through this; you don’t have to go through this and then seeing that she does have to go through what she has to go through. Very conflicting feelings about how young a person should be to go into treatment and whether that is beneficial or detrimental. When she was really young to try to keep her safe I didn’t see any other options. I was working full time and was a single mother again with another younger daughter that I was trying to protect from the stuff going on with my older daughter. She was in Fairview Riverside twice. She did outpatient which didn’t work very well at Anthony Lewis. Then ultimately I took her to Onbelay. I think it is part of the Anthony Lewis centers. Their girls inpatient program. She really loves to write and she got really engaged. Kind of like me there is a part of her that is really into that self growth and self exploration while maintaining some level of destructive behavior. 
AS: What about your younger daughter?
RF: She is a gem. [laughs] I’m not comparing them at all! No, I love them both.
AS: Oh, yeah, of course. You don’t have to tell me. I have two and my youngest is completely different. Not a ripple of trouble ever. 
RF: My fifteen year old -- and I think of myself at fifteen and my eldest at fifteen and she is engaged in school, she does sports, she dances. Her biggest thing now that I think I have to put on a leash is piercing. She got her ears double pierced and now she got her nose pierced for her fifteenth birthday and now she wants her belly button pierced. I’m like, Oh, no I’ve unleashed this piercing monster! That’s her thing. Could be worse. She is pleasant, she is not rude or disrespectful.
AS: What does she think about substances that you know?
RF: She knows that in other countries drinking is more a part of the way you grow up. She’ll say that she wants to try alcohol and we have conversations around what that means and the legal age and why the law is twenty-one and whether or not that makes sense or not and that her father is also an addict in recovery. I had nineteen years in January and he had twenty-one years in January. We met in recovery and he has been in long term recovery. We have conversations. She saw what it did to her older sister. I don’t know that she’ll never use because she has curiosities about what it means. She is curious about stuff. 
AS: But you talk about it. 
RF: We talk about it, yeah. 
AS: Anything else you can think of?
RF: No. I am also in touch with some of those people that I thought were so cool and I idolized. Some of them are clean and some aren’t but I could ask them. Some are in their late forties or early fifties. They would have that perspective. They were really entrenched in the heroin use in the eighties in the Twin Cites and the punk scene. I can get you in touch with Sue. 
AS: That would be great. Thank you, Rae. 
RF: Thank you."

At the Narrator’s Home
Richfield, Minnesota
AS: This is Amy Sullivan it is June 28, 2016. I’m with Gloria Englund in her home in Edina? Minneapolis?
GE: Richfield.
AS: Richfield, Minnesota. The awesome Richfield, Minnesota. Gloria could you just state your name and tell me that you give permission for me to record?
GE: I’m Gloria Englund and I give permission for this interview.
AS: Okay. Thanks. If you could just start by talking about your, just for a little bit, about your childhood, your education and move in to early motherhood, career, things like that. 
GE: So I was born and raised in Hastings, Nebraska which is a town of 25,000. It was a very safe, wonderful place to be. I had a father who travelled five days out of the week. I had three other brothers, two older and one younger. My mom had her hands full, all the time. I was a tomboy because there wasn’t time for me to be a girl until they left. Finally in high school she started caring that my hair was combed.
AS: That’s great [Laughs].
GE: My mother was pretty much an introvert, very dedicated to her family, didn’t have a high school education. Her job was mother and homemaker. I thought she did a pretty good job of taking care of four kids without my dad around much. You never really knew. I have more of my father’s personality; he’s more of an extrovert. You kind of know just where you stood with him all the time. When something would happen to one of us kids my mother was like a lion. She was, nobody was going to do anything to her kids. I write about this in the book. I just learned that is was really important to stand up for your kids, let them take their share of what they dish out but there comes a point when the parent steps in. You protect your kids no matter what. I never doubted, I just had a pretty good, I had a good childhood. Except for one thing. I don’t know whether I want you to include this in the interview.
AS: Okay.
GE: In the written interview.
AS: Oh okay. That’s fine.
GE: I’d be lying if I didn’t tell you about it. There was incest. One of my brothers and I. I did not remember, and he’s still alive that’s why I don’t want it to get out. Although I have dealt with it with him but he didn’t remember it. I was twenty and it was a writing class. It was a suppressed memory. I did remember asking my mother, when the memory came back to me. When I got up that next day I said, “Did Gale come into my bedroom last night and try to do things to me? Or was I dreaming?” My mother said, “Oh it was just a bad dream.” 
It was hid until I was in this writing class and I was asked to think of a time in your life when you feel the safest and secure, in your childhood. For me it was taking a bath on a summer night and my mom had put clean sheets on my bed. I’d always sleep at the end of the bed, next to the window, so the breeze would come in those hot summer nights. Sixty five years ago we didn’t have air conditioning, sixty five years ago. It was one of those times when my brother raped me.So in the class it was kind of a meditative experience. I had never meditated, never been in an altered state. I was in my early twenties. This memory was just like right there. I just didn’t know what to do. I just started writing as fast as I could.
AS: How old were you?
GE: Early twenties.
AS: No, I mean when it happened. 
GE: I think eight, seven, eight, nine. My brother was twelve or thirteen, just beginning puberty. When I went back then at twenty and asked my mom, that’s when she said, “I thought it was just better to remember it as a bad dream.” You got to understand. My mother had no high school education.
AS: I know. I know.
GE: She was trying to protect everybody, never told my father. If my father would have found out my brothers, he would never have dealt with it properly; he would have beat my brother. I know he would have. Not beat him but there would have been, nobody would have got counseling. You didn’t do that back then, you just beat them up.
AS: Right, exactly.
GE: My older brother who also came in because I made noise and my mother and my older brother came in. So he knew it was going on. So I went to him and said, “Remember this happened.” “Yes, Mom said don’t tell Dad.” So I went to therapy. I thought I had dealt with all of it. Then flash forward another twenty years. I am divorced and remarried to Bob who is the kindest, most loving, understanding person there is. Probably the first time in my life [Dog Barks] that I ever felt safe. I do go back and I have this conversation with my brother because we were always very close. [Whispers to Dog]. That’s right, the recorders going I’m sorry. 
AS: It’s okay [Laughs]. I’ll warn my students. They’ll jump in their chair.
GE: So I make a trip back to Nebraska to confront my brother. 
AS: Wait so this is in your twenties or your forties?
GE: This is twenties after therapy.
AS: Okay. You were just talking about your husband. 
GE: I’m sorry. First time I went back, I confronted my brother and he lived back in Grand Island, Nebraska still. He said, “I know why you want to meet. I know why you called me now. You’re right it happened. I don’t ever think about it.” I said, “I just want you to know I forgive you. I hope you’ve gotten help.” He said “I’ve talked to many ministers.” And blah blah. Then he said, “Nothing’s going to change between us. If you lived across the street from me I wouldn’t be any closer than I am to you now.” I mean he just wanted to stay up on the cross. I wanted to forgive him and get my brother back because he and I were like this as kids until that happened. I came back to Minnesota and lived another twenty years. I divorced my…you know it was just kind of gone. I didn’t really have any huge emotional, the memory came without a lot of emotion. It was a very mental experience. The therapy was very mental. Twenty more years of my life goes by, I get divorced, I get remarried, I have two stepsons, Aaron started acting out before my husband and I got divorced. A lot of trauma going on.
AS: So Aaron is your biological son? 
GE: Aaron is my biological son. Jeff is my biological son. Marty and Matt are my two stepsons. Matt and Jeff are just six months apart. Marty is the youngest, he’s three years younger. Aaron was four years older than Jeff. When Bob and I got married Aaron was running away from home a lot. Aaron never lived with us when Bob and I got married. Aaron was on the streets from the time he was fifteen. 
AS: Okay. So sorry. Twenty years…
GE: Twenty years later my brother who raped me gets rectal cancer. That was the way that I was raped. My mother calls to tell me, “I want you to know Gale’s been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. I thought you’d want to know.” I’m finally in a relationship and a family where I have, I guess, total trust. Then I start reliving. I have PTSD and all the stuff that comes along with being raped and incest. What I did after I got my Master’s degree, I got a Master’s degree after I got divorced, was going to work as a psychotherapist so I could make enough money to support my kids.
AS: What was your undergraduate degree in?
GE: English. 
AS: Okay.
GE: Writing. English teaching. Never had a teaching job either. I couldn’t find one in 1970. 
AS: You’re going to get your Master’s. So you did get it?
GE: I did get my Master’s degree but I couldn’t earn enough money. I found out about this company, Sunrider International because I was looking for an alternative to Ritalin for Aaron. He’d been diagnosed with ADHD. They had a product called Ease that really worked well for him. I did all my homework, I talked to other parents. I didn’t know about all these. Ritalin kind of calmed him down but it stunted his growth, he lost fifteen pounds. It was not a good solution for him. When this worked for him I started…to make a long story short I had a twenty year career in a multi-level marketing company. I supported our family doing that. All that marketing degree, all that marketing experience, all that experience in entrepreneurship was why I had no problems stepping into this other entrepreneurial thing as a recovery coach. All this public speaking training, all this personal development training in this business. I think that’s why, I think all that prepared me for what I’m doing now. I think there was a bigger plan. I started experiencing all this trauma and I go back to my mom and my oldest brother. They deny that it ever happened. 
AS: Oh my goodness. Even after those conversations twenty years ago?
GE: Yes.
AS: They’d never heard you.
GE: My mom said, “I just can’t do that to Gale.” I said, “I’m not asking you to do anything to Gale. I’m just asking you for some support here.” I couldn’t even think about seeing him. I don’t know when I’ll be able to go to a family event again. I don’t know what I’m going to be capable of. I was in full blown PTSD. I couldn’t work.
AS: It was only then that you truly remembered physically what had happened to you?
GE: No. None of the emotional trauma…
AS: Had emerged. Oh yes. 
GE: I couldn’t sleep with Bob. We couldn’t have sex for a long time. I couldn’t have people come up behind me and tap me on the shoulder. I just was hyper vigilant about everything. I just told my mom and my brother. I said, “I don’t want to have anything to do with you. I can’t do this. You are not being supportive. I don’t know why you’re lying.”
AS: So it was your, which brother is it?
GE: My oldest brother.
AS: But not the one who…
GE: No. No. I never re-contacted my other brother. 
AS: Did he survive?
GE: What do you mean?
AS: Did he live through the cancer?
GE: Oh yes. He did.
AS: Okay.
GE: Yes, he did. I’m sorry. Yes he did. That’s the non-support that I got from my mom. Then I realized after about nine months of that that I was losing all these other connections to my nieces. I had grand-nieces and nephews that were being born. I called my mother and brother and said, “You know what? I want to start coming back to family things. But between the two of us we can never speak about this again. I don’t ever want you to bring this up to me and talk to me about it again. It’s a dead subject between the two of us.” They both agreed. That’s how I managed to get back to my family.
AS: Wow. 
GE: My mother did give me; I did go to my mother and ask for a thousand dollars for EMDR treatment. Which in the early nineties, there was one therapist here in town that I heard of. I had all this therapy, all this talk therapy wasn’t working. I thought I’m tired of this; I want to get him out of my head. 
AS: Did it work for you?
GE: Yes it did.
AS: It worked for me. It was a miracle.
GE: I just recommend it so highly to everybody. Aaron had some success with EMDR. My mother, I had that treatment in February, March, April, May of ’96. My mother died in January of ’97. My brother who raped me was the executor of the estate. I was able to go back to Nebraska and give him a big hug, thank him for everything, no trigger. He is not a triggering person to me in any way, shape, or form. When Aaron died he showed up. I’m very close to both of his daughters. It’s all come full circle. There’s just some things you can’t talk out or change. As long as they didn’t keep rejecting me, we didn’t keep talking about it.
AS: They didn’t keep denying your truth.
GE: Right. It worked out. As a psychotherapist you’ve got to get the answer, you’ve got to get closure on everything. Guess what? No. [Laughs]. Other than that I had a very lovely childhood. [Laughs]. I don’t know how we would talk about that.
AS: In relation to what we’re going to talk about?
GE: I mean, yes.
AS: Well what it says to me. All I can do is say that I relate completely. My mother was raped repeatedly from very, very young into her teenage years when her brother took over. She didn’t remember any of it until she was forty-one. She remembered the part with her brother. She was diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder. She had gone through a suicidal phase, when I was seventeen, and the psychiatrist in the psych ward wouldn’t let her talk about her childhood. He only wanted to focus on her marriage.
GE: It takes all kinds.
AS: That was in ‘84. By ‘92 things had changed in terms of talking about it. Then there’s also the False Memory Syndrome which set her back a lot. She confronted her father and she lost all of her siblings. She now talks to two of them.
GE: Because of all of this.
AS: They disowned her. They didn’t even tell her when their dad died. 
GE: He’s the one that raped.
AS: Oh yes, her dad. So I understand very deeply the consequences of what incest does to a family.
GE: What my brother asked me with our initial conversation when I said I forgive you and I want to go on. He said, “Are you going to tell Linda and my daughters?” I said, “Gale that’s between you and your wife and your daughters.”
AS: Yes. That won’t be me. 
GE: Not going to be me. I said, “I love Linda and I love your daughters.” [Dog Barks].
AS: I jump when the dogs bark. [Laughs]. If I’m standing up I’m fine.
GE: It’s the UPS drivers. She thinks she has control over it because she barks and then it goes away.
AS: Oh yes. I don’t know Gloria maybe at some point later as we’re talking. I mean to me, the things that you experienced, that incident as a child prepared you. Your attempt at healing from it is what gave you the training and the insight into the kind of havoc and trauma that addiction can reap. Right?
GE: Aaron was abused by a babysitter. He remembered it. Of course people thought it’s just a drug. It came up after smoking pot. I begged him and begged him and begged him. He knew, my kids knew what had happened. I said, “You have to get help now.” I think that part of the therapy, after he came back here and tried to recover. When he was in the height of his using he wouldn’t deal with it. I tried and tried. How do you make somebody do something? How do you make your kid do? I mean if I had the answer to that.
AS: I mean you don’t. You couldn’t send them away.
GE: “I can’t believe after what you went through you didn’t just make him.” I said, “How am I going to make him do that?” That’s all part of my story. You can’t make anybody do anything. You got to love them where they’re at. Remind them. Part of one of the reasons why you may not sleep at night is because of this. They need some help.
AS: So he was using…maybe we should back up and talk about Aaron.
GE: Aaron. 
AS: First born.
GE: First born. Very ugly baby, very beautiful person.
AS: [Laughs].
GE: Very pointed head, erratic labor and delivery. I had two miscarriages before him. He would often say, “I don’t know why I wasn’t just one of those miscarriages and just died.” He hated his life, just so much. “Why couldn’t I have been one of those miscarriages?”
AS: When did he start saying that?
GE: Pretty deep in his addiction when he was trying to recover. He was a miracle baby. One of those vivacious, incredibly demanding, insightful, intuitive kids. Like all people with substance disorders are.
AS: It seems that way. Almost everyone describes their child like that. 
GE: Extremely sensitive and very bright and picked up on, I’m sure, the marital discord. His younger brother when I told him we were getting divorced, Aaron said, “Well I wondered when.” And Jeff said, “What are you talking about?” Totally not aware that there was any problems in there. Probably I told Aaron too much. My former husband travelled all the time. Aaron was kind of my surrogate partner; inappropriately I’m sure at some point. I don’t know. He was pretty aware of the discord. There was always dragging into family therapy, trying to save the marriage. My former husband became the bad guy because he was an alcoholic and wouldn’t give any time to family. Based upon what you know about me I of course had abandonment issues that I think came out that way.
He didn’t have a particularly easy childhood until we divorced. He just wasn’t going to follow any custody arrangements. So he started running away from home. That actually happened, I’m trying to remember. I don’t know how much of the running away from home had to do with drug use. I really don’t know. I never talked to him about that. If he ran away from home so he could use drugs or if that became part of…As he got older and with the ADHD school became more of a challenge, he couldn’t coast. The less he could coast the more disruptive he would become. 
AS: Where did he go to school?
GE: Bloomington. Bloomington Public Schools. Finally we put him in Minnehaha Academy his seventh grade year hoping that a more structured environment would help. He found the element there. His best friend’s name was Aaron also. They started smoking pot and messing around. It didn’t seem to help.
AS: Is that when he first started smoking pot, in seventh grade? Do you think it was before that?
GE: I would say. Well Aaron, and I have this in the book, Aaron’s first experience with euphoria was accidentally sniffing gas when he was mowing the lawn. He never forgot how that felt. [Long Pause]. I never found that out until he was in treatment. He was in his twenties before I ever heard that story. I think he stole alcohol when he was eleven, twelve and then we started locking it all up. I imagine he was smoking pot then. I know for sure by the time he was thirteen and fourteen it was a pretty regular thing. I think he was doing mushrooms, I think he was drinking. It all started in his early teen years. 
I was divorced by then, I was in graduate school, Bob and I had connected. I was madly in love. He was madly hating the whole thing. The divorce, not that he knew the divorce wasn’t justified for me, but he hated, he was mad at the world. I guess the way he chose to act. I don’t know if Ed and I would have stayed married if he wouldn’t have done the same thing. I don’t know. I get really mad when people talk about broken homes.
AS: Yes me too because I made one too. I broke one.
GE: I broke one too. 
AS: I’m not making light of it but there’s a stigma around that as well. If you do have a child who has an addiction that is always the reason. We never talk about the children of the parents who are still together; it must be because the parents are still together. I mean we don’t. We never want to talk about what the actual issue is, it’s blaming the mother who…
GE: Or the parents, or the divorce.
AS: Right.
GE: We were always very close. He had probably had a hate-love relationship with me. I tried all the tough love stuff. I was getting child support. He was living away from me and he said, “You’re getting child support for me. That money belongs to me.” I said, “That money is for you if you’re living at home. So if you want to come home and live at home and not use drugs you can have access to the money. Because you’ll be living here right? You’ll have access to everything that you want. You’ll have a life, you’ll have a family.”
AS: Where would he stay during all these times?
GE: He was living, he was couch hopping, living on the street. I mean he never lived on the street. One of the first places he lived was a block house off of 30th or 31st and Stevens I think. How could I ever forget that? That’s when he got the dog. At one point, I don’t know if you read the book or not.
AS: No, I would like to.
GE: He wanted to come home and bring the dog. I told him not to get the dog because I said, “I am not taking care of that dog when you decide you’re tired of it and can’t handle it on the street anymore.” And blah blah blah. Well he did it anyway. So guess who ended up with the dog eventually? That’s kind of my amends many years later when he couldn’t take care of the dog. That’s one of the first chapters in the book. It was about how you learn that the hard and fast rules don’t make any sense. Or the black and white rules don’t make any sense. I had a chance to have Aaron come back home when he was fourteen or fifteen if I would have let him bring his dog home. I told him he couldn’t because of the dog. 
AS: Oh he was fourteen or fifteen? Oh wow. 
GE: That’s what you’re supposed to do, the hard and fast line.
AS: Right. Be tough, be in charge.
GE: In charge of what?
AS: Right. Well that’s what you’re told or we’re told.
GE: Many years later he called me from Portland, Oregon and the dog had fleas. I think he was into heroin addiction then, I didn’t know it. He said, “Mom I can’t get rid of the fleas.” We have become, there are many times when he would come over to the house and bring the dog. We all got attached to the dog, it was a Rottweiler. A beautiful Rottweiler that he had trained magnificently. He fed her, took her to a holistic vet. He wouldn’t feed himself or take care of himself but he took care of the dog. He called me and said. You know it isn’t cold enough for fleas to die in Portland. He said, “I can’t get rid of the fleas. Maeve is really sick, she’s lost weight. If I pay money to send her home and give you money for the vet can I send her home to you? Will you take care of her and get her back on her feet? I’ll be home in the spring and I’ll take her.” He paid for everything, he always paid. He sent the crates and paid for it. He gave me money for the vet. I got the dog well but when he came home that spring he was never able to take her back on a full time basis. That was kind of my amends.
AS: How old was he at that point?
GE: I’d have to go in the book and look. That was hard.
AS: I didn’t realize your book was his story.
GE: Yes. The book is a lot of his story and not just my story but what I saw him going through trying to recover. 
AS: That’ll be useful. I’ll have to buy a copy from you.
GE: I think it would be very useful. He must have been like twenty five, twenty six. Early twenties. Let’s see. He was twenty five when he went to Wilmer and that happened after he came back here. I can’t remember. I’ll have to look in the book. 
AS: That’s alright.
GE: That felt like the next best thing to do, to take that dog back.
AS: Was this the same dog?
GE: The same dog, yes. There was a part of me that it was like if I had her I knew he’d stay in touch with me. All this went on with him before there were cell phones. So Aaron would be gone for weeks at a time. One time months at a time and I wouldn’t hear from him. I wouldn’t know if he was alive or dead. There’d be many times, weeks when I wouldn’t hear from him. He did carry a pager because he dealt drugs to support his habit. Not like the drugs that are available now. Oh my God. I think he did cook meth for a short period of time. Mostly it was mushrooms and pot and I suppose he was dealing heroin too. I don’t know. There’s a part of me that knew if I had the dog he’d stay in touch with me. So I had kind of an ulterior motive. It felt kind of like I had a part of him with me when I had the dog. It all sounds kind of stupid.
AS: No it makes perfect sense.
GE: Maeve was just such a wonderful dog. We all loved her. I ended up with his cat too. The cat, the dog. The cat died, I had to put the cat down a couple of days after Aaron died. I came home after doing funeral pre-preps and the cat was laying here on the couch, a different couch, in her own urine. Just laying there. I thought I’m getting ready to bury my son; I’m going to have a houseful. The only room where I could contain this cat was the utility room next to the downstairs bedroom, where my youngest brother was going to stay. The cat would be going “Meow, meow, meow, meow.” 
So I packed her up, took her to the vet. She was seventeen years old. She’d been missing the litterbox and those kinds of things anyways. I said, “I’ve got to put this cat down.” They said, “It sounds like she could have kidney problems.” I said, “Listen. This cat is seventeen years old. She’s been missing, pooping outside the litterbox. Sometimes she has poop dragging behind her because she doesn’t know.” I said, “My son just died. I want to put this cat down. I can’t deal with a sick cat right now.” “Well, this is not the time to make a decision.” “Well are you going to put my cat down or am I going to have to go someplace else?” It was horrible. She finally euthanized the cat. I never regretted it. The cat was ready to go. It was laying in its own urine. Right?
AS: Isn’t that something. When you just said my son just died and I can’t deal with this.
GE: Well then she said, “Well this isn’t the time.” Well really it makes logical sense.
AS: It makes sense in a textbook kind of way.
GE: I said, “I’m going to have a houseful of company. I’m going to put the cat down anyways. I’m going to tell you that. Why do I want to listen to a cat whine for five days? And worry about it.” Yet, I digress.
AS: Let’s backup. So Aaron. When does he finally move out? Tell me more about his teenage years. Does he never live at home after age fourteen?
GE: When Bob and I got married. 
AS: Does he finish high school?
GE: No. 
AS: What does he do?
GE: He got a GED finally at a Bethlehem Alternative School. Great experience for him. He met a girl, a very bright woman who was six years older than he was. They fell desperately in love. He was sixteen or seventeen and she was twenty five. She wanted to go to acupuncture school and I think she already had one college degree. I can’t remember. She wanted to go to New Mexico. Aaron was going too, they were going to move to New Mexico. I finally had some pictures taken of Aaron when he was eighteen, I didn’t have any high school graduation pictures.
When he went to New Mexico with her we had this kind of ceremony, a family ceremony where we all said goodbye to him. I bought one of these big round candles that had five wicks and then a wick in the middle. We each said something. He cried through the whole thing. We all said something we loved about him and we were going to miss him, that he’d always take the candle so he’d know he’d always be part of us. We each had a candle that we saved then. I was afraid I was going to be really emotional. It was really fun because it was nice to see him be emotional instead of me. I often wondered if he got emotional because I didn’t. He did do some Junior College. 
His father bought him another car. He totaled one car, never got a driver’s license until he was twenty. His father bought him a little pickup truck. Which of course was great because he could do drug running with it. But he was under our insurance until he totaled it. Then my insurance was cancelled because he was under twenty five. I said, “If you ever buy him another car, you’re going to have to figure out the insurance. I’m done. I’m done giving him money. I’m done giving him anything. I think you’re enabling him. You gave him a car. At least don’t give him another car.” But he did. That’s how Aaron got to New Mexico. He took some Junior College classes down there. I’d hear from his girlfriend, “Aaron just won’t get a job.” Well he was smoking a lot of pot. It’s kind of hard to work and smoke pot daily right? Then she wanted to finish acupuncture school in Portland. So they went there. That’s when I think he got into the heroin. 
AS: Around what year is this? The early 2000s?
GE: No, this is in the 90s.
AS: Oh okay. 
GE: I got married in ‘91. So this all happened early 90s. Twenty years ago. Twenty five years ago. It was one of those times when we were in Portland when he sent the dog home, after they got up there. She’d call and complain, “Aaron won’t get a job.” She knew he was using heroin. She never told me. Here’s the power of Aaron and relationships. They ended up, long story short; they ended up hating each other’s guts, he and this first woman. When Aaron died she took planes, trains, and automobiles to get back for his service. The woman that found Sophie was his last girlfriend. The other one in between. He had three really long term relationships. They loved him desperately. Of course they were all co-dependent relationships. There was something about him that you just couldn’t resist. The picture of him is very handsome, charming, witty. He was very caring. He could be very emotionally present for women. Which is always a big draw right? 
AS: What year was Aaron born?
GE: ‘73. He would be forty three this October. Finally, he came back and he and Marla broke up. Or did he come back with her? Oh I shouldn’t have said her name. 
AS: It’s okay. We can take it out. 
GE: I can’t remember. How can I forget this? He finally said he was coming back. She was staying out there and finishing. I guess he wanted to come back or something. Or they broke up. I can’t remember. He came back. He said, “I found somebody. I’ve got a roommate but they won’t let me have the dog.” It was all very mysterious. Finally one day he showed up with another woman that he said was his roommate. I think they were just friends for a while. 
He just looked like hell. He’d always come to visit me. So he’s back in Minneapolis but I didn’t see very much of him. He’d always come to visit me during the day. The kids were at school. You know, I was still doing this business out of my home. He just looked like hell. Finally this kind of went on I think for about six months, for a while. He’d come to see the dog and talk with me and then he’d vanish for days. I get this call. We’re doing this big seminar for my business and Bob’s father had just died. I get this call from him. He says, “Mom I’m really sick and I’ve got to get to the clinic. Can you give me a ride? I’m up in Northeast.” I just, it’s seven thirty in the morning, and I’ve just gotten out of the shower. I’m putting on this big thing; Bob’s brothers are in town because his father just died. I’m saying, “Honey if you’re really sick but I just got out of the shower.” “The clinic closes at nine o’clock. I’ve got to get to the clinic to get my medicine before.” I don’t know nothing about Methadone. I don’t even know he’s a heroin addict. 
AS: At this point. 
GE: So this is before GPS or anything. I say, “Give me the address.” I put it into MapQuest, I print my directions. “You be standing out there on the corner, out in front of the house so I can get you.” It’s up in Northeast. I get in the car, I go pick him up and he gets in the car. He looks like somebody who’s had the flu. He’s in withdrawal right. He’s got on somebody else’s holey sweater. I said, “When is the last time you bathed?” He said, “Mom just don’t talk to me. Can you just get me there?” I said, “Where’s the clinic?” He says, “Burnsville.” I said, “What are you doing going to a health clinic in Burnsville?” “Just get me to the clinic.” So your kids sick, you haven’t seen him for days. The last time you saw him he looks like death warmed over. Now he looks like three deaths warmed over. So are you going to take him to where he wants to go? Sure. 
I get him out there and there’s this non-descript clinic. There’s no name on it or nothing. He said, “I need five dollars for the co-pay. Can I borrow five bucks from you?” I said, “Sure. Don’t worry about paying me back.” So I get out of the car he says, “No, no, no. You don’t need to come in.” So he goes in, he comes back. He gets in the car and about twenty minutes later and it’s like he’s in a stupor. He gets in the car and kind of slumps down in the edge of the corner and I said, “What is going on?” He said, “Just drive. Can I come home and cleanup? Can I just come back to the house and just cleanup? Just drive.” So I start driving down Cliff Road from this. It’s clear he’s nodding off and on. I’m thinking I took him somewhere to get high, right? I don’t know what’s going on. I stop at this park, I pull over and I said, “Tell me what the hell is going on. What is going on? You’re high!” He said, “I went to a Methadone clinic.” I said, “Meth-o-what?” He said, “Methadone. It’s something they give people when they’re trying to get off of heroin.” That was the first time I knew he was a heroin addict. I just went nuts.
AS: Do you remember what year this is?
GE: It’s in my book. No. I don’t.
AS: Is it long before he dies?
GE: Oh yes, yes. Long time before he dies. This is ten years before he dies.
AS: Oh okay. That helps.
GE: I just start pommeling him with questions. He said, “I’ll tell you everything. I know I’ve got to get off of heroin. I’ve been trying. I’m hoping this is going to help. Can we talk later?” It was always can we talk later. I drove home. He said, “Can I just go to bed? I haven’t slept for days.” I tucked him into his bed upstairs and just held him, hoping. You know how you hold your kid and you think it’s going to make it all better? That was the beginning of my journey with heroin and opiates and watching him go through treatment time and time again. And try to make Methadone work and abuse Methadone and sell Methadone and not be on Methadone and use pot when he was on Methadone. Until his last gallant effort with Dr. French. 
AS: What was that? Tell me that.
GE: He went to Wilmer and went through treatment. Back then it was all, complete abstinence when you were in treatment. When he went to Wilmer, he was court ordered to Wilmer. He went into a pizza place high and they found opiates on him. 
AS: There were like cops in there or something?
GE: Yes. He was probably visibly high and the cops happened to drive by and they caught him. There were a lot of times he would be thrown in jail. He wouldn’t have any on him but because he was publicly intoxicated. He’d call us for bail and I would bail him out. One time afterwards, he told me this years afterwards, he was thrown in jail for public intoxication and he was on opiates so he was in withdrawal by that time. He had, at times he had large amounts of cash because he was dealing. He hired this feisty lawyer to bail him out. He had no car and his girlfriend didn’t have a car. It took him five hours to crawl home because he was in withdrawal.
AS: Oh my Gosh. 
GE: Because I wouldn’t come pick him up. 
AS: Had you picked him up before? What was your process like as a mother with this?
GE: I never when he was jailed. I was all wrapped up in it being about…it was not declared a brain illness until 2011. Aaron died in 2007. All of my training as a psychotherapist was this is a behavior or a personality disorder. Although the American Medical Association declared it an illness in 1956 so you could get reimbursed for it as a disease. Treatment centers still treated it as a behavior disorder or personality disorder. They didn’t treat it as a brain illness. 
AS: It was a personality flaw.
GE: It was all cognitive behavior therapy. We’ve got to learn to change your behavior, there’s something wrong with your behavior. You’re broken. 
AS: So would you say that when he’s called to get out of jail you’ve already been dealing with him since he was thirteen, fourteen. You’re still in your kind of tough love thing?
GE: He broke the law I figured he needed to…
AS: Right. Live with the consequences of what he was doing. Right. He was using illegal drugs.
GE: Right. It wasn’t until…So I went to Wilmer.
AS: What is Wilmer?
GE: Wilmer Regional Treatment Center. He was court ordered there. He spent a month there and then he went to Prodigal House which had a pretty good reputation for repeat opiate offenders of being the right place to be. Unfortunately, Aaron teamed up with four guys in treatment and they all went to Prodigal House together. They were the band of brothers. He got out of Prodigal House and got a job driving cab but started using. As long as he was working I said he could live at home. So he did come back home. He lived in our basement. I had other kids at home but he was driving cab. Well then I found vodka in there, I found vodka in his room. He smashed up cars and couldn’t drive cab anymore because he was using. Where are we in the story? I don’t know. Then he hooked up with this last girlfriend, the one that found Sophie. She supported him for a long, long time. So he didn’t live at home. She would constantly call me, “Aaron this, Aaron that.”
AS: How many years were they together?
GE: A long time. I’d have to call her and ask her.
AS: That’s okay. Ten years?
GE: Maybe not that long. She finally broke up with him before he made this last gallant effort. She couldn’t take it anymore. They were maybe together five or six years. She was not around the last three years of his life. He wrote her letters to let her know that he was really trying. Not to try to get her back but, “I just want to let you know…Mom’s even let me drive the car. I’m starting to get my parents trust back.” When he died she just hated it that she never got in touch with him. It’s her biggest regret. She still loved him. She was in another relationship but nobody ever loved her the way that Aaron did. When I finally grasped…after he died, I didn’t really grasp this whole idea of addiction as a brain illness until after he died. 
AS: Yes, that’s what I’m thinking.
GE: It was through my continued training through MRC as a recovery coach and all my continued investigation. There were just so many things about Aaron that didn’t add up. There wasn’t anything that kid couldn’t do when he set his mind to it. When he wanted to recover and couldn’t. I’d see him try treatment after treatment after treatment after treatment and be so self-deprecating and not get it. Why can’t you get this? Then when I started reading it’s a brain illness characterized by compulsive drug seeking despite harmful consequences. I thought that’s what’s wrong with him, it’s his brain. It’s not Aaron. It’s not his personality, it’s not his character.
 I’m telling you there was not a more loyal. Yet he’d lie to me, he was deceptive in his illness and all that. I’m talking about loyal to the core to his family, to his siblings, to me. He had an incredible relationship with his stepdaughter. He just idolized Bob. He finally saw what a marriage was supposed to be. He saw somebody that loved his mother the way that he wanted his mother to be loved and respected. That’s what really made me really want to write the book and tell other parents. There was somewhere along the line before he died. Like about five years before when I got the lightbulb that I’m not going to fix this.
AS: Five years before.
GE: About five years before.
AS: What was that moment?
GE: I don’t remember what did that. [Long Pause]. It was this realization that I wanted a relationship with him no matter what, whether he was sober, whether he was using. I couldn’t stand it when we were at odds. How could I take care of myself in the relationship and still maintain a relationship with him? But make the boundaries about what I needed in the relationship not about trying to control his use. That wasn’t going to work. When Bob and I made that whole switch about, no you can’t be in the house when you’re using we’ll still see you, we want to stay in touch with you, blah blah blah. When you’re in recovery and you come to any family event but you come high I’m going to take you home. All these things. What I needed to feel safe. You can’t stay in the house when you’re using because I don’t know who’s going to show up at the door. I don’t sleep when you’re using in the house. It’s not a good thing for me. It’s not about trying to control you, this isn’t good for me. 
AS: How did you come to that? Did you go to any meetings? 
GE: No, it was like Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It was like God finding. My higher power finally sent me a message: you are not going to change him. What do you want to do if he dies, how do you want to remember your relationship with him? It really Amy, it was like…I write about this in the book. It was the reading. It was the July 5th reading in the Al-Anon Blue Book.
AS: The Nar-Anon Blue Book?
GE: No the Al-Anon Book.  I never went to Nar-Anon meetings.
AS: Oh okay. There probably wasn’t one.
GE: One day at a time. Is that what it is? Oh yes, there was Nar-Anon.
AS: Oh there was. 
GE: It said, here it is this was the turning point for me. I’d read this a million times right. “The non-alcoholic in the family doesn’t seem to realize that the alcoholic is in a terribly vulnerable position, he must be constantly be on guard because he knows, deep down inside how much trouble he’s bringing to the family. He knows he’s wide open to criticism but did it ever occur to you that your tantrums and harsh words are like whipping a sick dog. Remember he’s lashing himself all the time. If you apply more lashes you’re inviting him to transfer some of his guilt to you. This can keep him from reaching his bottom and realizing how much he needs help to find sobriety. Today’s reminder: I will try to understand how desperately the alcoholic suffers from guilt. I will not yield to impulse to kick him when he’s down. We both suffer in different ways from the alcoholism. I who have God’s gift of sobriety must be the one to realize his dissatisfaction with himself no matter how defiant and defensive he may appear. If I were unfortunate enough to be an alcoholic how would I hope to be treated by the person I live with? The golden rule is a useful tool in all our personal relationships.” I realized I would treat a street person better than I was treating my own son. That did it. I just said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here but I’m going to start having a little compassion for the fact that he is sick.” The whole illness concept hadn’t even come into being yet. 
AS: But you saw it as a mom?
GE: I was picking it up on some kind of collective unconscious self. 
AS: Well you’re also just watching it.
GE: Yes over and over. Right.
AS: You saw him trying and failing and trying.
GE: He never tried and failed at anything else in his life. He was a very resourceful drug dealer. He honestly never carried a gun Amy. I want you to know that my son was an honest drug dealer. 
AS: That’s great.[Laughs]. 
GE: You’ll have to read the book.
AS: Oh I’m going to, tonight.
GE: Bob and I just started changing. We started being compassionate and it was all about where we were and what we needed, when we can help support your recovery. Aaron would call and ask me for help and the question was: is this going to support his recovery or is it going to enable his using? Those were my questions. That’s all in the book. “Oh God Mom I missed a doctor’s appointment. It’s too late to catch the bus; can you give me a ride?” Well, doctor’s appointment, I’ve got to get him to the doctor. “Well what’s this appointment for?” Was it going to interfere with my work schedule and destruct the rest of the family? I had to decide was helping him going to be as good for all of us as it was for him? Now if it was a matter of life and death with him that’s a different matter. I also started basing every circumstance on what was going on now not all the shit that went before. That’s where a lot of parents, well I’m not going to trust him now because…
AS: Because of all this other…
GE: You know what? If he was going to make me untrustworthy I would know and then I couldn’t trust him again. So what? Nobody was going to lose a life or if my property wasn’t going to be damaged. You know what I mean? You’ve got to start building trust again somewhere. Start it and see what happens. The more we trusted him the more trustworthy he became. 
AS: Even in his addiction.
GE: Even in his addiction, yes. Then he started talking about, “You know Mom I’d read about these ultra-rapid detox.” That sounded a horrible, horrible, horrible experience. Except for the fact that I didn’t go with him, his father, his birth father stepped up and went with him and paid for it. It was the only time Ed was ever completely responsibly for Aaron’s emotional and physical well-being. He told me it was the best time he’d ever had with Aaron, it was the best $10,000 he ever spent in his life.  They finally connected emotionally before Aaron died. I said to Aaron, I said, “If you want to do this you can come over to the house, you can use the computer to look at websites, use the phone to make long-distance phone calls. But I’m not going to go through that with you.” 
I watched him withdraw from heroin, opiates so many times. I heard the vomiting and the constant dry heaving. I was in Post-Traumatic Stress watching him withdraw from heroin so many times, and opiates, trying to go down on his Methadone. I said, “I can’t do it Aaron. I can’t do it.” So then Jeff thinks that he’s going to go. You’ve got to drive to Chicago, you spend a night in the hospital, and they do a physical. This was a reputable place. Then the procedure is this, the Naloxone I think it’s now Naloxone, but it’s an opiate antagonist that is intravenously run through your body while you’re sedated, intubated. 
AS: Oh I’ve heard of this.
GE: It’s supposed to make the withdrawal shorter. Then you get in the hospital the day afterwards and supposedly stabilize and then you get in the car and then you drive home from Chicago. So Jeff thinks, Aaron’s brother, thinks he’ll do it. I said, “So when Aaron is vomiting and having diarrhea all the way home from Chicago what are you going to do?” “Well I’ll pull off at a rest stop.” “How long are you going to be able to stay there? How many days you going to take off work?” I said, “Jeffery he’s going to be violently ill.” “Well this is supposed to not…” “Trust me.” So finally Ed stepped up to the plate and said, he was retired, and said, “I’ll take him.” I just had to ask Jeff all kinds of…I said this is really valiant of you to do this but I don’t think you have any idea. You’ve never seen anybody in opiate withdrawal. You have no idea what you’re getting yourself into. 
AS: So what was going on with Jeff this whole time?
GE: That’s a whole chapter in the book.
AS: That’s another story. [Laughs].
GE: Jeff and I finally have made amends. It took a long time, and he still doesn’t trust me when I say I’m going to show up for him. And he’s thirty eight. It’s just that the sibling fallout. You’ve got to understand Aaron abandoned Jeff. 
AS: Oh yes, at the divorce. 
GE: So there was such a love-hate relationship and all the addiction. Jeff had his own issues. Aaron was never there for him. It just took a long, long time for us to heal. I just kept saying to him because of that last five years with Aaron and the positive experience I had, instead of trying to fix him I just kept saying, “Jeff I know that you’re not yourself.” He was just angry after Aaron died. You couldn’t even talk to him. Oh my God just angry, angry. “Something’s going on. I don’t know if you’re using drugs. I don’t know what it is. You are not yourself. I love you, I care about you. I can’t help you. You need help. When you’re ready to get help I’ll support you. I’m not going anywhere in between. I can’t help you with this issue. When you are screaming and yelling you’re going to have to leave the house or I’m going to call the police. I’m not going to take that kind of behavior in my home.”
AS: Was he screaming and yelling at you?
GE: Oh yes, everything. He just totally…Jeff was the most easy-going, lovable, teddy-bear. Everybody loved Jeff. Man it totally changed. 
AS: What were the circumstances of Aaron’s death? Where was he?
GE: Well he got back from that ultra-rapid detox process and my former husband was supposed to leave him at his apartment. He was still violently ill but he had medical marijuana stashed. He thought he was going to smoke his way out of the after effects of the thing. Ed left him off at about seven o’clock and Aaron called me at nine thirty or ten and said, “Mom I can’t stop vomiting. I’m really worried. I don’t think I should be alone. I think I need to go to the hospital.” I picked him up and took him to Fairview South and so there I am watching him in opiate withdrawal anyway. I got him admitted to the hospital and he proceeded, and this is all in the book, he proceeded to continue to vomit for ten days. Even rectal suppositories, he was on the IVs, he had this terrible taste in his mouth from the Naloxone or whatever that antagonist was they did intravenously. He couldn’t keep anything down. He was continually swishing his mouth with sodas. The hospital complained so I had to bring in soda. 
AS: Oh because he was drinking too much of their soda. 
GE: Yes, right. Get this. He called an AA and asked for a sponsor, asked for somebody to come to the hospital to talk to him. They said, “Do you have a sponsor.” He said, “No.” “Well we can’t help you unless you have a sponsor.” He reached out. He was so sick and I had a lot of friends in the program. I don’t know why I didn’t think about just calling. It’s like well they said that no one can talk to him unless he has a sponsor, must be true. Finally the doctor up at Fairview, at the hospital, said, “I’m going to put him…” You know he was just aghast that we ever did this ultra-rapid detox thing. He said, “The only way we’re going to get any homeostasis is to put him back on a small amount of Methadone.” Ed was supposed to fly back home. When Aaron was so ill and I put him back in the hospital I called him and said, “I don’t think you should go home.” So Ed and I and Bob took turns being up in the hospital with him. 
Finally the doctor had a meeting with all three of us and said, “I’m going to put him back on Methadone.” We just like jumped out of the chair because in order to get him to detox they had to switch him from Methadone to Dilaudid. The ultra-rapid detox center said, “Well we can’t detox him directly off of Methadone. He’ll have to be on Dilaudid for ten days.” Aaron knew it would work. He was wondering if it would work. He’d used Dilaudid on the street enough. So it kept him stable, kept him in withdrawal enough. He just wanted to be off of Methadone. He just couldn’t stand going to the clinic. He was becoming very black and white, again no education. “You know what Aaron? It would be ok to be on a small amount of Methadone for the rest of your life.” 
AS: Right, nobody said that?
GE: He knew some guys that were but I had my own stigma about it Amy. The only thing I got was this pamphlet and I write about this in the book, called “About Methadone.” It explained. He said, “Mom I want you to read this.” He was trying his best to get me. All I saw was how he abused Methadone not how useful it was. I’d see him kind of get stable and then they’d take him down. Then he’d start using pot or heroin along with it. 
AS: He needed to stay stable. 
GE: For a long, long, long time. Right? He could never get his life in order. He was always either in withdrawal or using on the street. You know what I mean? There was never a period of stability on Methadone.  
AS: That was allowed to happen.
GE: There were a few times but every time he’d get there, he’d want to start tapering again. He’d say, “I can’t be on this anymore.” 
AS: There’s jitteriness and an anxiety.
GE: “I can’t be on this.” All the stigma and lack of education about medication, treatment is. Now I know that Aaron’s disease had progressed to the point where he could not recover.
AS: Without it.
GE: Without it. It wasn’t available to him in the way that it should have been. I kept trying to make it about he was dishonest, I write about this all in the book. I stigmatized him for even years after he died. Big book says he can recover if you keep him being honest. Aaron was always a little liar as a kid.
AS: Wow, Gloria that’s tough.
GE: I’ve got a whole chapter in there. I mean when somebody dies there’s got to be a reason. I had to have some…he just couldn’t work a recovery program. He just wasn’t honest enough to work a recovery program. When in fact his disease had progressed to the point where he couldn’t recover with what was being offered him. It was somebody; I went to speak at St. Joe’s, which was the last treatment center he was in. Anyways, I digress. 
So he goes to ultra-rapid detox. They put him back, finally we agreed, puts him on five milligrams or twenty milligrams of Methadone and “Bam” he is well. He hasn’t eaten or kept anything down for two weeks. The guy says, “I got a bed for you at Fairview Riverside, now. Do you want to go?” Aaron said, “How can I possibly go through treatment? I haven’t eaten for days.” He wasn’t hardly stable. He said, “Hey Mom could I just come home and just get some good nutrition in my body and get stable? Then I’ll go.” I truly believed this was the truth. I said, “Fine you’ve got two weeks.” Then I knew he would be put on the proverbial waiting list. He didn’t take the bed then. 
He came home and I kind of nursed him back. The longer he was on Methadone the craving, you know he went to recovery meetings to begin with and then the cravings would increase. He didn’t get into treatment in two weeks. I said, “You’ve got to go back to your apartment.” I’d given him the two weeks. He went back to his apartment. He finally got into Fairview Riverside. They started taking him off the Methadone and the step down was too fast. He got sick all over again. Riverside was abstinence based no Naloxone. So he couldn’t go from Methadone to Naloxone. That’s usually what they do now. If you’re trying to get off Methadone you get on to fifty milligrams of Methadone and then you go on Naloxone. They tried to step him down too quick and he got sick and couldn’t finish treatment. So he went back to his apartment and started doing research. He found David French at St. Joe’s. He was one of the first doctors to use Clonidine. Which helps with, it’s a blood pressure medication that helps with.
AS: Was he? My daughter used that.
GE: This was like 2007. He read about French and didn’t really like the program at St. Joe’s because he’d been through one before but he liked French. His insurance was so short. You left treatment there’s no way you’re going to get back in treatment again.
AS: Even though he was sick?
GE: If I go score some heroin, shoot up, go into the emergency room, and say I’m suicidal and that I’m drug addict they’ll have to admit me. So he got back into treatment at a hospital. It’s in the book. That’s how desperate he was. So he gets into St. Joe’s. 
AS: He totally understood the system by this point.
GE: Oh yes. He gets into St. Joe’s. He loves Dr. French. He is only supposed to get three weeks of treatment. He gets a social worker to petition. He gets another week of treatment but he is told, “You will not get any more money. You won’t be able to go to treatment for another two years if this doesn’t work.” This has got to work. He tells them when he goes in, “I do not want to be on any medication at all. When I leave here, Mom I can’t be a controlled addict. I want to be off of all medications. I don’t want to be on any anti-anxiety medications. I don’t want to be on any antidepressants. I want to be off of everything when I leave here. I said, “Aaron let’s just deal with the Methadone. Let’s just go through treatment.” He’s an adult, right? He’s thirty three. So they do what he wants. 
By the end of the third week he is going nuts. He can’t sleep. So all these emotions that have been suppressed for all these years by the anti-anxiety medications and the heroin and the pot are coming to the surface. We’ve got the angry addict back again. He said, “If I don’t get out of this place I’m going to kill myself or somebody else.” I said, “Aaron this is the time you need to stay. I really implore you do not go off all your medications. Just worry about the Methadone.” We used the term opiates then. “Let’s just worry about treatment of opiates.” “I’ve got to get out of here. I’m going to see how soon I can get out.” I called the nurse and said, “He is threatening himself or other people. He threatened that he was going to kill himself or other people. You cannot let him out.” “Well he hasn’t said that to us.” Right? See he knows. He’s agreed to an out-patient day program. “Since he’s been in treatment so long, so many days we feel that.” I said, “He needs to be up on the psych ward. Put him on a seventy two hour hold.” “We have no basis to do that. You can do that. You can commit him. I’ll give you the paperwork. You can commit him to the psych ward for five days.”
AS: As his mom.
GE: The one thing that Aaron has always said to me, he signed release after release. I was always privy to any information. He said with one caveat, “Never ever commit me. I don’t know if I could ever forgive you.” My codependency bought into that. I saw him committed by another doctor one other time. I saw him on a seventy two hour hold in the psych ward. He talked his way to the social worker, the psychiatrist, and the psychologist. I knew that if Aaron didn’t want the help he wasn’t going to get it. Was it worth damaging my relationship, our relationship? No.
In the end, when he went through this last effort I promised him I would support him in whatever he wanted to do treatment his way. I was going to let him do it. I was the support person not the mastermind. I had always been the mastermind. It was the one regret I have, that I didn’t commit him. Maybe something could have been different for him. 
AS: So he gets out?
GE: He gets out. I pick him up on Tuesday and I take him back to his apartment. He’s really agitated. I say, “Can I get you some groceries?” I know he wants to go back to his apartment because he’s going to smoke pot. “Can I do anything? Do you need food?” He said, “No, get me home.” I said, “Okay.” I had a meeting at the Woman’s Club the next day which is right down the street. His father was furnishing him an apartment. It was a nice one-bedroom apartment. I helped him; I was with him when he signed the rental papers. He was in school at the time. He got it and his father kept it up. Anyways, I said, “I’ll be back on Wednesday.” 
So I come back on Wednesday. He said, “Hey Mom, I want to change everything around in the apartment. I don’t want anything to be like what it was when I was using here. I don’t want it to look or feel the same. When can you and Bob…” He was on the last part of his medications. He’d gone to outpatient treatment. He really liked it. He could get on the train and get there and get home. He had it all figured out. He was happy with the arrangement. He was in a very good mood when I saw him on that day. His brother Jeff was going to come over and watch movies with him that night. I had this big event I was putting on for my business on Thursday night. I said, “I can’t do anything until the weekend.” Then his stepbrother’s birthday party was Friday night. I said, “Saturday we’ll come over. We’ll help you move everything around.” He said, “Great.” “You need anything?” “No, I’m fine.” So Jeff came over and watched movies with him that night and he gave Jeff a copy of William Burroughs book. What is it?
AS: Junkies
GE: No not Junkies. 
AS: Chronicle something. Yes.
GE: He said, “Here, I think you’ll find this good reading.” Aaron and I, I got him a cell phone. Put him on our cell phone plan a long time before that, when he came back to the cities. The deal was that he got four hundred minutes and he had to pay the ten dollars that it cost me to add another phone. I said, “You go beyond the minutes I’m cutting off your phone and I want that ten dollars every month.” Never missed a payment. He went over once. He called me and said, “I’m going over minutes. I understand my phone’s going to be turned off.” Never did he ever abuse it. People say, “You’re giving a drug addict a phone?” I said, “He’s going to make drug deals anyways. I have access to him this way.” The other deal was that he call me every morning at seven thirty and let me know he was okay. Every day, seldom if he was late, and he always ended it with, “Goodbye Mom. I love you.” He called me Thursday morning to check in after this great experience on Wednesday. “I’m not doing well. But I don’t want to focus on me. Let’s talk about Matt’s birthday party. Should I ride the bus out to your house and go out there? Or should Bob pick me up?” I said, “How about we figure that out on Friday. I’ve got this big thing.” I was very preoccupied with this event. I said, “Are you sure there isn’t anything you want to talk about?” 
The day I picked him up from the hospital on Tuesday, I called to make arrangements to pick him up. He said, “I had this dream, the strangest dream. I dreamed I was a Tibetan monk and I was coming out of a cave. I said in a language that I don’t know but I understood what I said to the guy next to me. ‘It’s been twenty years and it’s time for me to go home.’ Don’t you think that’s odd?” I said, “Wow Aaron. Maybe its twenty years it’s time for you to recover. Maybe that’s what it’s all about.” I think he had a premonition of his own death. I said, “Let’s be in touch on Friday.” I kept trying to call him on Friday. He didn’t call Matt and say he wasn’t coming to the birthday party. His sister-in-law had had surgery. Very close to his aunt, very close to Bob’s sister-in-law. Didn’t call and check with her. There were times when Aaron decided at the last minute, “I can’t do a family event.” So he just wouldn’t communicate with me. I didn’t think that much about it. 
We got to the birthday party. “Where’s Aaron?” “Well he must have decided not to come. Matt did you talk to him? Did he call you?” “No.” Another really weird thing. On the way home Bob and I are having this silent thing. I just had this odd feeling, this premonition. We were both just exhausted because we’d gone to this big business thing and I just kept trying to call Aaron. No answer, no answer. I woke up at one o’clock. Came home, went to bed. I said, “We’re going to go down there Saturday morning if I can’t get ahold of him.” I woke up at one o’clock in the morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. For some reason when we had rented the apartment I kept the super’s, the caretaker’s card. I threw it in my desk somewhere. I spent a couple hours finding that card. It was in a secure building. I started calling her at seven AM. I finally got ahold of her. She was showing apartments other places. I said, “I’ve got to go check on my son. I’m afraid something’s happened to him.” We found him at one o’clock. It was clear that he was dead; I think he overdosed on Thursday night sometime. That was the last time anybody had contacted him. Now they confiscate cell phones and all that trying to find out who they got the drugs from. Bob and I took his phone and started calling people. We couldn’t find out. Nobody cared that he died of a heroin overdose, in 2007. No. He was a junkie. 
AS: I’m sorry. 
GE: I know you are. I know you understand.
AS: I do.
GE: We did have a great relationship the last five years. He came over here. He was on Methadone take-outs once a week. He got his Methadone on Tuesday morning and he’d come over here and spend Monday night. He’d take my car to the clinic. He was gone with the car just for exactly the right amount of time. He was supposed to come back and then he made me breakfast on Tuesday mornings. That was our time together. 
AS: At what point did you start on the journey that Aaron, you said that for a while you stigmatized him, you did things to try to explain it to yourself. Then what was your turning point?
GE: I needed a reason for him to die so I could go on I think. I needed to blame something. I’ve been a writer all my life. I just have tons and tons of journal stuff. He died in May; I went to grief groups in the fall. They were just horrendous experiences. There weren’t very many people that were dying of opiates back then. It was just starting to come about. Nobody understood, like the majority of people now, that addiction is an illness. The underlying thing was, number one: my son was a drug addict but what did I expect? Of course he’s going to die. His life doesn’t have the value of my son who was a college athlete. That died of something else or you know what I mean? Almost seventy five percent of the parents I was in with, whose children died of accidental deaths were drug or alcohol related. Right? One girl stepped off a platform and went through to the tracks because she was drunk, on a platform in New York City, and got hit by the subway. It was because she was drunk, she was high. It was because that platform was not made correctly and he sued the city of New York. Which is probably, anybody probably could have stepped off. I just found myself educating them about addiction and trying to defend my son. I thought I am here for support.
AS: This is not working.
GE: This is not working. I went back to my Al-Anon group and got support there. They understood addiction at least. They could understand the double loss, the ambiguous loss. They got that. That was just killing me. You’ve got to understand, I was a person who did motivational seminars. I was the person that taught people you can do or be anything you want. I was the symbol of hope eternal. When he died it died. I didn’t know, I had no idea who I really was. I felt like I lost my own identity. I couldn’t practice what I preached. That you can do anything you really want. 
AS: You must be a fake then.
GE: Right. That shit doesn’t work. A friend gave me a book. I can’t remember exactly. It was about a kid that committed suicide. Her son committed suicide because he had mental illness. He purposely drove, created an accident. She was a person like me. She’s in a coffee shop and she’s hearing two people talk about, “You know, I drove around the block and I just envisioned that a parking place was going to appear and it did.” What her experience was after losing her son and listening to a conversation like that. Boy could I relate to that. I wrote a poem about it. I just started all this journaling about grief. I just have reams and reams. What this was like for the last twenty years. 
I got out of the car one day. In network marketing you can continue to earn income, I mean if it’s a real buyable company, without continuing to build. I was just living off of residual income. I just couldn’t do anything after he died. I just didn’t have that. My soul was gone. I got out of the car at Zumba one day. I was praying, “God show me where I’m supposed to go and what I’m supposed to do now.” I get out of the car one day and God said, “You need to write. You need to write a grief book about this. You need to put all this stuff into a book.” So I started that whole process and kind of got this huge conglomeration of stuff together. Part of it was sort of like; the first part was sort of like the first part of the book that you’re going to see. The rest of it, the middle was about a different kind of grief about the addiction. The rest was these meditations that were connected to quotes that I found. 
My editor, God bless her, said, “You know there’s two different books here, two different audiences.” By now the opiate epidemic is in full swing. She said, “People need to know what you learned in twenty years. So they don’t make the same mistakes.” I’d had an editor, who worked also for Hazelton as a freelancer, do a lot of editing of my books. So I could get the languaging down and all the medical terminology. She helped me with some of the medical research. I have a lot of research in my book to back up my own personal theories. So then I had this editor look at my book once the one editor said, “You have two books.” The opiate epidemic is going on, people need this. I chopped off this other part about grief and put this together and then this other editor, my final editor looks at it. She said, “I can’t keep track of this stuff. Are you going to just market this in the recovery community or do you want the general public to be able to understand this?” I said, “I want everybody to read this.” “You’ve got to have a glossary. You’ve got to do pull outs with lessons. I can’t remember all this important stuff. You’ve got to do little pull outs. You’ve got to list them on the back. You’ve got to have a glossary of terms. You’ve got to have resources. This is what people need now. Do it this way.” God bless her. 
My book ended up being much more. It’s not a memoir. It’s kind of a handbook of resources. Don’t do what I did, do what I learned. The grief book is waiting. The first support groups I did were the grief groups. Once I went through Minnesota Recovery Connection and got a website up. I did that before I started really working seriously on this book. Then I just got really involved in advocacy. I work with Minnesota Recovery Connection and still toy with the idea of becoming a non-profit. I don’t know if I want to do that. Probably would look better. That involves a board, all this other stuff. I think I just want to focus on my speaking and my advocacy and another book. Maybe. I’m doing a lot of partnering with Rose McKinney. God bless Rummler Foundation. They gave me a little seed money to get my groups off the ground. I got a little bit of a grant. I got a thousand dollars and managed to start that. Other people said, “Well do you have groups for people that are still in active addictions?” So I started my Courageous Caregivers group. 
AS: You mean for families of people who are still?
GE: Or significant others. I had my Courageous Caregivers group. Did you ever hear of the Opiate Coalition that started? She helped me do a pilot. She and I piloted the first Courageous Caregivers group to see if people would show up. They showed up. She didn’t want to have any more to do with it.
AS: Who is this? What was her name?
GE: Mary Kay Forstrum. She and I piloted that. Once there was an interest she said, “You just take them and run them out of your house.” I did that so I can keep the cost down. I had my first few groups at my church. But then I had to charge more. I moved them back here. People like coming to a home, more relaxing. This is in the book; I kind of became a follower of Chuck Hilger. He would come and say, “You need to write a book.” 
AS: He told me that too.
GE: There you go. 
AS: There’s a thing about how you feel…Sometimes I think that isn’t there enough out there. I said that to Chuck Hilger who I met through the Steve’s Law lobbying day. I told him about this project. He was really excited. Two years later when I’m finally able to get to it. I was like, “Chuck do you really think I should go forward with this?” He was like, “Are you kidding? We need this. Please keep going.” 
GE: I think you ought to get ahold of the Minnesota Historical Society. 
AS: I talked to them.
GE: They’re not interested?
AS: When I’m all finished they might look at it and they might decide to house it. I couldn’t believe it.
GE: There’s stigma for you right there. This is a major health crisis. This is a health epidemic.
AS: Of historic proportions. The way I think about it is like AIDS. History of medicine is one of my fields. That’s how I’m starting to realize it. It’s following the same trajectory.
GE: The effect it’s having on doctors and the way they prescribe. Absolutely, positively and the backlash of people who are on pain medication, using it responsibly and need it because they’re on MA. They can’t afford acupuncture or meditation or any of the other stuff, massage. They want to stop prescribing it.
AS: To people on MA only.
GE: Yes. 
AS: Thank you very much right? So there’s a racial component to it and economic. It’s a class issue.
GE: Right. She’s my best friend. One of my best friends is scared to death that she’s going to get her opiates taken away from her. She has angioedema which are extremely painful. They never found out why she has those. 
AS: That’s the backlash that you talked about.
GE: There’s a lot of backlash.
AS: Where you go to the extreme instead of the more balanced approach.
GE: That’s kind of the way the United States does things. Maybe that’s just the way life is. I mean, that’s the way I did with Aaron, from one extreme to another. 
AS: I did that with my daughter. I didn’t understand it. She was using heroin for two years before I ever knew. I only knew when she nearly died. I found her. 
GE: I didn’t know until I took Aaron to the Methadone clinic. 
AS: What would you say about your…can you talk a little bit about mothering? I know you already are talking about it. Is there any last things you’d want to say?
GE: Aaron had some good friends in Oakland during one of his more sober periods. Though I think he was using medical marijuana when he was out there. I had to call them all when he died. Thank God I had their phone numbers. He was in contact with them. The young woman, he’d tried desperately to go out to her wedding but had so much anxiety about carrying Methadone on the plane, even though it was a legal prescription. Was so sure something was going to go wrong that he didn’t go. He hated that about himself. That he never went to her wedding.
When I called her and I said, “Mary I don’t know. I tried.” She said, “Don’t you ever doubt that Aaron ever loved you. Or that he didn’t know that you did everything that you could to help him. You were his angel.” That’s what I would say to parents. That sometimes the person you’re trying to help can’t relay to you how much you do. Or how much they appreciate or maybe they are very self-absorbed in their own illness. They could never had as many chances, had the quality of life while they were alive if they did, could never have had as many chances to recover. It just comes all back to parenting; it’s just a fucking thankless job. [Laughs]. You have to remember that whether you have an addict or not. I think that’s the other thing. So many things that I made huge issues about I always made out because Aaron was an addict. There were a lot of things, issues that go on with teenagers and young adults with parents in their lives. It’s all part of growing up. Issues happen. 
AS: It’s not always about the addiction.
GE: It’s not always about addiction.
AS: Unless your child is an addict.
GE: Then parents get blamed and then there’s a lot of thanklessness that goes on. I think they’re all angels. No matter how many mistakes they made. They did it because they loved their child. I do a lot of coaching my Courageous Caregivers group and they’ll say, “What do you think I should do?” I ask them, “What’s going to support their recovery? Or is it going to support their illness? You know what if you’re not ready to drop the gauntlet on this particular issue that’s your choice.”
AS: Right, maybe don’t.
GE: “I don’t want you saying, ‘Gloria said.’ You need to make up your mind about this.” 
AS: You have opened yourself up to, and put yourself in a place where you can be supportive of other parents who are going through what you went through, with the benefit of hindsight. The things that worked and the things that didn’t. That is a way to continue mothering in a bigger picture. 
GE: Yes, it is. I have my own supervisor as an unlicensed healthcare professional. I don’t have to. I’m not a licensed psychologist or therapist. I’m only a certified recovery coach. But I belong; I’m registered with the board of unlicensed healthcare professionals. I do have a supervisor that I check in with if I feel like I’m getting hooked by my parents or some of my clients or my grief clients. It brings up my own grief issues. Like you said, you’re never over it. There’s no closure. It’s all good for me until it’s not. There was a thing in the paper, an editorial in the paper about mental illness, a whole story in the paper about how we’re not taking care of those who are mentally ill. It could have been about addiction. I wanted to write a letter to the editor so bad Sunday morning. I just couldn’t do one more thing about it that day. You know what I mean?
AS: I do.
GE: That’s why I’m going up North. 
AS: To take a break.
GE: It’s really my whole life, in a lot of ways.
AS: Do you think you’ll stick with it? What’s your energy like for it? What do you want to achieve?
GE: I really want to put this grief book out. I would love it if some other publisher would pick up Living in the Wake of Addiction. There needs to be a second edition, I already have some updates. Like this whole thing about implied consent which is in the chapter but it’s mostly all around Dr. French. You’ll read it. That needs to be driven home. I have a whole chapter on alternatives to twelve steps because Aaron never... It was a long time until I accepted that he’s not going to recover in twelve step recovery, start supporting him in something that he wants. He loved health realization. 
AS: Oh right. My son-in-law, Brandon that totally connected for him.
GE: Right. One meeting in 2007. One meeting in the Twin Cities, no car, they didn’t have the light rail. We were living in Chanhassen so how was he going to get to meetings? 
AS: There’s so much about access that I just find astonishing. In that way it does remind me of the AIDS crisis. There’s certain people who have access to the treatment modalities, or happen to be at the right place at the right time for it. Then there’s always people who are on the fringe and they could be from middle class families, educated middle class families or they could be out in Dassel where I talked to another mother this week. They’re so isolated and alienated just because of the lack of access to resources. Then you add stigma. 
GE: And then you think about the lack of Methadone clinics in the outer suburbs. Not just the outer suburbs, out state. The opiate crisis is live, and living in rural communities. No access. 
AS: It’s criminal.
GE: I mean I’m sure you’ve seen the anonymous people right? You remember the breast cancer survivor? What can we do to help you recover? There’s a whole recovery program that’s free for you.
AS: Just because you have breast cancer. You walk in and it’s beautiful, you go into these Methadone clinics and they’re just, they’re not welcoming places. My daughter won’t bring her infant to them. She’s like no way. I’m not going anywhere near those places with her. How’s that? What does that do to a young mother? Who doesn’t have the option to have someone stay with the baby? 
GE: When you’re standing in line at the Methadone clinic with the same people you stood on the street corner with. 
AS: And there’s people dealing, twenty feet away I saw so many drug deals. Twenty feet away in Brooklyn Center. 
GE: Aaron told me. It was really funny. I believe one of the treatment centers when he found out about health realization was Cedar Ridge, was one of his most positive experiences. That was the first time I ever got any kind of amends letter from him was after there. He really wanted to get off the Methadone. They wanted to keep him on a small amount. When he was leaving Cedar Ridge he said, “Mom I think the same people that own Cedar Ridge own the Methadone clinic. What do you think about that? I think you and Bob should invest in a Methadone clinic.” Then he got into, “You ought to buy a sober house. Do you know what the state is paying me to have this crappy little room, with a crappy little roommate? You guys ought to run sober houses.” I was thinking all the shit that goes on. Here I am. For me to be advocating and writing blogs. He’s just laughing out of the other side of his mouth and saying, “Oh I wish we could have done this better together. Oh Mom I wish we could have done this better together.” I do a lot of nurturing. It’s totally changed my relationship with my other kids. I could be a pretty harsh, you follow the rules or you’re not okay with me. I’m just not like that anymore. Whoever you are, as long as you’re kind to me, you’re kind to other people in the family, kind to your own children you are okay by me. 
AS: That’s a pretty big transformation. 
GE: It happened because of Aaron. I could never have supported Jeff’s recovery through his death the way that I had if I hadn’t gone through that experience with Aaron. I could never have been as patient.
AS: You mean Jeff recovering from his brother’s death?
GE: Yes. His anger and drawing the boundaries what I wasn’t going to take from his anger. I don’t know the answer for it. I could never have taken that approach with him if I wouldn’t have. He and I would have been like this the whole time. Like, “What the hell’s wrong with you? You need help. Go get help. You’re broken.” I think it’s mostly about me. Shoving aside what happened to him because I was trying to save Aaron. 
AS: Well thank you. That’s powerful, a very powerful story.
GE: You know what’s really sad? There’s a million stories like mine out there. That’s when that first book review, the editor what’s her name?
AS: Julianne.
GE: I wrote a book review for her. She said, “Do you want Aaron’s picture?” I said, “This isn’t about Aaron or about me. This is about all the other people. This is about all the others. It’s about us and Aaron. I don’t want to make Aaron’s death the star.”
AS: Right, the star sad story. That’s the part that’s not being communicated very effectively. 
GE: That’s what I try, that’s what happened in two or three interviews.
AS: That’s what I’m trying to counteract. We need to get Rose on our PR committee. 
GE: We’re valiant; Aaron was a valiant hero, all those people that tried so hard to recover. The ones that make it, they’re valiant. Aaron isn’t any less valiant then they because he died. The parents that stick by them, valiant, valiant, valiant. Talking about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder various things will trigger and I will just lose it. 
AS: Mine has been for a couple years the people with the signs. 
GE: On the street corners?
AS: That are showing up everywhere because it’s what my daughter was doing the summer that I just knew she was going to die. Here in Minneapolis she was doing it on 94. 
GE: Did she ever want to come home?
AS: She did, I let her and then she overdosed in the house again. With her little sister right there, the foaming mouth. We had to call the EMT.
GE: You didn’t have Naloxone?
AS: I had just lobbied for it two months before but I didn’t, there was no access yet. It was in that period between March and the middle of May. It was available as of June or July. She came to before they, we made them take her to the hospital.
GE: How did she come to? What did you do?
AS: We moved her and then there was a lot of noise. 
GE: She came around.
AS: Yes. I’m going to stop this.
GE: I didn’t know any of that. "

We are back together for part two, as Nancy called it, to discuss what happened in the last few months of Lucas’s life and what Nancy is doing now. We will just take this as a conversation. Can you say you give me permission?
NE: I give you permission, Amy. 
AS: Where would you like to start?
NE: Well, honestly I don’t know where I am right now because I feel so lost. I feel very lost. I think what is starting to happen is the shock is wearing and the reality of the finality is really in my face. Not that I ever thought Lucas would come back, but I guess I did. There was so much action and sorrow that I didn’t make room or allow myself to really think about Lucas. Now I want to think about him all the time and I want to push it away all the time because I am afraid to think about him. 
I think one of the big challenges for me -- actually, I’ll tell you the challenges my grief therapist told me on Saturday. My situation is a little different in that I had so much trauma for so long. I’m also solo flying. I’m single; I don’t have a partner to really go through this mourning with and Lucas is my only child. I say ‘is,’ I don’t know what to do with that ‘is’ versus ‘was.’ That’s a big one. 
I felt left. I really feel left. I fought so hard. I’ve never worked so hard on anything in my life. 
AS: To keep him sober and safe. 
NE: To keep him alive. And nothing. There is nothing to do. There is nothing to do. I can’t do anything else. Lucas had a hard life and a life filled with a lot of suffering and that feels really horrible. That’s where I am, sort of. Every morning when I wake up and often when I go to sleep there is a new song in my head every day. Last night it was John Legend’s “They got nothing on you, babe.” Lucas and I listened to that music a lot. I think maybe that’s a message somewhere. The lack of form of Lucas, of his body, evaporating -- I don’t know. It is so hard to digest. For three months I cried. Who knew you could cry so much? 
The other piece is the confrontation of the part of me that says you’ve got to go on and the part of me that says I don’t want to. That battle. There is a part of me that doesn’t give a hoot. It doesn’t. About anything including my future. The healthier, higher vibrational part goes, “Come on Nancy, you’re still part of the living. You’ve got to find a way to live.” That snake rears it’s ugly head and goes, “Really? Why?” That’s scary. That lack of desire for anything is scary because all I have been living with for the last number of years was the desire to keep Lucas alive. He consumed all of my thinking, my finances, my activity, my sleep. 
AS: The last interview was the beginning of June of last summer. Some things happened since then. I thought fall was pretty rocky. Are you able to back in time a little bit?
NE: I think in July it was rocky. His acceleration of sadness really started in the summer. He was calling me constantly crying, “I’m scared, I’m scared.”
AS: What do you know about what he was doing?
NE: I did not know in July. In August Lucas called me to tell me that he had been arrested. I don’t know if he called me or his father called me. Evidently he was driving on something. He told me he had a wobbly tire and there was a problem with the tire. All the same stupid stories he made up his whole life. He was in jail. He called his father, not me, knowing I wouldn’t bail him out. His father said to me that they gave him a breathalyzer that came up clean, but they hired a lawyer. I was thinking, Hold on a second. If his breathalyzer was clean and it was just his tire they don’t put you in jail. What was he doing in jail? 
Well, then Lucas proceeds to tell me he had a scale in the car and it was his friend’s scale. Somewhere Lucas must have really thought I was stupid. He really thought I was going to believe this garbage. I called Michael Knoth, one of my contacts in New York who Lucas loved. We had a session and he said, “You need to get to California.” I said, “When?” And he said, “Today.” I flew out that afternoon. 
AS: Was this a therapist you had worked with?
NE: He was the man that I mentioned at Lucas’s service. I called Lucas from the plane and said, “I’ll see you in four hours. I’m on a plane.” I learned at that time that Lucas was doing Xanax which he had a grand mal seizure from in college. Supposedly he got Suboxone. I don’t even honestly remember what it was. He was withdrawing and I had to take him to the hospital one night. 
AS: You got him out of jail?
NE: No, he was already out. His father hired a lawyer. Lucas and I really lay in bed for two days and watched television and slept and ate. I knew we were in trouble when I left, but I didn’t realize how much trouble. 
In September Lucas came in for the state fair. Lucas won me that giant bear in the corner. The day that he was leaving he really didn’t feel well. I didn’t connect this because he wasn’t high. I said, “You need to go to a doctor.” By the time he got to California his legs and feet were so swollen -- he sent the pictures to his father -- but I told him he had to go to the hospital. He had a really horrific infection. Almost deadly. If it would have kept spreading it would have killed him. 
AS: Like sepsis or something?
NE: Yes. But I didn’t know people shot in their feet. He was walking around in his underwear in front of me and there’s not a mark on him. That was September. 
The beginning of October he called me one night screaming at me that he needed my help and he was vomiting profusely. He couldn’t stop. I said, “Lucas, I’m in Minnesota. You’ve got to call an ambulance.” I didn’t ask him what drug he had took, although that was the turning point for me. That’s when I knew we were in serious trouble. 
AS: You knew he was using heroin?
NE: No. 
AS: But you knew he was using drugs again?
NE: I thought it was Xanax. I ended up calling the Santa Monica police, but they told me he had already called and they were already on their way there. He made up some cock and bull story that he had a kidney stone or appendicitis. I said, “Really? I don’t think so.” It just accelerated from the beginning of October -- crying, screaming, “I’m scared.” I went to see my friends for the party in October -- for Monica’s sixtieth -- and he was high as a kite. I still didn’t know it was heroin, and I had a breakdown. 
AS: Had he not used heroin before, Nancy?
NE: He had, but he had never shot before. 
AS: Was he using pain pills?
NE: He was an OxyContin guy. 
AS: But now he was shooting up. When he would say he was scared would he ever explain what he was scared of?
NE: “What are you frightened of?” “My future, my life.” I said, “Lucas, you need help and I’m here to support that. Tell me what is happening.” He wouldn’t. He just called me everyday, “Don’t stop talking to me. Please keep talking. I need you, mom.” I said, “Lucas, I’m here.” But when I wouldn’t give him money he would say, “You’re abandoning me.” I said, “I think you are confusing money with abandonment. I’m right here. I haven’t gone anywhere. My bank is closed. It doesn’t exist anymore.”
AS: Plus, you didn’t have a job at this point. 
NE: He didn’t care. 
AS: Right. But you actually had reached a hard place. 
NE: Correct. It was all about money. He was getting jobs and losing jobs. When I was there at the end of October I was down on my hands and knees. I thought I was having a nervous breakdown. So did Kim and my friends Sierra and Jane. They thought I was having a nervous breakdown. I was pounding on the floor in the garage: “Stop. What’s happening? You have to tell me. What are you doing?” He just stood and watched me. He was void of emotion. It was like I wasn’t there. He didn’t come to the party with me. He lost his wallet, he lost his phone, and his computer was gone. He was aimlessly walking. It was horrendous. 
I called the psychiatrist and said, “How did you give him Xanax without knowing his medical history?” He was referred by his therapist. I went berserk on him. I said, “Don’t talk to me about HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act], I know all about HIPAA. Everyone has always called me. Lucas has always signed a release. Xanax?” Anyway. It just accelerated. The sobbing, the tears, the fear, the pain. I talked for hours, Amy. 
AS: How long did you stay in California with him at that point?
NE: In October? A few days. 
AS: Didn’t he come back for a meeting? When did he visit our meeting?
NE: Was that before you interviewed me the first time?
AS: I thought when he was trying to get clean after he crashed his car. 
NE: July.
AS: That was in the summer? He came and visited and he came to a meeting. 
NE: He did. He did. 
AS: That’s when he told us that it wasn’t about us. 
NE: Yeah. That must have been the summer, I think. He came in September for the State Fair. That’s what it was, it was September. 
AS: He came with you to the meeting even though he was using. 
NE: That’s right. 
AS: He hid it well. 
NE: He hid it well. But he didn’t want to do the recovery walk.
AS: That’s right, but he had done it a year before. 
NE: I didn’t know he was using then either. 
AS: He was using during that first recovery walk?
NE: When he got arrested I asked him how long he had been using and he said for the last year. He told me he was withdrawing on the recovery walk. Outside of Lucas being swallowed up -- everything came so easy for Lucas except this. Everything. He didn’t have to try at anything. He was exceptionally smart. He was talented in every aspect of creativity. He was a superstar athlete. He was charming, he was funny, he was handsome, and he thought he could do this on his own. He couldn’t and I don’t think he could believe it. 
I came back October twenty-sixth and I held on for dear life. I would talk to him and the minute he said, “Hello” I could tell if he was high. He didn’t even have to say a sentence to me. 
AS: Was this because you had spent that time with him in October?
NE: No, I always knew when he was high. Always. I would say, “What are you doing?” He says, “I’m going to work.” I said, “Really? You’re high as a kite. You’re going to work?” This was his response: “Okay, mom.” That’s what he said when he knew that I knew and he didn’t want to admit it. “Okay, mom. I’m going to go now.” 
Amy, I knew somewhere. I did. I never really allowed it to penetrate my consciousness, but I knew Lucas wasn’t going to make it. I knew it. I couldn’t own it. I couldn’t take it in. I couldn’t accept it. I couldn’t look at it because who can look at that? It is horrifying. In the depths of my soul I knew it. My awakened mind knew it. I couldn’t hide it from myself. 
AS: At what point would you say you knew that?
NE: Probably four years ago. 
AS: Really?
NE: Yeah. I just kept watching him spiral and do nothing. 
AS: He couldn’t get a grip on anything to pull himself up.
NE: And believe me if he had a fall he had such a net to fall into. He had so many people rooting for him there, available. He couldn’t do it. I hate to say he couldn’t. I also hate to say he didn’t want to. I don’t know what is true. I don’t know which part is true. Maybe both. I don’t really think that Lucas knew how to live on this earth plane. He wrote me some remarkable stacks of letters and poems. He could present and express when he was ‘locked up’ if you will. In a treatment facility. Not towards the latter parts. He fought them; he wasn’t interested. But, the minute he stepped back into the real world he couldn’t do it. The world was too scary to him. He couldn’t find ground. He couldn’t find a way to really participate. He didn’t want to play by the rules here. He wanted to set his own crazy standards.
I think the thing that is so hard for me too is that he became like a thug. He was like a split person. He was the person you met, and he was that, and then he was this thuggish, hanging out with sludge, garbage, awful people. 
AS: I keep thinking of the road trip story with the drug dealer. They are driving across the country. 
NE: Yeah. I saw a picture that he had sent me in November. In November he was going to see Tony Robbins in Nevada with his roommate who is very spiritual. He was trying to influence Lucas to the best of his ability. I never really looked at the picture because I didn’t like it. I looked at it not too long ago and it looked like Lucas had a broken nose and a black eye. I was so horrified. I think -- and his father thinks too -- that he was in trouble. I think people were after him for money. I think everything that started to come out of his mouth was a lie to everybody.
I don’t know if you know this. He called me one night at the end of November: “Mom there is something mentally wrong with me. I’m not right. Help me.” I said, “I’m here Lucas. Tell me what.” I said a lot more than just that. I said, “What thoughts are you having? What is in your head? What are you hearing? What are you believing?” He goes, “I don’t know.” He was sobbing. I think he knew how far from reality he was going and that he was living in a very dangerous world. He wouldn’t say it. I said, “Come to Minnesota. Let’s get you out of California. I’m here I’ll get you on the next plane. I’ll come out there.”
AS: Because he had lived here for a while. 
NE: Yeah, but it was a really bad place for him. Then he called me the first week of December at six in the morning and said, “I got it. I had an epiphany.” I went, “Okay, what happened?” I had heard that before that people suddenly had these epiphanies. He said that he understood what this was all about. And what life was all about. I said I wasn’t following. He said he was talking to my father and that my father was on the other side and my father isn’t on the other side. He understood his addiction and what purpose is here in life. Anyway, it was all very confusing, but for me it gave me such a sense of hope in the moment. I thought he had an epiphany. 
Now, I think one of two things happened. I think he had a near death experience. Or I think he had a premonition and maybe he was on the other side. 
AS: Maybe he had overdosed. 
NE: Yes. 
AS: He would just not be straight with you.
NE: Never. 
AS: Even around something like that. 
NE: No. 
AS: You would get the final statement but you wouldn’t get anything that led up to that. 
NE: Raymond thought he was cracking up. I thought it sounded like he maybe had got his footing. He was talking to me like a sane person. 
AS: Sounding like he might be ready for recovery. Is that what you are saying?
NE: Yeah. Three weeks later he was dead. 
AS: Let’s go through December. That was the first week of December?
NE: About. Then he swung back into, “I’m so scared. I’m so sad. I want to be happy.” That’s all Lucas said often. I went, “If happiness is your end goal you might as well give it up today. That’s not how the world works.” I couldn’t do it anymore. Every time the phone rang I had a heart attack. It continued like that through December. Maybe that’s when he was with Tony Robbins. The first couple of weeks. Then I saw the epiphany. I don’t remember the dates. 
Then at midnight on December nineteenth when the clock was swinging into the twentieth I woke up out of a dead sleep having a severe panic attack. I didn’t know what the heck was happening to me. I was up for four hours. I finally fell back to sleep. My mother called me the morning of the twentieth. We went out to breakfast, and I was crying saying, “I think something is terribly wrong, but I don’t know what.” I texted Lucas that afternoon and never heard from him. Lucas always responded to me. Always. This was about my dad, and he would have definitely responded to me. 
AS: When was the last time you talked to Lucas?
NE: The day he died. The nineteenth. 
AS: He died on December nineteenth. 
NE: Around midnight. Around the time I woke up. He was crying hysterically that day. That day I went and paid four thousand dollars for his rent. My father did because he said he was going to get kicked out. It was a horrible day. He called his father and told his father I didn’t give a shit about him because I wouldn’t give him money. I haven’t really thought about that conversation. But, I did say to him, “If my name wasn’t on that lease you can rest assured that you wouldn’t be getting a dime from anybody. I’m only doing this to safeguard myself because I’m the cosigner. It’s not for you, Lucas. It’s for me.” I know I said something like, “You are such an ass. I can’t even stand it.” When we hung up I texted him and said, “I apologize. You are not an ass. You’re behavior is ass-like and it is very hard for me to watch it and to be witness to it and to be on the other side of it.” He wrote me back, “No, mom. I’m an ass.” That was our last communication. 
I did learn also that his ex-girlfriend from Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation], Audrey, who he liked a lot. I don’t know what happened. She was in California, too. They hadn’t spoken in a year. I did learn that she -- and I saw it on his phone too -- she contacted him that night and wanted to see him. He went to see her and she never showed up. He died four hours later. If you think I don’t want to call her and kill her I do. If that’s okay to say here. I wouldn’t do it. 
AS: It’s just a feeling. 
NE: She never showed up. The text was, “Audrey this is not a game.” She called him. I haven’t read through half of it. I can’t. 
He didn’t call me back or text me. My anxiety was so high.
AS: So twenty-four hours later is basically when you wake up or later that night?
NE: I woke up for some reason that morning after having fallen back asleep with a feeling of doom. My mother goes, “What are you talking about?” I go, “I don’t know, but something with Lucas. I know it.” When he didn’t respond that day my agitation really heightened. I spoke to a bunch of my friends including Kim and I said, “I haven’t heard from Lucas.” She goes, “Nancy.” “No, Kim. I’m telling you right now.” People think you’re crazy because you’re kids disappear. Lucas never disappeared. 
AS: Right. You know what their patterns are. 
NE: I know what his patterns are. 
AS: Some people might not expect their kid to text back. 
NE: I went to bed thinking he was really busy and I’ll get a text the following morning. I woke up Wednesday morning and nothing. I texted him again. Nothing. I just knew. I called Raymond at about four o’clock that afternoon and asked if he had heard from Luke. He said he had been trying to get a hold of him for two days. I flipped out. I was hysterical. I said, “I’m telling you something is very wrong.” He said to call his apartment and I said I was too scared. I was afraid to do anything. Really, I froze in time. My friend Jane from New York called and said she was my sister. At this point Raymond also posted something on Facebook unbeknownst to me: Has anyone seen or heard from Lucas?
The building never called Jane back. They said they would try to reach him. I called back at about five o’clock and they said they couldn’t reach him. I said, “You need to go open his door.” They said that the only people that can do that are the police. At that point my brother-in-law called me and said, “What is happening? Raymond posted something on Facebook.” I said, “We hadn’t heard from Luke.” He said, “Lisa and I have been trying to reach Lucas for two days.”
I then called the Santa Monica police. The dispatcher was getting two police to the site. I called my friend Michael and I called my friend Kim. Michael came down; Kim was coming over. The police called and said that no one was answering the door. “We are leaving. I guess he is not home.” I said, “You are not leaving. You’ve got to open that door.” “Why?” “Because he could be behind that door.” They then had to get permission from the building, from me. At which point now Ann is here. It is now six-thirty, a quarter to seven. The police called to say they were entering and they would call back. Nothing. Of course if he wasn’t there they would call me and tell me he wasn’t there. I call back a half hour later. The dispatcher said they were still on site and they would get back to me. Forty-five minutes pass. 
It is now eight-thirty and my sister is here. She said, “Nancy. It is a crime scene.” But I didn’t hear anything, Amy. I called back. The dispatcher went, “Oh, Nancy,” and I went, “Yeah?” She said, “They are still on site and they will get back to you.” I said, “You’ve said that now for two hours.” At nine-thirty Lisa called and asked to speak to a sergeant. She said that this was borderline abusive. We need to know what is happening. I went downstairs to have a cigarette with Kim and I came back upstairs. My sister just looked at me and I fell to the floor. He had been dead since around midnight the morning of the twentieth. They were waiting for the coroner and the medical examiner to show up and that was why it took so long. Ann explained that, although I didn’t hear anything. All I did was scream. 
I couldn’t get a hold of Raymond that night. He must have gone to sleep. It was a quarter to ten here, which is a quarter to eleven in New York, you know, Eastern Time. Lisa stayed here and called Raymond the following morning. We got him on a plane here. My friends Jane and Emily flew in. In the Jewish religion they don’t do an autopsy. I would have done it anyway, but with the crime scene they automatically do it. They never even asked me. Lisa did everything. She got in touch with the coroner, the medical examiner, I don’t know who. She got in touch with the funeral home in Pasadena. Palisades is about a half an hour from Los Angeles. Raymond and I booked flights to get out there. We left Christmas day. They told us they were doing a brain and a full body autopsy. I didn’t know what an autopsy really meant and then I looked. You’re like a shell after that. That was it. 
Raymond and I went out there. I didn’t think I wanted to see Lucas, but Raymond definitely did. We asked the head of the funeral home if he thought we should see Lucas. He said, “Yes.” There was a towel around his head because of the autopsy. I did see some hair. He had a sheet covering him from the neck down, but it was Lucas. It looked just like Lucas. I couldn’t get off of him. We went to the apartment and did work and then I had to leave and Raymond finished it without me. I’m talking as if I’m not talking about my child because it’s too much. It’s just too much. Some days I think I could take those ashes over there and put him back together. I do. Did you see this? Some of his ashes are in here. 
AS: Wow. That’s beautiful. 
NE: As a matter of fact I was in New York at the camp and then his soccer team did a beautiful memorial for him. It was amazing. 
AS: Where was that? New York?
NE: You have no idea the outpouring from all over this country. Yeah, his soccer team did a thing. His coaches. Thirty kids showed up. 
AS: Was this high school or college? 
NE: It was high school and traveling. Some of his friends from high school had films of him playing soccer. They gave me that picture. They had two blown up pictures of the team they mailed to me. The team was called the Galaxy. They had a Galaxy ball that everybody signed. The coaches were sobbing. The kids spoke and were crying. It was probably one of the nicest nights of my life. His camp friends and his ex-girlfriend came.
AS: His high school girlfriend?
NE: The one from camp. The only girl he really ever cared about besides Audrey. When I saw Brooke I was like, “Oh my god.” So many people showed up. Brooke just sent me pictures of her and Lucas two days ago. I got an email two days ago from this kid on his floor that said, “I just learned. Lucas used to play with my dog all the time. I loved your son.” We talked. 
AS: Was this in California?
NE: You can’t believe how many people in California reached out to me. I had no idea. His lawyer wrote me: “Lucas changed my life. I’ve never had this experience with a client. He was a remarkable young man.” I mean hundreds. I had over a hundred and fifty cards up there. I had no idea the impact. None. Teachers, the owner of the camp, coaches, my babysitter who was with us for years. Loved Lucas; came to the soccer thing and the camp thing. He either didn’t feel it or couldn’t feel it. 
AS: He had an addiction, Nancy.
NE: I know. 
AS: It just hijacks their brain. 
NE: I know. It is a very hard thing for me to accept. I can’t really embrace -- and I do, up here -- but I can’t embrace that he couldn’t do it. You know what I mean? I thought he would do it for me. I did. I thought he would do it for me. I really did. Even though I knew. 
AS: Even though you know scientifically and intellectually and spiritually that you have to do it for yourself. 
NE: We were that close. Having lived with so much trauma and insanity for so many years I also didn’t think that God would let my story end this way. I didn’t. I thought the ending would be good. Somewhere down the line. I didn’t know where that would be. 
AS: That’s what kept you going through the struggle. Is that what you are saying?
NE: Yeah. I did have hope. Lucas always talked about how he wanted to get married and have five kids and he really did. I thought he would. I thought I would be a grandmother and have a daughter in-law and watch my son change other people’s lives the way he did unbeknownst to me. People wrote me that, “He saved my life.” There was a mother at the service who flew in from Chicago because Lucas saved her son’s life. I didn’t even remember her. She remembered me from the family program at Hazelden. 
AS: What did he do? Did she tell you?
NE: She said he was just there one hundred percent for Joey all the time. And Joey had no idea that he was struggling. People asked me, “Why didn’t he share. We had no idea.”
AS: So it wasn’t just you. 
NE: No. 
AS: That’s pretty powerful. 
NE: He had so much shame. He couldn’t admit that this was who he could be and this is who he turned out to be. He couldn’t bridge the two and the devil won. Evil won. I’m actually afraid to get back his toxicology report. They told me it would take six to ten months. The state of California once they get it back they send it to a secondary firm. They want to make sure the two match. I don’t even want to know what was in his system. I’m sure he had Xanax, I’m sure he had heroin. I mean they found the needle. There was one needle that was empty and one needle that was still full, which makes me think the first needle had a lot of Fentanyl in it. 
I don’t get it. When I spoke the neuroscientist, I said, “How do you explain it?” He said, “We really have no idea yet.” I have a theory because listening to Gabor Maté and how he said things often skip a generation. I don’t know if all of our drug use impacted our kids. Everybody now, including this doctor --
AS: Do you mean people who use drugs -- parents who used drugs in the sixties and seventies?
NE: Because Maté said to a degree that epidemiology now -- that layer that lives above the genetic level that everyone is talking about now. 
AS: Epigenetics?
NE: Epigenetics. That everything is stored on the cellular level. That we pass everything on on a cellular level. I wasn’t a huge druggie, but I drank plenty of alcohol and I partied. I certainly had my share of cocaine. I don’t know. I don’t know. Certainly I have plenty of friends whose kids did plenty of pot smoking. Some of them have problems. 
AS: Yeah, but some of them are fine. 
NE: Yeah, but the population that is not fine is so big. How come? It’s not just -- I don’t know. I don’t know if it is technology, I don’t know if it is a breakdown in humanity and a lack of the family unit. I don’t know. 
AS: I think that opioids have a different impact on the brain because we have opioid receptors and our body wants it. We have a place in our brain for that particular plant chemical. 
NE: Once you start doing them it naturally turns off your own --
AS: Right. And then you need more and more and it changes your brain. That’s what Bob Levy was talking about the other night at the meeting when he came. He was reiterating how different opioids are in the brain than other drugs. Opioids actually can take over your frontal lobe, but the part the opioid is responding to is your old brain, your amygdala, which takes over your frontal lobe. All the lying and the cheating and the stealing and hiding, all that stuff that it does. 
One thing that might be interesting to you to hear -- because he didn’t say this the first time -- he said they are finding now that genetics and addiction have about a forty percent correlation. If you are related to someone who is an addict or was an addict you have a forty percent chance of becoming one yourself. But one of the things some of this research is talking about is this kind of shield, and this is kind of like the epigenetic idea of the switch, and they are trying to understand why some of us are so susceptible to addiction and other people just aren’t. The analogy he used was a shield: we all come into the world with a shield, but some of us have a really thick shield. Things can happen to us that don’t prompt addiction. Other people come into the world with a much thinner shield and it is very easy for that shield to be penetrated. That to me puts together all of the things we have been learning about and that we have talked about, you and I, and in our group. It is a shield. What we give to our children and what they get from the world and what they get genetically and experientially, who they come into the world as with their own personalities. I think that shield metaphor really makes sense to me and it fits with Maté’s thing about how trauma can create a tendency towards addiction. 
NE: What’s interesting though is what the addiction really does is it tries to thicken your shield. 
AS: You try to protect yourself, which is ironic. 
NE: It is so ironic. 
AS: The very thing that makes you feel safer is actually killing you. 
NE: Right. They do say that people who really do struggle with addiction are heightened. They are more sensitive. They are thin skinned that way. 
AS: And often don’t feel at peace in their body or in the world. 
NE: That was Lucas. 
AS: I think we know a lot of kids like that. 
NE: Yeah. This very, very sensitive -- where you could touch and it could feel like a punch. Also, Lucas, I may have mentioned this to you, had a lot of neural sensitivity. As a kid he would say, “Get this shirt off of me.” “Why?” “It is itchy and uncomfortable.” He was heightened. “I don’t like this sock. It doesn’t fit me right.” You know? He had neuro stuff, body stuff that was sensitive to whatever it is. That’s what this doctor was saying. He said your brain is completely rewired from opiate use. 
AS: Levy said that the other night. He said there are parts of his brain that will never heal from his own drug use. 
NE: They have found, I’m sure you’ve heard this, in mice -- have you heard this about mice and cocaine? Mice who became highly addicted to cocaine they found a place in their brain that they can zap. They zap it and they put the mice back in the cage with mounds of cocaine and they won’t go near it. That is what they are trying to isolate and identify in humans. Neuroscientists at the University [of Minnesota] are studying the brain and addiction. I said, “How close are you?” He said, “We are closer, but we are still very far away. There are different transmitters for triggers, cravings, and memory. Even though you can get control of one the triggers still remain. It’s not like the cravings ever fully go away. We are trying to study the exact part of the brain where the cravings, triggers, and memory come together. Mice don’t have a complex brain so we were able to identify the craving or the addiction part.” That is what they are trying to understand: what actually happens to the brain. What gets rewired and what gets activated. Certain parts of the brain get turned off. Look, we hear a song and we think of our boyfriend from four hundred years ago. [laughs] We smell something and I go, “Oh my god, that smells like camp.” We hear a noise and think of our crazy father. People say, “That reminds me of my father when he went to work.” You go immediately to fight or flight.
AS: I think those are things that -- the song you are waking up with everyday, the songs that are coming back to you as part of that memory bank. It is healing you, it is coming back, it is flooding you with memories that will comfort you in some way. It seems like it is part of the grieving process. 
NE: It may be part of the grieving process, but it doesn’t comfort me. It makes me sob non-stop. 
AS: I don’t mean -- just some things become alive again. 
NE: Yes. 
AS: This happens to me in yoga or something when you aren’t thinking of anything and suddenly something pops in your head and you are like, Where did that come from? Just some random memory. 
NE: It has been resonating. That is the interesting thing about epigenetics. Is everything really stored on a cellular level?
AS: And maybe a lot is stored that is never really needed or accessed. The shield idea. If you don’t ever come upon drugs if you had a thin shield it might not matter. It just seems so random. What Maté was talking about with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. Why do they have these high levels of depression?
NE: They do. They do. I also know the parents of those people and the parents were the children of the people. They have such heightened levels of anxiety. For one woman if there was less than one gallon of milk in the house she would have a complete nervous breakdown. She would always have to have two gallons in the house just in case they ever ran out. She was anxious; the kids end up with depression. I don’t know. 
AS: You came back and you had the memorial service, which was so beautiful. 
NE: I haven’t listened yet. It was. That’s what happened. I went into action. 
AS: That shielded you for a while. 
NE: It shielded me. It kept me in shock. 
AS: I think we stay in shock for a while after trauma like that. 
NE: I had other friends that came out. I went to New York. I have these silos, these different compartments of emotion. It’s like that jack-in-the-box. They come up and go, “Ah!” And the other one comes up and goes, “Ah!” All of them are very different than what I want to have in my heart, which is compassion, and understanding, and adoration, and love for Lucas. But I have so many other things going on right now. I don’t like that. 
AS: Like what?
NE: Like, “Why did you come here?” I feel tortured. I do, I feel very beat up. In that Nar Anon room people say, “My child is coming back to me, they were who they were.” Lucas was tough from day one. He wasn’t an angelic, perfect little kid. What he had was what he had, so naturally had everything going for him. He had a lot of rage and a lot of anger. Last night that’s all I could feel in my head. All of it banging in my walls, telling me where to go, the stealing, the apologies, and then the stealing. You might have been there when I said my therapist in New York said, “Nancy, love is a verb.” When I remember that I feel really bad, too.
AS: Why?
NE: Because Lucas told me all the time how much he loved me. But he acted contrary to that very often, and before he did drugs he was tough. I was really a single parent. 
AS: You loved him. Does the rage make you feel like you didn’t love him enough?
NE: You know Amy, the rage was tough. 
AS: Can you hold those two things together: the love and the rage? Or does that not feel --
NE: I think it was safer to have those two things when he was alive. He made it hard to love him sometimes. Sometimes I felt like I didn’t love him at all. There were times that I thought if he wasn’t my child I would want nothing to do with this person. They don’t feed my soul. There is no give and take here. There is no gentle kindness consistently. Who I am and what I am going through doesn’t matter. I’m left with a lot of output. There was so much output. 
AS: You were feeling empty. 
NE: I’m empty. I feel empty and left. I do. Some people say, “Things were so good for a month or two years or five years and then they relapsed,” but they had a period of time where there was rejuvenation. Sort of a resurrection of a healthy relationship. 
AS: You didn’t have that. 
NE: No, never. Lucas walked out of the first rehab and bought drugs. The second one I went down there and left early because he was doing drugs. The one at Hazelden -- he walked out and did drugs. He never really got sober I don’t think. 
AS: Would he tell you that he was sober?
NE: Yeah, he would. 
AS: Was his dishonesty part of the rage, too? Was it all just mushed together?
NE: That’s an interesting question. Now that you say that maybe that’s why I feel so left because he didn’t leave me with any truth. If he would have told me he was struggling -- I feel used. I was the one he called all the time. I was the one who heard it all, but I didn’t hear the truth. I was trying to help somebody who was being completely dishonest. And he was counting on me, calling me, and expecting me to be there. And I was for years. And he wasn’t even standing on his face. You know when they say ‘standing on your mat?’ He wasn’t even standing on his mat. He was lying. He was not true. Even when I asked him. Even when I said, “Lucas, you are high as a kite right now.” “Okay, mom.” 
AS: You never got any acknowledgement that you knew what was going on from him either. That would make me enraged. 
NE: That’s why I think I almost had a nervous breakdown in October. I said, “Do you think I’m a freaking idiot? Look at you! What do you think I’m seeing!” It is crazy making. It’s like having a sociopath in front of you. 
AS: I don’t know any sociopaths, but it might be worse. Someone who is trying to make you crazy. 
NE: I started to feel crazy. I am watching, listening there and, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
AS: Right. Slurring his words and nodding off. 
NE: Completely. Maybe that’s it. Maybe all the work --
AS: With no acknowledgement of the truth of what was happening.
NE: Why put me through that? Why count on me that way? Why make me privy to all of your misery, your heartache, your suffering. For what? So I should suffer, too? And I suffered, and he knew it. When I came home from that trip he called me. He said, “I’m glad you broke down.” I said, “You’re glad I broke down?” He said, “Yeah, because you had all of that stored inside of you and you really needed to let it out.” He didn’t say because it was legitimate, he didn’t say, “Because I’m using heroin.” He didn’t say, “Because I need help.” Yeah. Maybe that’s it, or a big piece of it. 
AS: I don’t know anyone who would deny you the right to feel angry in this situation. Even with the great loss and sadness. The anger about addiction and what it does to people is completely justifiable. 
NE: And as I said he was not easy or the most honest person to begin with. This just exacerbated an already obvious tendency. I wanted him to plop himself on that chair and say, “I’m going to make it all up to you.” The way he used to say. “I’m going to show up and I’m going to be the son you want me to be and the son I want to be for you.” Okay, well you know what? You took that away too. My head goes to that spiritual side. Lucas and I were meant to be together and this happened for a reason and I do go there. I do. Even though my faith is in the garbage right now I still have that sense of myself and know this was for something and it wasn’t for nothing. 
There is a woman who is in my grief group who is also in our Nar Anon group, and the other day she said, “I feel so peaceful.” I’m like, “Really?” She’s way ahead of me in this game of time, but she said, “Every day I wake up I know I am closer to seeing my son again.” I’m going, “Really? Every day I get up my son goes farther from me.” The juxtaposition of those two thoughts. She’s happier than me. She’s finding peace. Not peace, but that’s the way she holds it. I have too much rage right now. 
I did speak to a medium, I should tell you. Yesterday. She told me that Lucas was really good, and that made me really angry. He’s good and I’m sitting here miserable, suffering. She said what another psychic said to me in October: Lucas was not from this earth plane. He could not find his way on it. He came in like a warrior and was never comfortable or safe here. But that didn’t help me. She said, “Are there a bunch of people that he knew?” I said, “Yeah, he lost a bunch of friends.” “They are all doing this Buddha chanting and talking about what they did.” Because he lost a lot of friends to addiction. She said it was with a bunch of people. She asked who the Russians were around him, and I said it was my grandparents. My mother’s parents. I don’t know if it was them or not, but she said he was good. It didn’t help. I wish it did. I want him to be peaceful.
AS: You want to be peaceful. 
NE: I do. Being his mother I want him to be peaceful first. She says he is. 
AS: But you just said it didn’t help. 
NE: It doesn’t, but I wish it for him. It doesn’t yet, maybe it will. I don’t know, Amy. I never thought at sixty-one I would be facing my parents who are eighty-nine, my sister who has leukemia, my dog who is fifteen, and not have Lucas. And not have a mate. Time will tell. Was this what you wanted?
AS: I have another question. I wondered about the follow-up to when you had his phone and you told me you called the number he had been calling. Did anything ever come of a drug dealer or anything in LA?
NE: No. Did I tell you he got a text? It said, “Got Roxy?” I called the Santa Monica police. That was the second time I spoke to the Santa Monica police. They asked for Lucas’s phone number. I think they were trying to pin people. I don’t know what happened; I never heard from them. I was very tempted to follow up with them. There was a woman there -- I know who she is through these texts. She said, “You’ve got to get off drugs.” But then she was giving him drugs and is an addict herself. I said, “You could call about Cat.” 
AS: Is that her name?
NE: Her nickname or something. I went, I don’t know if I want to put my energy here. 
AS: Someone said you could call and report her?
NE: The sergeant from the narcotics bureau said, “Call me anytime.” I didn’t want to spend my energy there. I was going through emails and everything and I never heard back from them. California is different from Minnesota, too. They go after the dealers much more actively here. No, nothing was put to rest. I see what Sam is going through. Now they changed the court date. The defense attorney now is trying to separate all the cases. Of course he is. He is working on behalf of his client. If they find something out and they let us know, great. I told them I want to know. I don’t want to go fishing. 
AS: Yeah, you don’t want to dig through all of his stuff. 
NE: I have it all on his phone and his computer. I have stayed away right now. I look through the texts. There are over two thousand I have to read. I said, No, Nancy. You have your whole life to read this stuff. Some of it is really going to hurt you. He was suffering. The night he died he was really suffering. I saw those texts. He was vomiting profusely; he was very sick. That’s horrible to learn. It’s such a crazy thing. I think about the Nar Anon group and I think it is a beautiful thing that I can show up there and other people that have lost their child. I’m not there. 
AS: How is your grief group doing for you?
NE: It only meets once a month. I have a grief therapist that I started with and I see once a week that I like a lot. Even the grief group is a little hard for me because people are talking about their gratitude. I don’t have it. And I’m the only one with an only child. 
AS: That would make a big difference I would think. 
NE: For me it does. My cabin is empty. I don’t know what I am going to do. I am proceeding with Facing Addiction; I’m proceeding with Cardboard House.
AS: What are you doing with Facing Addiction? What are your thoughts on that and why that group?
NE: I don’t really know yet what I’m doing with them other than I’m collaborating on different things. I’m trying to formalize in my head what I’m trying to do with them and find out what they want to do with me. I don’t really know where we tie the bow. "

Narrator
Amy Sullivan
Interviewer
June 5, 2016
St. Paul, Minnesota
AS: Alright, this is Amy Sullivan. I am recording an interview with Nancy Espuche, did I say your name right? 
NE: Espuche.
AS: Espuche. E-S-P-U-C-H-E.  in her apartment in St. Paul on June 5th, 2016. Nancy, will you state your name and your address and then that you give me permission?
NE: My name is Nancy Espuche, I live in St. Paul. I give Amy permission to record and document any way she like, whatever it is we talk about today.
AS: Thank you.
NE: You’re welcome.
AS: Okay can you tell me a little bit about yourself and where you grew up, your childhood, family, your education?
NE: I grew up in Long Island, New York. We originally lived in a place called Great Neck, if anyone is familiar. I am the youngest of two daughters, I have an older sister Lisa who actually turned 63 on Thursday. I am 60, she is two and a half years older than me. We then moved to Jericho, Long Island. My dad was an educator, he was a teacher, and then became a principal in what is known as Bedford-Stuyvesant, a very tough area of Brooklyn and was pretty beloved, and is still a pretty beloved man. He ran summer camps for [unclear] every summer, a sleep away camp for kids five months old until twenty. I think it was there that I really learned who my dad was and learned to appreciate him and my sister and different aspects of her being. I had a tough mom; pretty critical, pretty, you know it’s her way or the highway, not nurturing in any capacity. I’ve learned a lot about her life which was pretty traumatic too. My development as a person really circled around the need for good mothering. Which, I did not have. As my sister and I both say, we raised ourselves. She did it very differently than I did. My sister now has leukemia, and we are watching that. If it wasn’t for my dad, who is kind and thoughtful and nurturing to a degree, I think life would have been very different for me. I went to school… do you want more?
AS: Yeah, keep going.
NE: I graduated from Stony Brook University with a psychology degree. I did start my masters at Hunter College in New York City. I was married at the time very briefly to someone I went to highschool with and he became an abusive husband, and I was lucky now thanks to him to get out of the marriage really quickly after a year, and then proceed with my studies. Then, I got a job that I was at for 31 years on. Moved forward, met my husband when I was 31. We have a funny story that I will reserve not for here [laughter]. Raymond is from France, he was visiting New York at the time. We ended up getting married shortly after, and we were married for 20 years. I am divorced now for eight. We had Lucas when I was just 35, I had just turned 35. Mothering was the one thing that I was desperate to do then in my life. 
AS: When do you remember having that feeling?
NE: Yeah, very young. 
AS: Before you had a child?
NE: Yes. I really wanted to be a mother. I really wanted to be a good mother. A nurturing mother, an available mother [laughter].
AS: How was your experience mothering when it actually happened at first.
NE: Well, Lucas was a sick child. So it tainted everything. We didn’t know it at the time, but at three months old Lucas was a very collicky baby. We now can contribute that to his illness, we just thought he was collicky at the time. But, at the age of about three months, and I was nervous, I was a nervous mom at the beginning, when he was making noise about because he cried so often. And at about three months Lucas started to throw up for a couple of hours, but it started to happen pretty regularly, once a week, but continued to increase over the course of time. We then realized after, you know, he was in and out of the doctors and the doctors kept saying it was stomach flu. And I said, “this isn’t the stomach flu.” I don’t remember exactly when it happened but about a year in a half we rushed him to the hospital. They thought he had twisted intestines, but they couldn’t even get him off of me because he was clinging like a monkey. He calmed down and we went home but that accelerated pretty rapidly my... his dad was in the restaurant business and he wasn’t home evenings and weekends so I was really left to Lucas’ illness, or what became an illness, and it was horrifying because I didn’t know what was happening and he would be up for hours screaming in pain. 
Finally, after I don’t know how long it took we changed doctors, but Lucas was about three. We rushed him up to the hospital. He had been vomiting profusely for hours and was really sort of out cold in my arms. The surgeon that came in at the time, the pediatric doctor on call, of course won’t look at a baby without getting all the bloodwork done, and realized that all of Lucas’ pancreatic enzymes were off the charts and that he was suffering from pancreatitis. And the only reason my baby would ever have pancreatitis is they have a pancreatic tumor or something pretty deadly. So, that’s when the reality of what we were facing really took hold. From that point forward Lucas was, every week, monitored, blood tests, sonograms, restricted with food, knocked out for six hours with other tests, it was constant; insane. It was a week, it was in January, one month shy of his fourth birthday they ended up doing an endoscopy because something was really obvious. They hadn’t done one, and they found what the surgeon always thought was the case with Lukey. He had a cyst called choledocal [unclear] cyst it was common bile duct. A congenital cyst between the gallbladder and the liver and he couldn’t digest any of his food. He had probably been struggling with pancreatitis from the day he was born. 
So, he went in and they said once it burst it would be gone. And from that point forward... he had surgery for 7 hours, he was cut pretty open, they also removed his gallbladder. We thought he would be in the hospital for 14 days but, I think this is one of the most telling and most important things to note, when he woke up with tubes everywhere, because he had a bag at the time, I went down to bend down to kiss him and the surgeon was there and with all his might he took his hand and he slapped me in the face and said, “Stupid mommy, stupid mommy.” And the surgeon pulled me and Raymond out. 
AS: Who slapped you?
NE: Lucas. The surgeon said, “I want you to hear me. Children who have this kind of medical trauma, an intervention from birth, grow up with rage, anger, inability to listen to adults. You need to get him into therapy as soon as you can.”
AS: Wow. 
NE: And we got home and I don’t know who Lucas would have been. Maybe he would have been the same, but he apparently became really belligerent, hostile, tough. Really tough. 
AS: Just as the doctor had…
NE: Yes. And then he had more medical problems. They thought he had turrets, he started to tick terribly and we were running everywhere. It ended up he had what’s called PANDAS which is from all the stress that he had. There is a correlation now between stress and ticks and it looks like turrets. So then he had his tonsils and thyroids out and was in the hospital again. Then after that, he was hit in the head in kindergarten and was knocked out for twelve hours with a severe concussion. 
AS: My goodness.
NE: Then after all of that I got very sick, and he watched me because my autoimmune system just went berserk. So I got very sick for five years and was rushed to the hospital for at least once a week and he would witness that and it was for trauma. So to answer your question in a very long way, motherhood for me from the very beginning was all about crisis. From birth, it was crisis after crisis. And, it was difficult from day one.
AS: Did you feel supported by your husband?
NE: Not enough. No. 
AS: Were you working full time?
NE: Yes. Now, neither of us could sleep in the middle of the night, when either I needed to get to the hospital for myself because that’s when my problem really would occur, I would wake up and my tongue would be this big. Or, Lucas was not well. And there was no waking Raymond up. “Leave me alone, I need to sleep.” So I was pretty exhausted, I was working pretty… ten hour days and, with Luke all night and on weekends. 
AS: Would it be fair to say you were... you raised Lucas on your own?
NE: Yes, it would be. 
AS: A single mother with a man in the house. 
NE: Yes. In many instances.
AS: Yes. 
NE: Yes. He didn’t take an active role with… Lucas was a remarkable athlete. He was like a superstar kid. He is so bright, beyond bright. And, he got into remarkable schools and ended up at the University of Miami and he wanted to go there because they had a good business school. He was a super-star athlete, he couldn’t play nice in the sandbox, but he was recognized for his academics and athleticism. He played for the Junior Olympics... but Raymond is an artist. And Lucas is an all-American kid. 
AS: Right. 
NE: I was a sports junkie [laughter]. So… And we were very tight, and we still are. I am really Lucas’ go to. I’m his universe. I don’t want to be his universe. I want to be his mother. 
AS: Interesting.
NE: But not his universe.
AS: Do you think you played a part in that?
NE: I think I did. I don’t think I’d do is... play the same role to the degree which I had. But, the habit has been formed.
AS: Can you back up and tell me when Lucas was born, what his birthday is?
NE: February 18, 1991.
AS: So he’s 25. 
NE: He started experimenting very early. 
AS: Yes, let’s move on to drugs.
NE: You know, he was a risk taker. Lucas was a really big risk taker. I remember at a birthday party he was dared and the police showed up. Nobody knew why, and they said someone from this location called the police. The kids had dared Lucas to call the police and say there was an emergency, and he did [laughter]. I almost had a heart attack, but he said… 
AS: Wow.
NE: He was a daring kid. And he had a lot of anger. A lot of anger. We tried therapist after therapist. 
AS: So beginning from… 
NE: Four...
AS: What point… Four years old?
NE:  People, therapists would say to me, you can’t break him. He’s not breakable right now. 
AS: What did they mean by that?
NE: He… they couldn’t get into him, into his heart and his head. 
AS: They couldn’t reach him
NE: They couldn’t reach him. He had such a wall built from all this trauma. The only thing that Lucas would say is that he felt really different: “Why me?” is still, or, “Why are you doing this to me?” is still a line he uses to this day. And, it was what he said from the minute he could talk. “Why are you doing this to me, mommy?” with his bellyache.
AS: Oh, because, oh right.
NE: ...Why are you doing this to me after his surgery.
AS: ...his physical problems, he connected those with you, and with other people being in charge of his body and mind. 
NE: Why are you doing this to me. And to this day, when he is blue, or even when I was putting him in rehab, “Why are you doing this to me?” And how do you explain to a three year old that I tried, I said, “I tried to help you. This isn’t to hurt you.” I don’t think it registered. I’m sure it didn’t. 
AS: That is fascinating. So, he’s a daredevil, he’s ten, and then when did you notice that he was starting to experiment or…
NE: I think he started to smoke pot at 13 or 14. Yeah. I didn’t realize it at the time. And, I don’t want to say I thought it was cute, I didn’t think it was cute, but I thought it was acceptable. 
AS: Yeah.
NE: But, it was a big mistake. I now know it was a terrible mistake. And I never had pills in the house. I never took them. 
AS: Back up. What was a big mistake? That you just let that slide?
NE: Yes. That I was easy about that.
AS: What would you have done differently? I’m thinking in the context of our culture where marijuana is being legalized and the 60s generation.
NE: It wasn’t legal then.
AS: Right. It wasn’t legal then. But what would you do differently?
NE: I wouldn’t drink in front of him the way I did. Not that I was… I mean socially we had parties and a lot of people were drinking. That would not be so cool today for me today at all. I would tell him that pot is illegal, and you can’t smoke it, and you can do what you want when you are out of this house. But…
AS: So he would smoke at home?
NE: Not a lot, but I really put the kibosh on it. He was going out every night and I knew what he was doing. He would come home stoned out of his mind.
AS: Right. At 13, 14?
NE: No, more like 15, 16. Tenth, eleventh [grade]. 
AS: Any other substances? 
NE: Yes. 
AS: Before then?
NE: In eleventh grade I called home, which I always did, and I asked the woman who took care him…. Lucy. “What’s going on?” And she said, “Lucas is in his room with a girl.” And I said, “I want to talk to him” and he could barely talk. He was slurring, I had never heard him like this. And he said “I’m really tired” and I said, “Lucy, what is going on in that room. He’s not tired.” And then I spoke to the girl. And I said, “You are not to leave my house. I want to know what you both took.” And they said nothing. And I said, “Well here is the deal I’m in New York City and you are not to leave the house I’m calling the police.” Because at that point Lucas had fallen asleep. I called the police, the ambulance showed up. Both of them at this point were out. They were driven to the hospital, I called my friend…. with the ambulance at my house. I was working. I was able to get back to the Island. By the time I got to the hospital, a couple of my friends were there. 
Lucas had Xanax, alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana in his system. The girl who was really in big trouble, I don’t know how she was talking to me, the way she was at first because he was the one who sounded really bad. It was awful because when he woke up he was awful to me. Disgusting. And we had somebody come to the house then that wanted to take him away, you know, like…
AS: To a residential treatment?
NE: And Lucas was leaving three weeks later because he had gotten to an exceptional program in London, for the summer, at a bank. And Raymond and I were very conflicted. Raymond wanted to send him and I didn’t. 
AS: Send him where?
NE: To London. Let him go to London.
AS: Instead of to treatment.
NE: And he went to London. 
AS: Was he 16 at this time?
NE: Eleventh grade, 16 I guess. Then, it was twelfth grade. He was never home. He was getting high all the time i didn’t know what he was doing. A week before he was leaving for college I got a call that he was in jail for a DWI. He was completely stoned out when we showed up to court on Xanax or something. And I said to the judge…. “I don't...” I was separated at the time and, I don’t know what I was thinking, wishing, hoping, praying. I couldn’t really grasp the seriousness of what was happening. I couldn’t. I think I was in such disbelief and such shock. I didn’t want to look. 
AS: Tell me about your experience with other mothers around this time. Did it shift or change over time? When he was small did you have a lot of interaction with other mothers?
NE: I had my good friends. But I didn’t have interaction with people who were struggling the same way. And honestly at this point everybody in the high school's mother looked at me like I was a really bad mom. And I was… a lot of the women in Long Island don’t work. You know they [unclear] very wealthy men. I worked a lot of hours. I wasn’t home a lot because I worked so much. I had a tough, youngster as my child. Lucas was a fighter. So, I was so uncomfortable there and I didn’t trust people there to share my life with. Except one very good friend who is still a very good friend of mine. But it was tough. It wasn’t until, really, Lucas’ freshman year of college that I got really involved because I had moved back to the city, saw my house. I moved back to Manhattan and I got very involved in something called the Freedom Institute in New York. Which is… there was a parent’s group there for people whose children were using a lot of drugs. 
AS: Was he at school at this time?
NE: He was in college. Almost kicked out supposedly. I mean, lots of problems in college with drugs. He came home... that summer I found needles and steroids. We reentered therapy, there was a lot of back and forth with this. Lots of Xanax. Back and forth. But I promise, I promise I’m finished, I’m done. 
AS: Oh, this is what happened. Get caught and...
NE: ….over and over and over again. And then I realized there was a lot of money missing. A lot of money. He had cashed a 5000 dollar check. 
AS: ...took your checkbook? 
NE: I had a check. Somehow, I don’t even know how he cashed it but he did. 5000 dollars. I had no idea at the time. I had no idea until 2 months later. Money was always missing from my wallet and I’m going, “How much money did you spend today?” Thousands of dollars he took. More car accidents. And this lasted a long time. And the first month of his junior year and that was it. I don't know I woke up. Something had happened. I called an interventionist, I was in New York, I found somebody in Florida, just a therapist, and I read him Lucas’ bio because I had written a story. And he said, “Nancy I’m good, but I’m not this good.” He said he needs to get away. And I flew down the next day. Lucas thought we were going to therapy together. I had already called the school and pulled him out. I had already called where he was living and cancelled his lease. And, I don’t know, I said, “It is up to you but you don’t have a place to live and you aren't enrolled in school. Take it or leave it.” And that was the beginning. 
AS: Is this what the therapist recommended that you do or did you do this kind of on your own? The cancelling thing?
NE: It was coming. That I did on my own but it was coming. I was at the Freedom Institute, I was getting help myself in New York. I was talking to other parents. And at that point in time something awoke in me that said “he is going to die if you don’t do something.” And of he went the next day.
AS: So he agreed.
NE: He agreed. I had his friends call me: “We will watch over him, don’t do this.” I said, “if you really care about Lucas, don’t call me again.” And I hung up the phone. I don’t know how I did it. But that was the first, we had three more after that. He went to four treatments.
AS: Ok. So how long did he stay, he’s only 25 now, so he must have been what 20, 21 by this point?
NE: Yeah, 20.
AS: Ok. 
NE: I guess. He went... he was there for 12 weeks. He then went to sober living in Atlanta, from North Carolina to Atlanta, the day he showed up in sober living he bought drugs and left, hitchhiked back to Florida. 
AS: Wow.
NE: I told him to call me when he was ready to go back but not to show up in New York. He called me intermittently, we would chat about nothing. He would say no, whatever, and then he showed up. He hitchhiked to New York. Oh no, somehow he kept me credit card number and bought himself a first class ticket to New York.
AS: Oh, first class.
NE: First class and showed up at my door.
AS: [laughter].
NE: That went on. 
AS: Did he go to treatment again after that?
NE: Not immediately. He stayed with friends in New York City. He got a job, passed his real estate license in New York. Got a job and then I started seeing him. He needed to leave that apartment, he came back to my apartment, and then same thing. He just nodded off, was spending time in the bathroom. I called the police and had him kicked out. I got the interventionist. He didn’t show up. I went to Breakthrough. And then he agreed to go to treatment. He stayed at the house the night before he was leaving and i woke up at 1:30 in the morning and he could barely move but i saw him snorting opiates. How we got to the airport…. If it wasn’t for this guardian angel….
AS: Why the airport?
NE: He was flying to Florida. 
AS: Oh, for treatment.
NE: But he could barely move. Screaming and cursing me out in the middle of Laguardia airport with the entire airport looking at me and him. He would fall down, I mean it was... and a transit person saw me, a woman, and said I think you need help. And got me through, I don't know how because he couldn't walk. Got him on an early flight and had him sit first class with the stewardesses watching him. But it was a horror scene at the airport for two hours. He was there for 3 weeks, 3 months. Unbeknownst to me, he was in touch with a criminal. He showed up…
AS: While he was in treatment? What kind of a criminal, what do you mean?
NE: I don't really know what kind of criminal, a really bad criminal.
AS: Oh oh. Like a drug dealer?
NE: A drug dealer or I think worse. Or a mafia or I’m not sure. Showed up at my apartment at Christmas, I said you have two days to get back to Florida or you are on the streets. He introduced me to this guy who said he wanted to meet me and I told the guy that he was bad news to his face. I told Lucas that if you left with him then he could write me off. Lucas was driving out to Las Vegas with him to do something supposedly, and he left. And I got a phone call three days later. Lucas was picked up in Utah, on five federal accounts. 
AS: Federal?
NE: Federal. He was in jail. I was... I don’t even know what I was. I called my sister, she got their friend who is a lawyer here, who said to me, “You gotta get him out of that jail, it is one of the worst jails in the country.” And I said, “He can’t come back to me, I can’t take him back, I can’t do it.” And my sister and Eric, her husband, agreed while he…. we got a lawyer from Utah to come to Minnesota. They took him in while we were waiting to get him into Hazelden. He did not, was not guilty of any of the….
AS: Charges?
NE: Charges. Except for possession which he agreed the Oxycontin in his pocket belonged to him. Everything else in the trunk he had no idea was in there. 
AS: And he was with the guy that was at your apartment?
NE: No, that guy flew to Utah, and he probably knew what was in his car, he was criminal. 
AS: Oh, a different guy.
NE: Who had been in jail before for possession and dealing. Lucas went to Hazelden and was there... but he wasn’t doing the work at all. Dr. Lee, the head psychiatrist at Hazelden said, “He’s a tough kid Nancy, and he’s a danger.” And what will be will be. He lived here, he worked here, and he relapsed real bad. And he had never done heroin before. I didn’t know he had done it, he did it twice, he didn't shoot it he snorted it, and he got violently ill actually. But I saw him and he was…
AS: He had been using pills?
NE: Big pill user, big oxycontin guy.
AS: Ok.
NE: Oh, and in college he had a grand mal seizure from the Xanax and Adderall. I got a phone call and thought it was him. I was walking in New York [to my] home and I said, “Hi Lu” and they said “It’s not Lucas, it is blah blah. We are waiting for the ambulance, we think he is breathing. We don't know if he is breathing.” Of course I flew to Florida the next day. He was disgusting then too.
AS: When he would see you after these episodes?
NE: Yeah. And his brain fried from all the Xanax and the Adderall and it didn’t know whether to go up or down. It was shortly after that, no, that was the end of his sophomore year. Then he had the summer and then the first month of his junior year. I must sound like a lunatic right now.
AS: No. You don’t. Not to me.
NE: I can’t, like what do you, like hello. When I listen to it. 
AS: Yeah, that’s true. When we hear the list of things we have been through, there’s our trauma. It’s our trauma that’s… that makes our brains do that I think. 
NE: Yeah. 
AS: Yeah. Because not very often do we list these stories in a chronological way, because it’s too painful. Right? Our brains, our traumatized moments are trying to protect us from that.
NE: And you can’t really believe that you are living this.
AS: No. It’s so true.
NE: If anybody would have ever said to me, “You ever worry about your child growing up and becoming an addict?” I would go “It’s not even on the radar, what are you talking about?”
AS: Right.
NE: It would have never even occurred to me. Yeah.
AS: So he had a bad relapse after Hazelden? 
NE: Yes and my sister…
AS: Was he living with your sister at the time?
NE: No he had an apartment with friends here. And his roommate came to me and said “We’ve got a problem.” That night my sister, Eric... I spent the whole day and got somebody here, was trying to help us get him somewhere. And Lisa, Eric, and Trevor, his roommate, went to the Mall of America where he was working and did an intervention. He was pretty high, really high.
AS: At work he was high?
NE: Yeah. The police had been involved with him a couple of time at the Mall Of America. And he was on probation mind you, for two years. We got him to Fairview. Or Alina? I don’t remember which one. Because he had to detox. He was there for 48 hours and he tried to tell me, it was the next day, that he was ok now, but he left that night for California. 
AS: For treatment?
NE: For treatment. He was there for 3 months. 
AS: So by this point he has been in treatment for an entire year
NE: At different times. 
AS: Yeah. A total of a year in treatment. Right, that’s what I meant. In totality.
NE: Right. A year. And he was in sober living for three and a half months. And he’s not involved in a program. He’s never been.
AS: Interesting. 
NE: Never. But he’s been sober for 17 months. 
AS: And he was living on his own?
NE: With his roommate, someone who goes to Pepperdine [University] who doesn’t drink or smoke. He is actually home with his folks now in China. He is Asian. He got his real estate license in California and is working. Lucas is a serious worker. He is very driven. Oh man he really wants to be successful but he is very driven by the externals. But he is in therapy now. I don’t know what kind of work he is doing there. But he is different. He has matured to a degree, he has. He is not the same person he was. But I did for a long time talk about community. I can’t write his story.
AS: No. Not at all.
NE: But I live with that uncertainty, as we all do.
AS: Right.
NE: As we all do.
AS: So, how do you live with that uncertainty?
NE: Well, I’m very engaged in my Wednesday night parent group. It is true though that when your child gets sober after a certain point you start pulling back a little bit. I think part of that is I don’t want to hear all the bad stories so much anymore. I want something else, you know, but I do go very regularly, I do go very regularly to that. I read a lot, I read a lot. I stay very connected to my women. To other mothers, I’m very connected to other mothers because that support has been a godsend, lifesaving for me. 
AS: And you found those other mothers in…. 
NE: Program.
AS: In programs.
NE: I mean the people that I met when Lucas was in Florida, Caron, three years ago, were still some of the... they live in Ohio, they live in Pennsylvania, but we are very connected. 
AS: How about the Freedom Institute. Did they use a twelve step program?
NE: No, not for us, no. And it was a very intimate program. No. It was much more of an interaction. We really spoke, the mothers, really spoke. 
AS: To each other?
NE: To each other.
AS: Just...
NE: With a therapist. It was led by a therapist.
AS: And it was all women?
NE: This was. But, I found that more women go to these things. 
AS: Well, that’s true.
NE: A lot of times… Yeah, I mean there aren’t a lot of men who really, consistently come. But it was led by Michael Noth. If you ever watched Sex and the City you know Mr. Big? Christopher Noth. This is his brother believe it or not. He is an addiction specialist. He ran this program at the Freedom Institute. 
AS: Interesting. So what, if you had to describe to someone what it is like to be, not the mother of Lucas, but the mother of an addict. What is mothering addiction like?
NE: Well, in part, I don’t feel like I have been part of the living for a long time. I don’t. There is an elephant in the room and a monkey on my back from the minute i wake up to the minute I go to sleep. It has really forced me to take a real hard look at how I show up every day for myself and in the world. I don't know if I would have done it the same way had I not been the parent of an addict.
AS: How so?
NE: I don’t know how I have contributed or if I have contributed. I don’t. But I certainly wanted to invest in understanding if what I was doing would continue to contribute, or not help Lucas. I didn’t know if changing me would change him, but I knew that if what I was doing was certainly not helping him than I wanted to change that. 
AS: Ok, right. Is it about, then, taking a chance and looking at yourself?
NE: Totally.
AS: Regardless of what your addict child does?
NE: Totally. Totally. Because I knew that whatever I was doing, that may not be working I was doing to myself too and was doing in my relationships with men. Because…
AS: What are those things that you were doing and how do they relate to mothering and your relationships with men? 
NE: I couldn’t tolerate the thought of Lucas being uncomfortable in any way. 
AS: As a mother.
NE: As a mother. So I gave in a lot. A lot. 
AS: Would you trace that back to his illness? Or would you say that even with the consequences of addiction, the illegal behavior, you didn’t want him to be uncomfortable then either?
NE: I did not…. I did not want him to be uncomfortable that’s for sure, but not to the same degree. I could tolerate him being uncomfortable more. I could not tolerate what I felt like and I’m not even sure what that really was. I could not tolerate the insanity and I needed to sort of make it ok. I needed to quiet it down, I needed to… because part of the insanity was Lucas’ incessant craziness around all of this. He was verbally abusive, he was loud, he was aggressive, he was lying, stealing, cheating, and I just wanted to attenuate that horror. I got, my anxiety was so high from all of the insanity, that I wanted to quiet that down. I also didn’t really understand, I wasn’t disciplined enough. I didn't have the discipline, to say I don't care how uncomfortable he is. It is better than being a drug addict. And not that anything could ever be worse than being a drug addict. But I thought if I did that maybe it would help him. I thought maybe, you know what, it is too Amy? I thought I would be able to get to him. I thought that I was going to be able to show him the light. 
AS: Yeah. Through all our love and sacrifice and...
NE: I did.
AS: ….efforts.
NE: I thought that with enough effort, if I tried a little bit harder and a little bit harder, he would wake up. 
AS: How do you connect that to good mothering?
NE: Well…
AS: Do you know what I’m getting at?
NE: Maybe. I think Karen… was all about bad, you know, thrown to the gutter, thrown to the walls. 
AS: Right.
NE: I never bought that philosophy. And I knew that if I didn’t continue to show up in Lucas’ life depending... and how I showed up, of course, the chances of it really would have gone off the deep end. It would have gone worse. I knew that loving him was still really important. I knew that I was not going to disown him. I did throw him out multiple times and I did say “I love you, call me when you are ready, but I can’t have you in my life or my house unless you go get help.” 
And it’s been different at different times, but I never disregarded him. I never said “I hate you,” even though I did hate him. “Don’t ever show up in my life because you’re you're out. I can’t push you out of my life.” Is that what you are getting at?
AS: yeah. Because mothering…
NE: How do you go to bed at night having birthed a child… For me, and now, you know, like, I don’t have one? I’m going to pretend they don’t exist?
AS: Right. 
NE: It’s almost crazy making, Amy. For mothers. For me. Because, I was really conflicted. Because having Lucas around made me crazy. And not having him around made me crazy.
AS: [Laughter]. And then there is that constant uncertainty of their…
NE: Wellbeing.
AS: ...wellbeing and their actual death, impending death when they use the way that they use. 
NE: Right. Right. 
AS: Would you say it is more extreme than worrying mothers anyway? 
NE: I don’t think you can compare.
AS: Like a normal kind of worrying of a mother versus mothering an addict. For you what was that like?
NE: I knew what it was like to watch my friends when their kids were first driving saying “I can’t sleep until they get the key in the door.” I understand that. That is normal worrying. I couldn’t sleep because I didn’t know if my phone was going to ring and my son was going to be dead.
AS: Right. Exactly, that’s the difference.
NE: I, and this is every day, for years, and years, and years, I don’t live with that same thought every day now, but it’s not too far away. And, if I call Lucas now and he doesn’t call me back for an hour, it is the first place I go. Where is he? What is he doing? Why isn’t he responding? Is he back there? Is he doing that again? It is where I go immediately. Where most normal mothers would go, “Oh, he’s probably out with his friends, he could be at a movie...
AS: He’s 25, he’s an adult. No.
NE: I don’t think those thoughts I think oh my god what is happening. It’s like the Sword of Damocles is over my head all the time. Waiting to just [noise that connotes death]. 
AS: Right. Would you say that you have, because one of the things I am thinking about is the double meaning of mothering addiction. Right? So there is mothering addiction or addicts, and then there is mothering addiction. And I am wondering, in the program we talk about the twelve steps and our work and our own recovery and do you have... have you ever pulled those apart at all in yourself thinking about because I have been traumatized by my sons addiction I can’t, I’m kind of addicted to mothering? Have you ever… We talk about being addicted to our addicts, but I want to take it a little bit out and think about that in terms of how does that relate to mothering?
NE: Well, I’m really aware that my mothering has really been about saving Lucas, or fixing Lucas. And it’s only very recently that I am even able to say to Lucas when he’s got a problem, “What are you doing about that?” or “What are you going to do about that?”
AS: Versus…
NE: Well, “have you thought about this and have you thought about that and da da da da.” Coming up with fourteen different ways that he could look at it. So, in terms of mothering addiction, all I want to do is mother addiction to keep my addicted child away from addiction. 
AS: Even though you know…
NE: I can’t.
AS: ...You can’t.
NE: Even though I know I can’t. But, every mother, I think, that’s probably not accurate. Many mothers I would bet, know that and would give up trying. The thought of really letting Lucas fly on his own really? I’m not there yet. I’m not.
AS: Does he know that?
NE: Yes. I am proud to say that I have made enormous changes and strides in the last three years in my life. Probably more than I have made in the last 59, 60 [years] because I really, in my heart, have not truly accepted that maybe there is just a little bit of me that can’t make a difference.
AS: Because that is the mothering part.
NE: And that’s what brings me back to, that is the mothering part. You know, I think people who have children who have problems can show up for them differently. They can offer their ideas or assistance. When it gets to addiction the message continuously is “Don’t do that, it’s not helpful.” It is probably not helpful for mothers to do that when their kids reach a certain age. I think the whole acceptance thing is still, hasn’t been taken completely.
AS: What…
NE: I haven’t accepted… I don’t really wake up to Lucas’ addiction until I call him and he’s not home and he doesn't call back. It’s like I’m right there, I can’t explain it. I’m not separate from “Oh I wonder what he's doing?” and I’m still mothering the addict. So much less, but I’m still mothering my trauma. 
AS: Yeah. 
NE: That’s what I’m really mothering. It’s like that feeling in an instant: where is he what doing? And it's like, “Okay Nancy, what do we need to do for you right now?”
AS: So you have shifted that?
NE: Yes. 
AS: And through work, a lot of work.
NE: A lot of work.
AS: What have you done? What do you do recently?
NE: I have spoken at a couple Hazelden meetings. Do you mean in terms of relation to addiction?
AS: How have you…
NE: I’m actively engaged in therapy. I’m in therapy. A wonderful woman who I see weekly. I got to lectures all the time whoever is speaking I listen, I participate, I talk about it all the time, I’m not reticent about it, I will tell anybody that I am the mother of an addict I don’t keep it secret.
AS: When did you start doing that?
NE: Immediately.
AS: His first time in treatment? When did the shift happen then, let’s go back a second. When did the shift happen between the mother who didn’t feel comfortable at school to you knowing that just being willing to say that?
NE: That it was time to go to treatment?
AS: Yes, well not just to send him to treatment but often we don’t admit to very many people when our kid first goes into treatment. So I’m wondering at what point were you willing to just put it all out there and tell people? Did you have a moment… Did you live in shame and stigma?
NE: I still have shame. I still have shame.
AS: But you don't feel the stigma?
NE: I don’t pay attention to it. I don’t know what people say or think. I mean I’m sure people maybe say what happened in that household. I’m sure they do. I was willing to talk about it with my friends and my family immediately. I was never quiet about it. I was really willing to go really public with it. The minute that the therapist in Florida said to me “I’m good Nancy, but I’m not that good” I went “Oh my god.” And it was at that moment that I said, let it rip, Nancy. 
AS: Interesting. And he was 20. 
NE: He was 20. But it wasn’t like people didn’t know. 
AS: Oh right. But, yeah I was just looking for that moment when you realized…
NE: I think I realized it when I really saw the steroids, the needles. But, I think I didn’t know enough because I think I would have done something. I think you do something when you really know. When something becomes really clear to me there is no wavering. It was at that moment when I knew. It’s now, Nancy, that’s it. It's now or never. It's do or die. I had a do or die moment at that moment. And that’s when I started to engage. Oh, and then I was very involved in the Caron [unclear] parent meetings in New York. Up until the day that I moved here. And the first thing I did was look for parent meetings. I was first going to the Hazelden meetings. And then I… I don’t know how I found…
AS: Our Nar-Anon group?
NE: Maybe through the internet. So, I listen, I engage my friendships. Many of them are around parents of addicts. 
AS: It’s our community.
NE: It’s our life, really. So, I mean, every day I do something related to this world. Whether it is helping someone else, listening to someone’s story, reading something, watching something, showing up somewhere, speaking. 
AS: So you have done some speaking?
NE: I told my story, to a degree, in Hazelden and in New york.
AS: When you’ve gone back?
NE: No, when I was at Caron.
AS: Oh, okay.
NE: Up until Hazelden, because I was in New York when Lucas was in Hazelden. I didn’t move out here until he was out of Hazelden. 
AS: And then he was up here.
NE: And then he went to California. But, I would do anything. It’s not that I want to live… People would say to me “Don't you want to get away from it, Nancy? As a mother. Don't you want to start thinking about life differently?” I don’t really. I really don’t. Because I would rather be able to show up for other people. Other mothers.
AS: right. Mothering other mothers through addiction. 
NE: Yeah. 
AS: Through their child’s addiction.
NE: I am going to say I don’t know how half of us mothers are standing. I don’t. I really don’t. I'm surprised more of us haven’t have nervous breakdowns, emotionally collapsed, ended up in the hospital with some horrific illness. Cracked up, or became addicts. [Laughter] I mean honestly, I don’t, I really don’t, Because once you know where you are you are in such a spiral. Your life is never the same as a mother.
AS: No. It's true. 
NE: And I didn’t have other children so I don’t know what it would have been like to be the parent possibly of a second child that may not have been an addict. And what that would have looked like. I only know mothering in relation to addiction. 
AS: Would you say that you are more, well you already said this, nevermind. 
NE: I am much less judgemental.
AS: Okay. Do you want to talk about the shame and judgment?
NE: You know, I remember too as a younger woman and looking at somebody’s disastrous child and thinking what is happening in that house? What is the mother doing what is the father doing? I am too educated now to know that we are not responsible for that... it is complete addiction. I don’t judge. I may have thoughts and feelings if I’ve witnessed something, saying “I don’t think that’s serving their child.” Out of all the education I’ve gotten. But, if I see a child who is down and out my immediate thought next is not who is their mother and father? 
AS: Right.
NE: I often admit people think that about me though. I do. And it’s hard. It’s hard you know I’m not a Facebooker anyway but you look at all these blissful youngsters graduating, getting married, blah blah. 
AS: In your son’s peer group, yeah. 
NE: And it is very piercing. It really is. But, I have to tell you Amy, and I don’t know if any other mother feels this way, but I am a big believer that we will get exactly what we ask for in this lifetime. And I know in the deepest part of me that Lucas and I were meant to be together because we both had a lot to learn. He has been my biggest teacher. My biggest teacher and my best teacher because I’ve had great teachers and I’m like “Ok yeah I don’t need to learn that.” I needed to learn about me and parenting and how to show up and be educated on this whole thing too. And that was because of Lucas. 
AS: Do you consider yourself a good mother?
NE: I’m very judgemental about myself. I could not answer easily. Yes, I would consider myself a good mother. I can’t say that affirmatively. I can say that I have given my best to Lucas, possibly some of my worst. I think if Lucas would sit down and really think about it that he would say he was very loved by me and is very loved by me and that I was his biggest champion. He will remind me of all the gifts I gave him. But, if I were to take an aerial view, I have a lot of would’ve should’ve could’ve. But don’t we all? Even the healthiest parents.
AS: Oh yeah, no matter who your kids are.
NE: I feel proud to have showed up this way now. I do. So I think my parenting has really gotten better. 
AS: Would you say you were the mother you aspired to be when he was little?
NE: Often. Often. Not all the time, but often. Yeah. This thing called… There was something on TV yesterday about mother’s and sons too. But I think it is this thing called Mothers and Children. It’s different. I mean that’s the big joke and one of the first words out of their mouth: my mother. I think the rivers go so deep for all of us, every single one of us with our own mothers. And I think the same is true for being a parent. 
AS: Yeah, with our children.
NE: With our children. 
AS: This is really wonderful.
NE: Was it helpful?
AS: Yeah. Do you have any other thing that you want to share?
NE: No, we just need to keep on keeping on. Keep doing the work. Ourselves. Because like anything else you can learn something and then unlearn it very quickly.
AS: And then have to learn it again.
NE: And this really is a process. A never ending process. I think the biggest secret for mothers is to learn how to love themselves as much as they love their children. 
AS: Right.
NE: I think that is the big crucial piece that we are… because it is easy to not do that as a person but it is harder to do that I think as a mother who has a child who is suffering. 
AS: One thing we didn’t touch on was, at what point did you learn that addiction was a disease, or did you hear that, or what did you think about that when you first heard it. What was your process?
NE: Here is the thing. I have a problem with that. And I just bought this book called Unbroken Brain. I don't know if you have heard about it. I think there are so many factors that go into addiction. But, I have not adopted the philosophy or the belief that addiction is solely a disease and that is the problem. I think it has components of that, like everything else. But, Unbroken Brain, and I’ll be very brief. [Unclear] put it on our website actually. She was an addict, a woman who has been studying addiction for years and years and years and years. She believes that addiction is a mental illness in adolescence. And that almost, if not all, addicts, and I haven’t started the book yet, and people who become addicts lives had some serious trauma in them. Could have been medical intervention, could have been crazy household, could have been sexual abuse, could have been physical abuse, could have been verbal abuse. But some… the way in which their brains embraced whatever their experience was and what their perception of that, and when they got high for the first time the relief that their brain felt from the trauma and that it is a very learned behavior. Eventually you physically become addicted, no question. I believe more along the lines of her. And, I think it has a component that there are just some people who can take opiates for two months because they have a broken pelvis and then it is over and they don’t think about it again. Then there is another person who takes them with the same surgery and they become a full blown addict. I do believe it is about brain chemistry a lot. I have always had trouble with this whole disease model. 
AS: Good, I’m glad I asked you that.
NE: I am very timid sharing that a lot because I think people judge me for that, you know. [laughter]
AS: Well there is just a shift happening right now. There’s so much...
NE: And the truth is none of us know. 
AS: That’s right
NE: We don't know. 
AS: That’s right.
NE: We also don't know why it is happening to so many people. 
AS: Right.
NE: I mean it’s hard for me to believe that thousands and thousands and thousands of youngsters have this same disease. Like why are all of our generations’ kids have this disease called addiction?
AS: Right if it’s a disease.
NE: If it’s a disease. Did we drink too much coffee when we were pregnant? I mean I don’t know. 
AS: Right, that’s interesting.
NE: Because really, I mean not that there aren’t a lot of addicts. But now 50 year old women are becoming addicts. There is a big thing now for women in their fifties. Menopause, divorces, loss of money, vitality, feelings of womanliness, losing your period, the whole thing. Drinking more and more. Taking pills. Why? Did they have a disease?
AS: It is more complex is what you are saying. That’s interesting.
NE: I mean they’ve drinking their whole lives, and suddenly they have a disease they haven't had the last thirty years? I don’t know. I don’t know. But I do know we are supposed to be doing something about it. Because that is what the world is telling us.
AS: Yeah, clearly.
NE: Because that is why it shows up this way. I don’t know if you heard, if you were at the meeting, but [unclear] and [unclear] went to the meeting and there was Federal and State people there. Minnesota has the fifth lowest population of addicts who have died of overdoses in the country. Lowest. I thought we were the second highest here. 
AS: Wow, no it’s... Yeah. 
NE: Fifth lowest of all the states, and ten people a month in Hennepin county alone are dying of an overdose. That’s why how can mothers forget? How do we forget? 
AS: Right. Because it is around us all the time.
NE: People are sober and then they are dead. And that is what mother’s live with. 
AS: Yes. 
NE: Well, at least that is what this mother lives with. 
AS: Thank you nancy.
NE: You’re welcome. Was this helpful, was this what you wanted?
AS: Yes. 
NE: Was it? You didn’t have a sense of something else or..?
AS: No, it was perfect."

SA: We'll begin by having you state your name and having you say you give us permission to record this. 
RE: Okay, my name is Roberta Evanson, I go by Robin, and you have permission to record this. 
SA: Thanks.
SL: It's May 18th, and we're in Duluth. 
SA: Do you want to start about telling us a little about your childhood, family, and growing up?
RE: Okay, well I was born in 1956. I'm sixty-one today. I was born as the last child--I have five siblings--my father was married before my mother and had one daughter, and then met my mother and had four of us. Then when I was fourteen my mother took in a foster child who I consider a sister. We lived in southern California. My mother was from Superior, Wisconsin and my father's from Ottumwa, Iowa. My mom was born in 1919 and my dad was born in 1911, so I was kind of a late child, bit of a late child, compared to my brother's and sisters. Being the youngest my next oldest sister was eight years older than I am. I had a niece who was seven years younger. My half-sister was twenty-two years older than me and she passed a few years ago. None of them have addiction issues. Compulsive overeating, but not any kind of substance abuse issues. My father was what I think of as a periodic drunk. Whether he's an alcoholic or not would have been his decision to make, but he was very unpredictable. He had long periods of not drinking followed by short periods of heavy drinking. When he drank he was really violent. Was very physical with my mother in front of us kids--on purpose in front of us kids. He'd get us up in the morning and the middle of the night and drag us into the living room and call her names and berate her. Made sure we knew what he thought of her and that kind of thing. 
When I was five my mom had saved enough money to move out. My oldest sister Barbara had come to live with us for a while and then had gone back to live with my dad's sister, her aunt, in Virginia. And then she had moved on and gotten married. In fact she was married the year I was born. Then my next sister Marlene had already moved out. She had gotten married. 
My brother Tom was still at home. He was in his senior year of high school, and my sister Kathy was still of course at home. I was in kindergarten. I think I had just--had I left? No, I was just getting ready to start kindergarten and my brother decided to stay with my dad, which was really hard on my mom. It was because he wanted to graduate high school from the school he was in. He was on the football team and so forth. As soon as graduation he enlisted and moved out right away. It wasn't much longer. 
My mom and I and my sister Kathy moved to Redondo Beach. My mom worked two jobs, so my sister had to take care of me. My sister kind of picked up where my dad left off. She resolved all her emotional issues through violence. Again, it was a periodic kind of thing. It wasn't an everyday kind of thing, but when it occurred it was pretty severe. It didn't really stop until one time she really, really went a little too far and I had climbed out my bedroom window and was hiding in the garden of my neighbor. She found me--the mother--and she had me call my mom. Of course, back then, you know, you didn't call your mom at work because she could lose her job. I had to call mom at work and she had to come home. I have no idea what she said to my sister because that was behind closed doors, but what she told me was she needed me not to make my sister so angry. She had to work and if she was going to support us she couldn't lose her job and she had to depend on Kathy to keep an eye on me. She needed to depend on me not to make my sister angry. So, I learned at a really young age how to be responsible because I was going to make sure my mom could depend on me. I really loved my mom. 
Kathy and I kind of found our way. I think the difficulty for me with Kathy was that she was one person behind closed doors and another person out in public. It was kind of like that Beatles song, Eleanor Rigby: Keep a face in a jar by the door. That's pretty much how it was. But I had a very loving relationship with my mom and with my sister, it just was mixed with this unpredictable kind of thing. I think I learned also at a really young age not to trust what you saw. You know, you just didn't know--especially with my father--you never knew what you were going to get. I never knew if I was going to get this loving, caring father or if I was going to get this violent, alcoholic stranger that I had to be afraid of? My trust issues ran pretty deep pretty young. 
Being from that era--being born in '56 and starting to be raised in the sixties--not a lot of kids had divorced parents. That kind of made me odd man out a bit. And their mothers--most of them were at home. Not only was I from a divorced family, but my mom was working all the time. I wanted to be where I was comfortable, so I sought other kids who were like me. Although I was raised very strictly--I mean it was like call the cops, just don't tell my mom--you know, kind of a thing. Not all these other kids were--they were a little bit more...the parents weren't paying that much attention to their kids. Those were the kids that I gravitated towards. They were the ones I felt the most comfortable with. I did a lot of the standard stuff. I was in Camp Fire Girls, and I played violin all the way through high school, and I was a good student. I spent my years in high school just waiting to get out. I had no real ability to plan or see into tomorrow. It wasn't--I think a lot of teens are like that, but I just didn't know, ""Oh I'm going to go to college,"" or, ""I'm going to do this."" Nobody in my family had gone to college. None of my brothers and sisters had gone to college. So it really wasn't something that was very--it just wasn't talked about much. It ws assumed that I would go because that's the next thing you're supposed to do. 
I had been working since I was fourteen. I babysat the kids next door. Their parents were hippies, and they came home after an evening with a group of friends. I was going to leave and they said, ""Oh, no, you can stay."" They were smoking black tar opium in a big water pipe and offered me to partake. I thought, well, heck yeah. I want to be a part of this. It had nothing to do--it's not like I got high and said, ""Oh, this is it! It's the answer to all my problems!"" But it made me feel a part of. Right? Especially when you're fourteen and you want to be thought of as older and, you know, accepted and all of that. And it was okay. It was just fine. It wasn't like the ridiculous movies they were showing us at school about reefer maddness. I think, too, it also made me not believe what I was told about drugs and them being dangerous in any way. I was pretty clueless about that. I didn't know any addicts. That wasn't a term we used back then. We certainly never talked about Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. It just wasn't a thing. I think they were more focused on kids not getting pregnant. That was probably the deal. I wasn't really premiscuous--a little too self conscious for that and a little less trusting than maybe others. That was growing up. 
SA: So that was about eighth grade?
RE: Yeah. Seventh grade was a great year. We drank a little bit if somebody got a beer or something, but it wasn't something--we were doing baseball and hide and go seek and running around the neighborhood. Had to be home when the street lights were out. Stuff like that. I lived in a pretty lower to middle class--but back then even though we were at the beach it still wasn't--people with money lived up on the hill. They didn't live in our neighborhood. It was about--I went to school with about thirty to forty percent Mexican American population, too. It was a pretty diverse neighborhood. 
SL: Can you tell us a little bit about your high school years?
RE: High school. Well, again, it was a real tough thing for me because I was bright. In eighth grade I had taken classes up at high school already. I was a very good student. I had no problem with learning. My mother read to me as a kid and, you know, you went to bed at eight o'clock and read for half an hour and then it was lights out. I learned to explore through literature. Book learning came easy for me. I did really well in my studies, but I wasn't this straight-laced kid who had the 2.3 kids at home and dad working and mom--that group of kids that tended to be in the honors classes and those kinds of things tended to be the ones whose parents were paying attention to them. My mom paid attention to me, but it was a different environment so I felt odd man out there. Then I wasn't a sports person by any stretch of imagination--basketball, but that was about it--and so I didn't fit in there. I didn't feel real girly, so I never felt like I knew how to accessorize or whatever. Probably because my sister was really good at it! [laughs] It was just easier to not make that important because I didn't feel good at it. I probably felt the most at ease in my orchestra class because that was kind of a mix of kids, but didn't socialize outside of class. By the time I was a freshman I started making friends outside of school. Older kids. 
SA: Were these people you worked with?
RE: Some. Yes, by the time I was a junior in high school--yes. When you use drugs everybody uses drugs. That's what you think. That's my whole social connection was through smoking weed. My best friends Maria and Shelly from eighth grade on--and Shelly and I were friends from second grade. Her parents divorced, her dad was quite the hippie. He was an accomplished artist and grew his own weed. I would buy like a quarter pound of weed from him and then sell three [lits] and then get mine for free--needless to say I became an accountant. [laughs] That worked really well for me. That was something I did on a daily basis. Pot was a lot different than it is today. It wasn't as potent. It was just--nobody knew I was high. My mother never thought something was going on. And then I started finding--benzodrine. We used to get little white crosses. Loved those. Didn't care too much for downers like reds [Seconal] and that kind of thing because I felt a little out of control. I didn't like alcohol for the same reason. I didn't like that feeling of behaving in a way that I couldn't stop myself from behaving. It didn't remove inhibitions. It removed everything who I am. Pot didn't feel like that, and neither did uppers. I did some LSD and some mushrooms and stuff like that, but again it wasn't my thing. 
SA: How would you say the opium made you feel?
RE: I did not start using heroin, opioids, until I was twenty-five. 
SA: I was just referring to the time when you were babysitting. 
RE: Oh, that was kind of a one time thing. I mean who could afford black tar opium? That was not a repeat thing. And it wasn't readily available. At least at our age. 
SA: So, you started experimenting with marijuana. How did that lead you through high school and past high school?
RE: Well, again, everybody I knew was smoking weed, and at that day and age we used to smoke it in the open. We'd go to concerts and people were passing joints around. It was just a different kind of thing. It's kind of odd to me how it went from being so casual to being so restricted to know everybody wants it to be legal! I can't quite figure out what the whole moral dilemma is. At that point in time it was just a really casual drug. I can remember at some point in my early adult--my oldest sister Marlene coming to me and asking me if I could get her and her boyfriend some weed. She was the one who wouldn't let me swear in front of her, you know? It was a different time. I was still working, I was still going to school, I was still getting good grades. It wasn't interfering with my life. 
SA: Did you sell for a long time?
RE: All through high school. But not--I wasn't a dealer, I just scored for people. It was more like that. 
SA: And that kind of got you friends? Or not as much?
RE: They were already my friends. It was something that I was not ignorant about people going to jail for. It wasn't something I was interested in--I didn't need the money. It's not like I was trying to be a drug dealer. That wasn't the idea. And I didn't really know 'drug dealers' or what I thought of as dealers--I would eventually know dealers, yes. I had a connection at school because--that kind of thing. I wasn't known as somebody you'd go get something from. I had a very tight inner circle of friends that that portion of it was for. 
SA: What happened after you graduated high school?
RE: By then, my senior year in high school like I said I had gotten in with a group of a bit older--maybe four years older than I was--and they left Hermosa Beach and went to Florida. A couple of them were going to go to school there. I went on to the junior high and I was there for about a month and I couldn't stand it. It just did not work for me. Junior high in California is fifteen thousand students. It was a big school. I just didn't know what I was doing there and I wasn't comfortable there. I was having trouble with my mom at home because my mom had become very successful. She became an entrepreneur and very successful. She worked all the time. When I was a senior--she was able to hire people and do all that, and so she was home and around a lot. My oldest sister--my sister that had lived with me--had moved out when I was ten. From ten until I was eighteen I was making my own decisions pretty much. I had restrictions and all of that, but it wasn't like I had someone saying, ""Well this is what you should wear. This is what you should pack for lunch. It's time to take a bath. Time to wash your hair."" Whatever. I mean it wasn't like that. Suddenly at eighteen my mom is in the picture and she wants to play that role. I'm looking at her like, ""Who are you? I don't think so."" It began this strife between us. There was always a little bit of that because I was pretty independent at fourteen, and I could get pretty mouthy, but everybody in my family is mouthy. It's just kind of how we are. Again, I love my mom and we got along. We would do things together, and I was her plus one in a lot of cases. She was a member of the Business and Professional Women's clubs and would bring me in and I would sing and play guitar and do their entertainment for them, and I got to know all these women. I learned to really love women and the friendships they showed one another. It was a Women Helping Women orgainzation, so that was very strong in my upbringing. 
So, as a senior in high school and then after graduating I was not prepared to have my mom telling me what I could and could not do on a decision--like I was home sick one day. I had a cold. It was a Saturday. I just kind of layed around in my pajamas and watched TV. I thought, ""I've got to get out of here."" I called Kenny and Eileen and I said, ""What are you guys doing?"" I mean we didn't--we weren't out getting in trouble. It was, oh, we're playing spades and Kenny played flute and I played guitar and we would all get together and jam and smoke weed. That's just kind of the way it was. My mom said, ""You're not going anywhere."" I'm like, ""Excuse me?"" ""You've been sick all day, you're not leaving."" I said, ""I'm just going over to Kenny and Eileen's. I'm just going to be inside their house. What's the problem?"" It turned into this enormous battle of will. I finally gave in because it came to the point where were about to be violent with each other and it scared me that I could go there. 
On Monday morning Mom went to work and I went to her bedroom and got out the pass book that had my college funds in it. It was a joint account, and it had at that time $11,200 in it. I remember like it was yesterday. I went to the bank and I took out $1,200, which I thought was a nice round nubmer and I left her ten grand. I called my friends in Florida and I said, ""I'm coming out there."" I bought a ticket and had my friend Maria bring me to the airport. I left a note on the kitchen table that said: Have gone to Florida. Will call. That was my big 'f' you to my mom. We'll see whose in charge of my life. That's how I left high school. 
SA: What was life like in Florida?
RE: It was pretty cool. I roomed with four people. I rode a bus to get around. They had really good public transportation unlike southern California. I got a job at the court house in the tax assessor's office, which was only a few blocks from where I lived. I went to the clubs at night because you had to be eighteen to drink there. I dind't drink much but I went dancing a lot. I met a boy. He was five years older than me, John, and I thought I was in love. I'm sure for who I was at the time I was about as in love as a person could be, I suppose. I had this unfinished responsibility at home and it didn't feel right. After about--not long--maybe five or six months I went back. Made things right with my mom. I did a tecnical school for medical office stuff, or whatever. I don't even remember. John courted me long-distance and he wanted me to come back. I told mom, I said, ""I think I want to go back."" I was waiting for her to scream, and she just said, ""What is it I can help you do to pack?"" 
So, I went to Florida. Lived down in the Keys. Poor as poor could be because you can't make much money there back in those days anyway. We smoked a lot of weed. That's about all we did was smoke a lot of week. I worked as a waitress and he worked as a heavy equipment operator at the dump. After a year we decided to get married. We got married. Then moved around different places in Florida, and then I just needed to come home. I needed to come back to be with my family. 
I drug this poor Florida country boy back to Los Angeles, and he did not do well there. I did. I got a job at a company--my sister helped me get a job--and I ended up just [makes blowing wind noise] up the scale because the business was growing by leaps and bounds in the telecommunication industry. I was really good at business processes. I set up stuff and I did really well. And then I found cocaine. My girlfriend introduced it to me, my friend Maria. She was single and I was still with John. Pretty soon I didn't want to be with John anymore. I had lost a lot--the quick cocaine weight loss program, you know, so I was looking pretty good and was getting a lot of male attention. I was a different person by the time I was twenty-four than I was when I met him at eighteen. And he was already twenty-five so now he's going on thirty and he's pretty much the same guy he's always been. God, he was such a nice guy. Could have sold him to anybody; I mean it. Get him up on the auction block and--anybody, they'd fight over him. He was just a really great guy. But I didn't understand any of that at the time and I just wanted to move on. I believe, I guess, in serial monogomy. I'm not a player, but I couldn't move on and do something behind his back. That didn't match my morals. So, we split. He went to live with my mother, which was another bone of contention because she just knew I was 'going through a phase' and it would all be okay, and he was a hell of a nice guy, like I said. But I started doing a lot of cocaine. I had a lot of money, and there was a lot of cocaine, and so was everybody else doing a lot of cocaine. It was a very popular, popular drug at the time. 
SL: This was in the late seventies?
RE: Let's see--when was that? I graduated in '74, so we're talking '79, '80? Almost the eighties. Drinking margaritas, smoking weed, and doing coke. It was the perfect world. It really was. I was doing really well at work and feeling like everything that defined me was work oriented. I wasn't playing my guitar anymore. I wasn't playing piano. I wasn't doing any of that. I hadn't touched my violin since I left high school. The other interests--I got this real big ego, you know? I was young, and the administrative manager of a major telecommunications corporation. I was traveling all over the United States, opening offices, hiring and training people--at twenty-five. It was a big deal. So, I didn't have a problem. I was still working. In fact, this was golden. 
SA: Until it wasn't. 
RE: Then I met Tim. I didn't do alone very well. I met Tim, and he was very different from John. He was much more cynical. He was very well-read. John was borderline illiterate. Not intellectually, but his skills were not there. Tim read the LA Times cover to cover everyday. He was interesting. He became a longshoreman. He was making some good money. We moved in together and were living together for a year, and I wasn't telling him about the cocaine. That was my business. He started coming home and he would pass out on the couch. I thought, you know, this is not my beautiful life. What's going on here? He needs to stop drinking so much. He did, he drank a lot. An Irish guy, definitely the stereotype. 
I thought, you know, the problem is that we're not doing the same drug. [laughs] If he would just do coke with me then everything would be okay. So, one day he came home. We were together five years--we lived together for a yera and I think we were married for three. It was proabably in our second year. I kind of lose track. It's been a while. [laughs] I am sixty-one. I don't know the timeline well, but the storyline was that I decided to say, ""Hey, guess what I brought home?"" I brought out a little bindle, little gram of coke, and I said, ""Do you want to snort some coke?"" I've been doing this for a long time. He said, ""Hell no. I don't want to snort that shit."" That's exactly what he said. I thought, ""My secret's out."" It was my secret. I knew at that time that I was probably spending more money and energy in using this drug than was probably socially acceptable. Again, nobody talked about addiction back then. They didn't tell you they could cure you on TV like they do today. I looked at him and I remember being just devastated. I thought, ""I'm going to lose this relationship."" He said, ""But I'll fix it."" I said, ""What's that?"" at that point in time I don't think I could have gotten high anymore much because I had been using so long through snorting that this was not working so much anymore. He says, ""Hang on a minute."" He had a rig, he had a tookit. Well, it wasn't the drinking that was making him pass out. He was using heroin. He was chipping heroin. 
SA: And you didn't know. 
RE: I had no idea. Right. We were very functional. There wasn't that stereotypical idea that you gain from poorly done newsreels and shows on addiction--or not addiction, because they didn't do shows on addiction--but the heroin addict or the alcoholic was always somone on skid row. It was never the bank president. I was up for it. I was like, man, this is a new way I can get high. And I did. I started getting high again. It had just gotten to the point that I was using because I had to use. I wasn't getting high. Well, that--for about a year that worked for me. Then I was just crazy. I had to have more drugs, I had to have more, I had to have more. He's like, ""You need to chill out. Try some of this. So, what ended up happening was I would use coke to get high and heroin to come down. Then go to work and function and do all of that. It became this back and forth thing. 
I started embezzeling from work. Not paying my taxes. We were renting a house from my mother and wasn't paying her any rent, we weren't paying our bills, we weren't doing--and then Tim wasn't going to work. It was becoming quite a problem. Then it got to be that I was using coke to get high and heroin to get well because I was strung out on heroin and I would get sick if I didn't use more. And I got pregnant. I'm like, ""He needs to do something about his problem."" Again, I was in such denial of my own--I mean, I go to work everyday. He's not going to work! This is not okay. How I judged how well I was was I'm about my job. I was almost four months pregnant before I even realized because I was so out of tune with my body. I did go to see a gynecologist. I did tell him that I was using because that scared me. He said, ""I can never repeat this, but I'm going to tell you--"" he had me come back. He did some research and then I came back, and he says, ""Look, I've been in touch with the people from Haight-Ashbury area in San Fransisco, and we don't want you to go on methadone because that's really hard on the fetus. We don't want you to kick because we don't want the baby to go through withdrawal. What we want you to do is start to cut yourself down."" 
I turned my addiction over to the care of my husband. He did. He started weening me off. He got on methadone maintenance, but by the time--again I'm not sure the storyline. He did go into treatment. I did try--I sabotaged that as soon as he got out. I was like, ""No, no, no, no."" You like hugging people I don't even know? This is not okay. This was my first exposure to treatment. My mom was going to the family group stuff. She kept going while we didn't. My daughter was born hooked. That was 1985. 
SA: How much had you weened off by this point?
RE: I was almost not using. I mean I was using, but there wasn't much there. They put her on phenobarbital as a detox for about three, four days. She was pretty--her health was good. She was small, but she was okay. Well, we knew what was going to happen when we got into the hospital because they screen parents. It's considered child abuse. They put a hold on the baby--Tim's mom took her temporarily for custody and then at thirty days we had a hearing. We met before the court in east L.A., which was really quite a joke because we were probably the only white couple in the courtroom with a white judge, and all these cases were being called and parents not showing up, parents not showing up, parents not showing up. Kids in foster care and stuff. And then we're there, right, in our business suits and grandma and great grandma and everybody's all prim and proper. The social worker said we do not recommend you give custody, and the judge was like, ""Are you kidding me?"" These are white people. They can't have a problem. So, they let us have her back full-time with monitoring. Well, monitoring in L.A. is kind of a joke because they are so overloaded with cases, so I think we saw her once in a year's time. 
I stayed clean for four months. Went to a program, an outpatient program. Tim stayed clean and then one day he came home and his eyes were pinned and I looked at him and said, ""You better have brought me some."" And we were off to the races again. So, that was 1985. I lost my job. Well, I went in and quit my job before they could find out I was embezzling money from them. I didn't exactly lose my job, I gave my job away. That was really bad. That was really bad. My mother was dying. She had cancer. She was at my sister's house, and I would go into her house and take things and hawk them. I mean it got really ugly really fast. It was probably worse getting clean and then going back than it was before I got clean. I think the demoralization was really overpowering. My mother-in-law was really a life saver. She helped my daughter. Was watching my daughter more than I was certainly. Tim took better care of her than I did. 
I guess she was fifteen months old, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I called my brother and told my brother I needed help. My sister tells me that I called her off and on all night long and my brother off and on all night long, and they were just ignoring me. My brother says finally after twenty-four hours of calling me off and on he goes, ""I figured you might be serious."" I packed up Kaitlyn's stuff and handed her to Tim. I said, ""You go stay at your mom's. My brother's going to be here. He will kill you if he sees you."" Because my problem was because of Tim. Everything was because of Tim. And that was convenient for me. That was fine with me. They could think that. I went into inpatient treatment. On my fourth day my mom died. So that was pretty rough. I was lucky that I was in treatment because I probably wouldn't have even known. They were able to come and get me and I was able to see her. I asked her if she could ever forgive me and she says, ""I have nothing to forgive you for, Robin. But you're really sick so you need to stay. Finish."" I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I was like,  ""Take me back!"" 
So they kept me a little extra long, and then they had--they started--that program was really intense. They had--it was the Raider Program out of St. Peter Peninsula Hospital. You started in inpatient, and you started outpatient at the same time. Their outpatient program was Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Mondays and Wednesdays it was three hours, and Friday it was two hours. You spent the first hour in--the family members were in their group, and the family went through this whole thing at the same time for as much as you did. The families were in their family groups and the addicts were in their groups, addicts and alcoholics, and then they'd have an hour where you'd come together and they'd do an education kind of thing. A presentation, lecture, movie, whatever. Of course the counselors were all talking about you and your respective family members. Then you would come together in mixed groups. It was pretty--there was a number of people. There were probably fifteen of us in treatment and then all the people who were still going to the aftercare and stuff. 
My family came. Of course Tim was not--he was still using, so there was no way he was coming. It was okay because we did inpatient all day long, then you went to aftercare for three hours--and I mean there was no phone. No magazines. No TV. We smoked and drank coffee and went for walks under armed guard just about. I tried to leave once. That didn't work out too well. 
SL: Was it a thirty-day program?
RE: It was a thirty-day program. They kept me a little longer. Because Tim was a union guy they gave a five thousand dollar--it cost five grand. Pretty cheap back then, but it was probably a ten or twelve thousand dollar program at the time, which would be probably thirty thousand today. There were so many treatment people coming in through the welfare office at the union that they gave them a volume discount I guess! [laughs] I don't know. It was a really good program. That was November, 1986 and I've been clean ever since. 
SA: Your family knew about your addiction but they didn't help you get into treatment?
SL: But your brother helped you get into treatment. 
RE: My brother came with my father actually to come pick me up. I was furious, furious, that he brought my dad. My brother--today I have a completely different relationship with my brother. He's become a different human being in his own right. At the time he was very prejudiced, very angry, had no tolerance, patience, or understanding whatsoever in anything I was doing. I was despicable, and he treated me that way from the time he picked me up until the time he left the hospital. I tried to leave, you know, and I turned around and my dad, actually, fronted that five grand. He was retired by then. I turned around to bolt. When it started out it was a good idea. By the time I'm starting to kick and they're having trouble getting me in and it took four hours and I'm getting sick, I--this is not such a good idea. I turned around to leave and I ran smack into him. He--I'm fighting him and he's holding me and he was not going to let me go. He whispers in my ear, and he says, ""Robin, it's not that you're a bad person. You're not a bad person, but you really need help."" That's probably the only time my father ever said anything to me--and he ended up saving my life because I'd have left. 
SA: How did you maintain sobriety after that?
RE: Well, I am a social person. I do like people and like being with people. The fellowship was very appealing to me. I had been a member of that business women's club that my mother helped charter, and I learned a lot of leadership skills there, which fed into my success in business and so forth. I liked doing that. I liked going to conferences and being with the gals and all of that. The fellowship provided that for me. That had been missing in my life. It was--I was a part of the cool crowd in recovery, you know? That kind of thing. 
At the time, in '86, at that point in time people were very serious about their recovery. I mean, yeah, you showed up on a nudge from the judge, or your parents were going to kick you out, or your family was going to disown you so you show up, but they stayed for different reasons. 
SA: Have you seen that change? How?
RE: Yeah. Sometimes a meeting can feel like when you were in high school and they sent you to detention. That's the attitude. That happens everywhere, not just here. But we're smaller fellowship here in Duluth. Now, when I got clean it still was a small fellowship. Plus, there weren't hardly any females. One of the principles we have is called attraction rather than promotion. That worked for me because I was very attracted to being with the men, and not having to deal with women on an equal basis. That was really attractive to me. But, still, I can remember the Anderson meeting was at the Anderson men's halfway house. Oh, and I went to a halfway house for four months when I got out. 
SA: In Duluth?
RE: No, when I was still in California. I used to come back here for summers when I was a little kid and visit my cousins and stay for six weeks and be down in Wayzata. But California. So, I'm at the Anderson's house meeting and we had it in the living room. There were fifteen, twenty people. That Anderson meeting is like two hundred people come now. It's in a big hall and you have to go talk on the microphone. It's a whole different ball of wax than it once was. I was a little stunned to go back. I was asked to go back and tell my story and I shared my story at a meeting there. And people were getting up and they were walking around. It was just this kind of disrespect that I think is just a microcosm of our society. You find that everywhere today that you wouldn't have found in the eighties. In the seventies, you called people's parents by their 'mister' and 'misses' Johanson, I mean you didn't call them by their first names. It was just a different kind of respect that was expected as a social norm. Yes, I don't--you have to really...
Then I came here. So I was clean four years. I got another job very similar to the one I had. I was gone from six in the morning to six in the evening. My daughter was in preschool all the time and I thought, ""She's being raised like I was raised."" You know? I don't want it to be like this. My mother had left me quite a bit of money when she passed, and I made a decision to use that money to go to school. I had never gone to college. I figured then I could be home with Kaitlyn while I'm going to school for four years. Then I'll come back--and then I decided to come back here to do it in Superior because A) I have a support system. I couldn't afford to do it in Duluth without working too. And it was a gentler, kinder society to raise my daughter. My intent was to leave--you know, come back then and be the CFO. I had no intention of staying here. My sponsor at the time said, ""Don't you fall in love because you'll never come back."" And she was right. [laughs] 
So, when I came here though the fellowship was so immature. Very cliqued, almost incestuous. People were all dating each other. 
SA: Exclusive?
RE: It was exclusive. I don't think they understood that they were. I don't think that they were intentionally that way. But just because they had all--it was really tough. I hid out in AA for a while, and I put my toe back into NA every now and again. When I was in L.A., see, you got raised by people who said, ""Work the steps or die."" You know? If you were outside of the meeting filrting with some guy some female that you don't even know would come up and grab you by the shirtsleeve and say, ""Recovery happens inside the meetings."" And would drag you into the meeting and sit you down next to her. And then she'd put her arm around you and say, ""Hi, my name's so-and-so, here's my phone number."" And would adopt you. It's like, ""I don't know you. Who are you?"" But she'd adopt you. 
I can remember my sponsor getting a sponsor and her saying, ""We're all going to coffee. Come with us."" And I said, ""Okay, I'll meet you there."" She said, ""No. No, come with us."" I said, ""I have a car. I'll meet you there."" She said, ""If you get in your car by yourself you will not come."" She said, ""We'll bring you back to your car. It will be okay."" It was different. It was different in the sense that people adopted you. You just became--and then you were expected to adopt others. You called each other out on your bullship so to speak. Our basic text says we are each other's eyes and ears. If we're not going to be that why do we need a fellowship? If we could do this on our own... 
But here--I move out here and you're all so 'Minnesota nice.' It's like what do you mean you're not going to say anything? You mean you're going to Minnesota nice these people into their grave. I'd hear people relapse and somebody would say, ""Oh, I saw it coming."" It's like, ""Really? What did you say? What did you do? How did you address that?"" That did not exist in the fellowship here when I got here. Very minimally. I kept coming, kept coming back. Finally, I was sponsoring a gal in AA who was--she was a professional, and she worked in an oral surgeon's office and was sneaking drugs from the oral surgeon's office and replacing it with saline. Poor people they were issuing it to. She couldn't stay clean. She couldn't stay clean. I said, ""You're never going to stay clean talking about alcohol. You have to go and be where you can relate with other people. As pretty as you are and as sophisticated as you are, you're a hope to die dope fiend. You are in denial of that."" I brought her to a meeting. It was a brand new meeting and had been started by some young folks, I mean seventeen or eighteen year olds. They were so excited that we were there, so welcoming and all of that. I thought, you know, this is what I remember NA being like. So, I started coming back more regularly. Just decided to be the change, you know. I would go to AA to get fed, and I would go to NA to give what I had. Until NA here became strong enough that I could do both in the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous. It has become that. 
I had a really lovely compliment. I have a number of sponsees and I said, ""Okay, I have too many of you to do all this. We have to do a group."" We started a group to work through all the steps. This was about a year and a half ago and we are just finishing step twelve. We are in this little group and there's just--it started out about nine of us and there's just about six or seven of us still. I said something about something and the comment back to me was, ""But you've left a legacy here."" And I said, ""A legacy?"" ""Yeah. You've taught us and we've taught our sponsees."" She said, ""I mean I know that it isn't just you alone that created this legacy here, but you're a big part of it of a very small handful of people."" And that is the sad story that at thirty years clean where are my peers? They've gotten well? I don't know. They've died? I've buried a lot of people. Clean and miserable? I still go to meetings. I still can still service. I sponsor. I have a sponsor who has a sponsor who has a sponsor. I believe in this. I believe that--you know our message is hope and our promise is freedom. Freedom from active addiction. That is my story. NA gave me hope when I thought there was no hope. They loved me when I didn't know what it was to be loved. I certainly didn't know how to give love. I've learned that it's not about what kind of a friend I am. Expectations. Why do I have expectations? Why can't I just accept things to be the way they are? Well, that's a character defect that I have, so if I want that to stay in it's minimal status I have to go to meetings to remind me that that's who I am, and that my thinking gets skewed. So I'm not so disappointed. 
That relationship with my brother at, I don't know how long ago it was, must have been fifteen years ago, maybe longer. He called me and said, ""I need your help."" Who is this? He says Matthew, his son. Wanted by the police. ""If I don't get him out of here he's going to go to jail. He's got an addiction problem."" He sent his son to be with me for a while. Matthew has some mental health issues and he's not so much an addict as he is mentally not sound, and he's been able to accept that and seek the treatment he needs for that. It's really broken my brothers' heart. My brother called me, and his son went through some treatment and my brother went to family group and called me, and he says, ""Is this Robin?"" Again, he didn't call! And I said, ""Yeah?"" He says, ""Look, I need to tell you something."" I said, ""What's that?"" He says, ""I need to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when you went through treatment. I didn't understand. I should have been there for you. I said, ""Okay."" He says, ""Alright."" ""Is that all?"" He goes, ""That's why I called."" ""Okay. Bye."" ""Bye."" [laughs] And he hung up! I balled like a baby. My husband came running up the stairs. He thought somebody had died. I said, ""You don't understand. My brother gets it. He gets it that I'm not a bad person."" That was really phenomenal. 
My expectations of my brother was that I would call him and expect him to be an asshole. True to form he'd always be an asshole. My [unclear] said to me one time, ""Have you ever thought about just calling your brother and saying he's probably going to be an asshole. I wonder what kind he's going to be this time."" And just make it kind of a game. What started happening was I stopped reacting when he would be an asshole because I'd go, oh, yeah, there he goes. Instead of, ""He doesn't love me! What's wrong with me that he's doing this!"" It was just like oh, there he goes. What happened from that was that he didn't have to change. I changed. I changed how I saw him. He had to defend us. He had to knock my dad out at fourteen years old to keep him from beating my mother. He is who he is. What's funny is that he has changed in regard to how he relates with me now. He didn't want to be an asshole. He couldn't understand why whenever we'd get off the phone I'd be crying. So who wants to talk to me when all I'm going to do is cry and he didn't understand how he was hurting my feelings or any of that. When that stopped he was able to not put his foot in his mouth so much. So those things changed. Those are lessons I would have never gotten if I hadn't opened my mind to it's all about me. It may not be much, but I'm all I think about, you know, kind of a deal. 
SA: That goes along with sponsoring people, too.
RE: Yeah. I'm a do-it-yourself sponsor. I will not put more into your recovery than you're willing to. I learned that one the hard way. I've had sponsees, new people come to me, say, ""I want you to sponsor me. I need somebody who's really tough like you."" If I sit next to one of my sponsees they'll laugh. Like, ""She is so not tough. She's not tough. She's not going to kick your ass. She's not going to do any of that. She's just going to be there for you when you need her. I can't get it to you. That whole you can't lead a horse to water. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink kind of thing. I'm not even going to lead it to water. Here it is. You're all grown up. You want what I have to offer you've got to be willing to do what I did to get it. Otherwise you'll never have it because I'm not doing anything different than my predecessors. 
I met my husband here. He's in recovery. He's got two years more than I do. He had left and been down in Minneapolis and moved back at the same time I moved here. He got a--was volunteering, was running an aftercare at Miller-Dwan when they still had their program. He was in school for his master's in social work and was an in-take counselor--or a, not an in-take counselor. What do they call it? Anyway, he was a trauma counselor for veterans with PTSD. He is a veteran with PTSD. Combat vet. We met because I volunteered there to do the same thing. New each other for a year. Dated for a year. Lived together for a year, and we've been married since 1993. My daughter came to me when she was seven and she said, ""What am I going to call Rob?"" I said, ""What do you mean?"" She says, ""Well, you're getting married."" ""Yeah."" Because he proposed to her and me. She said, ""You're getting married so he won't just be Rob anymore. What am I going to call him?"" I said, ""Kaitlyn, you've got to figure that out for yourself."" She came back in a little while and she goes, ""I can't call him dad because that would really hurt my dad's feelings. I'm going to call him 'pa'."" She still calls him pa. Her friends call him pa. 
When I went to move to leave California I had fifty-fifty legal and fiscal custody so I really wasn't supposed to take her out of state. I couldn't find Tim. He was out there using. My mother-in-law had died. It sent him over the edge. When she was three--he got full fiscal custody because I was in treatment and he had no legal record that he was an addict. Then, I had visitation when she was fifteen months old. Then when he was three he decided to go into treatment so I got her full-time and he had visitation. He had relapsed, and then his mother died. He felt so guilty that he just went off the deep-end. I didn't even know where he was. About a week, maybe ten days or so before I was--I mean I was packed. I was ready to go. I got a knock on my door and it was him. He says, ""I need help."" He was septic. He had blood poisoning all through his system. His arms were like Popeye arms. They were all swollen. I kept him well. Gave him money and kept him well until we could get him in some place. He got in. He came to my going away party. Signed the papers to let me take her. I forced him to sign the papers. [laughs] And he's been clean ever since. I think I have four years on him, and I always let him remember that. [laughs] We're very good friends. We made a decision at that point in time that we were both from broken homes, we're both from being made the rope in a tug-of-war between parents and we refused to do that. He has come to stay with us every Christmas. My husband and I and Kaitlyn would go out to visit him and so forth. Two years ago he decided--he was fully retired--he decided to move back here, so he moved to Duluth. He can't stand it. He's leaving, but at least he got a couple years with his daughter and be her dad. That's been really good. She's had three parents. She says she's had three parents to raise her. 
We've done well, and again I think that's because we all come from the same process. We process our feelings through the same steps. When he's irritated with me he can go and deal--it's his problem. It's really not my problem. When I'm irritated with him it's my problem, not his problem. I get to go and process that and then bring it back and try to talk about what we can do different or whatever. It's made it work. And now my daughter is in recovery because our stories weren't enough. She had to have her own damn story. She never saw any of us loaded. Never saw us use. All of my friends are in recovery. She knew clearly about addiction, and she got hooked on meth at a young age. She is thirty-one now I think and has four years. She's our area chair. She sponsors people. She does all the steps. I guess the family that uses together can recover together too, right? We didn't use together! I wouldn't say that, but you know what I mean. 
SL: Any last thoughts?
RE: We can recover. There is hope. It doesn't matter why you come. If you don't come you won't hear our message. If you don't hear the messge you don't know that there's hope. I think that drug court has done society a great service because they allow convicts to find a way out that they didn't have when I was younger. That stigma once an addict always an addict runs deep. It's nice to know that women are coming out of their shame. For some reason society accepts males as addicts easier than they do females. ""Good mothers have their children. What's wrong you that you would use?"" Those kinds of things. A lot of shame attached. It's not about that it's legal or illegal. It's completely irrelevant. Completely and totally irrelevant. Maybe if they put as much into anti-drug wars or the fighting the legality of it as they put into education and creating fellowships before people have addictions. That might be a cool thing. It's not happening at church. And that we come from all walks. And that our anonymity isn't about protecting our last name. It's about being the same. It's about it doesn't matter if I get here in a Cadillac or on the city bus. It doesn't matter. We're all the same when we walk through the doors. That's why our anonymity is important. It doens't matter who we are out there. It matters who we are in here. I'm just another addict. Good luck with your project. 
SA: Thank you so much. 
SL: Thank you so much. "

Amy Sullivan
Interviewer
August 10, 2017
St. Paul, Minnesota
Adam Fairbanks-AF
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I'm at French Meadow Cafe. It's August 10th, 2017. I'm with Adam Fairbanks. Adam, will you state your name and say you give me permission?
AF: Okay. My name is Adam Fairbanks, and I give Amy permission to do this interview.
AS: Alright, do you want to start with where you were born, where you grew up, just a little bit of family history, childhood stuff?
AF: So, I was born in Bemidji, Minnesota on July 5th, 1983. My father is Native American enrolled in the White Earth Tribe, and my mom is non-Native mix of various European blood, and I have an older sister. She is thirty-seven, and I have a younger brother who is thirty-one, and a twenty-one year old sister. Both of my sisters are half sisters. My parents went to school—tribal school in kindergarten, Fond du Lac where we moved after I was born. Lived in the Duluth area, and my parents got divorced shortly after kindergarten. 
I was a little young, gay person, kind of picked on in school. My parents got divorced, we moved back to Bemidji. I didn't really know I was gay at the time, but was picked on throughout elementary and middle school. Kind of started hanging out with the wrong crowd, but in many ways it was a protective crowd that I was drawn to. I think that was part of the reason why I hung out with these kind of badass Indian girls. They did—they protected me in many ways from the folks that, you know, the non-Native white guys who would pick on me. I was getting in quite a bit of trouble in Bemidji, which is where we moved to from, you know, it was first grade until sixth grade. Started getting in trouble. My mom decided she was going to move us out of the area to kind of get me away from the trouble I was getting into. That of course didn't change my behavior necessarily. I went wherever we went, so. [pause]
We moved to North Dakota, to Grand Forks for a brief minute, then Mayville, North Dakota. Then my grandmother got Alzheimer’s, and my mother wanted to move closer to her in Wabena, so I was there for eighth grade. So eighth grade, you know, I was still kind of getting in trouble. I came out to my mom at the age of sixteen, and I was kind of tired of moving around. I was living in a rural area as a gay man, and it was difficult. And I didn't want to do it anymore, so I told my mom I would like to move out on my own, and drop out of school, and get my GED and go to college. She said she supported that, and so I did. I dropped out at the age of sixteen of high school, went and got my GED, and then I went to St. Cloud State University. 
AS: So when you say trouble what do you mean by trouble?
AF: I think in elementary and middle school it was mostly getting in a lot of fights.
AS: Because you were being picked on?
AF: Yeah. So getting in a lot of fights, smoking cigarettes, there was some dabbling with alcohol and marijuana, and then when I came out I ended up going into adolescent treatment for a brief minute, and that's when I actually became sober as like a fifteen year old. And then I came out and that's when I went to school and college, and was living on my own in a larger area. It wasn't the Twin Cities, it wasn't a city, per say. St. Cloud is a city, I mean I—
AS: Compared to where you were before. 
AF: Yeah. But it wasn't a metropolitan area. So, I felt a lot safer at that point.
AS: Did you live by yourself? 
AF: No, I did not. I moved in with a boyfriend, actually. And was in school and lived off campus. I was taking some pre-college courses because I got my GED, so I was taking those. I was there for a little while, but then got exposed to Minneapolis, and was like, ""Oh my god,"" I had to move there. [laughs] To be around the rest of the gays. So I did. I moved to Minneapolis. Broke up with that boyfriend and moved to Minneapolis. Kind of was out on my own. Got a job. That's when the on and off again adult learning kind of stuff happened where I couldn't do school full-time because I needed to work and take care of myself, so then I would work, do a job, and then get kind of on my feet in that job, and so I would start school again. Then I would get a new job, so it was like on and off of school. This is like nineteen through the age of twenty. I was just kind of working these odd jobs. I was working at a restaurant briefly. Then a salon for men. I was like a front desk person. 
I got into drug use earlier on. I was twenty years old, am thirty-four now. There was probably a full year of substance use with methamphetamine. Maybe it was longer than that. A year and a half probably. I really lost my way at that point. I wasn't going to school. I wasn't really working. My life was really overrun by substance use, drug addiction for methamphetamine. Things fell apart after that year and a half and I ended up going to treatment a couple times. Went to PRIDE Institute for a few days and left, and then went back a month later for a few days, and left. I finally went another month later and completed the program. 
After I got out of that treatment I got a job working at a drop-in center called the Aliveness Project. They're an AIDS service organization in Minneapolis that works with people living with HIV. They had a drop-in center and it was an entry level job. I was kind of exposed to that environment just because I knew people who had HIV. The job that I got was working within a small grant with the Minnesota Department of Health—the county. Ryan White counseling did the program. The job was to be in the drop-in center and talk to people about harm reduction and safer drug use. I think my title was Peer Educator. So as a person who had had some experience in substance abuse my job was to talk to other people on how to do that in a safer way. 
Well, at the time, I mean this was really early on. It was 2000—I'm thirty-four now so it was twelve years ago. 2005, early 2005. I didn't know anything really about harm reduction. I had heard about it when I was at PRIDE Institute. Kathy Vader is a therapist, and she had a group about it. During that group it didn't really sound like anything more than common sense, more or less. I got that entry-level job, and I read a book. I went to her and said, ""How do I learn about this?"" And she said, ""Read this harm reduction psychotherapy book."" So I read it and it made a lot of sense to me. I was like, ""Wow."" The abstinence based world that was taught to me at the PRIDE Institute I guess made sense to a lot of people because there were so many people involved in that, but I also had understood that there were a lot of people using drugs, so that model didn't work for them. [laughs] My job was to teach those people how to do things in a better way before they were ""ready"" to be completely abstinent, drug and alcohol free. 
I became really passionate and motivated about that model. I was involved in the abstinence based recovery world at that time, and I was apart of this committee for this conference that they held every year called GLBT in Recovery, held a conference, like a workshop. I was on the committee, and I said, ""Why don't we do a little workshop in harm reduction?"" And they like almost chased me out of there! [laughs] Like they thought I was crazy. They said, ""That's enabling people. Telling them that it's okay."" It was such a threat. And I was like this isn't a threat. It's a good way to get people into this model that we are all apart of. To keep them from getting diseases. All the public health benefits of harm reduction. People just didn't see it that way, and I think there was just this block from them being able to because then it challenged, I think, their own view around abstinence. 
AS: Does that surprise you considering HIV—using condoms and safe sex—that you were chased out of the room? Because it kind of surprises me.
AF: It did. I was very naive about the whole thing. I just thought people would like get what I was talking about. [laughs] I didn't think I would be so controversial. And it was. It was very controversial. I became very angry and resentful that what I was really passionate about was viewed so negatively by the people, the community that I became apart of. 
AS: They saw it just as harm reduction just as it related to drug use?
AF: Correct. And that's how I presented it, too. Harm reduction is obviously involved in public health, but from the perspective of that conference it was harm reduction and public health were viewed separately to the drug and alcohol abstinence based recovery world. It's like, ""Public health makes sense. Of course we support condoms,"" but we start to talk about public health and drug use/harm reduction—then it's a threat. And really problematic for them. I got angry and was basically like “f” you guys. I care about those people that you're afraid of helping and think that they are just not ready, and I became very passionate. I actually got another job after that at Minnesota AIDS Project shortly after. Nine months later. Probably 2005 still. In the needle exchange program. That's when I decided I was no longer part of that community both their choices of them not really wanting me there, as well as my choice of not really wanting to be there. 
AS: The AA community?
AF: Yeah. I don't know if I'm an anomaly or what. I just didn't need that in order to—I think in that book I read it was just like I could get rid of my urge to use drugs if I made a commitment not to do it. I would just tell myself, you don't use that anymore. You're a non-crystal meth user. You don't do that. That decision removed the ambivalence that I had, and without ambivalence I was just able to be sober. My recovery was based around my passion, and my passion was based around helping people that nobody else gave a shit about. 
AS: Do you remember the name of that book? 
AF: Harm Reduction Psychotherapy by Patt Denning is the book. So I worked in the needle exchange van of Minneapolis. Driving around this big ambulance with Roger Moore. He passed away, but he worked there forever. Fifteen years or something like that before he died. Running that ambulance around. And there were two needle exchange programs: there was Minnesota AIDS Project, the ambulance, and then there was Access Works, the set site location. It was a store-front needle exchange. You know, you know about Access Works. Well, this was prior to Access Works closing, which was really a big loss for Minneapolis, but after being there being part time—I was under a grant so like thirty hours a week or something like that. They were trying to figure out how to make me full time, and there was a partnership between Minnesota AIDS Project and Access Works, and I think the Red Door Clinic, which is the Hennepin County STD clinic. They had this grant to work with gay men who used methamphetamine to do education on harm reduction. It was a collaborative. I talked to my boss and said, ""How's the program doing?"" She said, ""Not well. We are really underperforming. No one is going to our groups. The people that are going aren't really part of the population.""
AS: Who was your boss?
AF: Kathy Strobel was her name. She was awesome. And so I said, ""Well, let me do that! I know all those people!"" [laughs] I was involved in that community. I could get them to come to that group. I've always had this high level of confidence in my ability to get things going. One of the people that I know, a colleague of mine, she said, ""There's thinking outside of the box, and you don't even really have a box."" [laughs] Like it doesn't even exist! 
AS: You don't feel constrained. 
AF: I don't. Honestly I think some rules should be changed. They are ridiculous, or they are a barrier to success. And if they can be changed we should try to change them. I think most people operate within, ""Oh, these are the rules. This is how we've always done things."" And I just don't agree with them. If it's a barrier change it, is the way I look at it. Thinking creatively to get those people to come to the group. There was the little incentive budget, so I said, well, people who use meth need food, so let's get pizza—because it was all we could afford, Domino's Pizza. And we'll do five-dollar gift cards to come to the group. 
Over a period of nine months the group was a huge success. It started off with me and just a couple of people. And then the word of mouth got out there, and more people started coming, and more pizza had to be ordered, and the group wasn't specific to—it was a harm reduction group for gay men who used crystal meth, but it was also written in the grant, 'or had used crystal meth' and I was like, I didn't know how that was going to work. How are we going to get people in recovery to go to the group of people who are using? I'm like let's try it. I reached out to a few people and said, ""You should come check out this group."" I was a recruiter. I was a harm reduction activist, and passionate about that work. Public health person, and recruiter. So I got more people to come. It worked fine. It actually was awesome. It got people in recovery, even in the abstinence based recovery world, to support people who were actively using. And we are all hanging out in the same room talking to each other, and not having it be a threat to the people necessarily. I mean they chose to come to this harm reduction group, so I think it really just strengthened their ability to be sober more than be a threat to their sobriety because it kind of removed that belief that, ""I need to completely hide from any risk of interaction with drug use."" 
By the end of the grant—it was unfortunate; it was so successful—at the end of the grant there were twenty-three people. I think the maximum number we had was twenty-three, and the grant period ended. Things changed. Access Works lost their funding, some of their funding. The grants changed. Red Door Clinic got some money, and so I left Minnesota AIDS Project and I went to Red Door, which is the Hennepin County public health clinic—STD clinic. And that was again an HIV grant. Still in school, still adult learning on again off again. 
AS: What were you majoring in? What were you drawn to?
AF: I was not sure. I was just taking generals, technical college. And then during that time I enrolled at Metro State, which is a four-year college, and I decided to go for like an individualized program because there was no public health at a bachelor's level program in Minnesota, or that I was aware of. So I decided to design my own degree and it was going to be around harm reduction public health was the focus. And with an individualized program you get to kind of use work experience and write essays and work with an instructor to kind of craft your own class around it. So I used a lot of what I had done with work to design the degree and get some school credit for it. Because it was so unique. I mean it was like how else do you get that experience? And I just continued to advance and advance in my career without a degree. Because I had this very specialized niche of working with gay men around substance use, and people didn't—that just didn't exist. Like where do you find somebody like that who has even like direct experience with it themselves? And who isn't a total disaster, right, waiting to happen. 
So sadly Access Works closed. The van continued to operate. 
AS: Access Works closed in like 2009, 2008? Somewhere around there?
AF: Yes. So this was after I had started in my career—2005, 2006 at MAP [Minnesota AIDS Project]. I was there for a couple years, and then I went to Red Door Clinic, and that was shortly after I started there was when Access Works—they weren't able to survive on their other grants so then they closed their doors. They got reorganized—MAP got the money—and the needle exchange services operated through the van exclusively in the state. Lee Hertel, who you and I have talked about, was kind of—is it okay for me to talk about this? You'll have to check. 
AS: I'll check. He's been interviewed one-on-one. 
AF: Right. He was a participant in that group. The pizza group. And he and I had similar backgrounds, right? And he was so hyper [laughs]. Couldn't sit still, and kind of a big mess.
AS: He's almost twenty years older than you. 
AF: Yes. And I remember like saying, ""We need to get more drug users involved in this HIV prevention world because we're losing funding. The needle exchange programs are losing funding. We need to have a larger voice. How do we organize?"" And so I talked to Lee and I said, ""You should get on this committee, and you should be the drug user. Like the gay, male drug user and represent that community."" And he was really, he just wasn't quite sure, and I said, ""I really think you could do this. You majored in English, you're well written, you have a lot of energy."" [laughs] And so he applied and I don't remember what committee it was, but I think that's really when Lee entered in his role of activism as a drug user activist. 
And I went off to the Red Door and started doing HIV testing and working in a clinic setting. I was there for four and a half years. I was on the inside of this cynical world as kind of a government robot doing these HIV testing stuff, but I was always an activist just trying to do stuff on the outside, like influence things. And Lee was one vessel I was able to use to do that. I go, ""Did you hear Ryan White? Go to this meeting and you should talk about this.""
AS: So you would provide him with information that gave him—
AF: Yes. That gave him intel. Yeah. And worked to figure how to not manipulate, but change the system internally to move this movement forward because again the reason it was so easy to get passionate about this work was A, I had previous experience with it, but it was so easy to care for people that nobody else gave a shit about. That is why I did it. And that is what kept me really passionate, and like sober. And I had made that commitment, and I wasn't able to do the good work that I was doing if I was a crystal meth addict. [laughs] Some people can. Lee is a good example of one. But I wasn't. I never tried, but I wouldn't. [laughs] 
So that was when I went and I called Chuck [Hilger] one day. I met Chuck. Well, actually I met Karen Greensend. She was the owner of Valhalla Place. She was crazy, in many ways, a friend of mine. Crazy in a good way. Motivated. She didn't have a box either. The only other person I've met like that. And she just came and crashed a meeting one day. She was like, ""Oh, they're having a drug user meeting over at MAP? I'm going!"" She just showed up, and she had started this methadone clinic and was trying to learn about the community and get her clinic going, and it was called Valhalla Place. I don't remember when they opened, but now they're the biggest provider in the state. 
AS: It wasn't even ten years ago.  
AF: Yeah. 
AS: Right, if you're talking about 2009.
AF: Yeah. And that's when I met her. I was working at Red Door and we went to this meeting and she was there. We clicked right away and we stayed in touch. I talked to her about maybe wanting to work there. She ran a methadone clinic. It was a really good overlap of public health and a medical clinic and harm reduction and working with drug users. I mean it was a perfect fit for me in my next transition. But it was a private company so it was something I wasn't used to. I was always used to working with non-profits and government. 
The time came. I met Chuck. He became the executive director and I reached out to him and I said, ""Hey, Chuck. I have this big donation of needles that was provided by somebody across the country that mailed"" —I don't remember how honestly I got them, but it was this big pallet full of needles that someone offered me—and I said, ""I would like to store them there, because I don't want to put them in my house, at the Valhalla clinic."" And he said, ""Okay, well I'll talk to Karen."" And Karen is like, ""Sure, I don't care."" And I said, ""If I store them there would it be okay if I came once a week and then gave them out? Like on a Friday if I gave needles out to people? And we started a little needle exchange?"" And he's like, ""Okay, sure."" [laughs] 
And so that little needle exchange started. I got a bunch of people involved. I used to go to speak at these—the HIV prevention world had interns at the U of M, and public health students. I talked about my passion, and it rubbed off on people and they wanted to get involved. So then I had all these like bachelor's level, sometimes master's level, public health students that were like running this needle exchange program out of a methadone clinic with me with the support of Valhalla Place, and I thought this is a really good way to get people to come in to a clinic setting, become familiar with it, and then enroll in services. It's like a marketing tool. And that was kind of like, oh, I started to get into the business thinking of it as like public health and working within a private company and seeing how we were able to do good but make money. 
AS: And sustain yourselves, sustain the business because non-profits are so dependent on grants that are the whims of the government. 
AF: Right. And so I was able to convince them that you should invest money into this because this is good for your bottom line, and it's also good to get people into treatment, which is why we are ultimately here. The CFO of organizations may not think that way, but the people who start the programs do. And that's all the counselors, and clients, you know, they're all about the treatment. So, and I was all about the harm reduction and started the needle exchange. 
And then I asked if I could work there. I was hired as their Harm Reduction Services Director, I think was my title, and I was there for about a year. The needle exchange was successful, and I went to a conference. It was a White Earth Hep C conference in 2015, yes, 2015. It was in May. When I was there I got a phone call from Chuck and he was like, ""Oh, you know our CFO is bitching that you're just footing around at conferences and not generating revenue for us. You should really ask around and just see if there are opportunities for partnering and doing something with other organizations."" So I asked around, and again White Earth is my tribe. I ran into Clinton Alexander, and he's like, ""Yeah, I totally know exactly who needs you. There's this new program they are trying to start called the MOMS program, and they're looking for a Suboxone provider."" I was like—went over and talked to them and Julie Williams she was the manager. And Mina Spalla, she was the nurse. And they were directed by Tribal Council to direct this program in like three months. And they had everything they needed. They had the counseling, and the mental health, and the nursing. They had everything they needed to run a program they just didn't have the prescribing doctors. And so I said, ""Can I be of assistance?"" They said, ""Well, if you can get prescribing—a doctor for us that would be awesome."" So called Chuck and said, ""Hey, Chuck these guys need a prescriber. Is it okay to do telehealth? Like how do we do this? He said, ""Yeah. If we can get the software to do this let's do telehealth and we'll just start the program.""
So then I met with some folks from administration and talked with them and they were supportive of the partnership and wanted to proceed with a contract. We started with a program that had, I don't—I want to say like seventeen days to get the program going and we did it. We met the deadline. I think we did it in fifteen days. So, you know, I worked with—Valhalla Place at that time was a big organization, so I had access to nursing staff, and as a team we put it together very quickly. 
AS: Was this before they transitioned to Meridian or Alina?
AF: Before, yeah this was before. So this was Valhalla Place prior to the Meridian merger. Right around that time actually. So White Earth did this to address the babies that were born exposed to opiates. And were being removed from the home. It was a huge problem on the White Earth Reservation. All reservations really. And this was an approach—they wanted specifically Suboxone. They didn't want to do methadone. This was an approach they wanted to move forward with because it was what they learned was the evidence based way to deal with it. And there was this reluctance, and it was controversial, but there was also urgency and other things weren't working. 
The program started. We did the prescribing through Valhalla Place. Patients met with the doctors. We had telehealth and then they got all their treatment and dosing at White Earth. And it was awesome. People enrolled. They were a little nervous at first I think, you know, going to the program. I was the liaison, the point of contact at Valhalla Place so if they had issues they called me and I would address it. And I was really glad to be of assistance to my tribe. 
Over time—the program evolved very quickly. Within months they were changing from just the pregnant women and the women with child protection cases to their partners or the men of the women, the fathers of the babies. Then it was everyone who lived in the house. Treat the whole household. And then it was the communities demanding access that were not part of the demographic, and it was really apparent within a short period of time, I want to say six months or so, that White Earth needed to provide these services across the entire Reservation, and there was such high demand that they needed to open multiple clinics. 
And so I decided—the Meridian merger had started to happen. I was not exactly sure—I felt uneasy, you know, uneasy about the future, and so I reached out and said, “Hey, I'd like an opportunity to help start those clinics that you've expressed interest in.” And so I was hired by White Earth to do that. And there was a year period of time where we worked towards getting the, I want to say four additional clinics open. Five, sorry. So there were two on the Reservation, then there was one in Bemidji, which is four hours north of Minneapolis. North and east of White Earth Reservation. And then there was Minneapolis next. There was the MOMS Program started in Minneapolis as well as the medical assisted treatment kind of for everybody, Native American clinic here in Minneapolis. And it was very rapid pace that we moved. I mean getting, you know, I recruited a doctor, and helped with some of the clinic design, and how to set up the dosing windows. Just things that I had learned from my work at Valhalla Place. 
AS: So are the clients coming and getting a dose of Suboxone everyday?
AF: Correct. 
AS: So they're not getting a prescription. 
AF: Correct. 
AS: Why that model?
AF: Diversion concerns. When you have a lack of access, and something is just becoming available, there is a huge demand for—you know demand is there, lack of access is there, you have a black market for it. It's worth a lot of money. So, what White Earth did, and what I think was a really good idea, was to keep tight control of it until there was broader access. Then once it's readily available people can just go into a clinic and enroll—then you can start to look at giving people take-out medications to have at home because the demand has decreased in fulfilling the needs of the population. 
AS: So that is a little bit of a different model with Suboxone. 
AF: Well, it's a methadone model. 
AS: Right, it's a methadone clinic model—
AF: Rather than a prescription, take it home model. 
AS: Yeah. And are those common around the country that you know of, or is that unique?
AF: I want to say it's unique to tribes specifically. I'm not aware of any other Suboxone only programs that have that tight control and dosing policies and limitations. 
AS: Okay. So that would be a unique aspect of the Tribal program. 
AF: Correct. And that's what I'm aware of is how they're being operated. Now there are also people who probably go to a physician that live near the Reservation and get a prescription. So there's nothing that would prevent you from being able to do that other than you can't find the doctor. 
AS: But this also allows clients to be brought into other services and support that they might need.
AF: Correct. And White Earth always provided culturally based services. It was about how do we incorporate culture into programming for treatment, and having people that are Native American providing the services. Having it be for the people, by the people. Comfort, and culturally based, and connecting people to something that they maybe have never had access to, or have lost along the way. So that was a really cool part of the White Earth model is connecting culture to treatment. And probably a really important component of how, you know, to make that work for the people who need it. And you know if culturally based treatment isn't what people needed then maybe it's not the right program for them. But it wasn't like cramming culture down people's throats either. It was like this was just our model and this is how we do things. We help you participate in the ceremony, but you certainly need to go to your three hours of group everyday three days a week, or whatever the treatment goals were. 
AS: Right, there's minimum participation, and then there's other opportunities. 
AF: Correct. And over time the rules started to become a little bit more like, okay, we can give so-and-so a take out medication. We can be closed on Sundays. We can give people take outs on the holidays. And just over time things gradually started to evolve to more of a—less controlled. And I think that it made sense to happen that way. 
AS: Do you have any sense of the success rate?
AF: Yes. I mean as far as I know there weren't any deaths from the year that I was there for people that were actually enrolled in the program. So that's, you know, opiates can be fatal in many ways, so keeping people on Suboxone and providing treatment is very effective. 
AS: Was Narcan available?
AF: Yeah. We made Narcan available through the programs. 
AS: So participants could bring it home and have it at home?
AF: Yeah. And then Clinton also did like harm reduction work on the Reservation too. So he was doing kind of more true harm reduction, non-MAT [medically assisted treatment], needle exchange work, and Narcan distribution. So, yeah, there was actually a lot of Narcan available. And the other tribe that had significant need and White Earth was providing services to out of the Bemidji program was called Oshkimanidoo, was Red Lake Nation, which is thirty minutes north of Bemidji. So they were going to a White Earth clinic, and traveling because it's a long distance away, so spending time in a van, and having to get from their house to the van, and from the van to the clinic, and then the clinic back home. It was—it is quite the ordeal currently. And I ended my employment with White Earth recently and wanted to be of assistance to Red Lake because they expressed interest in wanting to do a program like that. The need is there. The travel is ridiculous that people have to go through. And I have a very unique skill set to offer. So I was brought on as a consultant on July 12th of this year. So, yeah, I started on July 12th, and Red Lake declared a public health emergency the following Tuesday. 
AS: Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you. Do they kind of have a plan in place to declare that emergency, and to hire you? I mean were things kind of—
AF: I don't know exactly how that came to be. 
AS: I'll have to find someone to talk to about that. 
AF: Yeah. I mean, I think I could—
AS: That's a really powerful thing to do, as we just saw this last week when we thought the President of the United States might declare opioids an emergency, and he didn't. 
AF: Right. So, yeah, I don't know. It might be really... I'll see who I can put you in touch with. They declared that public health emergency that Tuesday, and I started [pause in recording]. 
Red Lake declared the state of emergency. They're looking at two major things within the resolution. And I've asked for support from the Governor's Office and a bunch of other federal agencies to help them address this, I don't think it is specific, but—well, it is. Opiates I know are like the primary focus, and so they're looking at banishment, which I don't know a lot about. That's part of the resolution is banishment. And they're also looking at the Narcan, other public health type things. Medically assisted treatment, that's what I was hired to do was bring on the Suboxone clinic. I work with their chemical health division. And I love starting new things, so it's really fun. I'm in my element right now. 
As far as the model I think both White Earth and Red Lake have really great models of integrating culture, and this biomedical drug treatment approach. A Western medicine approach combined with traditional, culturally based treatment. I think it's a good route for tribes to go. I believe that it does conflict a little bit with the traditional way that like alcohol has been addressed. But in my opinion the alcohol use, and all the substances need to be looked at as unique to each other. We can't lump marijuana with heroin. Marijuana doesn't kill people. So, like I think every substance needs to be—services need to be uniquely planned around it. There can't be a one-size fits all approach. Twelve steps is a support group, not a treatment modality. Evidence based treatment is the way to go. Medication assisted treatment has the most evidence. Methadone has been around forever. [laughs] And this daily dosing model, and getting people counseling and medication has been around for a really long time. It's just taken states, and tribes, and different places to get over their reluctance around the controversy of treating substance use disorder with medication. But there's been alcohol medications for a while. Antabuse, I mean why is that okay? [laughs] But then opiates aren't. I guess it's a narcotic, but if it's a treatment that works, and it doesn't get people high, which everybody thinks it does, why wouldn't you use it? 
Speaking to the White Earth outcomes of no deaths we're just getting people on their feet, and all that stuff. I mean that doesn't address the larger issue in my mind, which is poverty. I mean that's the true culprit I think of addiction. I think until we address that we're never going to get out of this. Livable wages, getting out of crappy living environments, education, opportunity, jobs. All of those things that make somebody feel valuable, and not living in fear of not having enough. There's so much around I mean people shouldn't feel that way. 
So I guess that's what I would say is needed to get over this issue is addressing the way we look at substance use as a consequence of poverty, and we need to address that. Because we can give people Suboxone and we can keep them from using heroin, but at the end of the day they still go back to the same place they were living unless we give them other opportunities. And then we're preventing them from dying but we need to also work towards getting them opportunities to be successful and thrive. 
AS: And it kind of connects to your own experience when you talked about being committed to something in a new way, or a new thing in your life versus using to continue using. It's about creating...
AF: Feeling good about what I'm doing in my life. 
AS: And seeing a future, and seeing potential. 
AF: Exactly. I mean when I was using drugs I had, you know I was—my partner says the horizon line that people see in front of themselves, you know, at that time was only a few inches in front of my face. I didn't see very far beyond what was directly in front of me. And then over time as I advanced in my career, and I became more successful and able to move towards being able to provide a much larger contribution in my life, my horizon line really sort of started to grow. In addition to not really having a box, now I don't necessarily see the limitations, you know, the not having a degree thing has never held me back. It's something I'm going to get. I have like two classes left. But here I am again in a situation where I'm consulting, and I have a very short deadline to get this program going and it's like, okay, start and stop, start and stop, start and stop. But it's fine. I don't need it to be able to do what I'm doing, you know. 
AS: So what do you see in the future for yourself? What do you envision on that horizon?
AF: I want to help all the tribes do this. 
AS: In Minnesota?
AF: In the region. For now the region. I'm still learning. I understand the Minnesota system. How to enroll in health care and [unclear]. I understand all that stuff. Now it's like trying to figure out how does this work? Because health care system with IHS [Indian Health Service] and Tribal Services and all that. It's very, very complicated. If I started talking about it you would have no idea what I was talking about. But figuring out how to do it, how to do it well, and go in and help the tribes that are interested and ready for this sort of thing. It's only a matter of time before all the tribes are having this problem, hearing about how Red Lake and White Earth have addressed the problem, and then trying to find out how did they do this?
AS: And then you raise your hand!
AF: And then I raise my hand. [laughs] I know how to do this!
AS: So, Adam, do you have any mentors? Do you have people that you look up to? You can know them or not know them personally. 
AF: Yeah. I would say Chuck for sure. Chuck Hilger. He brought me on to Valhalla Place. He and I worked very well together. I'm kind of able to just speak to him openly. Bounce ideas off of him. Swear in front of him. [laughs] He's a wise person. And I'm like young, and ambitious, and maybe need to be slowed down sometimes and think things through. I'm still learning as a young professional. So there's that. 
I think also...I don't know. I have some friends in San Francisco that are really doing some amazing work in harm reduction, and just the national harm reduction community in general. There are so many just amazing people doing great things, and advocating for drug users. It's so refreshing to go to those conferences and be like, oh, yeah I can talk about the fact that I believe drug users deserve things and should have a voice. I don't necessarily always speak that way in meeting settings because it's just not always productive. Then I have to sit there and explain things. It's just not worth it. That's not what I'm there for, but that is what I believe. And so being around people like that every two years at the harm reduction conference is like being recharged and reminded. 
And who knows. Maybe tribes will at some point, or maybe it's happening somewhere behind the scenes and I don't know it, but will look at legalization. Marijuana, and maybe decriminalization, and putting people in treatment. Increasing treatment. A lot of what other countries have done that are actually really effective. And I would love to be part of that because I believe in it. I think I would be able to do it really pragmatically. And again it's just common sense. But we get so—it's like the moral thing of drug use and it's a choice, and they're bad people, and they don't care about themselves. And it's just not true. There may be times where I felt really bad towards myself. I didn't like myself. But it didn't mean I didn't care about wanting to be alive, or...
AS: Or that you didn't love your family. 
AF: Exactly. I just had lost my way. I think I had a couple of attempts to find my way, and I didn't succeed, and then I did. [laughs] And again it was the opportunity. It was the part-time, eight-hour a week job at a drop-in center and becoming passionate about this one thing. That's what it took. 
AS: And you couldn't maintain using if you were—
AF: Yeah. That was what I needed. There's so many different ways that people can give back. Or maybe it's like just their family is important to them, and they're not like me. They don't need a career that they're passionate about. They just really care about their family, or whatever. But people have to find value in what they do. 
AS: That's great. 
AF: So I think other tribes are at a variety of different places. Some are still probably completely against public health strategies, and just can't figure out why their current models aren't working still. Still blaming others instead of trying new things. Because it does go against the values of being completely drug-free, abstinence based community. That was what needed to happen to address the alcohol problem, which has been tearing tribes apart forever. 
AS: Thank you. 
AF: You're welcome. "

Carol Fallowski     -CF
Amy Sullivan        -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I’m with Carol Fallowski at Macalester College. It is March 2, 2017. Macalester College, St. Paul Minnesota. Carol do you give me permission to record this interview?
CF: Yes. This is Carol Fallowski. I give you permission.
AS: The first thing I like to start with is where people are coming from since this project is based in the state of Minnesota. It’s going to look at Minnesota primarily. Can you let me know where you’re from, where you grow up, whether it’s Minnesota or not?
CF: I was born and raised in Minnesota, not far from here. My parents got married at the Macalester President’s College. I worked at a dress shop that used be right down Grand Avenue. I’ve been in St. Paul my whole life. I got interested in the addiction field in the school of public health in the 1970s because it was the 1970s and it seemed like everybody was involved with drugs. I thought that was really interesting. I went through the chemical dependency counseling program and with one month left of an internship realized that counseling was the farthest thing from what I would ever want to do for a living. It was too sad for me. I would go home and cry at these sad stories. While you have to be empathetic you really shouldn’t be so sympathetic that you’re reduced to tears all the time. I switched my focus in college and after that because I was also while I was in the chemical dependency counseling program was an undergraduate teaching assistant in statistics and research methods. When I graduated from college I got a job with the government evaluating two-day jail sentences for drunk drivers in Hennepin County which was a very nice fit. Then did a statewide study of plea negotiations. Then did a study on family violence. I just moved into the research field instead of direct service.
AS: The topic has remained interesting?
CF: Oh yes and then eventually I wound up at the department of human services alcoholic and drug abuse division. From there participated in a national drug abuse epidemiology network of twenty researchers from the country and we were all convened twice annually by the national institute on drug abuse to present our drug abuse reports on those respective twenty cities. They looked at data, overdose deaths, treatment admissions, crime lab data, and hospital emergency room data. I wrote a report on drug abuse trends for the feds in that capacity for thirty years until it sort of reinvented itself in 2014. It gave me a great perspective because we would all get together for four days twice a year as well on emerging drugs of abuse, patterns of use, and populations at risk here as well as in those nineteen other cities. 
AS: So you just gave an elevator speech of our whole entire interview.
CF: So that’s that.
AS: I’m going to make you back up if you don’t mind. 
CF: Here is that most recent report.
AS: I think I printed this. 
CF: April, okay you’ve got it. 
AS: I just printed that out. I haven’t read it. I’m looking forward to it. I want you to back up and talk about...You grew up in St. Paul. You said drugs were everywhere it was the 70s. Do you have any addiction tendencies in your family? Did you experience any? Did you see people in high school? What drew you to it?
CF: I was a sociology major, man and society. Looking at that it was a great social phenomena and statement of popular culture. I do not have any addiction in my family. My mother, my two uncles, and my grandfather all died of tobacco addiction at young ages. 
AS: It was the time and the place. And you went to the U and you got your Bachelor’s in…?
CF: Sociology. 
AS: Then you got a Master’s?
CF: No, I have a BA. 
AS: That is really awesome. You’re a really smart person.
CF: Thank you. I don’t know about that. My grandfather was a very smart person. He was born in Laverne, Minnesota in the Southwest part of the state. The only county without a lake. After he graduated from high school took out a loan and bought the Rock County Star newspaper. He ran that newspaper and then he was editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press and then he went and worked at the New York Times for a couple of years. Then he went in 1956 to become managing editor of the Washington Post and then executive editor and then in 1969 was appointed ambassador to the UN to the United States by Lyndon Johnson. He never went to college. I’ve never really thought that higher education was a prerequisite because that guy was so accomplished. He didn’t do it. 
AS: This is your grandfather?
CF: Yes, who lived until he was ninety-seven. He just died in 2000. 
AS: What was his name?
CF: James Russell Wiggins. 
AS: Do you have a family? Did you get married? Do you have children?
CF: Yes, I’m married and I have two adult children. And I have one grandchild who my son won’t let me put on social media. So there you go. 
AS: That’s a bummer because you’ve still got a lot of fun when you do that. Some day he will, maybe. Tell me what it was like when you first started doing research with drunk driving, with addiction? Can you kind of back up?
CF: How what was?
AS: What was it like when you were first studying it? What was the culture like? What was the bureaucracy?
CF: Drug abuse?
AS: Yes, for drug abuse. I’m looking for some changes over time. 
CF: Well this is all governmental structure stuff. 
AS: That’s okay. That is interesting to me. 
CF: The federal government, for many years, passed through grant monies to states for drug abuse prevention and treatment. They’re called block grants. The state Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency which in this state is now called the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division of the Minnesota Department of Human Services is the state agency responsible for dispersing those funds. The funds come from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMSA. The state alcohol and drug agencies vary by state. In some states they’re located in the Department of Human Services. In some states they’re located in the health departments. Here it’s in the state Department of Human Services. That’s sort of the state structure. I was working there at the research unit when I did a study of two-day jail sentences for drunk drivers. That was in 1983. Then in 1986 due to some changes I became part of this drug abuse epidemiology workgroup of the national institute on drug abuse. It’s called the CEWG, Community Epidemiology Workgroup. It was reconnoitered in 2014. It’s called something else now. Then when I would write my very first report, by and large the drugs we had anything to talk about in the state of Minnesota were of course alcohol and then marijuana and then everything else took a remote backseat to those two drugs of abuse in terms of both prevalent abuse and consequences of use. 
AS: Do you remember what your findings were for the two day? This is basically the old idea that you take the drunk person and you make them jail detox. It’s kind of like a jail detox.
CF: I did a time series analysis. It did show to reduce night time injury accidents, I compared Hennepin County to Ramsey County which did not have the two-day jail sentences. 
AS: Because they’re locked up for the weekend or whatever those days.
CF: They can schedule them when they come in but they still have to spend two days. It was an effective deterrent as measured by changes in the rate of nighttime injury accidents. 
AS: So did they keep it after your report? What happened?
CF: The judges kept it up. Then as changes happened in the judge’s appointment it kind of fizzled out. That was my first published article. It was on reducing two-day jail sentences and using time series analysis which is pretty complex. It was interesting. Then I did my first drug report in ‘86. The VA had a methadone program. I think it was the VA had one and Hennepin County had one. There had been one in St. Paul that I kind of came in on the tail end of that. There must have been some problem with it. It had been closed down. There were really only those two. The prevalence of heroin was very low. It was very sporadic. It was as if there would be a short brief supply of heroin and then there would be dry periods. Eventually, I’m just going to talk about these trends in drug abuse. I think as the result of our sporadic supply of what is very low period of heroin it became apparent that the Twin Cities had some of the higher rates of prescription opioid abuse. This is into the 90s.
AS: After oxy is approved.
CF: No, prior to that. 
AS: Where were people getting it? Hospitals?
CF: From a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy. The source, I don’t recall the source of it. It was interesting to me in looking at the hospital emergency room data that relative to other cities we tended to have higher rates of exposure to prescription medications which was attributed by me and by others to the fact that we didn’t have a constant supply of heroin. To supplant that people would seek out prescription narcotics. That lasted into the mid-90s. Also, when Prozac or fluoxetine was introduced we had one of the higher rates of hospital emergency room episodes involving that as opposed to other cities. I believe it was a carry over to sort of a penchant of drug abusers here for prescription drugs. 
AS: To abuse Prozac. Interesting. We’re in the mid-90s now and are you still at DHS or have you moved on?
CF: I left DHS in 1997 to 2007 I was at Hazelden. Then I went back as director of the state alcohol and drug abuse agency in ‘07 and did that until 2012. In 2012 I hung up my own shingle and now I do education training and consulting. With drug abuse, cocaine then started. When I got into that group in 1986 cocaine was on the upswing and we always met in a different city and then would take field trips. It was my ongoing education about drug abuse. We happened to be meeting in New York City. I think it was in June of 1986. When Len Bias, the aspiring basketball player overdosed on cocaine. We passed around little vials of cocaine. The police came and we all got to look at them and see what it was. We went on a field trip to some treatment program in Harlem. It was my ongoing education about drug abuse because we were together for four days twice a year. 
AS: Many of the same people?
CF: Yes. That was a good learning experience. 
AS: This is the Len Bias who the law is now...this is his case of his overdose? Where they’re trying to convict drug dealers?
CF: Is it? They have a Len Bias Law?
AS: Yes. 
CF: Federal?
AS: Well I think so. I think right now there’s a drug dealer named Beverly Burrell who’s being charged with third degree murder of five young men in this area. What I understand is that it’s the Len Bias.
CF: That would be him then. 
AS: So you were New York right after that happened. So cocaine, what about cocaine here?
CF: We saw cocaine here. The first time I was quoted. Many researchers aren’t really articulate in explaining things to the public. But I seem to have that knack for it. The first interview I ever had in the newspaper was about cocaine. I know that from looking back at old newspaper clippings. I think I said, “It seems as if everyone and their dog is using cocaine.” I think that’s why the media always still comes to me for good little sound bites. I never really a saw a dog use cocaine. I think that was an embellishment. Cocaine came and rose. I learned how to not only gather data but interpret data because I noticed an extreme spike in people coming in to treatment. With any drug epidemic having people come into treatment is a good thing. It was just such a dramatic increase. Talk to my colleagues across the aisle from me at the alcohol and drug use agency. They’d opened three different federally funded programs for cocaine addicts. Of course you’re seeing these kinds of increases. 
AS: This might seem like a boring question but can you explain how you got the data to do the research? Are all of the treatment centers supposed to report to you? Can you explain how that process works?
CF: We have a system called the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Normative Evaluation System or DAANES. We thought that was so clever. DAANES is a requirement of anyone who receives public funds for treatment in the state. DAANES has two hundred and sixty some variables about patient history and how they came to be there and that includes information collected at intake and at discharge. It also allows us to look at changes in time over number of people coming into treatment for different drug categories. 
AS: Is this still used today? 
CF: I can show you. Exhibit 6, this one. Page ten. That is DAANES data. I invented this chart way back in the day. It’s a good way to look at the number of admissions coming in and what the primary drug of abuse is. Then within that what is the gender, race, ethnicity, age, route of administration, we put smoking in there too. 
AS: On this if you add heroin and other opiates that would be the number two after alcohol. 
CF: Oh yes. Heroin alone what’s significant now, what’s unprecedented now in this report of April of 2015 is that the percent of heroin admissions exceed the number of marijuana admissions which has never happened. You can see where cocaine has really dropped off to four percent. Methamphetamines is actually rising. The fact that heroin admissions surpass marijuana is a significant plight in the state of Minnesota. 
AS: Is there someone doing your same kind of work now? Since you’ve left?
CF: I still do it. 
AS: Will you be doing it again for 2016?
CF: I don’t know. To be determined. I’ve done it so long. 
AS: I can help you with it. I’m concerned because the numbers have actually gone up in 2016. There’s been more deaths. They dropped in ‘15.
CF: They all come from different public data sources. These reports were unique in as much as they put it all together. By putting various data sources together, collectively they painted a picture that did not otherwise exist of drug trends. 
AS: Are you talking nationally? No, you’re talking about here in Minnesota. 
CF: And the people in nineteen other cities that did this. That’s the value of these reports. Now data is much easier to get, public data. It was very difficult to get. DAANES data, treatment data was maintained and I worked on the drug and alcohol DAANES system. That was easy to get always. These other data sources used to be very hard to get. To get crime lab data for Minneapolis I used to have to go and individually record things from three ring binders to write that down. Medical examiner reports I would have to go sit over there in their office in Hennepin County and go through manually pieces of paper. It’s come a long way. My first pie chart was done by putting a coffee cup on a piece of paper and drawing a circle around it because computer technology did not exist to make graphs. It’s come a long way. Data is much better. Some of these agencies have been very proactive in putting their own data together. Some of them including other people’s data. The state monitoring has actually improved over thirty years. You think it would, it has for everything else. 
AS: There is something about learning how to present it and communicate it to the audiences.
CF: Then go to this Exhibit 14. This shows trends over time. That’s that same treatment data on page nine. You can see as a percent of, or these are just raw numbers, of people coming in. But you can see that rise in heroin. You can see that rise in methamphetamines. 
AS: They’re kind of on a parallel line aren’t they with each other? Other opiates, that is a little more steady there. 
CF: Then this one, talk about the State Health Department. It always had mortality data. It has started being much more active in the last two years in making that public data, public.
AS: Because you wouldn’t necessarily know what the person died from or what the medical examiner…?
CF: No, they’ve just become more proactive in making it more accessible. They’ve always had it. They’ve just started because in this state the state alcohol and drug abuse agency is in the Department of Human Services not the Department of Health. Even though the health has the vital statistics. They’ve kind of gotten on board in making it more public and here you can look at overdose deaths in the eleven county metro area versus greater Minnesota for Minnesota residents. Which are the lion share of the deaths. What’s going on, to me the point of this is that it’s not just a metropolitan problem, it’s all over the state. So in the meantime, I’ll just do the short thing of drug trends. When I started in that group I really had nothing to say about it. Everybody really organizes their presentations around drugs. I had nothing much to say about heroin or cocaine. After a few years I thought, “Whoa. I wonder if I’ll ever have anything to say about those drugs.” Then it changed with cocaine peaking out then methamphetamine became a big problem.
AS: When would you say cocaine peaked out?
CF: ‘86 was a height. I’d have to look. It was somewhere there. For at least ten years now that’s been declining. The thing is it never really disappears. Something else. What makes news in the drug abuse world is large increases. The declines not so much. Then methamphetamines came in and it peaked in 2005. Here as well as nationally. Then has been declining. Minnesota was one of the first states to have state laws about methamphetamine manufacturing. Then thirty-four states total had state laws about it and then the federal law came in. Our senator at the time, Senator Norm Coleman was very active in that and driving that national legislation. That was 2005 and then things with methamphetamines declined for a few years. Certainly there were fewer methamphetamine homemade labs. We had the federal law that restricted the retail sale of products that contain pseudoephedrine. Starting in 2009 or four years later increases started happening again with methamphetamine. It was in 2015 that indicators related to methamphetamine in Minnesota were higher than they were in 2005. Because opioids were at that time capturing the headlines, it didn’t get much public attention. It is still the case that methamphetamine is stronger than it ever was. There’s not that element of labs blowing up and pollution. It’s coming in from Mexico.
AS: It’s being made there so people aren’t making it here. 
CF: It’s a huge problem. Mixed in with all that are the synthetic drugs and synthetic opioid drugs like fentanyl which is a complete game changer. I could talk forever. Ask me a specific question. That’s kind of the overview.
AS: I’m just letting you go and then I’ll ask you another question. Can you talk about your time at Hazelden and what you did there? Who were you seeing? Were you still collecting data for Hazelden? Is Hazelden one of those places that has to report to the DAANES?
CF: Yes.
AS: They do because what public funds do they get?
CF: They get some money from the Chemical Dependency Consolidated Treatment Fund, CDCDF.
AS: You’ve got a lot of alphabets.
CF: The Consolidated Chemical Dependency Treatment Fund is a pool of federal money and state money that is available for people who could not otherwise afford treatment for addiction. Each county in the state gets an allocation from that big pool of money that’s based on a formula. That’s like a population based rate. Each county gets their allocation and then the county administers those funds. In order for a person who’s low income to receive alcohol or drug treatment they have to go to their county human service agency, get a chemical dependency assessment, and then the county determines the severity of problem and matches that with the level of care of services. They also match it with the treatment providers with which they have contracts so they can send patients there. It’s an enormous fund. The state contribution the last time I looked was like probably 2012, it was about over one hundred million dollars were state funds to that. There were some federal funds, some from this block grant. It provides treatment for people in the state. At Hazelden it gets people who come on that. The data systems are good. Almost any treatment program in the state is in that. 
AS: It’s a good picture, it’s inclusive.
CF: Some states have more limited ones and only collect Medicare or is it Medicaid. 
AS: I can never remember.
CF: Some just have data systems that look at public paid clients through their Medicaid. Ours is pretty much all treatment programs report on it. It’s a good snapshot. It’s almost a total snapshot as opposed to a sample. 
AS: So what did you do there and were you at Center City?
CF: Yes, I was at Center City. I came in working in the research department. I did these reports. Then I helped with other different patient studies. They had different studies for different patient groups. I’d take part in that. Then the CEO at the time said I should be in communications. Being in government I never had a CEO. I thought well if he’s saying it I should go do that. Then I worked in the communications. All the time I kept doing these reports.
AS: You keep doing them not necessarily because someone is telling you to but because you want to keep your eye on what’s going on?
CF: No, because I was a part of this national workgroup. It was only twenty people. I wanted to. 
AS: You needed the Minnesota data so you could report it to that. 
CF: I wanted to be a part of that group because it’s a spectacular learning experience going to all the different places we went to in different cities to see aspects of the drug problem. I kept writing those reports. I worked in communications. Then I worked in public policy driving the national Ramstad-Kennedy legislation at the national level. I made trips to Washington. I did that for ten years. 
AS: How did you find it different moving from DHS into a place as prestigious and well known as Hazelden?
CF: It was a breath of fresh air because Hazelden had campuses in Chicago, New York City, Florida, and Oregon. I got a lot of my experience through going to those areas of the country and speaking to different professional and parent audiences about it. That was really a great experience. At Hazelden if you had a good idea it was so welcomed. It was like, “That’s a great idea. Let’s help make that happen.” When I worked in state government two different times as I was a young woman coming up I had some ideas and I’m very outspoken. I would take them to my superior and two different times I had different bosses say, “We aren’t about good ideas here. We’re about doing things the way we’ve always done them. You should know that.” It was very deflating. Working in government is a great experience and I learned so much about how bureaucracies work and how money flows. It takes a certain outlook to maintain long-term in government and I just didn’t have it. I believe you should improve things and quit doing some things. So when I went back to government I went back as the director. I thought, “Now I’ll be in a better position because I’ll be the director.”
AS: Were you able to make change?
CF: I was able to make some changes.
AS: Like what?
CF: I freed up some funding for recovery based services like the Minnesota Recovery Connection. There’s another one down in Mankato. We get this block grant money so why not have those. They’re really an important piece. The theory behind them is that when someone’s in recovery, the person in the throes of addiction has lost their friends, their family, their job, their social supports. It’s very hard to go back and integrate into the community. The idea of recovery centers is to provide services to those folks who are just trying to get their lives back in order. Recovery or systems of care is the buzz phrase that they use. I helped start those. I also got some training going. We had at the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency an American Indian desk that really deals exclusively with the American Indian programs. There was a person there who had developed a curriculum to teach non-Indian service providers about Indian culture and how to best deal with Indian clients. I freed up some money and time to go deliver that to different audiences over the state, to correctional workers and different workers in different domains.
AS: So Minnesota Recovery Connection started with you?
CF: Yes. 
AS: That’s awesome. You’ve done a lot of talking to parents. Can you talk about how you approach that and what your philosophy was and your strategy? Those situations, where they happened, the response you got. When did you start doing that? Was it while you were at Hazelden?
CF: Yes. That’s when it really took off. I had done it before. They had people working in all those cities. They wanted to get Hazelden’s name out there in a high profile way. What better way than to have something for professionals during the day and then they’d something for the community at night? My busiest day in Kentucky I talked to school teachers in the morning, a combination of the Lions Club and the Rotary at lunch and they’d never met together. I said, “Now don’t you boys get in a fight.” Then a law enforcement group at three in the afternoon of regional law enforcement people. Then that evening a community event. I was on the speaking thing. I could do that again. Parents are often the last to know what to do. They may be the first to realize something’s going on with their child with drugs and alcohol or they may be the last to know what’s going on with drugs and alcohol. The challenge really of parenting in today’s age is that the signs and symptoms of drug abuse are very similar to the signs and symptoms of normal adolescence. The list is almost identical. Changes in hygiene, changes in friends, changes in mood, loss of interest in usual activities.
AS: Sleepiness, staying up too late. 
CF: All of these symptoms that are in my book are also the same as the symptoms of an emerging drug or alcohol problem. The key is that when they all happen together, when it’s not spread out over time. When all these symptoms are occurring all at once chances are there’s a drug or alcohol problem involved. Another thing parents don’t realize is that they don’t know how to distinguish, is it a drug or alcohol problem or is it just normal adolescence? Then they don’t know what to do about it. They don’t realize that if their kids are involved in a drug or alcohol problem they will lie about it. They’ll look at you in the face and lie to you. That especially for some parents is just appalling. I say your kids will lie to you and you can hear a gasp in the crowd. “My Johnny would never do that.” It was really an eye opener for me about how parents grapple with this. Not only do they have a hard time identifying it but they don’t know what to do about it and they don’t know about the drug abuse situation today. They don’t know that their little angel just by going to a good private high school can buy heroin now. That would just floor them for as little as ten bucks. They don’t know that their little angel who goes to a public school as early as seventh grade can be offered Adderall in the bathroom or a joint at the football game or alcohol on the school bus. They don’t have a concept of how our culture has drugs and alcohol all over it. We are blanketed in this country with drug and alcohol access at a very young age that we’ve never seen before. 
It really was gratifying for me to go all across the country, learn the local problems. Because I was a part of this national monitoring group I could read the reports of my colleagues in those areas before I went to kind of familiarize myself with the numbers and the epidemiology in those specific areas. Then talk to parents and listen to their concerns. I was talking in Cape Elizabeth, Maine which is a hoity-toity suburb outside of Portland, Maine. No one was coming. The school principal had to be convinced to do it. “If we host something on drugs people will think we have a drug problem.” That’s how schools were like and probably still are like. No one was registered to come. We might get twenty-five people there. That Sunday I was speaking on a Tuesday and that Sunday a sixteen-year-old girl got drunk in the middle of the day and drove her car into a tree and killed herself. It was an accidental car accident but she was drunk. Come Tuesday it was standing room only. They had to move it to the cafeteria and an adjacent room. It was packed and you could have heard a pin drop. I spoke first and then we had a panel of the police chief and the school principal and a treatment provider and another woman whose son had struggled with addiction. When the panelist were all through making their introductory remarks a woman stood up and just lost it. Saying, “When is this community going to face the facts about our drug and alcohol problems? How many people have to die? What’s going on here?” She was just really agitated. After the police chief took that question. After it was over I said, “Who is that?” She said, “Her son got killed by a drunk driver fourteen years ago when he was in high school.” It was such an a-ha moment for me because what an example of unless communities kind of step up to the plate about talking about drug and alcohol you’re going to have people like that. You’re going to have this ongoing rage and burning rage inside of people unless they can have some community programs or events or something. Some community to plug into where they get support for underscoring it as a certain problem. We still are so shameful. 
Kids who get into trouble in drugs and alcohol. I’ve talked about the parents but the kids themselves, if they get labelled in high school as having a drug or alcohol problem then the parents don’t want their kids to hang out with that person. Even when they get the help they need they don’t get the support for it. They’re still labelled. Minnesota used to have more sober high schools than any place in the country. Now because the failed business model, they didn’t figure out how to make themselves charter schools and spent all their money on transportation. We don’t, we only have six. Minnesota was a pioneer in that area of sober high schools where kids once in recovery could get support for being in recovery. Parents are really key and that’s one of the things that motivated me to write a book. The book is called Drug Abuse. I brought that for you too. 
AS: Thank you. 
CF: An Easy to Use Reference for Parents and Professionals. I said don’t pick a scary title and then Dangerous Drugs in big red letters. It’s a guide for parents. It has the signs and symptoms. For every drug it talks about the observable signs of use and then when you should call 9-1-1. It didn’t exist. I felt really good about writing that and going around and talking about it. 
AS: There was nothing like this. That’s great. Thank you for that. Just getting back, what have you seen change here in Minnesota because of the heroin and opiate pain killer epidemic with parents, with kids? Did you notice a shift with parents here or is it the same as what you were just talking about where people don’t really want to acknowledge that maybe in Northfield or Minnetonka that there’d be a heroin…? Do you think it’s really changed?
CF: What?
AS: The general response. There’s a lot more in the media.
CF: There was stuff in the media about methamphetamine as there is about opioids now. With every drug trend it gets varying degrees of public attention. Every drug epidemic has a certain characteristic about it. Every drug has its own characteristics. The key thing about methamphetamine that was used to drive prevention methods was it rots your teeth and it gives you a sunken appearance. Still parents didn’t think that their little angels could access meth. There’s a drug. We live in a culture where we are rewarded for doing more in less time. It’s a perfect fit with our culture. A strong stimulant, long acting drug.
AS: And Adderall is this generation that’s been raised on the ADHD drugs. 
CF: I’ve looked up a story and I can’t remember when chill pill came into our dictionary. I think it was 2003. You could confirm that. 
AS: Thank you for reminding me about that.
CF: That’s a very good thing to have in a book and I have it. I’ve got a million PowerPoints but I can’t remember which one I put that in. It shows that one thing that’s happened sociologically is the increased use of pills to treat all sorts of medicine. And direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that happened in 1989. That sort of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs, I’m not sure that ‘89 is the year. I can’t remember the exact year. That really does start this increase in the abuse of prescription drugs non-medically. It still is the case that kids get a lot of their information from television. Especially if you watch the national news, nightly news. Those are all prescriptions but they’re mostly for older people with different body function failures. The thing that distinguishes the opiate problem for me professionally was whenever I would speak to these various professional and community audiences and when I started doing that, it happened a couple times with methamphetamine, it started happening more frequently and regularly with audiences where I was talking about heroin and opiates. Someone would stay back afterwards and tell me that they were the parent of a child who had died from an overdose. The numbers grew so much that at one point I had a dozen emails of parents whose kids had died. I just sent out an email to all of them and said...I would meet with them and talk. It’s such a devastating thing that their family will probably never recover from. I got them all together and I think that’s maybe how Mothers Against Drunk Drivers started. Just letting them know each other.
AS: Was this mostly in the state of Minnesota?
CF: Yes, it was in the Twin Cities area.
AS: Do you remember some of those mothers’ names?
CF: Yes. You want to talk to some of them?
AS: I’m wondering if I’ve already interviewed some of them. 
CF: I don’t know. Did you know Star Selleck? She’s good. 
AS: Yes, and Gloria Englund. 
CF: And I can’t remember the one I always talk to. I’ll have to look. That’s what changed about that. The thing that distinguishes the opiate problem from other drug epidemics we’ve had in the past is that for each epidemic you have to look at prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. The three prongs of drug policy in this country. Given the pivotal role of prescription narcotics with the opioid crisis we have to look at prevention, treatment, and law enforcement, and the practice of medicine. We have to look at the situation and figure out what we can do about it within the medical community. We have two hundred and fifty-nine million prescriptions written for opioids in a year. In a country of three hundred and twenty million people. We need to look at what we can do to curb that. 
At the same time, we have to add that fourth prong, the practice of medicine. It’s not just looking at the conditions under which we prescribe prescription opioids. It also involves integrating the screening for drug and alcohol problems into primary care. With other chronic diseases with behavioral components where you have to change your behavior in order to get better we screen for those. You go to the doctor and you get screened for high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure the doctor talks with you about your high risk conditions. Obesity the same thing. We screen for that every time we go to the doctor. Asthma is screened for, diabetes. With those conditions about ninety percent of the people who have those conditions receive treatment for it. With alcohol it’s the inverse. About ten percent of the people who exhibit symptoms get treatment for it. That’s due to a number of things. One that the treatment system developed outside the practice of medicine. Secondly there are some people who manage their addiction simply by going to self-help groups. There are a group of medical professionals who seriously believe it’s not really a medical problem you can just go to one of those self-help groups to get better. They don’t really own it. Finally, they don’t get training in addiction even though they are prescribers. Even though they’re more likely to see someone who’s addicted than they’re likely to see someone with some horrible cancerous rare growth. They don’t get training in it. We have a long way to go. It’s as if the prescription opiate problem has brought to light all these shortcomings of all the different systems involved. Getting out of it and turning it around is multi-layered. It’s going to be a multi-year thing. It’s pretty complex. Doctors as a group do not take to being told how to practice medicine. Yet voters in twenty-eight states created this sort of outside of mainstream medicine systems of marijuana distribution. Changes have happened in spite of what doctors want. It’s very multi-layered to address it. I did for the Minnesota Medical Association I travelled around, this was in 2013, the state had me talk to different groups of doctors that they had convened about this opiate problem.
AS: What was that like?
CF: It was really interesting. I remember particularly one doctor who had said that whenever he tried to reduce, he had a patient who was probably one of those people.
AS: That was how he said it?
CF: Yes, one of those people. An addict. “Gosh, he’s been my patient for a long time. Every time I try to reduce his prescription or don’t increase it he threatens to kill me or my family.” I said, “I’m no doctor but if someone was threatening to kill me and my family I think that would be a law enforcement issue. Even if it were a patient.” That’s a threat against me. I said, “Did you do that?” This is in a small group of doctors. There are about thirty doctors in a room. He goes, “No. I just write him a new prescription.” I don’t think he’s the only doctor who deals with that. I don’t he’s the only doctor in Minnesota who does that. I don’t think he’s the only doctor in the country who does that. What I learned from talking to these doctors was that when they went through medical school they were taught, don’t worry about prescribing opioids. It’s only one percent are going to get addicted. You know that was from that little note. They really learned that. Then there’s a switch with the introduction of long-acting oxycodone to start using it for the treatment of chronic pain as well as acute. This long term chronic pain, Purdue Pharma they were fined in spite of that. We have the prescription monitoring programs which are good. Still we need to have more education, more integration. The National Institute on Alcoholism and Abuse developed a great curriculum for doctors on how to talk to patients about their drinking. It has little video, if you’re teaching a class this thing is great. When I was at the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency I had our staff watch it for a staff meeting. 
AS: What’s it called again?
CF: It’s at NIAAA.NIH.gov. They’re whole initiative is called “Rethinking Drinking.” Just look for clinical guide for doctors. It shows doctor interactions and one of them for example is a guy who says he drinks but only on weekends but only when he watches football games and doesn’t drink at all during the week. The guy’s presenting with high blood pressure and the doctor says, “Well how many games do you watch a weekend?” “Well if it’s in the season I’ll watch the college games on Saturday and then I’ll watch the pro games on Sunday.” The guy’s watching about ten games and he only has a six pack every game. That’s a lot of drinking. You think a football game does last a long time. 
AS: It’s just asking that second or third question. 
CF: The doctor saying, “I could put you on medication for your high blood pressure but do you think you could drink less? Do you think you could limit yourself to a six pack a day on a Saturday or Sunday?” If the person’s not addicted they’re like, “Oh sure.” Those conversations are easy to have. Doctors aren’t really well versed or trained in how to do it. 
AS: The doctors I’ve spoken to have said there’s also a time issue and a hassle issue. They have less time and they don’t want to be hassled. 
CF: Chronic pain patients and addicted patients are the most challenging of patients to deal with. This is just screening within the general population. They found extremely good results. The other one is the screening brief intervention and referral to treatment, SBRIT. It was developed by the national government and tested in many different settings across the country both on reservations and in urban areas and in rural areas. Screening brief intervention and referral to treatment involves just a very few little screening questions for people for patients who present for primary care. Sometimes they have it in emergency rooms. Then they found that just doing a brief intervention on them, like the one I just described would qualify as a very brief intervention, that over half of the people changed their drinking behavior. The people who were not addicted. Where else in behavioral health do you get that kind of behavior change? Never. It’s never been that high. It can be very effective in interrupting a person’s progression to addiction. To have a health professional, whether it’s a doctor or one of their people, just say, “You might be going on the road to addiction if you keep this up. Why don’t you just try reducing it for a while.” Then all these other health problems will probably diminish. That’s been really effective. SBRIT, there haven’t been any sites with it here. I wrote a grant when I went to the state and it didn’t get funded. SBRIT is great but it needs to go to more places in the country. Now Allina has a variation of that. Different health plans are starting to integrate it. That’s a huge issue. Just talking to people about it. If you teach this, you know this but you know doctors are trained to believe there’s only 1.5 percent of people would develop addiction. We now know from different studies and from the CDC it’s up to twenty-five percent of the people. 
AS: To opiates?
CF: Yes. There’s even one doctor I know who believes that if you have a room of one hundred people and you give them all Percodan for a month at the end of the month they’ll all be addicted. 
AS: Who’s that?
CF: Dr. Chris Johnson.
AS: I was going to guess. 
CF: Have you talked to him?
AS: Yes, I interviewed him. He’s an interesting guy. He’s actually the kind of spokesperson and Evangelist to get the attention of doctors. Those kinds of people emerge as well. In a crisis situation you need the people who are going to rattle your cage. 
CF: Doctors are much more inclined to listen to other doctors than anybody else. 
AS: You talked about the parents that you met…
CF: I want to finish back about this doctor who said that. I don’t think he’s the only doctor. Another thing that has to change in the medical world in addition to screening, in addition to more reasoned prescribing of opioids for certain conditions. We need to train doctors on what to do with people who are addicted. Many times they don’t know what to do. Again it’s an outgrowth of treatment centers developing outside of mainstream medicine.
AS: That’s interesting. What your ideal model be for treatment?
CF: Different health plans. We have a crisis in health care too. Each treatment plan has to figure out their own stuff. 
AS: In an ideal world what would you see?
CF: It’s like with any other health condition. Go to your doctor. You’ve got addiction? Go to your doctor. People coming into treatment based on the DAANES data, only six percent of people coming into treatment are referred by doctors. Nobody really wakes up and says, “Oh gee. I’m sick of my life. I think I’ll go to treatment today.” That just doesn’t happen. It’s either family, the criminal justice system, or your employer that says, “You’ve got to do this or else.” 
AS: If our health care system was functional we would have more access and more time with doctors. If they had more training they would look for signs. The fifteen-year-old that’s wanting birth control to the family nurse practitioner could be screened for other things as well. They could talk about all kinds of things with them. Do you think that opioids have changed anything in the way that we look at addiction or do you think it’s just another drug in the grand march of drugs of the day?
CF: I think they’ve put a spotlight on how we deliver treatment and what treatment is delivered. The science is overwhelming that the use of medication in the treatment of opioid addiction is very effective. Yet, treatment providers in Minnesota as well as over the rest of the country have been very reluctant to embrace that as part of their practice. People aren’t getting the kind of help they need. Hazelden was one of the first treatment programs in the state of Minnesota if not the first to use Suboxone in the treatment of their opiate addicted patients. They had a huge influx in the number of opioid patients and they were noticing that they were leaving without staff approval. Once they left a number of them were overdosing and dying. They wanted to do something and introduced state of the art medication assisted treatment. Now people go through a program they have at Hazelden that includes that. Trying to get other treatment providers to incorporate the use of medications in the treatment of opiate addiction in the state of Minnesota was one of my primary goals as a director of the State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Agency. I liken it to pushing a piece of string. It just collapses on itself. I had trainings through the professional association of treatment providers. I had trainings through DHS that we would put on and have different panels of parents and law enforcement and doctors. I did a number of those.
AS: Talking about the benefits of medications?
CF: Yes, here we are. This is the only drug category, well alcohol there’s some medication too, for which there are effective medications. We want to be science based in Minnesota not based on ideology. Let’s use the science to deliver treatment. There is a lot of barriers to it here. I wasn’t able to do that. 
AS: When did you start that?
CF: 2008. Do I think it’s made progress? What’s that it’s almost ten years. No.
AS: Hazelden won’t touch methadone either.
CF: Really?
AS: They won’t touch it.
CF: Still?
AS: Suboxone is not really their thing anymore. Vivitrol is their…
CF: That’s the same as Suboxone.
AS: They won’t touch methadone because they said that’s not their client base. 
CF: And how many people who are on methadone go to AA meetings or Narcan meetings and are told, “You aren’t really sober.”? It’s very frustrating. The analogy I use is that someone has high blood pressure. They go to their doctor. The doctor says, “Lose weight, exercise, and watch your diet.” Then they go back in a year because nobody really exercises or loses weight. Here it is a year later they still have high blood pressure. Then the doctor says the same thing, “Diet and exercise.” Then the person has a stroke and dies. If you were the family of that person and you knew those prior conversations wouldn’t you say that doctor is guilty of malpractice? He didn’t even mention that there’s a medication for high blood pressure. What kind of doctor are you going to? He doesn’t even mention that. In treatment you have people who go into treatment programs and they say, “This is what we do for treatment programs.” It’s all cognitive behavioral therapy. They don’t even mention there are medications that can really help with the craving. There are medications that you can be on long term that really help manage this disease with behavioral components. They don’t even say that. One of the changes that’s happened is there’s now language in a law that says treatment providers have to inform their patients that there are medications. 
AS: When was that?
CF: A couple years ago. I’m not sure how that’s going. I’ve been at a distance and just reading these list serve emails about the language. Big fights about the language in it from people who do not believe. If this is really a disease you should use what the science says is available to treat the disease, not your personal beliefs about it. “I just don’t believe in that.” 
AS: Do you think that’s an impact of the Alcoholics Anonymous model or do you think it’s the moral model of addiction?
CF: I think it’s both of them. It’s news to me that Hazelden still does not accept patients with methadone. However, I’ve taught at their graduate school and everything. There’s this belief that some of the people who are treatment providers now, back in the day were trained in the belief that a drug is a drug is a drug and methadone is just a drug. Whenever I talk about this publicly it tends to be students who are in the counseling in training programs at different places who say, “I was taught that a drug is a drug is a drug.” I don’t know if there are any programs that have counselor training programs in the state and I don’t know where they’re still hearing that. What also floors me is that just two weeks ago I got a call from a woman about a speaking event that I’m doing. In the course of talking about what I would be covering I talked about this issue. The use of medications and how much resistance there is to integrating them into effective treatment models in the state. She goes, “Oh boy that’s my son. He’s been to treatment twelve times and he’s nineteen.” I thought, “It’s still going on.” I was stunned. That just tells me. This was unsolicited from this woman. He had been to twelve different treatment programs. I said, “Well did anybody ever mention Suboxone to you or Vivitrol?” “No. What’s that?” I gave her the name of a doctor to talk with. I gave her the websites of how to read about these medications. 
AS: This is someone who’s planning to bring you to speak?
CF: Yes.
AS: What does she do?
CF: She’s a nurse. She’s taken her kid. He’s had twelve formal treatment episodes. It’s never been mentioned. 
AS: It’s never worked because he’s addicted to opiates. 
CF: She didn’t know what medications. She said, “He also has mental health problems.” I said, “That’s really common too.”
AS: You can stabilize him on methadone or Suboxone. Those drugs have such stigma. 
CF: That blew my mind. I could not believe my ears. That was two weeks ago that that came up. Totally unsolicited. We were talking about something else. Then she said, “That’s my son.” We talked for twenty minutes about her son. He never had any treatment programs that brought up medications.
AS: It’s criminal. 
CF: It’s horrible. It’s not limited to Minnesota. Yes, people who are addicted are very challenging patients. People are long term chronic pain patients are very challenging patients. But we have to give our medical system and our treatment provider system the tools they need to help these people get better. That’s one thing I realized going to all these events that it’s so polarized. 
AS: Then you also have the DEA who are involved in the monitoring of methadone and how difficult it is to even prescribe that or have a clinic or the doctors. They’ve changed the law. If doctors aren’t trained how to understand how to prescribe it and monitor it, they won’t agree to have a hundred patients. 
CF: Didn’t they even up the limit to three hundred?
AS: Yes, but who’s going to do it unless they understand it. 
CF: Doctors, why would they volunteer to treat the most difficult patients. 
AS: The people who got worse.
CF: “I think I’ll get my Suboxone training so I can start treating addicts.” That doesn’t happen either. 
AS: Even though one doctor I interviewed said he has a great practice. He has very few problems. He is a primary practice physician who has a specialty in addiction medicine. “These aren’t the people coming in the ER who see me. This is after we’ve gotten their lives stabilized. They’re much better.” It’s when are we going to quit the ER scenarios, the overdoses. That’s the mythology around addicts is that they’re just these horrible people. 
CF: Which reminds me. The things that are different about the opiate crisis are not only that we have to look at the usual prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and the practice of medicine. Also what distinguishes it from other drugs of abuse is that it’s got high abuse potential, high addictive potential, and high overdose potential. Unlike methamphetamine, unlike cocaine, unlike the hallucinogens, just a little bit too much can kill you. That’s what makes it different as well. The final thing that makes it different is this onslaught of China produced fentanyl that is appearing not only in the supply of sniffable drugs whether powder fentanyl has been mixed with heroin as well as cocaine. It’s getting mixed with the supply of powdered illegal drugs. Also it’s being put in counterfeit prescription pills. That is really only in the last year or so. That is implicated in the death of Prince and everyone who becomes addicted to prescription pain medications at some point runs out of the supply that they legitimately get. They seek them out on the black market. They find a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. People who may be selling these counterfeit pills probably have no idea there’s fentanyl in them. A little too much can kill you. That’s the other thing.
AS: That’s the case with the woman who sold to the five.
CF: She was selling heroin that had fentanyl in it?
AS: Yes. 
CF: I’ve looked at this death data for thirty years. Historically fentanyl deaths were either like an anesthesiologist diverting it or someone not taking it as medically prescribed. The classic case of that was a death of a guy who had knee pain and then was treating his knee pain with a heating pad. Then he had the surgery and went home and still put on the fentanyl patch and put the heating pad on it. Of course because it’s transdermal it opened it up and his wife found him when she came home from work on the couch with the fentanyl patch with the heating pad over it deader than a doornail. That was just not taking it as prescribed. Those were the kind of fentanyl deaths. Then one case, this was a law enforcement report where kids were trying to roll up and smoke fentanyl patches with a joint on the inside. 
AS: You’ve heard some stories I bet. 
CF: I’ve got a ton of them. That makes it new to this wild part of the counterfeit drugs.
AS: So now you’re doing the drug abuse dialogs. How busy is that keeping you? Do you want to stay busy? Do you want to keep working in this? How do you feel about it?
CF: That’s personal.
AS: Sorry. 
CF: We have a lot more drug education going on because law enforcement drug task forces in order to get their federal funding have to deliver training. We have a lot of non-profits who are delivering training. There’s more training available to people.
AS: Then what you experienced in the beginning when you were asked to be in communications?
CF: Right. There’s a lot more free training. It’s a challenge doing it as a business. 
AS: I didn’t mean that as a personal question. There is more education.
CF: That’s primarily what I want to do. It’s hard to find a niche in there when people provide it at no cost. I’m still sought out by the media quite a bit and I’m on TV three or four times a month. People come into my house. 
AS: Well you’re a good sport. Thanks for taking the time with me for this project. Is there anything else you wanted to share?
CF: Looking over the course of my career I think it’s very disheartening because the drug abuse situation in my estimation as the trained observer of it is as dire and tragic as it has ever been. Compared to when I got into this thirty-five years ago drugs are more accessible, they’re more dangerous, they’re more unknown. Our public policy response over the past thirty years to me is not as swift as it needs to be or as broad to adequately address it. 
AS: That ends on a sad note. Your perspective is important. Thank you.

White Earth Nation, Minnesota
Carson Gardner          -CG
Amy Sullivan             -AS
Sue Purchase              -SP
CG: Well the PhD behind your name means you have learned how to learn! [Sullivan laughing].
AS: I've learned how to learn
CG: And that's what it means. It means a lot of other things I'm sure, but I know it means that.
AS: That's right.
[Pause]
AS: First, before we got officially started I wanted to see if you had any questions. I have a release form that I'm needing you to read and take a look at before we get started.
CG: Sure. I hope that... My only question is not a question. It's a request. I hope that you will communicate with me and let me know when your book comes out and I will buy it.
AS: Oh yes, of course I will. Everyone who I'm interviewing is gonna know about that. Mostly this is a typical release form that just says that I can use what is said and spoken here in my other work and venues. The actual interview itself will belong to you.
[Long pause. Papers shuffling.]
AS: And Sue, I would say that if you have a question or you wanna participate I'm gonna introduce you as part of the conversation because you're in the room.
SP: Cool.
AS: It's what I should do.
SP: Okay.
CG: I'm gonna initial the review the content thing, not because I'm paranoid but  I'm an old family doctor.
AS: I put that thing in on  my own after another doctor asked me.
CG: Yes it's not, it's not that I distrust you.
AS: Yeah, yeah.
CG: One of the reasons is we have a big push right now here on White Earth land to try to develop some ethical forewarning for people who come in here to do acts of artistic expression. You may have heard of or seen, The Seventh Fire video? It's a video that a couple of citizens here linked up with an LA producer/director. And, they made a video and they kind of let people know they were here, but there was no supervision and no ethical contact. And, it turned out that the choice of the director and producer were to present things out of context in a very hurtful way. That really hurt the community of Pine Point [unclear].
AS: Oh... I think I did hear about this...
CG:  ...and our citizens. And so, I don't recommend that you watch it. Except, that yes in a way I do. It talks about issues you're concerned about
AS: What was it called—the seven fires?
CG: It's called The Seventh Fire. And yes, you should watch it. But, when you watch it you need to understand that's what should not be done, because it hurt a lot of people here. And, the tribal council was upset and the community council at Pine Point was upset, and they tried to contact the producer and director, and they sort of blew it all off. And said, ""We can do whatever the 'eff' we want."" So, there's been a groundswell movement here to try to develop some ethical way to instruct interviewers, writers, filmographers... about the ethics of presenting a contextually respectful story about White Earth when it's done. And, that doesn't mean we don't want you to tell the truth. The basic ideas in that video about drug abuse issues and generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences certainly are grounded in fact. They do happen, but the whole video presented things out of context in a quite hurtful way. And the two individuals, neither of whom live here anymore and didn’t at the time that was made, are felt to have opportunistically taken advantage of their having lived here to make that video. So, that isn't why you're here, and it may not have anything directly to do, but I have to tell you that if you haven't seen The Seventh Fire video you should look at it, because it deals with issues that you are going to deal with in your own way, and your creative product. But, just know that the way that whole thing was done was exactly not what the tribal council of the community council and our communities wanted. So, that's why I mention it, and that's why I'm signing initialing this.
AS: Right. No, I appreciate that so much.
SP: I think the actors... didn't, you are Clinton tell me before? Was Natalie Portman that was in that movie. I haven't looked for it yet, I had it written down.
CG: She was a producer, and of course her work is wonderful. And so, nobody's gonna condemn her for her dramatic work and everything. But the way the video was made was not acceptable and no one here was given any chance to ethically offer any standards or to review it or anything. So, no. Natalie Portman no one's gonna say anything but good about her work as a dramatic professional. So... but she put the money up and produced it and it wasn't as it should have been done. In our opinion. That's our opinion but it's a solid opinion.
AS: Your address would be perfect since we had such a hard time finding you! [Sullivan laughing].
SP: Clinton says he's supposed to be done by twelve thirty. I was told two interviews, but they had way more come for the interviews.
CG: Yeah.
AS: Okay.
[Long Pause]
CG: There, as you can see I'm a storyteller. It's hard for me to get anything done without telling a story.
AS: Thank you.
CG: I'm just not as dramatic about it as some.
AS: That's okay. So, do you have any questions for me before we get started? Like, who I am or what I'm doing. Want me to tell you a little bit about how I got...?
CG: You know what, I would love to hear a little more about that. You know what your time schedule is. I'll leave it up to you, but yeah I like to hear people's stories.
AS: So I, have a...worked on my Masters and my PhD while I was also raising my two daughters. My PhD is from the University of Illinois Chicago. My oldest daughter struggled with addiction issues that no one would call addiction 'cuz she was a teenager. And, when she was... and, I was also pursuing one of my areas of interests is history of medicine. And then, history of childhood. And then, women's history. So those are kind of my areas in U.S. history. I also have background in Native American history, particularly twentieth century. And I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And so, I've been in my life very much, my life's been very enriched by my association and being surrounded by Native culture.
CG: Other than obvious need to connect with Native communities, do you have other connections other than professional connections with Native communities?
AS: No, just you know personal things in my life. Cherokee nation.
CG: Do you have published work on the history of medicine and Native American history?
AS: No, not yet. No.
CG: 'Cuz I'd like to know about those articles if you have them I would read them.
AS: Sure, sure. Well I wrote my dissertation about the Girl Scouts in Oklahoma who experienced a very intense tragedy in 1977 when three girls were assaulted and murdered at camp, outside of Tulsa near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Yeah, so I wrote about that. So my...
CG: Our community understands such things.
AS: Yeah, so where I'm coming.... where my work has come from has been looking at trauma, and PTSD, and how communities heal from crisis.
CG: We have a lot of efforts going on in many of our divisions, and departments, and our community councils, and private individuals who are faith connected or traditional spiritual healers and teachers. So a lot of healing work going on all the time here.
AS: Yeah. So a lot of the women that were at the camp at that time were never diagnosed, and never had a chance to heal from that trauma. And, I was a child at the camp at the time. I was ten. And so, my insider status to that very—what became a very closed and tight-knit community because of the fear of that tragedy, you know, forever staining Girl Scouting in Oklahoma. It was very... it was my personal experience that allowed people to trust me thirty years later to talk about what happened. So, parallel to that is my work with the opioid epidemic because my oldest daughter ended up overdosing on heroin in our home before I, when I had never known she was ever possibly using any such thing. To me, as a child of the seventies that's not anything people would use. [Laughs]. Right? So, her overdose, near death experience, coma, surgeries, and recovery. In all ways—physical, spiritual, everything—really intrigued me.
CG: How is she doing now?
AS: She is great. She has a three and a half year old daughter, she's married, and she's about to start back at the University of Minnesota.
CG: Give her a hug for me. You don't have to tell her that it comes from me, but give her a hug from me.
AS: [Laughs] I will do that. She's very, very much an inspiration.
CG: Good.
AS: But, what shocked me, as a very attentive, educated, mother, was that this could've happened in my house. And so I started, seeking out, just from my own personal knowledge. How did this happen? What happened? And then someone said to me, who was working at a methadone clinic, he said, ""You know you should really write about this. You should really talk to people."" 'Cuz he said, ""Things are changing, and in how we're treating... the opioid epidemic is changing treatment. It would be great, because you do oral history, if you could collect these stories.""
CG: Yes, it's a perfect match.
AS: So, that's what I've done. I've done about seventy interviews in the last two years. And in all, in all... many different venues, all kinds of different people. What I have been particularly sensitive about, I came to the harm reduction, the summit two years ago. Not last year. I met Sue two years ago.
CG: Meeting Sue will change your life [All laugh].
AS: Apparently! Yeah, apparently.
SP: Thank you!
AS: So we, I interviewed her. And then, have been able to bring her on to do interviews as well.
CG: Good. I don't know Sue personally, but I know Clinton personally. And, Clinton speaks superlatively highly of Sue as a pioneer in harm reduction life saving in Minnesota.
AS: Yeah, he called her the elder birch bark.
SP: Yeah, he called me an elder birch tree of harm reduction! [Sullivan Purchase laughing].
AS: So, I'm gonna make you a little patch that says that. So anyway, that's just kind of how this got started. And, yeah. I'm really honored to be here. I also want to say that the chapter that I'm gonna work on around tribal nations and the opioid epidemic, I come to that with extreme awareness and sensitivity about portrayals and I'm very versed in my own history, where my people come from. How I enter the story, my vantage point. So, I just want you to know, that I'm so honored to be able to be here doing this. I will treat this with the most sacred kind of intellect that I can bring forward.
CG: Good, well you'll sell more books if you make us look twisted and evil. [Sullivan laughs]. But, you will help more lives if you make us look human.
AS: Well that's exactly what I'm doing
CG: And, you can ask Sue, but I suspect Sue and certainly Clinton will tell you that some of the harm reduction we're doing here is pioneering work on Native lands, if not everywhere in Minnesota.
AS: I know that.
CG: So, we're praying and working like hell to help save lives here, and to help offer people real healing of the underlying problems.
AS: Yeah, and well that's exactly why I wanna devote a chapter to it. Because I got a sense from the harm reduction summit, that things were happening in ways that were transformative and that there were lessons and things being learned here that could be applied.
CG: Your problem is, you really need to interview about 350 people here, and you're not gonna get to do it. You and Sue.
AS: I know, that is my problem!
CG: You're gonna end up being selective, and by being selective you won't go crazy, but you'll also miss some powerful stories.
AS: Right, but, if anyone you know of is willing, anyone else is willing to be interviewed we are open to it. We have cars.
CG: I think the best shot is Clinton and his team. Helping you Sue, to make connection with those who will want to speak their stories. So, that's gonna be your best shot. But, you know if, if you were an artificial intelligence and gonna be around for a thousand years you could interview almost everybody on the res here, cuz almost everybody would have a story of some kind. To connect to the pain and wounds and to the reach for healing.
AS: Right. So, that said. [Coughs]. Excuse me. We should get started [coughing]. My sinus, I'm not sick. My sinuses had a, took a beating last night at the hotel.
…
[Official Start Time: 15:40]
AS: So, this is Amy Sullivan. I'm here with Sue Purchase, and Dr. Carson Gardner. And we are at the White Earth Nation public health...?
CG: Tribal health department building.
AS: Tribal health department building. In White Earth, Minnesota. It's January 11th, 2019. Carson just to get started, I wanted to ask you to just state your name and say that you give permission for this interview to take place.
CG: My name is Carson Gardner, and I am an employee here of the White Earth tribal health department. And, I give my permission for the interview to take place. And, I have obtained the agreement and support from the White Earth Nation research review board to allow me to do this interview. The only stipulation is, I will not be able to give specific identifying information on White Earth citizens.
AS: Thank you. So, one of the things that we like to start off with in oral history, as I talked to you about is... get your, to look at, to get the whole story of a person as much as is possible in this short time we have. But, if you could start with your childhood, where you were born, your birth date if you're willing to share it, and just talk a little bit about your childhood.
CG: Sure. I was born on July 1st, 1952 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. My mother was forty years old when I was born, my father was fifty-six when I was born. It was my father's second marriage. They had been married for thirteen years, unable to have a child. And, I came along and it was a great joy for them, for one year. And, when I was a year old my father fell off a sixteen foot ladder, and he was terminally injured. It took him two years to die. My mother was heartbroken. Never really recovered from the grief of my father's death. My mother developed cancer when I was seven and died when I was nine. I was a food stamp kid. We had not enough money. My mother got a job working as a secretary in a bank so she could get health insurance. And she worked for a year with a breast lump until she could get health insurance, and got health insurance, went to the doctor, and it was too late. She died a year later with brain metastases and lung metastases. And we had no money and the insurance ran out. And so, they put my mother in an open state mental hospital cuz it was the only hospital that would take her. And when she died the duty nurse called our home, and my grandmother answered the phone and fainted dead away. I picked up the phone and heard the nurse saying, ""Mrs. Gardner is dead. What do you want us to do with her body?"" So yeah, adverse childhood experiences. My grandmother took over my care when I was nine and she was nearly 80, and she lived to be almost 98. We lived in the projects in East Minneapolis —across the river near the University of Minnesota. I can remember calling cops because there was a stabbing in front of our house. You know, kinda rough, but a lot of good too. My grandmother decided she wanted to show me that she was serious about my staying in school and getting an education. So, with her eighth grade education she enrolled in some extension courses at the University of Minnesota. She completed a year of college, you know she didn't graduate, but everybody in the neighborhood thought that was pretty cool that Jenny Carson completed a year of college in her nineties. So, that's kind of the context of my story.
AS: Were you named after her?
CG: My mother named me her maiden name as my first name. My name is Carson Timothy Gardner. And, I don't know if you wanna know this stuff, but...
AS: I do.
CG: My mother prayed to her spirit helper, named Timothy for thirteen years begging to have a child. And so, my middle name is Timothy. And she quit praying to the spirit helper, specifically after my birth. So, I've always found that to be somewhat interesting. Many other spin-off stories. But, you know darn, nobody's ever asked me to tell my story. So you're gonna get some stuff like this that may not be pertinent, but it will help you understand who I am.
AS: It's beautiful. That's right. Would Timothy be a Saint Timothy? Do you know?
CG: I don't think so. I think Timothy would be more like a minomoni [unclear] duke—a traditional spiritual helper, even though my mother was not avowedly or publicly involved in any traditional Anishinaabe spirituality. The other thing that I suppose I'm gonna tell you is important to me, because it gives me at least some connection here to the Anishinaabe community. My grandfather, Joseph Evan Carson, was the first white child born in Bemidji. His father and Uncle ran Carson Brothers Trading Post. And there's a whole story there that should be told.
AS: Okay.
CG: But, when my grandfather was a preschool aged child, Shaynowishkung, if you know Bemidji you know about the statue in Bemidji of Shaynowishkung, Chief Bemidji. You know that story?
AS: No.
SP: He's across from Paul Bunyan! I didn't know his name or that there's a story, but I know exactly..
CG: Shaynowishkung. There's a new statue, a beautiful bronze statue, done by a Montana, actually I think he's from Washington… but, he lives in Montana. Sculptor, that was commissioned by the city of Bemidji, after much argument and debate and years of planning. So, if you wanna know the story of the Anishinaabe in Northern Minnesota you should drive by the Shaynowishkung statue some time. But, Shaynowishkung was an Anishinaabe man who lost his wife and some of his children and moved to the wilderness around what became Bemidji. And, he lived there and tried to put his life together after grieving the death of his Anishinaabe wife, and white people began moving to the area and he began helping them. Even though ultimately it resulted in him losing his own land and home and being displaced and everything. He just kept helping white settlers. And he was well loved for hat. That's why there's' a statue of him there in Bemidji, because he helped, he helped white people and they remember that. So, he came into Carson Brothers Trading Post often for routine supplies. And, one day he came in, and as usual set his musket up against the wall. And, my grandfather walked over and grabbed the musket and of course those guns were loaded. And, Shaynowishkung came over and just read my grandpa the Riot Act  [confirm, unclear what “Act” Gardner is referencing], and my grandpa cried. And, Shaynowishkung  probably knelt down, I don't know, but he comforted my grandfather and that began a friendship. And, what happened eventually is, not my great-grandfather but his brother, my great uncle, married one of Shaynowishkung's daughters—Mary. And so, we married into the Shaynowishkung family. And, Evan Carson, my grandfather, stayed good friends with Shaynowishkung through his life. He was obviously much older than my grandfather. But, when Shaynowishkung died he had a Western will. And in his will he willed that musket to my grandfather.
SP: [Sullivan laughing] Oh, that's beautiful!
CG: So, and it was on display in Bemidji for many years—lent by my uncle. He died, and my oldest cousin, Nule Carson [confirm name], decided he wanted it back. So, my cousin has it now. But, I am connected to Leech Lake, and really to White Earth by that story. And so, you wanted me to tell you about my past and so I'm telling you about my past. That story is known to a few people in the Beltrami County Historical Society and to my own family. And a couple, two and a half months ago, my wife Gale and I, and my cousin Nule and his wife Barb—who drove on short notice all the way from Kalispell, Montana— got to meet Donny Hedbird [confirm name], the great great grandson of Shaynowishkung. And, got to meet a couple from Texas who are from Mary and Elle Carson [confirm name], heritage—descendents of Shaynowishkung. So, we all got together and had supper in Bemidji. Met them for the first time. So there ya go! That's history and that's oral stories. So, it isn't directly related to your book but now you know more about who I am.
AS: Exactly, thank you. So, what was your path to becoming a medical doctor then?
CG: I don't ever remember a time when I didn't talk about wanting to be a doctor and a minister. That's what I said as a little kid, and it used to amuse my mother. My grandmother took it seriously. And, that's just how it was. But, I'm quite sure that it had to do with my parents and their health problems. I don't remember my father. The only thing that I remember about my father is the smell of his pipe tobacco, he was a pipe smoker. Not, a traditional Anishinaabe pipe smoker, a Western pipe smoker. So, I remember only the smell of his pipe tobacco and I don't remember anything about his health problems. But, my aunt Grace was a legal secretary in Saint Paul, and she got pro bono help from her employer to try to get us some benefits since my father was millwright. Fell off the ladder at work when he was working, in a situation that called into question responsibility of his employer. Anyway, it didn't work out. But when I got older I got to read that. My family got no benefits. And I'm sure, I probably as a kid heard my mother and grandmother talk in distress about how they were gonna survive. And, my mother's breast cancer metastasis was a horrible thing. I do remember as an eight and a half year old kid, standing by my mother's wheelchair in our little rented home in Eden Valley, Minnesota and watching her have a seizure. And, she would come out of the seizure, look at me, and cry. She couldn't talk, but she would just cry. And I remember being very angry at her doctor. Not specifically, not knowing him, not anything. But, just angry at the doctor for letting my mother die, and I'm sure that there was some anger in me. And, I'm sure I decided that I was gonna grow up and become a doctor and fix everything and cure cancer and make the world better. I grew up and became a doctor and spent, I've spent over forty years now, and I realize that you can't fix everything and that bad stuff does happen. And that, that doctor probably did everything he could to help my mother at a time when there was no Affordable Care Act and there was very little support system. And that, my mother was lucky to have anywhere to go like the Anoka State Hospital. No one ignored her and no one did anything wrong. But, I'm sure that my experience as a child, and knowing about my parents' fates, probably gave me an exceptionally strong motivation to not give up and to succeed. I went through a church school system, the seventh adventist system. My grandmother became an adventist when I was eleven, and I joined the adventist church along with her. I am no longer a seventh adventist because of my own personal experience of noting administrators in that church, promulgate subtly the idea that if people didn't believe like adventists they would not go to heaven. And, you know, there are a lot of wonderful adventist people, I'm not telling you the story to condemn that, but I left that particular church's politics and ideology for that reason. But, they have a very strong commitment to health care based on compassion, based on Christian values, based on the beatitudes, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. And so, I went to boarding school. I went to adventist boarding school right on through college and medical school because I got accepted at the seventh adventist medical school Loma Linda University in Southern California, and I did my training there. And then, I came back and did my residency in family practice at Hennepin County medical center in Minneapolis. And then, my wife Gail and I achieved my dream of becoming a family doctor in rural Northern Minnesota. We moved to Park Rapids. We spent eighteen years there, but due to a number of things, I reached the point where I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe history. And, I discovered that I have actually a few drops of Anishinaabe blood. The old joke about nose bleed Indians, I mean no disrespect, I have to tell it on myself. I try to avoid fist fights 'cuz if I get punched in the nose I'm gonna lose my Anishinaabe blood in the first thirty seconds. But I do have some blood, it's from Bowantan [unclear] from the Salto [unclear] Anishinaabe —the Sioux band, the Sioux Saint Marie band. And so, I wanted to connect with my Anishinaabe heritage, and the stories about marrying into Shaynowishkung's family. And so, on relatively short notice I made the decision and Gale supported me, and we left our job in Park Rapids and came here. And we've been here for twenty years, and every day has been a joy. Because I can joke with people, and then talk with them about spiritual things, and then talk with them about tribal health business, all in the same conversation as perfectly fine. So, I've found a lot of what I was looking for. Learned a lot about Anishinaabe spirituality and also been able to help. And so, that's my medical background in being here.
AS: That's fantastic. Did you always wanna be a family doctor?
CG: I went through some struggles my last year of medical school. I thought about becoming a pathologist, but I'm red green color blind so that pretty much checks off looking at microscope slides. I thought about becoming a psychiatrist. Forty years, I've learned that basically family doctors are unlicensed psychiatrists in much of what we do. So, I also thought about being a pediatrician, but in family practice you get to take care of kids and families. So, ultimately I decided for family practice. But those other thoughts certainly went through my mind in the intense last year of medical school trying to make some decision and to find some match.
AS: Did you ever have interest, or I mean did you ever have experience with addiction or a personal connection? I wanted to kinda transition to... did you have experiences in your life that have later influenced you?
CG: Not during my childhood. My grandmother... certainly as a historian you must know about Carrie Nation?
AS: Mhm, yes! [Laughing] I teach about it!
CG: When I was in third grade I watched my grandmother who weighed a hundred bounds soaking wet, bodily throw a drunken 200 pound man out of our apartment who had wandered into the apartment. So, my grandmother was abused by her step-father when she was a teenager back in the late 1800s. And, my grandmother made it clear to me when she said that at age 13 if she had been strong enough and tall enough to get her step-father's gun off its mount on the mantle, she would've killed him. So, that's a pretty harsh thing to say. My grandmother wasn't a violent person. She was a devout Christian, and believed in forgiveness and everything. But she also told me that story. So, he was an alcoholic. And, people in the throws of active alcoholism like other drug abuse, can do things they would never do if they were in their right mind and with good judgment and impulse control and everything. So, that's my family connection, but not in my immediate family. As I said, we ended up living in the projects from the time I was middle school aged until the time I went away to college, and I still lived there came home from college. So, we saw the effects of chemical abuse in the families that were our neighbors and friends in the projects. So, we saw that, but my grandmother was a very gentle woman who was iron fisted when it came to anything related to alcohol abuse, or any other drug abuse. And, white [unclear]  people didn't mess with my grandma. And didn't try to argue with her about that. So, on anything else she was very tolerant, understanding, and even often very progressive in many of her views. But, do not talk with her about any kind of drug abuse being okay. Don't even try! So, that's my background. And I began to of course in high school learn about kids who got kicked out of boarding school for going out and getting drunk. And then, in college learned about kids who got into all kinds of trouble. I was always involved in the seventh adventist church school system and they also had no tolerance whatsoever. And didn't often, you know, in the sixties and seventies didn't often offer much harm-reduction focused sympathy on young people who were abusing drugs. They just got booted. So that was, you know, kind of a harsh and fairly one-sided view, but that was my growing up view. And then when I got to medical school all of a sudden, my relatively protected childhood was ended as I got involved in clinical work, taking care of patients, and studying the science of substance abuse, and the damages it could do.
AS: Do you have children?
CG: No, my wife and I were never able to have children. And it was a spiritual and emotional ethical debate for us. But what we ended up deciding to do was number one, to throw our lives into our professions. My wife's a dietician, and she did dietetic consulting in all the years in Park Rapids. And then, did dietetic consulting here. And as a historian, you should know this little fact that is not trivial. My wife, Gail Gardner, developed the diabetes Bingo game. which is now very popular, both in places like Oklahoma and other places where there are reservations, and also places where there aren't reservations. She and her assistant Paulie Nyson [confirm name] developed a game based on bingo that teaches good diabetes self-care. It was developed right here about sixteen seventeen years ago. And, a printing company out of Fargo Moorhead area, printed up the games. And, a number of them have sold. My wife hasn't made any money on it, it belongs to the tribe since she developed it as an employee, but she helped to develop diabetes bingo. So, we threw our lives into our work, and also we decided we would rescue big dogs. I always wanted a big dog. When I was in medical school, one of my classmates and his wife went away for holidays. Gail and I couldn't afford to do that. And they asked us to take care of their Saint Bernard Golden Retriever mix—Ginger. A wonderful gentle dog. And we weren't going anywhere, so we took care of Ginger. And I took her for walks in the neighborhood when I hadn't been out in the neighborhood very often cuz I was busy studying. And, one of the first walks we were taking, out from an unfenced yard that was about a foot and a half higher than the sidewalk, came a full sized Great Dane running right up. And, I, you know my life passed before my eyes. And then I thought, my god Fred will kill me. This dog is gonna kill me and then kill Ginger, and if I wasn't dead already Fred'll kill me when he got back. And the dog came up to me and...Pardon me, I respect your space, but this is [acting out the scene]... I'm a storyteller! The dog came up to me just like that and went [licking sound]. [All laughing]. And as I was laughing, and wiping my face off, I said to myself, ""Damn I'm gonna have a Great Dane someday."" So, after we moved to Park Rapids, in 1981, a few years later we adopted our first Great Dane, Chuckie. Who was a mis-breed of the breeder. He had a slightly short jaw, and the breeder couldn't sell him for big money, and so we adopted him for less than big money. And he died at three and half of osteosarcoma. Great Danes get spinal cancer. He died of osteosarcoma Christmas week, when he was three years old. And Gail and I, amidst oceans of tears and anger against fate, said we'd never adopt another dog. And one month later we got a call from a couple in Osage: ""We heard your Great Dane died. We have a Great Dane named Sarah. And, she's been running the neighbor's cattle. We're farmers too. We're not willing to fence her. Our neighbor came over and just said, 'You know folks, I love you guys, you're wonderful neighbors. But next time Sarah runs my cattle I'm getting out my deer rifle.' And so, would you take Sarah?"" And Gail and I looked at each other. We had said never again will we have a dog, we're not gonna go through that kind of grief again. So, we took Sarah, and we've kept it up through the years. So we've had eight or nine Great Danes and other breeds. And we also had cats for a while. But, Sarah was our general. Sarah had a higher IQ than me, I'm sure. Not that mine's that high, but hers was well-higher. And she, if we had let her run free, she would've organized all the dogs in the neighborhood into an army. And she was the general. Our neighbor was the Becker County canine officer deputy, and he kept his canine at home. And when the dog wasn't working, it got to run free. And the day I brought Sarah home, she was indignant about being on a leash, and she and I were trying to work that out. And the neighbor's dog came running over to introduce himself, and Sarah yanked the leash out of my hand, turned around, and my god.... Sigourney Weaver would have been less terrified of Alien than the snarl that Sarah offered that dog! And she chased the police dog back into his yard. And then she turned to me and looked at me like, ""Well let's get this over with."" So, I picked up the leash and started walking down the road, and that dog came back out again. You know, head down, tail down, crouched, and tried to walk up to Sarah and make amends. And she turned around snarled and chased him back into his yard, and he damn well never into our yard again! So that was, Sarah, our second Great Dane. And she was wonderful. She lived almost thirteen years, which is exceptionally long for a Great Dane. And she enriched our life with laughter and tears and wonder at her brilliance and her organization, and that's how we became dog rescuers. And we specialized in Great Danes for years. But, our last great dane a few year ago, Reggie, had congenital hypothyroidism. And by the time I convinced the vet to do a thyroid profile on him, ""Listen Gardner. You're not a vet! You're a family doctor. Your problem is you feed him too much."" He weighed 279 pounds. And when, the vet finally said, ""Well, bleep! I guess you were right and put him on thyroid medicine."" He got down to a svelte 212 pounds. But, when he developed serious heart failure at five years of age, Gail and I couldn't lift him anymore. so we, decided we better rescue smaller dogs. So, we now have a couple of Australian Shepherd Great Pyrenees mix dogs, that weigh about 60 pounds each. And they have double merle syndrome, which renders them partially blind and deaf. And we got them from a shelter in Southern Minnesota, who got a call from a shelter in Oklahoma that was a kill shelter, that said: [Feigning a Southern accent] ""Would y'all send someone down and get these dogs, we don't wanna kill 'em they're such nice dogs."" And so, Gail and I always tease people up here and say, you know our dogs bark with an Oklahoma accent. But they came to a Minnesota non-kill shelter. We found out about them on the internet and went down and got em. I'm sorry, but you're a historian, and you like hearing stories and I'm a story teller, so! [All laughing]
AS: I do so... Okay, so we should move on.
CG: Yeah, those are our children. But we should move on.
AS: That's great, that's fantastic. So, why don't we talk about at what point... well why don't you tell me what your job here is exactly. And, if it's changed. Like, what did you start here, and what are you now?
CG: My job now is, I am the medical director of the tribal health department. That is not the top position. My boss is Pat Butler, RN-BSN-PHN. She was the long time director of public health nursing here. And when the predecessor director of health services left, she took over that job. So, she's my boss. But, I'm the medical director. And I'm the medical director of the White Earth ambulance service, a rural ambulance service that does 700-900 runs a year. Far, rural, long-run times. Difficult, low-budget, lot of challenges, and a lot of overdose calls. And, a couple of years ago I became the chair of the White Earth research review board. The White Earth tribal council, now called the reservation business committee, decided in the wake of Havasupai Incident, do you know about that?
AS: No.
CG: You should read about that. It isn't about drug abuse, but it's about abuse of power. A researcher from Arizona State University got the agreement of the Havasupai Nation, that live in the Grand Canyon, to allow blood to be drawn to do genetic research on diabetes. And, it was all fine and good, and the consents were signed. But, several years after the study was done the lead researcher allowed frozen blood samples to be used by other researchers who were doing anthropologic, sociologic research. And ultimately, that was used to put forth the theory that the Havasupai people came across on the land bridge from Asia. And the Havasupai people were pissed as hell! That's against traditional, spiritual, historical viewpoint of how we originated on Turtle Island. And, they didn't even tell the Havasupai anything about that. But, a research review board member of the Navajo research review board, was reading and discovered this article and said, ""How did they get any Indian people to agree to that?"" And followed through, and found out what had happened. She told the Havasupai tribal council, and they took Arizona State University to court and won the case. Got a substantial monetary damage from Arizona State, and it was very embarrassing. Arizona State administration felt terrible. That's not what they set out to do, or how they wanted to do it. But, it all just happened by the taking the easiest route. And so, in the wake of that, our tribal council decided we better have a research review board and institutional review board. And so, it was established two years ago. And, I became a member, and I got voted in as the chair. And so, we're dong that work here now too. So that will inform you about my extra caution. So that's what I do now. But I came here in 1999, my first act as an employee after being hired by the IHS clinic, was to call in sick [laughs]. You should laugh at that!
AS: I am.
CG: Gail and I moved directly from Park Rapids to here, no time off. We did our furniture moving and everything evenings and weekends. And, two days before I was to finish work there and start work here, I ruptured two disks in my back. My left leg went paralyzed and I ended up with an emergency neuro surgery. So, I called in sick. But, and I was here to work in a week cuz I was scared I'd lose my job. And now, I have to tell you another story. You can just slap me up when you're ready [Sullivan laughs] But, some historian should know this story. Poozy Hags [Confirm name], Clifford Hags. You know about tribal nicknames?
AS: Mhm, mhm. 
CG: Clifford was the director of evening housekeeping services at the clinic. And the week I started, my leg was still paralyzed! Took months for it to get better after the surgery. And I was dragging my shoe, and I had the kind of shoe that would make marks on the floor. And Poozy did the evening floor cleaning. And so, like the third day of work at the IHS clinic, I was sitting in my office doing insurance forms and paperwork, like family doctors do in the evening. And, in came this very Indian man. And he said, ""You must be Gardner."" And I stood up with my cane and limp, and said, ""Yes. I'm Carson Gardner. Nice to meet you!"" And he didn't even put his hand out. He looked at me and he said, ""You're making marks on my floor. You come out here and I'll show 'em to you. We'll get along just fine if you quit making marks on my floor."" And I had no idea that Poozy is one of the biggest jokers on the res, and the biggest story-tellers. And you know, if I'd have known him, I would've laughed and said, ""Ah c'mon Pooz."" But, he took me out, showed me the marks, and said, ""You go buy another pair of shoes!"" And so, I told Gail when I got home, and you know, I took it very seriously. I'm an OCD kind of a guy, and so I was very worreid about it. So we went to Fargo, went to Penny's, I bought a pair of shoes, and I insisted to the sales person that I put them on, get up, and find the nearest linoleum on the store and rub my shoes. And my wife Gail tells me that while I was doing that, the salesman turned to her and said, ""Does he do stuff like this often?"" And Gail said ""Yeah, all them time."" So, I bought the shoes, I came back, I showed Poozy, and then he got a big grin, and said, ""Ah, we're gonna get along great!"" And Poozy became my secret agent here. He was the evening housekeeping lead who did the floors. But he would come in, and we would trade stories during his break. And I'm sitting there anyway, not being paid for doing paperwork. So, he would come in and tell me a story. But then, he'd say, ""By the way Gardner, one of these days ‘so-and-so's’ gonna come in for some little thing, and you need to know that they're having trouble with a heroin habit. And you should see if you can figure out a way, don't tell 'em I told you, but see if you can figure out a way to get 'em to talk about it, ‘cuz they need help."" So all the years I worked at IHS, Pooz was my secret agent in the community. He was as much a healer as any of the rest of us, snd maybe more so. ‘Cuz he could get away with that, and to hell with HIPAA and all that. Don't every tell anybody I said that. You may have to erase that. There may need to be a small blank on the... 
AS: You just mean it… you mean it, in a kind of philosophical way. 
CG: So, that's what I did first. That's what I did first, from '99 until 2011, and then I retired. And my retirement lasted three months and I got hired here, and I've been working here ever since. And I will probably keep on working for any number of reasons. Probably the most important one is a statement that I only heard verbalized recently, but I realize rapidly became my own personal unstated prayer: ""Creator help me to live in a way today that will make my ancestors proud."" I just heard that recently, but actually a lot of the stuff we all do here, is based on that. My boss, Pat Butler, in department head meetings, again and again says to us, ""Just remember people, we have to do things twice as well here as anybody else to be considered equal."" And so, if you look at the Western administrative records, you'll see that White Earth has developed many best practices pilot programs. And it's because of people like my boss Pat Butler, who believe that, yes we do have to do things twice as well as everybody else to be considered equal, so let's damn well get busy and do it that way! 
AS: That's great. So, you mentioned you, that you know that Poozy told you about someone with a heroin habit. Was that the first time you had heard about it here? And then, when did it start kind of becoming part of what people were talking about?
CG: When I interviewed here, which was just a couple of weeks before I was hired, I called Howard Hayes, the medical director of the IHS clinic. When I decided ethically and spiritually it was time for me to investigate working on an Indian reservation, I called him, he answered. And I said, ""Hi Dr. Hayes, my name's Carson Gardner. I'm a family doctor in Park Rapids, not too far from you. And I was wondering if you had any job. And he said, ""When do you wanna start?'"" So, I went for an interview, and he took me around—nice man. But he said, when we did the interview, he took me into the Pine Point, little Pine Point clinic, he took me to NATUA, and in the car he said, ""You know Carson. The Anishinaabe cure will test you. Just the first day someone will come in and want narcotic pain medicines, and you need to know what your own personal ethics and values are on that issue because we do have problems with that here. And, I'm not telling you you shouldn't prescribe pain medicine, but you need to know that you will be tested. People will always come to the new doctor here. People are struggling with substance abuse and will always look for the easiest source. Howard said, ""I'm not criticizing our citizens, I love them, I'm here too. But, you will need to develop your own ethics and your own values and your own decision making process on that because some people will push you very hard to get narcotics."" And so, I guess, in my interview a few weeks before I started here that's what I learned. And then I came and started seeing patients and saw that it was true. And, I was probably one of the most conservative prescribers of narcotic pain medicine. But, after a few years we all realized we needed to take a more aggressive step in standardizing our approach. So, we developed a chronic pain management program at White Earth in the early twenty-first century, where we all sat on a committee, all of us medical prescribers at the clinic. And, we developed a pain contract. And, we developed policy and procedure. And, we developed random drug testing policies. And, we developed policies on what to do if a person tested positive, and policies on what would be the criteria for second chances, and what would be criteria for release from the chronic pain management program and everything. So, we did that here, and we certainly used resources. You know, other places, we looked at their policies and prodcueres as templates. But we did that in the early twenty-first century here, because we, like many other IHS clinics, had to use locums doctors to fill in. And the locums doctor from elsewhere might have a whole different view on prescribing...
AS: What's a locums doctor?
CG: Locum tenans doctors. That's I guess latin, and I haven't looked it up, but it's a doctor who specializes in doing fill-in work. All they ever do is fill in for other clinics. They go and work two months at White Earth, and then they have two months off to go sailing, and then they go and work two months at Pine Ridge, and then they go work two months in Oklahoma, and...
AS: Is it mostly through IHS?
CG: No, no.
AS: Oh, okay, but it can be anywhere, but?
CG: Yeah, it could be anywhere...
AS: But once you're in that network.
CG: I'm just using Native American examples. But there are locums doctors that that's their own choice. They want to work very hard for a few months, and then have several months off to not do medical stuff. And, you know, a busy family doctor finds that attractive sometimes. But, locum doctors have no context, and they have their own set of rules. They can come into an IHS clinic, and if there is no policy on it, they will do whatever they think is right. And, it isn't always necessarily conducive to managing responsible opioid prescribing. And so, the chronic pain management program helped to better standardize the policies and procedures for locums physicians. And of course, while we were doing that Clinton and his team were being formed. And I won't tell Clinton's story, but he started consulting here from a harm reduction program in the Moorhead area. This is Clinton's home, but he was working there in harm reduction, came here to help out, and he will tell you the story about how there was a Hepatitis C cluster here in our community that sort of was the eye opener that helped community leaders to realize we needed a harm reduction program. And, he'll tell you the story on that, but harm reduction was being started on that basis at the same time we were starting a chronic pain management program policy and procedure at the clinic.
AS: And this is around 2011?
CG: No.
AS: This is before?
CG: Clinton will tell you, it was, I don't remember what year. But probably, in the early 2000s. Sue, do you remember? It had to be...
SP: Maybe around 2006, 2007? Somewhere in there.
CG: Yep. And so, it was probably about that same time. 2006, 2007. Maybe even 2005... when we started developing our chronic pain management program. I retired in 2011, but the chronic pain management program had been going for a number of years there prior to that.
AS: So, you retired for a few months and then...
CG: I retired in 2011.
AS: And then you came back?
CG: And, I got hired here by Monty Fox who was the director of health services at that time. So, that's why I joke about my retirement lasting three months.
AS: Right. So it was still like, 2011?
CG: But I became a desk jockey. I hung up my stethoscope in 2011, and that was painful. I still see old patients here, who say, ""Damnit Gardner, why don't you come back and take care of patients at the clinic?"" And I always smile, and acknowledge the joys of clinical practice, but I have been a desk jockey here and administrative physician since 2011.
AS: So, besides the chronic pain management plan, how's the public health and the medical system here approached the opioid epidemic? Could you describe how it first started, and what it became?
CG: A couple of things happened to raise my consciousness, and I regret that I didn't get to meet Sue at that time. But Sue, undoubtably was working with Clinton at that time. Clinton and his harm reduction team, Minus Bala, Karen, Keller, and not Rachel Lawfranir. [confirm names] She's on the team now, but she wasn't on the team then. But, the harm reduction core team brought Sarah Gordon here. Do you know Sarah Gordon?
AS: Yeah.
CG: Yeah, I hope so. If you haven't interviewed her, you pardon my french, damn well better!
AS: I'm going to [laughs], I'm going to.
CG: You better, you better!
AS: She's on my list.
CG: Because, she came up here to talk about harm reduction, and specifically to talk to medical providers. And I was one of the few who attended that talk, but she showed the video produced by anypositivechange.org, you should know about them they're out of Chicago. Do you know them?
AS: Mhm.
CG: Have you seen their video?
AS: No.
CG: You should watch it, it's on their website. I can tell you exactly what happened. I had been very conflicted. Not about ethics, and responsibility, and compassionate care, but about how far I should participate in harm reduction. But in that video that's still available on their website—I checked it a year ago—they're still showing it. They use primarily people suffering from active substance abuse, and not actors in that video. And, one of the scenes in the video, a young woman is sitting—calm, well-dressed, alert—and saying ""I got clean and sober, but my man is still doing heroin. And, I want him to quit, but you can't quit for anybody else. And so, I carry a naloxone kit, because if he's dead he can't recover, can he?"" And the video goes [mimics ""swooshing"" sound effect], to black. And I couldn't sleep that night. And I thought really hard about that. And I thought, okay, I have been a compassionate family doctor, and I support good care, but I haven't been active in harm reduction. And, it's probably time I get active in harm reduction. And so, it was Sarah Gordon, and Clinton, and Mina, and Karen, and that video—which you should watch—that was the turning point for me. That's when I got involved saying to Clinton, what can I do to help? And shortly after that, one of our child welfare workers gave a talk at a community forum meeting, and said, ""I just want you guys to know that last year we had twenty babies from White Earth that had narcotic withdrawal syndrome, and we damn well need to do something about it."" And, it was a shock in the community, and we had more meetings and said you know we need a treatment program specialized to helping our pregnant moms who are struggling with substance abuse, but can we do that? And so, medical minded people like me sat down and thought about it, and did our OCD thing, and wrote out timelines and flowsheets and said, at a meeting in 2013, late 2013, ""Well I think we can put this together. We can do it, but it'll take us about a year, maybe a year and a half to have it together."" And, Tara Mason, our tribal secretary treasurer, was at that meeting. And she stood up, and said, ""Okay, it's December now. I want this program open and taking clients in June."" And then she walked out of the room. And then we looked at each other and said, ""Well hell! Nobody told us we couldn't do it!"" So we were open by June taking clients. And the mom's program is still open, and it's won Minnesota state awards, and it's won some national awards. And so, that was the other thing, they asked me to put together a debate position on the negative side 'cuz no one would do that. They had some nurse practitioners come up from the Twin Cities and present the positive position: This is why we should have subaxone treatment program for pregnant women on the White Earth reservation. Well, we need someone to argue the other option so Gardner why don't you put it together. That's your job. And I, put together a lot of information, decided I really couldn't argue the negative position, 'cuz it needed to be done. So, that was the first active role. And then in 2014, my boss Pat Butler said to me, ""You know we have a lot of overdoses. You know that because you're the ambulance medical director. We need to start teaching nalaxone rescue."" ""Well, I uhm, uh, uhm..."" ""Put together a program! I want to get going here in the next few months."" So, in early 2014, and I guess the motivation was I had told her that the Minnesota legislature was reviewing what became Steve's Law and about to pass it. And that's when she said, ""We need to be teaching nalaxone rescue. We don't have to have state support, we're a sovereign nation, but it'll be good to have state support, so why don't you put it together?"" So, the ambulance manager Devon Green and I, put together a teaching program. And I went back to Pat, and to the tribal council and said, ""You know, we're having overdoses. And you know, we're attending funerals here. And so, we need to do this."" And that was at the time the Minnesota legislature, I think they passed it as of July 1st, but they weren't gonna implement it until late August or early September. And I, I said to Pat, ""You know it's silly, I've got the program ready. We could start teaching. No experience, but we could start teaching. The sooner we do it the better, but according to Minnesota legislature we can't start."" And Pat said, ""Let me talk to the tribal council."" And, like three days later they passed a resolution saying that we should start teaching and giving out nalaxone immediately, which for me, I'm not licensed by the tribe I'm licensed by the state of Minnesota. And I thought, holy hell. If I do this, and some legislator gets pissed at me, they could yank my license, or have the Minnesota health department sanction me. And I, talked to Pat about it. We looked at each other, and we said, well they wouldn't dare! The tribal council would raise such a racism argument that they would get backed against the wall. So, we went ahead. We started teaching nalaxone rescue here a month before the actual implementation of Steve's Law. Of course, it worked out fine. And we met, Clinton, Matt, and I, eventually Matt Luxey Read Holtum [unclear] and you know, made that connection and all the wonderful good that has been able to happen here. So, I haven't compiled the statistics for the last month, but as of a couple of months ago, and believe me there is no spiritual implication for this, so don't even think about spinning that. But, as of a couple months ago, we had trained 666 ""nalaxoners."" [Sullivan laughing]. And better than that, and that's ambulance service training, but about a year and half ago the ambulance service and harm reduction said, we really should get together and do team teaching. The ambulance service has done classes for groups of employees, and for behavioral health therapy group members. And harm reduction has done individual one-on-one counseling, so ten to fifteen minute individual training. Gardner's class and hour and a half with all the science and ""Oh god... Garner's gonna talk again."" But, actually people like it. They become the ambassadors to correct misconceptions about, ""Oh overdose? Give em, shoot up milk!"" Or, ""Throw 'em in the snowbank!"" Or, ""Put 'em in the shower!"" Or, you know, our students from our group classes get to help correct misconceptions, and say, ""No, no. This is what you do. You have to see if they don't respond to pain. You have to breath for 'em, cuz nalaxone won't work if they aren't breathing. And then you have to give 'em the nalaxone, and then you have to keep breathing for 'em 'til they wake up. And this is how long it'll take, and this is what you can expect."" So, the ambulance service and our tribal first responders, who are the security officers at the casino, have a 120 nalaxone saves since the summer of 2014, 120! And twenty of them are the first responders at the casino. They're basic emergency medical responders, not EMTs, not paramedics. But, they came to me in the fall of 2014 and said, ""Doc, we'd like to get in on this too. We see overdoses at the casino."" So, I'm gonna guess that with twenty saves, that first responder group is probably one of the premier first responder groups in Minnesota for nalaxone rescue. But they came to me, to us! To Devon Green and me and said, ""Will you train us? We wanna get started."" So, but then you'll talk to Clinton and he'll explain to you, that Clinton and I, and Mina, and Karen, and Rachel Lawfrenir, estimate that for every one save, the ambulance has, citizen harm reduction trained rescuers have done three of four, maybe five. So, we're pretty solid on estimating our 120, is probably 480. So, we probably have pretty close to 500 saves, and with all the individual trainings that harm reduction has done we have probably trained, we have certainly trained over 2500 nalaxone rescuers on White Earth reservation. And, ""Isn't that enough Doc?"" ""No!"" We will not stop, I like the quote from the director of the Baltimore Maryland health department who said, ""My goal is to have everyone over twelve years of age who lives in the city of Baltimore trained as a nalaxone rescuer."" So, our goal is, we'll stop training when we have a year of no overdoses at all. We'll consider stopping training, we might not even stop then, but we ain't stopping training until we have a whole calendar year of not one single overdose on White Earth land. And you know what, the truth of the matter is, as we struggle with the peaking of this opioid abuse epidemic, and the sinister introduction of fentanyl, and fentanyl cutting of heroin, that isn't gonna just happen like that [snaps]. So, we're gonna be doing nalaxone training and rescuing for a long time yet, and we will continue to do it as long as is needed.
AS: Would you, do you know, if it was pain pills that introduced heroin here? Is it the same narrative that we're hearing in most of the U.S. about the upsurge of heroin was because of pain pill addiction? That pain pill addiction started...
CG: I'm certainly sure that that's a factor. I'm not convinced that that's the primary origin of opioid abuse here. I don't have statistics for you, but I know the street level view point of the matter. We had a serious crack-cocaine problem here twenty years ago, and we've cycled through the various changes in drugs, substance abuse of choice, and everything. I believe that there was a small heroin problem here prior to the twenty-first century, but I have no doubt that pain management and prescription opioid use fueled a serious worsening here. So, I have no doubt about that. I don't have statistics on it. What I can tell you is, a year of two ago, the Minnesota health department put out statistics from 2000 to 2015 on county drug overdose deaths. Including the counties that shared with reservation land here- Becker, Mahnomen, Clearwater. And they estimated forty-five drug overdose deaths during those years- 2000 to 2015. And everybody I've talked to from tribal council to Poozy Hags, to everybody else says, ""Phew. That's a gross underestimate. We've had a lot more deaths than that."" Which has brought up the issue of busy old family doctors who are tired and have a desk stacked with insurance forms and death certificates and which one's gonna get more attention? And, what gets put on the death certificate? And, does the coroner take the time to say, ""Well you know, cardiac arrest. Yes, of course, but...
AS: This person was twenty-five...
CG: ""...This person was nineteen-years-old, or twenty-five years old, so, I'm gonna call old Gardner and say, 'You know Gardner I hate to be a pest, but you said this twenty-five year old died of cardiac arrest. Well, of course, that's the final mechanism but was there anything else that was a contributing factor or?'"" ""Well yeah, they were a heroin user."" ""Well, wouldn't you wanna put that on the death certificate Gardner?"" You know, that's hypothetical, but you get the idea.
AS: But, how things get lost.
CG: I'll insult myself and not somebody else. So, there has been a problem with struggling with substance abuse disorder here for quite some time. And it did include street heroin and other street opioids, but I'm certain that the 1990s concept of pain as the fifth vital sign, and articles from LA or New York about doctors being sued for providing inadequate pain control, and big pharma's advertising ""Oxycontin! No problem! You wont' have any problem..."" [sarcastic tone].
AS: Nobody gets addicted. Right.
CG: [Continues] ""Yeah, come have dinner. We'll buy you dinner, and wouldn't you like to prescribe Oxycontin?"" I'm sure that that had a lot to do with it. I came in 1999… yeah I'm sorry I talk too much.
AS: I'm just keeping track. No, you keep going!
CG: I came in '99 here, and as I told you, Dr. Howard Hayes warned me. There was a problem with prescription drug seeking, certainly was here. But I think, my opinion, working at IHS was, that we weren't necessarily the center of the problem. There were other physicians practicing, not associated with IHS, in fact, do you know the Lee clinic story?
AS: No.
CG: Dr. Lee, god rest his soul… 
AS: Was he here, around here?
CG: Graduated from a residency program in Fargo, and opened up several urgent care clinics that people could walk into any time, and prescribed tons of narcotics. You know, relatively speaking. And, ended up being charged with malfeasance and losing his license, and later committed suicide. So, very very sad story. Don't remember his first name, but… 
AS: Fargo. In Fargo did you say? Moorhead?
CG: Yeah, Dr. Lee. And the clinic I think is called the Seven Day Clinic. It's in Detroit Lakes, and it's near Menards. Sue, if you know Detroit Lakes. That was originally a Dr. Lee Clinic, and it got bought out by someone else after his untimely and sad death. And, ultimately.... Essentia bought it up because they believe in mitigating competition when they can, but they don't run it that way. They run it as a responsible urgent care clinic, but there were several clinics like that. And, Clinton will know about Dr. Lee. And I, you know, I didn't see any court records or any board of medical examiners' records. But, that was going on in the 1990s. And, I think that, very likely that situation helped to fuel a, you know, a serious habituation to opioids in this whole region. And you would have to look into that. I can't give you any authoritative history, but I, but I was here when that happened and we heard the stories about people saying, ""Oh I can go down to Lee's clinic, I can get as much 'oxy' as I want to. I can get as much 'vic' as I want to. What the hell's wrong with you IHS doctors?"" So, we heard that. And, apparently so did the North Dakota board of Medical Examiners. And so did the North Dakota judicial system. So, you may wanna look into that. It goes across the border. But, many of his urgent care clinics were through this area, rural Minnesota. In the 1990s. And, they were handing out 'oxys' and 'vics' like candy.
AS: Right, right.
CG: And so, isn't it nice for Gardner to blame someone else. There were various narcotic prescribing strategies by IHS doctors, but we had a solid core group from 1999 till about 2005 or 2006, we had no turnover in doctors and nurse practitioners. And, it was amazing 'cuz the whole IHS joke is, well you know, two years pay off your public health pay back, and then you leave. But we have the same group of five medical care providers, primary care, from before '99 until about 2005, 2006. And then it fell apart and people started leaving, and we got in short termers and locum tenens doctors, and it became more an issue with varying philosophies. But, from '99 when I cam until 2005 or 2006, we had dependable reliable team of primary care providers who were concerned about the issue and established policy and procedure to help minimize the risks of doing harm by opioid prescribing. So, I don't think in that time of '99 to early twenty-first century we were the primary cause, but we certainly saw the problem. And, yes we did prescribe. And I had, I had an individual who had pain issues. This is an interesting story. I'll try to leave out any identifying factors. So, here's the story. This was an individual who was a community member who had pain management issues. Who came in to see me, and I did prescribe narcotics for the individual for a period of weeks. And then, I realized that there were red flag signals here of inappropriate requests, and early refills, and suggestion of using in excess of prescribed doses. And so, I had a visit meeting with this individual and laid out the issues and explained to them that I was going to have to stop their narcotic prescription. And, they threatened to bring a gun to my yard! Now, I have to give you the perspective, I've been a family doctor for forty years, I've been threatened four times. Three of them were by white people in Park Rapids. So, don't think this is an ""Indian thing."" But, but this was an individual who was desperate and said something desperate. And, I reported it to the tribal cops and we looked at each other, and they shrugged and I shrugged. And you, know, no harm was done to me. And so, that happened, but that's not the end of the story because a week and half later I was on emergency call, and this individual came in having a profound severe heart attack. And I got to care for them, and I looked at my nurse and she looked at me, and I said, ""Ueah we're gonna care for this individual."" And so, we did care for that individual, and it was nip-and-tuck and the ambulance had to rush him to Fargo. And they ended up with fairly extensive sub-specialty management. And on that, that's all I'm gonna say. But here's the thing, I lost track. Ajd a few months later my nurse came to me and said, ""'Member 'so-and-so?'"" And I said, ""Oh yeah, I remember 'so-and-so.'"" And she said, ""Well 'so-and-so' is here and wants to talk to you.' And I said, ""Geez what do you think?"" And she was a community member here and she said, ""Oh yeah, you wanna talk to 'so-and-so' today."" So, so-and-so's put in the room, and I go into the room thinking, ""Okay, chapter two of the 'What's the matter with you damn doctors?'"" I walked in, the individual had come to me to apologize for threatening to bring a  gun to my yard, and to thank me for participating in the team that helped to save their life. So none of the three white persons in Park Rapids ever came back... [Amy and Sue laughing] and said I'm sorry. But, that individual did, so that's the whole story. But, that happened here. And I would guess that if you talked to everyone of us who had practiced at that time, each one could tell you some other story.
AS: Oh, almost every doctor has told me a story like that, yeah.
CG: So, that's mine and I tried to de-identify it as much as a I could.
AS: You did a great job.
CG: If you would make that into a big deal, I, you know some people who know, ""Well, I know who that is 'cuz I 'member about 'so-and-so's' heart attack and I 'member about this and such."" So...
AS: No, no, no.
CG: But, so those were the kind of things that were happening in the early twenty-first century. But I still maintain that narcotic prescribing at the IHS clinic was not the main problem that fueled the opioid abuse crisis here. I think there were other factors in play. We certainly did prescribe narcotics, and yes some of our patients did misuse them. But in the years that I was here, we proactively tried to be very careful. What we weren't good at was we weren't good at harm reduction. We didn't say, I'm going to have to stop your narcotic prescription, but I would like to have you talk to Clinton Alexander and Minus Bala [confirm names], and let's see if we can get you a substance abuse baseline assessment and some support here. And maybe we can work out some harm reduction help that will help you get through this. And I still wanna be your doctor. And you know, don't wanna have this end on a bad note, let me put together a team that will help you. We didn't do as good a job at that as we should back then. We're doing a much better job on that now. So, we had to grow up and learn about harm reduction. I told you about Sarah Gordon. I told you about the video. Profound turning point in my professional life was Sarah Gordon's visit and that video. And she will tell you I give her a hug every time I see her. I give her a hug and she laughs, ""You've already thanked me!"" But, that was a profound turning point in my professional and my personal life.
SP: Government lady! That's what she's known as up here.
AS: Government lady?
SP: [Laughing]. Government lady!
AS: So, what about, can we talk about medicine for opioid maintenance?
CG: Sure.
AS: And, and what have you, when did that, when did subaxone and probably, do you have, you don't have methadone...?
CG: No we don't.
AS: No, can you talk about how that fits into the story?
CG:  I was involved in doing basic research for the mom's program. We recognized that although we were determined to create a program that included traditional medicine wheel, spiritual healing, human services support, psychological counseling and support, substance abuse assessment and support....that we were going to need to develop a medically assisted treatment arm of the mom's program. And so back in late 2013, early 2014, I did the research along with others. I wasn't the only one, but I'm the OCD guy who in my next life is gonna be a medical librarian [Sullivan laughing]. So, I did the research, present it, and said, ""Look subaxone is what we need. We're not, you know, we have to move heaven and earth to open a methadone clinic here, but we can get a subaxone clinic open. You can find the staff who have some experience, or who can get the experience."" And, Julie Williams and Minus Bala who helped Julie Williams start the mom's program here agreed with that. And, Tara Mason, the tribal secretary treasurer, agreed with that. And, all the other members on the work-group agreed with that. And so, we went with a subaxone program. And it was the same thing that I've already told you. No one told us we couldn't do it. So we put the program together! And we didn't think too much about it. Except Tara wanted it by June of 2014, and so it was there by June of 2014- working well not working clumsily and ineffectively. And then, a year or so later people started coming and saying, ""How the hell didn't you get this program going out of nothing? Tell us how you did it!"" ""Well, no one told us we couldn't! We looked at the literature, saw what it would take, got the people, got the training, started it!"" So, you know, it would be good for you to talk to some of the mom's program.
AS: Yeah, I did meet Julie.
CG: I sound like I'm bragging, I'm not! I'm bragging up the White Earth philosophy that we can do this together. We have to be twice as good as everybody else to be considered equal, and we can do that. So that's how the mom's program got started. And, if you've talked to Julie, or do talk to her, or will talk to her, she'll tell you more of the detail. But, it became obvious to me and everyone else on the work-group that subaxone, buprenorphine nalaxone, was what we needed to use. And subutex without the nalaxone I think is an initially what was used. I'm not sure now. I am not a behavioral health employee, and the mom's program is a behavioral health program. Jerry Jaskin is the director of behavioral health. Pat Butler is the director of tribal general health services. So, I was the crossover consultant helper. And so, I know the literature now says there is not any likely harm from nalaxone, and so pregnant women could certainly take subaxone. But the tradition was to use subutex. But we got that started real fast, and made it work, and provided the traditional spiritual support and healing. Provided the human services support. Provided the substance abuse counseling. Provided child support, baby sitting. Provided good parenting training. Provided group therapy. Provided… everything Julie can tell you about. And, our program has worked very well, and we have served a lot of our equawa [unclear] our Anishinabe women who have struggled with substance abuse disorder, and who have been pregnant and needed help. And, many of them are now clean and sober and helping as counselors in our community and other places. So, that was one of the crossover points. I told you about the video. I told you about ""fade to black."" I told you about ""I didn't sleep well that night."" One of the big issues for me was medically assisted therapy 'cuz I had been resistant to that. I had supported what is still a very important tenet of the traditional viewpoint, and that is we can provide healing through medicine wheel traditional spiritual methods. And I still believe that, but even our traditional spiritual community are very gaetae [unclear] Anishinabe. Our very conservative, old-line traditional spiritual healing community, has come out in favor of the mom's program and what the MAT [confirm acronym] program is doing. What they have said is, ""Now, just so long as you don't do what Western medicine always does, damnit! They always leave us out and think that we're some kind of bizarre, extremist group. And you know, 'blah blah blah blah Western medicine and traditional healing could never work. ' Don't do that to us. We're here. Our medicine wheel healing works. You Western doctors need to understand that you're pretty good at curing stuff, but curing doesn't last. What we do is heal people. When you guys'll wake up and invite us to join the team, and help to heal, then your curing will last. And then we'll do some good."" And so, that's where we're at. We're working on that. I just got a call from out of the blue from an American Heart Association staff member in Minnesota, who has some American Heart Association regional funding and wanted to put on a conference fro Indian Health Service care providers and happened to call me because they have my name. And, like I always do, and have done for years, I said, ""Well you know, there are several things you could do. You know, you do a rapid heart attack response, that' great. You do rapid stroke response, that's great. You teach medical providers how to use a lucus to external compression device. That's great. But how 'bout this? Why don't you sponsor a healing counsel here and get together Western clinicians and traditional healers and have us all talk together as equals about how we can help with heart health on the reservation here?"" And that always ends the conversation. ""Ah well yeah, that sounds really nice... and well thank's for the call we appreciate it..."" [Sarcastic tone]. But this person said, ""You know, let me talk to my boss, but that sounds like a good idea."" I got an email back and said, ""I talked to the Minnesota AHA vice president here who's in charge, and they said we can do that!"" So I turned it over to our cultural director, Merlan Deegan [confirm name] who will follow up with it. But, you know I'm not gonna hold my breath. I've been saying this since about the year 2000. But actually, I know that person professionally, not personally, and when they say they're gonna do something, based on American Heart Association promise, they do it. So, we may actually have that after all these years, and that would be a very important advance here for Western medicine to invite traditional medicine with respect and humility, and listen to what traditional medicine says. And, you don't have time for me to continue on with this, but I was asked by Dennis Hisgun, one of the senior substance abuse counselors here, a traditional Anishinabe and Dakota healer and substance abuse counselor, and you should hear his story!
AS: What's his name?
CG: Dennis Hisgun Senior. H-i-s-g-u-n [spelling], Dennis. D-E-N-N-I-S [spelling].He's about almost eighty now. I'll have tell, I'll have to do the abbreviated story.
AS: Okay.
CG: But, Dennis asked me to put together a group of essays he could use to work with teenagers in recover to show them that traditional healing as a stature equal in value to Western medicine. And I thought, I said, ""Dennis okay I'll do it."" And I thought, ""Yeah I'll have a few..."" By the time I was done I had fifty-two essays! And I've, I keep a notebook now, and I've collected several other ones since then. I studied for a decade with a traditional healer, Wimba Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling], he's gone to the star world now. And, when I talk about Western medicine and traditional healing, I always point out to the audience, ""Wimab Okan Ogima [confirm name and spelling] came to me at the IHS clinic for Western medicine, and I went to him at his sweat lodge, because we believed it was good to combine the best of traditional medicine and Western medicine. Now, he's gone to the star world and I'm still here so I guess that tells you whose medicine worked best!"" [Sullivan and Purchace laughing]. And the audience always falls over laughing.
AS: That's great.
CG: But, he used to say to me, ""You know Gardner, I feel bad for you Western doctors. If you wanna develop a new medicine, you have to spend twenty million dollars to do the research. And then you have to spend forty million dollars to convince the FDA to okay it. All I have to do is ask Creator and the Healing Spirits what to do for my client, and then damn well do it!"" And we would laugh about that. But, then he would also say, ""You know the other thing that you need to think about Gardner is you Western doctors joke about placebo effect. You call it lying to the patient, but that's Creator teasing you. Because what placebo effect really is, is it's the inherent spiritual healing power that Creator has put into a human being. It's there. You look at your own Western research. Often a placebo effect works a third to a half of the time, and you call it lying. It isn't. It's Creator saying, that there is inherent healing power in a person that can be activated. But Gardner, you Western doctors aren't willing to admit that you have to believe in it for it to work. We believe in it."" And there was just a study that came out in the Western medical literature, I just read about it a month ago, and it talks about what's called ""open-label placebo studies."" And that's a whole new thing in Western medicine. Western researchers get people into the study and they say, ""We're going to do a study on this medicine 'triple crown barbecue sauce.' [Sullivan laughing]. We don't know if it works. It might not work at all. We don't know, but we'd like to do a study, would you be willing to try it?"" That's what they tell people, it's just sugar water. And people say, ""Yeah! I'd love to be in your study. You don't know if it's gonna work, have no idea? Not gonna hurt me?"" ""Nah it won't hurt you, but we don't have any idea it's gonna work. We don't have any reason to believe it'll work, but it was suggested and we'd just like to find out."" So, they give it to people and hell it works! A big percentage of the time! So, Western researchers are now saying, ""Maybe we should be doing open-label placebo studies because when people believe that the sugar water's gonna work, they get better, at a much higher rate than they do if they don't believe that they'll get better!"" And so, that's actually happening now in the Western medicine literature. So, okay here's Dennis Hisgun's story. Dennis comes from a family, Anishanabe and Dakota. He had a good stable childhood. Two parent family. I think his dad did farming, ranching. But when Dennis was about thirteen, his dad died in a traumatic accident, and it just broke Dennis' heart and he ended up as a teenager on Franklin avenue in Minneapolis and that's where I grew up- pretty near Franklin Avenue. So, I wonder if Dennis and I ever met each other. But, Dennis would overdose on various things—whatever drug he could get ahold of. Certainly alcohol, certainly other drugs. And many people up here and over in South Dakota from his Dakota relatives said, ""You know, just leave Dennis alone. you know, he doesn't wanna get better. He's never gonna make anything. He'll end up dying in an alley down there, and just leave him alone."" But one day, when Dennis came out of old Hennepin General after yet another overdose, there were a few Anishinabe men standing on the sidewalk: ""Hi Dennis, we're here to take you home."" ""I don't know you guys! Leave me alone!"" ""No, we're taking you home!"" ""Let go of me!"" ""Dennis, we're just like you. We're trying to stay sober and recover. And we're gonna, we rented a house on Franklin Avenue. We're gonna do this together."" ""Well, I don't wanna go with you! I don't have a job, I can't help!"" ""That's okay, we'll float you alone Dennis until you're feeling better and can get a job and help us out."" So, what're the chances that that would work? What is one human life worth? What is another chance worth? Dennis went with 'em cuz there was no HIPPA, he didn't have a choice. They grabbed 'em and they took him. But it was good. And Dennis got sober. He thought things over. He had the childhood, and the background, and the support that would help someone to get back into sobriety. And, he made that transition and he stayed there for a while—helped at the house. Then he came back up here, took an EMT class, became an EMT here for a number of years. He was an EMT here and helped save lives, and then he realized that Creator wanted him to be a substance abuse counselor, and so he got that training and became a substance abuse counselor here, and in the intervening more than forty years. He's number one, stayed clean and sober one day at a time. And number two, he has helped thousands of people make a start on the red road of sobriety. You can't get sober for anyone else, but you need someone there to help you when you're ready to make a try. And Dennis Hisgun Senior is the one, and so when I'm giving a talk and someone raises that, ""Ah c'mon Doc what's one life worth?"" I tell 'em Dennis' story—I got Dennis' permission. But you would need to get Dennis' permission to tell his story, but he gave me permission to tell it verbally [Amy laughing]. That's his story. If those guys hadn't grabbed him, he probably would have died in an alley. He will tell you, he had bad active addiction at that time to a number of drugs. But it took, and he dedicated his life to helping other people, and he's now almost eighty. He's still working part-time on the res. He helped the mom's program. He's helped our Oshki Manidoo center in Bemidji.  He's working right now with behavioral health. We're doing regularly scheduled peer support recovery classes. We have tribal certification authority to certify peer support workers, and we do the training, and he's on the team that does the training. So that's what one life is worth. If there hadn't been someone to say, ""Wait a second. We oughta give Dennis another chance. See if we can help him. He might do something good with his life."" He did, but if someone hadn't of stepped up with harm reduction help—it was homemade, but it was harm reduction
SP: That's right!
CG: You know Dennis probably would've died in an alley of liver failure and other overdose. So, you need to hear Dennis Hisgun's story. And, you have just heard it from me, but you really should try to talk to him.
AS: Oh definitely, definitely.
SP: Dennis was at the conference, the harm reduction conference in San Diego, with the mom's program.
AS: Oh really?
CG: Yeah, I think so. There's Dennis Jr. his son, who works here. And Dennis Sr. but he's in his late seventies.
SP: Jr…  how old is...  ?
CG:  He's a young looking man! He doesn't look like he's in his late seventies but he is.
SP: So, that that's the same Dennis that I met.
CG: Yeah, probably.
SP: Yeah.
CG: Yeah so, I love and honor him and wish I had met him many year sooner. But, Dennis' story to me is the story of what one life is worth when you step up with harm reduction help and you don't give up on someone and you offer them yet again, help.
SP: Harm reduction is home-grown.
CG: Yes, of course!
SP: It's the important piece about it.
CG: Of course! You're right! And I, I knew you'd love the story if you hadn't already heard it, but that's a story that should be heard. And Dennis tells it when he tells his own story, but he hasn't made a big deal out of it. It's never been published anywhere, and if I write it in an article I dub him ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling], which is the Dakota name for ""bear."" I don't use his name ""Dennis."" But I talked to him and he gave me permission to tell his story, so if I tell it like this I use his name. But if I write it, I use the name ""Mato,"" M-A-T-O [spelling].
AS: Okay, Okay. So, what... I think you've already answered my question about your ideas and philosophies about best practices. If there's anything else you wanted to add about that? 
CG: Best practices here… 
AS: Yeah what you've come… 
CG: … are what we need to do to help our fellow community members to find safer ways of living, and to find hope to heal the underlying generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences so that then they can receive long-term healing of the superficial issue of drug-abuse. Drug-abuse is a superficial issue, but it's a lethal one. But, if you don't offer red-road healing, if you don't offer healing of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences, then the superficial but lethal problem is going to continue. And, no I can't show you any community here where we have zero drug problem, but we are working very hard to offer healing for the underlying problems and trying to bring that to the front. It's always been in the background, but it hasn't been the front. And all of our tribal public health, behavioral health, harm-reduction, judicial organizations—a couple of years ago we started an adult drug court, we've had a juvenile drug court, restorative justice courts...
AS: Is that called the Circle Back Center?
CG: Circle Back is a, is an outpatient recovery maintenance group, therapy program for teens. But, it's connected with the adult drug court DIY—Dually Involved Youth Program—and the juvenile court program. So, they get referrals from juvenile court from the DIY program, and then Circle back can take kids just at their own request of their parents' request with no organizational referrals.
AS: Oh, Okay
CG: So, we're doing good stuff like that. But we, have been trying since 2013 when we opened the mom's program, to bring to the front the concept that we need to find ways to offer durable medicine wheel healing—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual—for the underlying wounds of generational trauma and adverse childhood experiences. And, when we do that, then we'll have a platform for effective long-term sobriety. So, those are the things in general that I think all our divisions and departments are working on, and we have a program that we call the Drug Task Force. Has Clinton told you about that?
SP: I don't think so.
CG: What the tribe declared a drug abuse emergency in 2011, or 2012—just around the time that I had my three month retirement and started working here—but shortly after the declaration the tribal council established the Drug Task Force. It is not a police group. It's a group where representatives of every division and every department get together and meet once a month, sit down at the table in the administration building—the big table—we all sit there and say, ""So what problems are we seeing in our community now related to drug abuse? What are the wounds? What is the healing that's needed? How can our programs work together across department and divisional boundaries to make things work?"" And certainly that was one of the motivations for getting the mom's program going, 'cuz it was that table where Tara Mason said, ""I want it open by June."" And walked out of the meeting. It was a Drug Task Force meeting. So, a number of our other programs in recent years have been based on that, and the cultural division director is the facilitator of that meeting, which is really good—Mike Larak [confirm name and spelling]. The police chief comes, representatives from drug court come—from substance abuse, from behavioral health, from tribal health, from harm reduction—but it's the cultural director of our nation that is the facilitator, Merlon Deegan [confirm name and spelling]. You should talk to him too. D-E-E-G-A-N [spelling], Merlan. He is a former cop, he's a former tribal policeman, who has traditional healing training in both Ojibwe and Dakota traditional healing. He's a nephew of Dennis Hisgun Sr. So there's a story there. And so Merlan is our cultural director, and he chairs that committee to help us all keep on task and focus on the fact that we need to provide medicine wheel healing for the underlying wounds of our people if we want to establish successful long-term sobriety strategies here. So… 
AS: Do you feel hopeful?
CG: Yes. Very much so.
AS: About the opioid epidemic? About it… 
CG: I do, but I don't feel hopeful for any quick-fix solutions. What we need is the work of the Drug Task Force, the work of the mom's program, the work of our MAT program, the work of our traditional cultural division. Merlan has spent a number of years struggling to work with a consultant, Roxanne Delille. She's a PhD level educator and an medaywan [unclear] woman, who works at Fond Du Lac College. And, she has been working with Merlan an a group of us, a work group, to develop a new employee orientation program. And as it stands now it's three four hours segments, that talks about the cultural history, the spiritual history, the history that the conquerers got all wrong, the history of work the White Earth nation has done to help its community members, and to help others, and the last section is being completed. And Merlan's hope with the support of our reservation business committee is that every new employee will get to sit in those sessions, and learn that history of ""Gawa ba be banicka"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. Confirm words for translation.]— ""the land of abundant white clay""—its history, its culture, a little bit about its language, its spiritual traditions. And, how they relate to issues today like drug abuse and like public health work, and human services work, and... Being a transportation bus driver! Being a child care worker! Being a whatever! Everybody's gonna get that. And, a commitment's been made to have all current employees attend that training too. So, that's a big deal for us. And that's work that Merlan has helped to keep on the front burner, and not to be forgotten about. Because that's part of that, you have to deal with the underlying issues. And, you have to acknowledge the hope that Anishinabe people have always had, but has often been distracted from by issues of colonization, issues of internalized oppression, issues of discrimination, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.. You know those lectures and that's not why you came here, but I will tell you two acknowledge phrases that you don't need to learn but you should know about. One of them is, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear. Confirm words for translation.] It took me a long time to learn that. I am not a fluent speaker, I've worked very hard to learn that, and here's why. Do you know what that means in English? This is what it means in English: ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" So, even if you don't ever learn any other Ojibwe, that's what you need to know as our working policy here, and not everybody can say that. I've worked hard to learn how to say that. "" Gaween......"" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. Confirm words for translation.] ""You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" And the ""you,"" is not Amy Sullivan or Sue Purchase, the ""you"" is the life. Okay? ""You cannot destroy me life. You cannot destroy one who has dreamed a dream like mine."" That is, an ancient Ojibwe saying from [unclear] Memorial. It applies right now to the drug abuse crisis. And, we're working on using that in our work here. The other thing you need to hear is this one. This is from Roxanne Delille,  who's helping with the employee orientation program. She taught us this one. I call these two sayings the ""Gaweens"" [Ojibwe. Confirm spelling of word for translation.] This one starts out with Gaween. ""Gaween...."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear. Confirm words for translation.] Also took me a while to learn that! What that means in English is, ""It is not without reason that I do this."" That is another Anishinabe saying. ""Oh geez, oh why did they burn that sage, I always think that smells like weed, you know? Why do they do that? Why do they... 'Joe! Look at putting down tobacco by a tree and there's food in that plane. Why do they do that?' That must be some aberration!"" ""Gawenn..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [unclear. Confirm words for translation.] It is not without reason that I do this. Merlan can explain, I can explain a little, Roxanne can explain, his team can explain, many of us who have learned can explain. There's a reason. A healing powerful reason, for each and every ceremonial thing we do here. And, I have to tell you this about smudging, this isn't why you came here, but we smudge a lot. Harm Reduction smudges a lot. You probably know that. Did you know that there are only 400 nerve receptor endings in the human nose for sense of smell? They're on a little piece of mucosa, about the size of a postage stamp in the back of the nose, 400! You've got hundreds of billions of neurons! I mean 400, that can't be very important. But, it is. Those 400 receptors are like a 400 character password. They can recognize more than a trillion different individual inputs, and those sense of smell receptor nerve endings are the only nerve endings in the entire human body that go straight into the brain. They don't go to the spinal cord, they go straight into the brain. And do you know where they go? They go right into the limbic system, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the part that's damaged by drug abuse and needs healing. And, do you know that Western researchers have discovered that human beings who can be given a brief meditational routine that helps to center them on healing thoughts will do much better in recovery, but it's very hard because in our text messaging, and phones, and blogs... it's very hard to get people to do that. That's what smudging does. The Anishinabe ""Seven Fires"" prophecy, more than a thousand years ago, actually warned the Anishinabe that drug abuse was coming, and said that there would be something to help. Smudging is a direct line into the human amygdala, to remind our brain centers of, ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. Confirm words for translation] So we smudge here. ""Gaween..."" [Speaking in Ojibwe] [Unclear. Confirm words for translation] ""It is not without reason that we do this."" It's part of our hope. So, that's my own eccentric version...
AS: No I don't think it's eccentric.
CG: ...but I'm pretty sure that people who are not as eccentric as I am, will agree with that. And that's one of my essays, in my group of essays that I gave to Dennis Hisgun, is don't laugh about smudging. Let me tell you about human physiology, neuroanatomy and how it works. Smudging really works!
AS: Will you share some of those with me? The essays? Are they ones that you've written?
CG: Yes.
AS: Oh, oh okay. They're not, you aren't collecting research.
CG: Nope! Here's the deal, I got tired of not admitting that I had written them. I gave 'em to Dennis, but I wrote 'em and so...
AS: Ah, [laughing] the truth comes out!
CG: You can go on to Barnes and Noble, or SmashWords, and you can type in Carson Gardner, and you will see an ebook on a reinterpretation of the Dao De Jing...
AS: Oh wow.
CG: And you will see an ebook of very eccentric sonnets, and then you will see an ebook of essays. And, I have probably sold ten, so I am not marketing, and I don't give a damn whether you look at 'em or not. But, if you wanna read them you can get access to 'em, 'cuz I got tired of not sharing them. And, I decided well, I'll put em in an ebook and then I'll die. And, after that people will actually look at it. So, I'm hoping to become a famous dead poet and a famous dead essayist! [Sullivan laughing.] So, the fact that they're available is just a way for you to look at 'em, otherwise if you want a totally free copy instead of spending four or five bucks...
AS: No I'll buy it.
CG: I'll email it to you from home.
AS: No, it's okay. I'll buy it and then you can say you've sold eleven!
CG: I have no desire in making money but, the whole fifty-two that are in there as eccentric as they are and I, you know, there's nothing off color or intolerable, but it will take you down a path that Western Historians don't often go down. But I'll stand by everything I put in there.
SP: You mentioned they're on Amazon, what's the other one?
CG: They're not on Amazon they're on Barnes & Noble.
AS: Barnes & Noble.
SP: Barnes & Noble.
CG:  Amazon requires that as an ebook author you have to sell 2,000 dollars worth of ebook before they'll even put it on Amazon. Did you know that?
SP: Did you say another one like SmashWords?
CG: Smashwords.com A couple in California, frustrated writers, a decade and a half ago decided, ""You know maybe the best thing we could do is put together a website to help other people get their ebooks out there."" And so, the Smashwords.com website has now helped amateur writers like me publish several hundred thousand ebooks. Most people make no money, and SmashWords says, ""You know what? We'll do it for you free, and here's the deal. If it sells we want ten percent of your profits."" That's pretty reasonable. And so, that couple is making a decent living on that, most of us never sell anything. You know, Grandma buys one, our cousin whose always liked our poems buys one, and nobody else does. But, they do it free, and they still do it free. So, that's how I did it. Costs you nothing except the rigamarole of getting the electronic text right. But they buy their groceries because 5-10% of their authors actually sell a bunch of copies, and so then they get paid.
AS: That's great.
SP: I'll have to check it out
CG: Yeah, yeah, you get on SmashWords, you can get it somewhere else. And, if you really don't want to buy a copy I'll give you the essays free 'cuz I always feel guilty. That's why I need to become dead, so that I can become a famous dead poet and essayist, 'cuz I can't countenance charging anything for 'em. And I certainly gave em to Dennis free. But, in case anybody ever asks, you're the first person that's ever asked, but in case anybody ever asks about a year ago I put em on SmashWords.
AS:  So, thank you.
CG: Thank you for putting up with me.
AS: This was really lovely, oh no
CG: Clinton and I both have the problem of typically after about 45 minutes in any meeting we're in, someone will say, ""Okay! Bring it in for a landing Gardner. Bring it in for a landing Clinton!"" So, you can tell Clinton I warned you.
AS: Well, thank you very much, it was really...
CG: I'm a storyteller.
AS: It was really delightful to meeting you
CG: I'm a storyteller, and I was one before I came here, but I have people like Poozy Haggs [confirm spelling of name] who really helped me to become a more effective storyteller here. And so, I will always be a story teller, probably long after I'm retired, and his is an opportunity I couldn't pass up so, I snuck in all kind of stories.
AS: No, those were beautiful.
SP: Can I ask you a question? So what about Hep C up here now? Like, what are the rates like? Cuz I remember like...
CG: Clinton will have some pretty good ideas about the rates. The IHS Clinic of course is reticent to just hand us information like that, but they do keep records, and Clinton is working with their new public health doctor. They hired a new public health doctor, that's a physician with a masters in public health. Who has interest in things like PREP for people at risk of HIV and Hepatitis C treatment. You know Clinton in harm reduction has developed a consulting relationship with, I think a Twin cities hepatologist, who is providing low cost Hepatits C care here. So i'm pretty sure Clinton can tell you stats. But I don't know if he has full access to all the IHS statistics. He might though...

Amy Sullivan
Interviewer
January 19, 2017
New Brighton, Minnesota
Chuck Hilger-CH
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: I’m trying to get a whole picture of the people I’m interviewing. Their life story, how they got into the work or situation they are in, and a past, present, and future. 
The other thing I will say is that I realized on the drive over here, I’ve known this for quite a while, you are the person who got me thinking about doing this, so thank you. It piqued my interest as an oral historian. You told me one time, we were having lunch a few years ago, I don’t even think my daughter was in recovery, and you said, If people don’t get on the bandwagon, if people don’t get on the ride with the changes in MAT [medically assisted treatment] and opioids, evidence based treatment, they are just going to be lost in the dust. As a historian that really intrigued me. It was really great this past semester to read all the stuff that I was able to finally read; many of the things you and I had already talked about. So, anyways, I just wanted to thank you.
Also, I wanted to thank you for the Minnesota Alternatives [Spring Lake Park, Minnesota] connection. They’re awesome. It feels good to me to have such a good organization being the fiscal agent. 
CH: Thank you.
AS: We are at Meridian Hills Treatment Center in New Brighton, Minnesota. Can you state your name and tell me you give me permission for this interview?
CH: My name is Chuck Hilger and I give you permission to record this. 
AS: I know some of your stories, and sometimes I might ask you things that I already know, but we are just trying to get it on tape. Can you tell your story a little bit? Where you grew up? What your childhood was like? Your family life, any experiences with substances, any struggles? Then we will move into your career and life. 
CH: My youth was pretty uneventful. I grew up in a middle class neighborhood with an intact home and family. 
AS: Where was that?
CH: St. Paul, Minnesota in an area called Frogtown, or as I like to say, in the shadow of the capitol. It is a few blocks from the capitol. Frogtown is a really diverse area; it’s got a long history of being diverse. We are on the very east end of that, almost to Rice Street. If you head down Rice Street to the north you will get solely Italian, Germanic, Irish; all Caucasian neighborhood. I grew up at the intersection of those two places. 
I was raised Roman Catholic. I went to an inner city, private Catholic school. I mean the four hundred dollars a year private school just so we are clear on that. [laughs] I almost didn’t say private because it usually connotes something else. My eighth grade graduating class there was eight of us in the grade. Well, there were thirteen: eight boys and five girls. We were together for most of those seven years. Being in the inner city you wouldn’t think it would be such a small school. It wasn’t because it was exclusive either. 
Stereotypical blue-collar neighborhood. Nothing too remarkable growing up. There is a piece of it in the culture and the time of it all that everything revolved around sports. I was never gifted in those areas. I have a lazy eye so my depth perception is off so I couldn’t play sports. 
AS: What year were you born?
CH: 1964. I’m fifty-two years old. I really stayed in the neighborhood until eighth grade. After eighth grade I met some people outside of the neighborhood and really expanded my horizons. It is really bizarre in a place where your worldview of yourself is based on your community. Then I went to a place where I was hanging out with the coolest guy in the school: my sister’s boyfriend. It was kind of culture shock. 
High school was relatively boring. I started working when I was fourteen or fifteen doing furniture refinishing for a guy across the street. 
AS: Did you go to Catholic high school?
CH: I did. I went to St. Bernard’s high school from ‘79 to ‘83. I graduated in ‘83. I didn’t put a whole lot of effort into school. It was Catholic school, but I wasn’t really academically focused. I had other external interests. I did get into a lot of trouble. I have narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder. Falling asleep is really easy for me. I didn’t know this until I was in my early twenties. 
I used to get things on my report cards like ‘diligent’ and ‘conscientious’ student ‘when awake.’ [laughs] I had problems in high school because people thought I didn’t care. It was more that I just couldn’t stay awake. Narcolepsy is like in any situation where it is easy for a person to fall asleep it is just ten times easier for me. Excessive daytime sleeping -- so, classrooms; especially if it’s not a topic you’re interested in at that stage in your life. I had a lot of problems staying awake. That really colors a person’s world because of the way people think about you.
AS: Did we know much about narcolepsy at that time?
CH: We did! We studied it in psychology. You know those clips they have of the dogs that run around and then fall over? But I slept through that chapter. [laughs] We did study it in high school. 
AS: But you didn’t know you had it?
CH: Yeah, it just never occurred to me. I was always pretty outgoing, ambitious; I was a risk taker, but nothing extreme. I decided I wanted to go into law enforcement. When I was in high school it seemed like a logical thing to do. Not being one of the ‘in’ kids in the original neighborhood. I took a lot of -- I hesitate to call it abuse, but there was a lot of bullying. That stays with a person. I think that was probably a big driver between choosing that profession. I went into the military police corps army. I joined my senior year. A couple of weeks after I graduated I went off to basic training. 
AS: In the Army?
CH: Yes. In the Army National Guard. I went straight to the National Guard because I thought I’d go straight back to school. I had two years of schooling and then went into the law enforcement. 
There are some things that happened along the way. First, when I was a senior in high school my high school sweetheart got pregnant. She went home to Washington state to live. That was always weighing heavy on my mind. My daughter was born February 1, 1983 so that was before I graduated. 
I went off to basic training. With regard to alcohol or drug use by the time I was a junior I was smoking cigarettes frequently. The neighborhood bar we could go into and shoot pool, so probably by sixteen -- rarely, never a problem with my parents, never a problem with my school, but around sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Nineteen was the drinking age in the state at the time. The bartenders knew we were underage but as long as you were behaving yourself and at least someone’s parents were in the bar you’re okay. I still would hang around with that really cool kid, he’s now my brother-in-law. 
AS: He’s now your brother-in-law?
CH: Yeah, right. My sister’s only boyfriend. They have been together for like fifty years now or something I think. She’s fifty-five. [laughs] 
There was really no alcohol or drug abuse. There was the occasional binge -- mom and dad were out of town or something. I experimented with marijuana. I was never a fan; I never liked the way it made me feel. It didn’t work for me, so to speak. I definitely did like alcohol. 
I went out to basic training, was at basic training for two years, came back home, and moved to Washington state for a couple of weeks to meet my daughter and see if perhaps I was going to be a resident of Washington state, but that didn’t work out so well. 
I came back home. I never thought I was smart enough to go to college. When you grow up in that blue-collar environment where your parents didn’t go to college. I’m one of thirty-five cousins, and I’m one of the younger ones, there are five that are younger than me, but they are all union drivers, union machinists; they are all blue-collar jobs. Everyone in my family was, and they all live in the metro [metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul]. My extended family isn’t spread out. Our family vacations meant going up to a resort with our aunts and uncles for a week or two in the summer, which was magical. Believe it or not, it was. It was a great experience. Ironically these are still the resorts that we have a travel trailer at. They didn’t have travel trailers back then. We have a summer place up there so that is where we spend our weekends during the summer. When I talk to my boys, who at this point are twenty-eight and twenty-nine, my son and my step-son, those are their best memories of growing up. Up with the trailer at the lake and playing board games. We never loved Nintendo or any of that stuff. No electronics. Just family time. 
AS: How many siblings do you have?
CH: I have one sister. 
AS: What did your parents do?
CH: My father worked for the post office and was a mail handler. He did that for thirty-five years. He did insurance for a year or two, but that wasn’t really his thing. He is really one of those -- going to work is really a function for earning an income for stability. He always paid the bills on time, he never extended into debt. He squeaks when he walks is all I’ll say. To this day! [laughs] 
True story: we talked him into buying a new travel trailer two years ago and he said, I’m only going to do this if I can use my bonds. His savings bonds. Because he had been collecting them from 1975. They had fully matured fifteen years ago, they weren’t even gaining anything, but he’s still got them. Heaven forbid he ever cashed something in. Then I said that he could have bought some pretty nice travel trailers with that. I’ve been helping him through some of that process. 
Mom did factory jobs and then for the last fifteen years she works in the kitchen at Hamline [University, St. Paul, Minnesota]. My mom grew up on the west end of St. Paul over on Seventh Street. Her family had a fair amount of substance abuse; alcohol issues. Solid, Irish family: Madigans. Second cousins to the mayor Chris Coleman in the city of St. Paul. 
My father, the reason for his need or desire for stability was that he moved a lot. Every year it was a different school, that sort of thing. My mom was from a family from five or six and my dad was from a family of five. 
AS: So they created some real stability that they didn’t have. 
CH: Absolutely. Don’t get me wrong they went out and had their fun. They bowled a lot. I know this probably comes as a surprise that they are bowlers. [laughs] Not until three years ago were they bowlers. Age has finally taken its toll. You could write a sitcom and it would be really boring. Very standard. Not punitive, just very structured. Monday night was Swanson chicken, Tuesday night was whatever. 
Dad worked second shifts so I didn’t really develop a relationship with him, but my grandparents were in the duplex downstairs. My grandfather and my grandmother and I were pretty close on my dad’s side. My dad bought the house with the grandparents living downstairs in order to provide stability for them. My grandfather was a truck driver and a cab driver and whatever driver and whatever he needed to do. 
AS: You went back --
CH: I went into the guard, and I came back and started school for law enforcement and started having trouble with the narcolepsy working in a security job position. That’s what guys trained in the military tactics police do. It is easy to get jobs. My narcolepsy started flaring up when I was nineteen or twenty. I got my first DWI [driving while intoxicated]. I fell asleep while driving a vehicle. It was on Highway 12 up by Highway 100; there’s a really steep drop off. Now there’s a big wall. Actually, they dug it all out. Anyway, I got in a car accident. I had literally fallen asleep behind the wheel. I did blow a point one three -- point zero eight is the legal limit. So, knowing what I know now, point one three is not really anything, but I seemed to be fairly sensitive to alcohol. 
I told them I had fallen asleep behind the wheel and that is actually what got me to go in and do a test for the narcolepsy. I was going to use it as a defense. [laughs] It doesn’t change the fact that you are a point one three, but when you’re nineteen you do what you do. That’s how I found out I had the narcolepsy. They started treating it then with a stimulant, which was not an issue for me except I like to drink and I couldn’t mix them. I quit taking the stimulants and just dealt with it. It was much easier just to deal with it then than it is now just because of my age and vitality, I think. 
I have always been a driven individual. I’m always looking for things that are new and interesting. In high school I did the McDonald’s and Burger King thing. I refinished furniture and continued to refinish furniture for years. I did the security thing, got the DWI and lost my license and that doesn’t go too well. I thought I would try my hand at sales. I became a vacuum salesman. That was my first sales job. My second sales job was raising funds for what is called United Arts Council, which is now the Ramsey County Arts Fund, I believe. This is back when they were trying to buy the land for the Ordway theatre -- don’t look back at when that was built! I had a knack on the phone for doing that. I didn’t even know it at the time. I thought I was just doing the same as everyone else. It wasn’t something that was really satisfying, if you will. But, I was successful at it and I stayed at it for like a year. 
I got involved with some guys that were running a multi-level marketing business with a carpet cleaning business on the side. It was called Music Biz. We grew that into a two thousand person international down line -- when you buy a record and your friend buys a record and you get the idea of the whole multilevel thing. It got so popular that we were on KDWB [Minnesota radio station] back in the day. The state attorney general came in and investigated us because we had so much publicity and so much going on.
AS: What was that called again?
CH: The name of the thing was Music Biz -- that’s what we called it. We had a jingle written and everything. I would sing it, but I sing really poorly. I don’t know why it is still in my head!
For them I did a lot of the maintaining of the databases, which was quite arduous back then. I think we are talking ‘84, ‘85. The other thing was to maintain the mailing list and send out all the fliers, reminders, and checks to the people that were earning all their downloading income. That went really well until we decided that the two thousand person download was so successful that we should just move to another product and just pick up the pyramid and move it to another product as is, then we would be fine. That bit of diversification was like trying to move a sandcastle. It just doesn’t work. It collapsed and we had gotten so big that I had hired a mailing company to do the mailing lists for us. I started doing that. 
Before that I did do a year or two of factory work. I knew working in the factory I would find myself being very angry for no reason at all. It just wasn’t suited for me, which is really hard for a person who comes from a family where that’s what everybody does. Why wouldn’t you? What is your problem? Why would you screw up this job? I worked at an envelope manufacturer. I worked in shipping and receiving and did that for a year and a half. I branched off of that job into this entrepreneurial piece. I did that for a while. 
My drinking, once I hit the drinking age of nineteen, definitely escalated. A lot of it was culturally informed. I enjoyed going out to the clubs and dancing and all that fun stuff, but I definitely consumed more on a regular basis than would be healthy. Binge drinking, of course, is if it is any more than five as it is defined now. 
I managed to pick up a second DWI about that same time. I got pulled over for going from a friend’s house to a bar. I got pulled over and was point one zero and they gave me a DWI for that. I was even where I was going. I was like, Look, there are my friends in the window! They were like, Wave goodbye because you’re going the other direction. Part of that had to do with the fact that I had a lot of driving after suspensions. When you have narcolepsy it is considered a seizure disorder. You have to go see a neurologist, I think at that point it was once a year. He would have to sign off saying I hadn’t had any episodes and that it was okay for me to drive. I wasn’t taking my medication so I wasn’t being prescribed; I wasn’t going to the doctor and all of that. They wouldn’t get the letter, they’d suspend my license, I’d get pulled over, I’d get a ticket, I’d get a warning, I would have a fine to pay, I wouldn’t pay the fine, it would get revoked, so forth and so on. I think that background, too, led to the fact that they would say, This guy has got multiple violations, previous DWI two years ago. We should probably do something about this. I want to be fair to those making that judgment call. Of course at this point I was like, I was so innocent! [laughs] They pulled me over because I rolled a stop sign at faster than pedestrian walking speed -- that’s what it says on the ticket. California stop is what they call it. It was on a side street. 
Alcohol for me can be a real -- I tend to think big picture and over the top anyway, so when you add alcohol the first thing to go is judgment. That’s one step closer to making bad decisions. Alcohol consumption for me is something that has to be closely monitored. At this point I wasn’t really concerned or thinking about it. 
I met my first wife when I was working at the factory. I did a lot of dating and a lot of going out. I was the guy that had the constant nine-month relationship. Sometimes I hadn’t even ended the first one before I started the second one. That wasn’t a rule depending on how things went. 
During that whole time I really didn’t have any idea that I might be smart. All I have sorting the world externally, what I did, I had an external viewpoint at this point. I did okay in the military, although I had trouble staying awake in those classes too. I graduated high school with a two point something. I wasn’t the guy that the guidance counselor was like, We’ve got to get you to take the SATs [scholastic assessment test] because you’ve got a big future. I had a low self-esteem. I think I wanted to prove something. I was always looking outside of myself. People that appear to be happy and have it together, who have an external orientation, this is what they do and how they have it. We don’t get to understand the complexity of their world view, but this is how they have it. At twenty-one -- and this is coming up on the yuppie time, the eighties. That’s really an important factor because I thought I had something to prove and was always doing work. 
AS: But, you didn’t feel like you were smart?
CH: No, no. That’s why I didn’t go to college. I figured I would figure something out one way or another. 
AS: But, you knew you could figure it out. 
CH: I was a creative problem solver. That was always a skill, but not a recognized skill necessarily. You can’t really put that on an application. It’s great, because you always seem to stay out of trouble just at the last minute, escape harm’s way at the last minute. You are just one step ahead of the next situation. Always drawn to the exciting fast lane. I was in my early twenties. 
I was generally really stable. My parents owned the duplex and my grandparents had moved out. When I was a sophomore and junior in high school working at McDonald’s I met a guy a couple of years older than me who had moved here from Flint, Michigan to live with his older brother and have better options here in Minnesota. We became friends and we are still close today. We lived downstairs in my parents’ duplex. This is the kind of guy that you live with for five years and you never have a fight. It’s just like that. Maybe over who ate the last piece of pizza, but that’s about it. 
Reasonably stable. I did the factory job, met my future wife, doing these entrepreneurial jobs which doesn’t do much for the cash flow. Keeping things going whichever way I could. In ‘85, ‘86 the small business I was involved with closed down. The guy that had been doing our mailings offered me a job selling mailing services. Labeling mailing services and stuff like that. I thought, Okay, why not. It was a straight commissioned job, of course, and I took that and grew that over the next four years pretty successfully into specialty services. We had a niche there. This was before inkjet printers, so we would do what looked like a typed envelope, but we had a machine process for getting it done. It was a very expensive thing to have done, but we would have like two million piece mailings from American Express. I got in with some other companies like I.C. Systems, which also does mail. I went out to San Francisco and landed a big American Express account. I’m like twenty-four and this is the only time I’ve been on a plane is to go to basic training and back. 
This is a guy who thinks he’s not very smart; I knew I was street savvy and can get by and figure things out. I did that until that person doing that business wasn’t paying taxes. I got a letter in the mail at the office that he owed payroll taxes. I took that product line I had developed and I moved it to a large agency in downtown Minneapolis. I sold them on the idea of it and sold it to a couple of employees and went and did that. They washed me out pretty quick. I learned the difference between a small family owned business that was just getting off the ground to working in the corporate environment where you actually have to produce and so forth and so on. Some of the accounts and the markets were just at that next level where you were working with those ad agencies and big players. While I had done well working in the direct marketing group in the Twin Cities -- I had a lot of connections and knew a lot of people -- it wasn’t amounting to enough work so after nine months they let me go. 
At that point, it was ‘89 and my future wife and I had a child in ‘88, my son Steven. He was a year and a half old. My wife still worked in the envelope factory. I got this really good job and they gave me a really big signing bonus and nine months later it was all gone. We went out and had bought a house. There was a lot of stress at that point. I had also got a job at the post office at the bulk mail center and I was doing ten-key and I’m not a ten-key person. I only did that for a short time but I knew that wasn’t going to work. A lot of mild chaos. 
Occasional drug use. I had tried cocaine at that point a couple of times. Nothing that had amounted to anything. I didn’t even get it, so to speak. Alcohol was still an issue from time to time. Binge drinking again, not black out drinking or anything. Still struggling with the driving issues because I am supposed to be going to the doctor’s and I’m not. 
AS: This is almost ten years later! 
CH: Yeah, it had been a while. When I lost the job at the downtown Minneapolis firm I opened up my own practice because I thought that would be a good idea. I opened up this small, broker advertising letter shop. I didn’t actually do the work, but I brokered all the services. I had brokered so many services for so many years and putting all these packages together that I knew most of the printers in town, I knew all the mail shops, I had all the connections. It was just a matter of landing the accounts. Quite frankly it went really well for the first year. I made one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand dollars worth of business. Thirty percent of that was what I got to take home and that was more than enough. So, here we go again. 
Ultimately, I kept growing the accounts I was making over about a year and a half to two year period. We are now at 1989, 1991. The Gulf War has broken out, the economy is taking a dump, and things aren’t necessarily going to great. I land a big account out of Mason City, Iowa to do Who’s Who mailings. If you send fifty bucks you can be in the book. Those mailings typically go out typically in one hundred thousand pieces and they want a high end product, which is what I specialized in. The nice thing about doing a high end product is that you always have a market. I did that mailing and got it out. Ultimately, they didn’t pay. My normal vendors who had done the job were like, We can’t keep doing your bread and butter jobs. Now we’ve got this big one hanging out there and it’s all this money. They put their attorney’s on the company. We all worked it out, but ultimately it was the end of that business. That was hard. 
There were a lot of technology changes; email is coming along, the Internet was just hitting the market. There were a lot of changes there. As my business declined my drinking really took off. As did spending money on things like pull tabs or gambling. That impulsive kind of stuff took over. I had bought a townhome with my wife as the business had taken off. I was always doing things slightly on the sly. I was contracting -- it was assumable. I think I made one payment for the year and a half that I was in the house. It took them like a year to get you out. 
I think 1991 I still had a job with the post office and started carrying mail for the post office as a letter carrier. I was backing out the garage and I slid into a parked car. I actually had my license for a few years at that point. It was an icy slope and I hit a car so I lost my job. I had some friends who were hanging cable up in Brainerd so I went to Brainerd and was installing cable systems. Apparently I was a cable specialist now. Climbing up ladders. 
I was up in Brainerd on February fourteenth, my ex-wife has a flair for the -- that was when she moved out of the house with the kids. We had a son together and she had had two boys. For the last six years we had been together so I had been raising them. One was six months old when we got together. The other one was three. They were eight, six, and our son was in preschool. That gives you an idea. That was a huge turning point for me because that was such a loss. That external focus, you know, if you have a nice house, two-car garage, then you are doing okay because that’s how it would appear. I really struggled to have all that stuff and it all collapsed. 
The drinking took off. 
AS: Had you been struggling in your marriage? Did that come to a surprise for you?
CH: I really think it was that this is the pattern that people follow. Not that I did any of it in the right order. You don’t have a baby, then graduate high school, then go into the service, then have another baby, then buy the house, then get married. All this time the relationship with my daughter is they come out or I go out once a year, send birthday cards, and that was about it. She had a great stepdad that she called dad; I was more of the stepdad. We kept the connection but it wasn’t really deep. Her stepdad was great. 
I lost the two boys I had been raising, I lost the house, and still we didn’t get divorced. We did whatever we could do. We struggled. She was very conservative about how she went about things. I was much more like, We will figure it out, it will work out. Her belief was that as I excelled or did well or did less well in business -- she was still working at the factory -- she was being left behind. Marketing and advertising is all this stuff, even back then: five hundred dollar suits, thousand dollar briefcases. That was just a big issue for us. She had met a guy at work that was the picture of stability. He was a single guy, farmer family, Somerset, Wisconsin. Just the epitome of stability and whatever. For her it was the right move at that time. 
After that, I think it took me two weeks to get my third DWI. One was when I was nineteen, one when I was twenty, and then one when I was like twenty-eight. It was 1992. I’m trying to think of what year it was. It was three DWIs in ten years. I blew a point one three again. I got pulled over because I was doing fifty-five and I passed a state trooper at one thirty in the morning. I was doing fifty-five. He said, You should know that if you are ever on the freeway at one thirty in the morning you should never pass a state trooper. I said, I was doing fifty-five. He said, I know, I was doing fifty and you passed me. Did you hear me? You should never pass a state trooper at one thirty. [laughs] I didn’t do anything wrong, I just got pulled over. It was three in ten. 
The post office called back and said, You’re right. We made a mistake. Here’s a bunch of back pay for the year. I had gone to the union and said it was an accident because it was on the ice. It was their truck, in their driveway, in their parking lot. Anyway, now I don’t have a license. You can’t be a mail carrier without a license. 
Anyway, somebody had introduced me to cocaine in the crack form, which I had never tried before. I was off to the races. That put me in all kinds of circles. From the time I was twenty-eight until I was thirty-one it was just one big go. Having grown up and living where I grew up at the crosshairs of Rice Street and Frogtown I had plenty of gang affiliated members that I could be around by going to certain places. Then I had all my friends on Rice Street who didn’t have access to crack at that point, which was largely an African American gang thing. 
For the next year and a half it was pretty interesting. Parents of the kids who were in the gangs -- the gangs who were burning down those houses and killing families; I never really thought twice about it. I didn’t get excited about being caught up in the mix because for some reason it doesn’t really faze me much. I had an acquaintance in the escort service so I drove escorts around. I would drive them to their appointment and wait in the car. A whole nefarious group of people. 
AS: Are you saying these are things that you wouldn’t normally do, but since you were using you were doing?
CH: I would do those things to be able to continue to use. I didn’t have any regular income. I was refinishing furniture again. I would work for three days, make three or four hundred dollars, then go and light crack. Then use and sell, use and sell, use and sell for three or four days. Then go work for three days. I probably kept that pattern up for quite some time. 
AS: Did your parents ever know?
CH: No. My parents never knew. My best friend, he was the best man at my wedding, never knew. I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this. 
AS: Would you disappear for a few days?
CH: There was no disappearing because it was just me. My children are with my ex-wife; I would have my son every other weekend. I never used when I had my son because he was there. That was the arrangement her and I worked out -- that standard every other weekend. I wasn’t paying child support at that time. I would use several days in a row and it didn’t matter the day of the week. It was a lot of gang activity. You start selling to support your habit and you find yourself in a lot of interesting groups and around a lot of interesting people. 
I tend to be fairly loud and outgoing, which culturally fits better with more of an aggressive African American male stance, so I never had a problem finding a comfortable spot in that group. I did look a little bit like a cop, so people would sometimes challenge me to smoke their drugs to prove I wasn’t a cop -- which I was completely fine with. Are you convinced yet, because if not I can do some more of it! 
There was a point when I was losing my advertising business and I was starting to get into cocaine and my wife had gone. I could get off the plane at five o’clock in my suit, drive home, throw on a pair of jeans and a hoodie, and be down on the block in a completely different lifestyle. I was just really a chameleon. No real sense of identity or way of things that had to be any particular way. 
AS: What were you going to tell me that you said you have never told?
CH: It was my wife who told me that I was smoking crack. 
AS: What do you mean?
CH: Well, the first time I used was with these friends of mine. They said, Try this! Or whatever. I knew it was cocaine and I knew we were smoking cocaine, but I didn’t know it was crack. It just really hadn’t hit where crack was --
AS: It was the media.
CH: The media to a degree. It was like, What do you mean painkillers are just like heroin? You know what I mean? It was like, That is cocaine. What’s fascinating is that she is this person that never did any drugs. She liked to drink but she never did any drugs or anything. She is the person that schedules what times the kids get up and what time they put their shoes on and what time they are standing at the door. She’s very organized and structured. The opposite of me, I guess. 
She was like, You realize that’s crack? I had heard about crack but I didn’t know what it was. I know that sounds silly. For somebody who’s fairly street smart, who is used to being in the mix -- I’ve got friends who are Hells Outcast on Rice Street. They’ve been long time gang members. Many notorious names and people that I know and still run into from time to time in different places. Then the whole gang thing. I think in the first couple of weeks I told her. She said, What did you spend your money on? Well, somebody gave me this drug. You realize that’s crack? I didn’t, but it’s funny that she enlightened me. I don’t think I’ve ever shared that with anybody. The kind of thing you wouldn’t want to admit. She was from Blaine. [laughs]
AS: Are we in the eighties or nineties?
CH: The business went down in ‘92 so this is starting in late ‘91. 
AS: So kind of early in what came to be the so-called crack epidemic?
CH: Yeah, yeah. For Minnesota it certainly was. It was never here like it was -- like we think of the crack epidemic you think of it more in the phase that it was in in Los Angeles. It just never hit that level of height over here. 
There were a couple of close calls I had with houses where we were moving dope. One of the big gangs in St. Paul, part of the Disciples, had a major connection. Because the kids were in the gangs and this was the stepdad of one of the kids in the gang, we could essentially get access to as much as we wanted. He had the connection so I did more of the driving and the facilitating, so forth and so on. It wasn’t anything that I ever got compensated well for. They were moving a fair amount of weight and that drew some attention. There were a couple of federal cases. 
There was actually a book written about it. A house fire on Lawson [Avenue] in St. Paul where five kids died. One was Andre Coppage and his brother Lester. Anyway, there is a whole book written about that group. They waited five or six years to prosecute on that. They gathered them from around the country. There were big articles from around the country about how they brought all these people back from Florida. I think this book is called ‘The Red Light’ [Code of Silence: The Andre Coppage Story by Ann Lee] or something. It has been a while since I read it. Some really fascinating stuff. 
That is the level. You have a lot of low-level gang stuff, but this was where people were killing people and fire bombing houses. The person’s whose car they used was a friend of mine. They traded his car for the night for some crack cocaine. He had lost his car behind that. I was right on the edge of being really deep in. I was at the house on a regular basis. I was never caught up in it like that. I got caught coming out of a house one night after a party. Of course, no driver’s license because we are back to that again.
AS: But you are still driving around?
CH: Of course. At what point do you need to stick your driver’s license into the car to make anything run? [laughs] When they solve that problem, then it’s golden. Until then, I’ve got my keys. 
I came out of a house one night, it was a prostitution house, and we had been partying and the police were in the alley where my car was parked. I didn’t have anything on me but they put me in the back of the squad. There are now people standing on the back of this porch because I’m out in the alley in the squad. There was a female officer and a male officer. They asked me all these questions like, Who is inside? You know that is a known prostitution and drug house. No, I met this girl named Tammy at the bar and she said this is where she wanted to go so this is where I brought her. They knew that was my car back there and they said, You’re going to get in your car and go home, right? I said, Yeah, absolutely. They let me out of the car and the woman cop gets out -- she was in the passenger seat -- and lets me out. I wasn’t cuffed. She goes, God, Chuck. Good to see you again! Thanks for all the information. [laughs] Just to mess with me. She must have really bought that I wasn’t from the area. 
AS: To throw you under the bus in front of everybody. 
CH: It didn’t get me in any trouble because the people over there knew me. This is just a really interesting time with interesting people. A lot of pain and a lot of suffering. I have seen a lot of really ugly things. I never got really caught up in the criminality of it, thank God. Excuse me, other than selling drugs.
That continued for some time. I was still going to the bar and drinking regularly. I had a steady girlfriend and we were out one night and we were pulled over because we were waiting for someone to run in and pick up some drugs. A squad had seen me and run my plates and pulled up on me. I’m driving after license cancellation -- three DWIs -- inimical to public safety [DAC-IPS]. A cancelled IPS is what they refer to that as. There is no way out of this. I’m going to the ADC -- adult detention center. 
At that point in my life I wasn’t good at being alone or standing still for any amount of time -- let alone in a six by six foot room having no control. I called a buddy of mine who agreed to bail me out. He was the one I had been working on the furniture with since I was fourteen and now I’m thirty-one years old. He came and bailed me out. It was six thousand dollars. The bond was six hundred bucks so he paid that. This is a guy who still goes to Latin mass. [laughs] Do you know what I mean? He won’t wear shorts because if some woman were to have sexual thoughts about him he would be responsible. This is my world. 
AS: This is old school. 
CH: This is old school. Anyways, he was the guy you could never do wrong by. There was one other time when they had brought me in on a driving after cancellation -- they got me one other time -- I was down in Ramsey County ADC and they said, All the guys going to Hennepin County stand on the left side of the room, which was where I was supposed to go. For the guys they were going to let go stand on the right side of the room. I stood on the right hand side, they handed me my shoelaces on the way out the door and I was gone. They weren’t going to let me go this second time -- they were onto me. I couldn’t have my friend give me the six grand. I just could never do that. I went to court. I had three DWIs in ten years, I’ve got all kinds of driving violations, and I have no license. The judge told me I was going to do thirty days. He said, If you ever want your license back you need to go to treatment. If you don’t complete treatment you can’t get your license back. 
I won’t go into detail but there are a number of other business things that I had done. I was trying to work my way back into sales. I took a job selling satellite dishes for a year and a half down in Winona. Driving back and forth. I had done a number of things. I did asbestos removal for a year because that paid pretty well. 
AS: When you say you have always worked you have always worked. 
CH: I have always worked. I have never collected a day of unemployment in my life. I have always had at least one job and sometimes two. There were just a variety of other experiences thrown in there while I was trying to get out of that drug lifestyle. 
I knew it wasn’t going anywhere. I knew I wasn’t going to make a living out of furniture refinishing. It was the base. Then I would try to do this and that. The judge told me I needed to go to treatment if I wanted to get my license back ever. That is what got me in. December 1994. 
One of the most devastating things I remember was Christmas of 1994 I had spent all of the money that I saved up for Christmas presents on drugs. I managed to gather up some more to buy Christmas presents again, but just that hopeless feeling. December of ‘94 I was about done. My court date was in January of ‘95, so I went into court and the judge said do this alcohol drug assessment. My previous DWIs they had told me I had to go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meetings. I had to do two days in Lino Lakes doing their education program. It’s not like I hadn’t had plenty of consequences. I went in this side room with this young lady that was the assessor and she asked me -- I swear to God it wasn’t more than six questions. She came back and said that I had alcohol abuse whatever. Of course I didn’t say anything about the cocaine because why would I? The judge said, Yeah, you have to go to treatment. I said, I can’t pay for treatment. He said that there was something called Rule Twenty-five. You have to go do that and if you [1:01.19]. I said, I’ll do that and he gave me thirty days. I went and did my thirty days. 
I really like playing darts. I had thirty days but I got out on work release because I told them I was still refinishing furniture. I would hang out at the shop even if there wasn’t work. On dart nights I would still go to the bar and play darts, ankle bracelet and all. But I wasn’t drinking! In case they came because they could come and test you at any time. I wanted to do my assessment and then go from the end of my thirty days right into treatment. I knew the only way to get into treatment was to get them to know it was bad enough to get a Rule Twenty-five. I went in there and I spilled my guts. I may have even enhanced a little bit to make sure I would get in. If I came out of the Rule Twenty-five and they said I didn’t need treatment, then what the hell am I going to do? Because I couldn’t get my license back. 
I went in there and did a Rule Twenty-five. They gave me fourteen days inpatient treatment and ADEP.
AS: What is ADEP?
CH: Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program. It is with the Regions Hospital program. I went to treatment and I just went to my fourteen days so I could get my license. Thank God this is getting behind me. Still, being an external sorter, the worst thing you can do is put a person like that in group. Do you think anybody can keep a secret like that in group? Right?
AS: Being what?
CH: An external sorter.
AS: What is that?
CH: People have internal and external locuses of control. This is something that has been really useful in counseling over the years and working with people. How people view the world is often, especially with people who are involved with addiction, you can have a strong internal focus. You know these people because they already have all the answers. They don’t need you to tell them anything. 
AS: Who?
CH: People who have an internal sense of self. They analyze, look at, and make decisions about their life based on their own information and data and process the decision that they have made. External people are like chameleons: they can become whatever they need to become in their environment, they become really good at reading things, thinking they fit in. I’m not saying they don’t stand out. They are driven by the environment as opposed to individual preferences. 
Ideally, you want some of both. There are points where you need to be taking in data from the outside and times from yourself. I just always had a very -- at that point -- external point of reference. I just looked around seeing how other people did it and emulated that. 
AS: To put you in group, you just mimicked what other people were saying?
CH: No, I just shared. When you have an external orientation you don’t have the need to protect or -- you know what I mean? When you are in those settings you just share. That happened to you? This happened to me, and this happened to me. I’ve been through this; I’ve been through that. They are like, See, you’re an alcoholic. You realize that the normal people don’t have to try to quit drinking. 
I drank the Kool-Aid. Fourteen days after getting out of outpatient treatment I knew I was an alcoholic and an addict. I had shared all that stuff about the cocaine and the stuff I had been through. All the crazy stuff. It was fourteen days after I had finished my detox and they called me into the director’s office and he was like, Alright, you are going to be here for fourteen days and this is how it works. You will need to take a look at the books on the shelves; there are four up there for different halfway houses. I said, Sorry, halfway houses? He said, Yeah, the recommendation here from the Rule Twenty-five person is that you do fourteen days inpatient followed by ninety days at a halfway house. At which point I said, John, I can tell you have been doing this a while and I can tell you are good, but if you look around you can tell I have some of the same problems that the people we have in this treatment center are dealing with. I think after I am here for about a week you will see that I don’t have to finish the fourteen days let alone go to the halfway house. At which point he metaphorically pushed my nose into the ground. He said, It says here if you don’t complete treatment and the halfway house then you don’t get your license back. 
I did my fourteen days and then I was three days in. I got into the program and I wasn’t faking it. I was like, Wow, I really have this issue. It is kind of like when you read the diagnostic and mental health manual for the first time and you have half of the stuff in there. It was like that. They give me a choice of these halfway houses. Three of them are in Frogtown and Dayton neighborhood. I was like, I am not going to those! There were two other choices. It was Cochran and Hastings, River Falls [Wisconsin], which is on the River Falls campus. They give you a day to go out there and check it out. They interviewed me and he said, Why do you want to come here? I said, I see you are on a college campus. I’ve never been to college before. I thought maybe while I was here I would take a class. I’m still moving a million miles a minute. Despite that interview they decided to take me. 
I finished up my fourteen days and I was excited to go to River Falls. It is a really nice place, but it is a forty-minute drive from ADAP to River Falls, which is apparently how long it takes to undo fourteen days of treatment. I don’t think it was two hours after I got into the halfway house that I was sitting down with my primary counselor saying, Bob, if you review my records you will understand that I have been pretty successful in my life and I have got some really good things going for me. I have a house in St. Paul that I can go back to and live. Of course, the telephone is shut off and I haven’t paid my gas in two months. You’ll see. How long do I really need to be here? He said, Well, Chuck, it says here if you don’t complete ninety days you don’t get your license back! So, yeah, that’s a long ride from one place to another. 
AS: How did you get the ride?
CH: They would take you. They transported you. I was their van, which was probably a good thing. Left to my own devices I would have gone for it. I did the ninety days. They have you do manual labor stuff. There was nothing wrong with it, but that’s the stuff that really makes me angry and annoyed. Now I am loading trucks again all day long and I have to pay for a ride to work to make like six dollars an hour. All these dichotomies. 
AS: That is kind of a sort of humiliation. 
CH: Yeah. A lot of grounding. 
AS: I’m calling it humiliation and you are calling it a grounding. Is it both?
CH: I don’t think it should be humiliating because there is nothing humiliating about it. For me it wasn’t so humiliating as it was like back to the roots. Here is what my family does, throwing sacks. Again, nothing wrong with it, but I always thought there should be more. I was just frustrated. 
AS: Okay. So you didn’t think it was beneath you, necessarily.
CH: No, no. Not beneath me. I could do it. I have always been in good physical shape. Well, I was. I finished my ninety days. 
One of the most important things that happened to me while I was there was that I started doing more reading about addiction because I wanted to understand it. The differences between my time in sales and my training in counseling -- the skills are really very similar. There isn’t much difference. I had done all the Anthony Robbins and the Dale Carnegie; I had done all the training for sales. When you are sitting in group and listening to what people are saying as opposed to applying your own meaning for them I was actually functioning very supportively in group. I finally read The Road Less Traveled by Scott Peck, which talks about a number of things, but most important for me was a mapping of the world, what this means, what this isn’t. For me, it was a lot of things I had believed to be true, but it didn’t go with the world view I grew up with. It really was a remapping for me. That book launched me into a whole course of action and research and interests. 
I finished my ninety days and I returned home. I took a job scraping forums. Like what they pour cement with. They bring them back and they are all dirty you have to scrape it out. In the yard scraping forums all days. I had to walk right past my old bar that I used to hang out at because I couldn’t drive. Now I am on the honesty program. I am involved in the twelve steps. I am trying to live a life of rigorous honesty. I don’t have my license; I’m not driving my car. I am halfway out of this program so the promises are going to come true if I just do what I need to do. I am going to meetings and got a job and I’m just getting started again. 
I started drinking again. I never went back to the crack cocaine because that was a whole lifestyle. It was too far to go. My parents and in-laws were invited to the halfway house and I did tell them that I was using cocaine and they were pretty surprised. They really don’t know what that means. To them that means, My son was using drugs but he quit. They don’t understand the depth of it and it is hard for me to explain because it is so complex and convoluted. All the craziness, games, and desperation. I had a gun in my mouth one time. I wasn’t holding the gun. 
I started to drink September 27, 1995. I went back to drinking for two months. I was in the bar and I looked up and they showed a picture of one of my best friends. When I first got into advertising at the company that was doing the envelopes and stuff I had met a guy who had done more than three years in Stillwater prison on three different occasions for stuff. In many ways we were cut from the same cloth but he just got caught and his connections went a little deeper than mine. I am more the guy that brings things together and connects things. He was the fighter. 
For many years when we were running together he would keep me out of trouble and I would keep up moving forward. That was my connection. He did furniture refinishing with me when he needed money. Very close from 1985 until ‘95. I looked up and I saw that he was on the TV and he was being charged with vehicular homicide. He had borrowed my friend’s motorcycle that owned the refinishing company and at two o’clock in the morning someone had stepped off the curb in front of him and he hit him doing thirty. My friend blew a point one three which is waking up for him. His drinking was way worse than mine. That was the day I decided. To some degree the trouble that he got in I got in, but to a lesser degree. I thought, This is where this is going. On that day I decided to stop drinking. 
I have never gone back to cocaine. The one thing that I was supposed to do with the halfway house that I didn’t do was go see a therapist. The next day I set up the appointment and I said, I was supposed to call after I left River Falls and I didn’t. I got set up to see him. I had my job so I just stopped the drinking thing, upped my meetings. At that point I was still going off and on. 
I went and saw this therapist in part because of what happened in treatment and the halfway house and my own reading, I went and saw this person and I said, This is my scenario and this is where I’m at. He is an exceptional therapist and his approach was very effective. He asked me, Chuck, how smart are you? I said, I’m street smart. I can always figure out a way to get around, I can do what I need to do, I’m good at solving problems, I can do this and that. He said, Let me get this right. You were in the service and you did that successfully. I got out in ‘89. He said, You were in the service for six years, you were in sales, you were with a small business that you partially owned at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two, then you were building a company, twenty-six, twenty-seven you had your own company, you’ve been through drug treatment, you’ve basically lived on the street, you’ve nearly been homeless, you’ve survived just fine, we are sitting here having this conversation and you’re saying you’re not smart? [laughs] I said, Well, that’s street smarts and that’s how you get by. 
He made me take an IQ test and it wasn’t off the charts or anything, it wasn’t near genius, but he asked me, Well, how smart are you? I said, How do you want me to define it? He said, IQ? I said, I have no idea. What is average? He said, One hundred. I said, I’m one hundred. I came back after I had taken the IQ test and he said, What was your score? I shared it with him and he said, What does that mean? Being an external sorter primarily at that point I said, Basically, it means short of doing rocket science or anything like that I could probably do anything I wanted to. He was like, Yeah, you’re right. His method of therapy was very effective for me. I went once a week for several months before backing off to twice a month and then tapering off. 
Years later my mom, with all of her family issues growing up, I sent her to him because she has a lot of depression issues and he saw her for like three sessions and he said, She’s good, we don’t need to see her anymore. It was really disappointing for me. [laughs] 
AS: Those are some pretty good coping skills, apparently!
CH: That was years after I had been to therapy but, yeah, that’s great. He said, We’re not going to talk about the twelve steps, that’s not what we’re here for. He was just very effective at throwing the proverbial bone and then I would go out and look for it for the week and I would come back with the bone and he would take that out of my mouth and throw it again. 
A lot of what I wanted to believe in my heart of hearts was true, I just had to come to those things myself. I became a much better internal sorter, I became a much better ‘identity.’
AS: Did you go to college then?
CH: I was in the halfway house and one of my friends was supposed to help one of these guys move. I was on my way to church and this guy pulls over and asks if so-and-so is around and I say, No, he took off for the weekend, and he said, I need someone to move the couch. I said, I’m going to church. He said, Help me move this couch and I’ll drive you to church afterwards and I thought, This sounds scary! This from the guy who used to drive prostitutes! [laughs] 
I go help him move this couch. He says to me that he had worked with guys from Kinnic Falls before, he had been DVR, Department of Vocational Rehab in Wisconsin and he told me if I wanted to go to school in Minnesota all I needed to do was go down to the Department of Rehabilitative Services and because I was a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, besides the fact that I have narcolepsy, they would pay for my schooling if I wanted to go to school for something. 
AS: How strange that this guy just shows up and starts telling you all of this. 
CH: I went and did my fifth step at this small church that I go to. The fifth step in the twelve steps is where you go and you share your shortcomings and character flaws with another person. You’ve done a searching a fearless moral inventory and now you have to share it. I went to my old church and I was going to ask the priest afterwards if he would do it at some point with me. I thought, I am not doing this. I am not doing this! In the church where I was an altar boy for six years. He said in the sermon stuff about Mary Magdalene and the stoning and it is about forgiveness and he was not guilty. I am really fortunate because next door we have the convent that we sold several years ago for people who are alcohol and drug addicted. Part of my job -- I want to get back to the community as I do the fifth steps -- I had not been in that church for five years or more and I don’t think I have been back since. Maybe once or twice. I went and talked to him and I did the fifth step with him. I was done and he goes, Alright Chuck, you’re human, thanks for sharing, have a nice day. Which is the definition of how you get rid of shame. I spent the time with the therapist and it was just really bizarre when you talk about things happening. 
I also went to DVR and said, Hey, I want to do this. I did an orientation and he said, What do you want to do? I have no idea. He said, What have you done? I said, How long do you have? [laughs] Security, asbestos removal, cables, sales, advertising, marketing, drug dealing, taxi service. [laughs] They have a series of tests and they do a personality test, an interest inventory, a manual dexterity test, an IQ test, puzzle things. I rocked the puzzle things. The guy was like, That’s one of the fastest I’ve ever seen anyone do that. They send it off, compile the score, and tell you everything. I said, I’ve been making good decisions up until this point -- the twelve steps at this point. I’m letting go; letting God, let’s just see what the plan is. 
I come in, Jeff Parkin was my counselor, he comes in and I go in and sit down. He says, Let’s look at your test results. He pulled out the file and said, Well, according to your skills your number one career that you’re best suited for is actor. We won’t pay for that. Tends not to have such a good success rate. [laughs] That was the first category. That was the number one. The next category was beauty salon operator, floral designer. I had no idea I was gay! [laughs] Stereotyping; don’t take that personally! I don’t feel that way, but what I thought at the time was, Great! I’m not a drug addict. I’ve got kids, how am I going to provide for them. In that same grouping was psychologist, counselor. 
AS: Right. Someone that works with people.
CH: Someone that works with people. I thought, I’m already in on this whole drug addict thing. It was believed that most counselors at that point -- historically we know differently -- were people in recovery and that you needed to be in recovery to be effective. The whole idea that one addict helping another addict, which is very effective. I said, I’ll do the chemical dependence counseling thing. At that point it was a two-year program at Inver Hills [Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota]. I went and got signed up at Inver Hills, I took the tests, and I only scored a couple that were over the one hundred -- I had to take a few remedial math class, but other than that everything was over one hundred, which wasn’t bad considering eighteen to thirty-one I hadn’t had an education. 
They said to take classes that you like so you can have some time to get used to college. Take a class that you like and that you think you’ll do well at. I took creative problem solving for one and I took a writing one because I have always had a flare and a knack for writing, and then I took a math class that was like introduction to algebra or something. For some reason I don’t have a mind that things algebraically. I’m not a linear sequential person. I think very geometrically and am more spatial. Those things just make sense to me. Algebra just doesn’t work. 
My first day of my first class -- I am thirty-one years old -- this is January 3, 1996. I am all of ninety days sober at that point. I go in. You think a guy would be comfortable for all the things he has been through. I was totally insecure. I’m going to be the old guy in the community college school with the kids who couldn’t get into the good colleges go! That’s not true, but that’s what I’m thinking. I walk into class and there were only a couple of people in there. There were two that looked like they were nineteen or twenty, and there was a woman who looked to be about my age so I went and sat by her. I did and that was my introduction to college. 
The college went really well. The woman that I sat next to is now my wife. 
AS: Honestly? Oh my gosh. I had a feeling you were going to say that. 
CH: It was the creative problem solving class and it worked really well for me. I took it because it was fun, it would be interesting, and I had a knack for it. My now wife took it because it fulfilled criteria in two core areas and therefore it would mean she would have to take one less class. That is about all you need to know about her and I to understand the nature of our relationship. She was actually going into marketing and advertising. I obviously had just come out of that among other things. She liked the books from the classes I was taking. She never considered social work. 
I was going to school and decided I was going to -- because I have to have a plan -- I was going to get a two year degree, become a chemical dependency counselor while I finish my four year degree with a bachelors in social work. Did my master’s in social work so I could be an LICSW [licensed individual clinical social worker]. I had this eight-year plan lined up. She liked my classes so much and had never considered being a social worker that she flipped her classes. She was going to school because she had been laid off and had a package from her employer to go to school. She is an LICSW now, which I never got because I ended up in administration. She jokes because she says, You knew you would always have LICSW after your name, you just didn’t know it would say, Mrs. Charles Hilger, LICSW. [laughs]
AS: Did you finish your alcohol and drug --
CH: I did. I finished my two years and I did have a knack for it. It was daunting because the professor would be like, Oh you’re the -- it was unfair. I remember I was telling my therapist about it and she’s like, Oh, you’re the superstar? I don’t know what that means, but it stuck with me. I was taking these classes and getting As in these classes. I was thinking, These teachers are dumb because I can’t be this smart.
AS: Right. You are still in that mindset. 
CH: Over time it bears out and I graduated after two years. I had taken a job as a tech in a halfway house overnight so I could study. I always give my wife a hard time because I say, I was thirty-one years old, three months sober, no driver’s license, no vehicle, living downstairs in my parents’ duplex with my dad driving me back and forth to school, with a job -- don’t take this the wrong way -- I was monitoring security alarms overnight and usually when we met, if your alarm goes off at your house I’m the one that calls the police. It was like for seven or eight bucks an hour. At thirty-one. Is that like a good social experiment, or what? I have no idea. Oh, this will be fun! Let’s see where this goes. I mean, what was she thinking. [laughs]
I finish my two years. She had taken a job at detox as a tech, I had taken a job at Cochlear Programs and they happen to be next to each other. I worked for a year as a tech while I was going to school. They hired me the day I graduated to start detox as a counselor. I worked at detox for six years, which was a great experience. I saw about a thousand patients a year. That’s a lot of patients over six years to assessments with. I continued and did my bachelor’s degree in social work. We moved in together in ‘97 and got married in 2002. We blended our families. She has a son that is the same age as mine. Our sons are just six months apart. They were fast friends at the age of seven when they met and they are still fast friends. 
I was finishing up my bachelor’s at University of Wisconsin River Falls where Kinnic Falls campus is located. No irony left on me there. I still go back there every semester and talk to their class. 
AS: Talk to which class?
CH: Use, abuse, and addiction. About harm reduction services. I went into working with opiate addiction. My wife and I worked side by side as counselors for about two of the years of detox after I became a counselor and she became a counselor. She did that for like two years and then we finished our BSW and she wanted to do something else. She went off and did a couple other things and ended up working in a methadone clinic at some point and said to me, This is great because you have patients for two years. If we are going to LICSWs this most looks like the therapeutic model where you have these patients engaged in mental health care and counseling for a long time. It’s a great training ground because you have the same fifty patients. 
I applied to that company as well and I went to a different location than where she was at. I started working in 2003. I was a counselor for a year. The company was a national one and they didn’t have a lot of leadership or strength here. The treatment director resigned and I applied for the position. It was three counselors in the clinic -- it was a small clinic. I think there were 150 patients in the clinic at that time. I took over as the treatment director. 
AS: Where is this?
CH: Dakota Metro. 
AS: In the Twin Cities?
CH: Yeah, down in Burnsville. 
AS: It is a methadone clinic?
CH: It is a methadone clinic owned by a management group. I don’t want to be disparaging towards them. 
AS: What year is this?
CH: This is 2003. In 2004 I was a counselor. In 2004 I took over as the treatment director. I made a few changes and the clinic took off. I had to double the size of the clinic. We just did really well. I was fortunate enough to find a few really solid staff members, enough people that knew enough about the treatment modality that I didn’t know yet like the pharmacy and the nursing piece. I used the medical model because I worked in detox before. 
I do have my license back by this point. [laughs] In the spring of ‘96 Brownie, my wife, gave me the money to pay to take my test and get my license back. She was tired of driving me around. My dad gave up the job he was like, You got it now! 
The clinic took off and we did really well. I got a call from a friend of mine I knew from the state. I knew him from working at detox next door. He was like, Hey, just so you know another national company is sniffing around Minnesota looking to open clinics. I notified my boss and he notified the CEO and he called me and said, The only way to stop this is to open up more clinics and I want you to do a footprint, get you boots on the ground -- you know Minnesota better than anybody -- and tell me where to put three clinics. Give me three locations. 
I worked that out and figured it out with my process and about a year after I became treatment director and I had put this proposal together and my regional director resigned. He was a man I have tremendous amount of respect for and is an amazing individual, great boss, one of the best people I have ever worked with. I was sorry to see him go. It was between me and another guy for the regional director because two of us applied for that position. I had kind of done that groundwork for the clinic. The CEO knew what I could do but the other guy applied and he had been there longer. In fact, he was the guy that hired me, and I got the job. He hired me as a counselor, then we were peers, and then I got hired. I found out he didn’t know how to run a clinic and I had to terminate him. Terminating the guy that hires you is not fun. 
I opened up two methadone clinics for them here in the state. We never did open the third one. 
AS: Was that Valhalla?
CH: No that would be St. Cloud Metro and Rochester Metro. For five years I had seven clinics in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Indiana. In that time, because it is a national company I got to work with Dr. Thomas Payte since the late sixties, you look at the tip forty-three, which has all the ‘this is how you do methadone.’ He is one of the authors. He is one of the top ten in the field. When they point to the elders he is one of them. He knew the people that pioneered methadone. Doctors Dole and Niswane. Just an amazing physician. He has a heart for patients and a realistic approach and view of methadone. I got to work under him for five years. 
The company I was working for didn’t allow for things like additional care like mental health. I was working on my master’s degree for mental health so I really had a penchant for that. They thought it was a good idea but it wasn’t baked into their model. If you add in mental health you end up reducing your profit. They didn’t want to do that. It was their model.
AS: Because it was just maintenance?
CH: They had all the licensed drug and alcohol counselors, right. When you try to start bringing in higher cost therapists
AS: ...let’s treat that problem that you keep talking about. I see. 
CH: The man I worked for was very difficult to work for. People are surprised that I worked for the five years that I did. Eventually we agreed to disagree on the topic of patient care and I elected to leave. I figured I was finishing my MSW and I needed my hours so I would go work at House of Charity in downtown Minneapolis for a person who used to be a treatment director. I work for her now. We always got along great. I was never one to be caught up on [1. 38.59]. Let’s just get the job done and do it right. 
I started working at House of Charity, which is a group-housing unit with service for mental health, CD [chemical dependency] services, the whole nine yards. We were doing groups. Can’t do mental health yet, at that point, but I’m doing groups. I have all the methadone patients on the side because that’s what I do on the side. I am taking on consulting jobs so I’m doing some consulting for Valhalla, which is a relatively new MAT [medically assisted treatment] program at that point. My friend at House of Charity quit and they offered me the treatment director job. If I take the treatment director job I’m never going to get my hours for my LICSW. 
I was just finishing my master’s at that point. I got to the point at St. Thomas [St. Paul, Minnesota] where I was finishing my master’s degree, it has a clinical focus, but I did the two-year program. I was in year five of the two year program when my advisor who I had never talked to before called me in and said, You will not be the first person to take my two year program and turn it into a six year program -- this was in March -- You have until the end of the semester to finish or we are going to wash you out and you cannot return. I had all the research, I had all the data, and it was just a matter of getting it written. I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. I finished it. 
I was consulting with Valhalla and when they found out I had this treatment director job they were like, We could use you here if you are interested in leaving that job. They were getting ready for their first accreditation. I told them I would work for them although I had a five-year noncompete with my other employer so I had to be a counselor, I couldn’t do anything else. I was a counselor that was writing policy procedures manual. And I had a [unclear]. At that point I was the eighth employee hired. My wife had left that other methadone treatment program and opened a locked CD treatment program for people that were committed down in Hastings and the Cochran Programs. She moved to Valhalla as a counselor. This was the third company we had worked for together, which works for us. 
Valhalla was owned by a person that was on a methadone treatment program. The company that I used to work for -- I didn’t know him -- but he wasn’t happy with the way he was treated so he established Valhalla in a way that was a place that I would want to go to and I would want to be treated in terms of how counseling is handled, how insurance is handled, how medical services are handled. His idea was a much broader approach. My only piece when I went to Valhalla was, It is fine but we have to do mental health care. I won’t do this unless we do mental health, thinking at some point I might get my hours in. [laughs] 
They agreed to that. I was the eighth employee. We had one hundred and fifty patients and that was October of 2009. Through a whole series of things like the increase in the opiate epidemic, someone who knew how to do marketing, the expansion of services into mental health. We took that clinic from one hundred and fifty to one thousand active patients in just three years, which means we are hiring a counselor every six weeks. It is crazy to think what we went through. We opened a second location in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and transferred like one hundred and fifty patients because they were actually closer to that location, and the company was sold last June when we had about 2,300 patients in 2016. 
We integrated mental health services so that patients coming in would get a mental health diagnostic assessment in addition to the regular counseling services. We had full time nurse practitioners and physician's assistants and doctors that are on site most of the day and most of the days. Just a whole different level of care. We had expanded Valhalla Place to add a medical clinic that you couldn’t do certain things from the treatment program to provide better and consistent medical care to patients with persisting issues besides do the physicals and the annual physicals. That was really huge. It has been amazing. 
I never did go and get my hours. I actually never sat for the licensed social worker test that you sit after you’ve finished your master’s. In a short time in Valhalla I moved from counselor to treatment director to executive director. They tried to come after me for the noncompete, but it’s pretty difficult when that’s what a person does for a living; for their career. It would have been an uphill battle for them. It is a different model and I’m not using what I learned there. I’m using what I knew what I wanted to do and it fit with what the owners wanted. 
AS: The pursuit of your interest in counseling led you to change the model in a methadone clinic setting that actually has improved patient outcomes? Was that a new model for Minnesota to have the mental health aspect integrated?
CH: There are other people that have done integrated mental health models. It really depends on the philosophy and the approach. Many of them are in larger mental health centers and medical centers. They are driven by a medical model. Instead of being patient centered it is really about, This is our program and this is what our physicians do. It is not guided by the patient and if the patient is or isn’t progressing through treatment. Is their quality of life stable? Are they looking for something better? Can we help them improve that if they want to? Is this as good as it gets and we need to be okay with that? A lot of the patients we have at Valhalla and a lot of the initial growth were patients that have been on a clinic tour for years because they would spend three years at a clinic, they wouldn’t get the results that the clinic expected, they would kick them out, they would go to the next clinic. Wanting to grow, people are always taking patients even though they know -- they think it’s going to be different or whatever. 
With the mental health patient in tact we can take the more challenging patient and we can work with them. We don’t say that this is going to get that much better. You’ve been in four methadone programs in the last two years and it hasn’t gotten any better. You’ve been through eight inpatient treatments, three outpatient treatments, four group residential housing. Why do you think if we provide you with methadone it is going to be any different? We fight for stabilization. Let’s not expect more than what it is going to be. 
There is a percentage of the population that just kept doing a clinic shuffle. Mental health issues kept getting in the way and they do fine for a while and then they have a manic episode and they go off and do something silly. They would sell their doses or whatever and then no one wants to deal with them. Just developing that and being able to do the medical care. Now the patient is more invested in the program that they know they can go to where they say methadone and they know the provider is not going to roll their eyes or say, I’m not going to prescribe you any pain medications.
AS: It is destigmatized. 
CH: It is. It is completely destigmatized. People don’t tend to move away as much from our programs. When you look at our numbers ninety percent of patients that have been on the program for a year are free of any illicit opiate use. 
AS: For one year?
CH: Not for one year. At one year. When you do the measurement, ninety percent are testing negative for any illicit substances. Seventy percent test free of any elicit substances. Between the seventy and the ninety mark is predominantly people who continue to use THC [tetrahydrocannabinol]. I’m not going to put someone out, but is this something that is interfering with your quality of life? Do you want to change it because it is illegal? You might get drug tested at your job? If those things aren’t an issue --
AS: You don’t kick them out of the program. 
CH: No, I’m not going to kick them out of the program. Anyway, it is still ultimately their choice to make. The funder at some point may say, If you continue to stay positive you’re going to do -- we offer high intensity outpatient treatment, which is a twelve week program for five days a week, three hours at a time for twelve weeks for people that have more challenges making the changes they have to make. There is no reason to add the outpatient element. Some of them just want to go to in order to get the stability. The outpatient piece has been critical. 
The counselors get more training than they ever did, but they still don’t have the depth of knowledge that licensed mental health professionals have. They are teaming up to work with this patient and figure out what needs to happen. 
It has been a fascinating journey. The pieces that made the biggest difference were the things that weren’t supposed to -- certainly there is serendipity that has come into play with the church thing and a couple of other things, but the right place at the right time, everything happens for a reason, whatever you make peace with or you look at it. I was the person that was cornered in for treatment, which we all know never works. I thought that was kind of funny. 
AS: It didn’t work right away. 
CH: The Road Less Travelled was a book that I picked out for a guy that had been my roommate at the treatment center. We went down to the library and I picked it out for him and I said, You’ve got to read this because I think this is what you’re looking for. [laughs] He elected to leave the halfway house, so he left it on my desk. He said, Would you mind returning this? It is the only reason I read it. There are a number of those very crystallized moments where I’m like, That was weird. Getting into school, therapy was huge, the mental health piece, the treatment piece was huge. My twelve-step piece was critical as well. I did CA groups as well, cocaine anonymous groups, for two years at ADAP. I would still go back frequently probably for three years. Eventually I stopped going and haven’t been going for years. 
Doing harm reduction strategies, we do syringe exchange, we distribution of Narcan and training for Narcan across the state. The numbers that were coming back for 2016 it looks like more than twenty-five percent of the kits that we distribute are being used to reverse overdoses. Huge numbers. We distributed over two thousand last year. Five hundred reversals out of those two thousand kits. 
Watching people go through recovery over the years, people that I still see today that we on my original fifty case load in 2003 -- I always joke that you never forget your first fifty. I’ve certainly lost patients over the years. My belief in the dogmatic approach to recovery, you know the ‘once an addict always an addict’ just doesn’t apply. There are people that it is never safe for them to go back to using. Using anything, using something. People have different physiologies, they respond differently with chemicals. 
I had a bad accident in 2000 and they sent me home after five days in the hospital. I had a broken collarbone, five broken ribs, and a punctured lung. They sent me home with Dilaudid, and all this stuff I had been listening to people saying were great drugs. I took them with a little bit of, I need to get rid of this pain, and a little bit of anticipation. I don’t get it. They don’t do anything for me. I am a go fast guy. Thank God they don’t treat those things with cocaine because it would have been a different story. [laughs] It would not have worked out too well. I believe that our mindset that because someone has problems at some point in their life with alcohol or drugs does not mean that they cannot ever use again. I would be irresponsible if I ran around saying that everybody should find out if it was just a phase. I would never do that. Several years ago I made the conscious decision that drinking at this point in my life would be okay for me. Two and a half years into it I consumed it socially, and I have never gotten any problems because of drinking. 
AS: You still have your license. 
CH: I still have my license. [laughs] My methadone piece when I do the eight hour MAT 101 and I kind of roll this out slowly in the presentation but I still have narcolepsy and at age thirty-five it started to get bad to the point where I was counseling in my first year at MAT and I was starting to have problems staying awake with patients, which doesn’t convey any positive regard. They were like, Chuck, come on. The good part is coming. Is your dose okay? Are you nodding? Do my pupils look small? 
I went to the doctor because they told me it wouldn’t get any worse. He told me I was just getting older so the effects are more pronounced. Thanks. That’s getting worse. I don’t care how you sort it, that’s getting worse. 
Despite the fact that based on the twelve-step philosophy that taking any stimulants -- because stimulants are my drug of choice -- is a slippery slope, then ultimately is going to lead back to regular use and or abuse or addiction, ultimately addiction and jails or those types of institutions, if not death, I elected that I did not want to sit at home and be on Social Security because I cannot drive my car because I cannot stay awake behind the wheel, which is what ultimately could have happened. I elected to take the risk and take stimulants. I am fifty-two and I have been on stimulants for -- I joke and say the only time I ever abused them was the morning I had four ibuprofen in one hand and four of my ten milligram Ritalins for the day. Instead of taking the four Ibuprofen I took the four Ritilin. That morning went by really fast. Other than that I have never abused it. I have never taken it in excess and it allows me to function. Here I am now, here I am a person taking a kissing cousin to my drug of choice. People abuse Ritilin; it is a stimulant. Stimulants are my drug of choice but I take them to maintain functioning so that I can do what I need to do. Without it I wouldn’t be able to do that and it would definitely have a negative impact on my quality of life. Yet, my patients that take methadone, and nobody ever questions whether I’m sober or not. 
When I started drinking and I did tell a few of the guys that have been in long-term sobriety with me -- and I still consider myself in recovery and long term sobriety and recovery -- that I had made the decision, because I didn’t want to keep any secrets, we were talking about, Oh you’ve got so much time and I said, Well, I’m not counting alcohol anymore. They were like, What do you mean you aren’t counting alcohol? I was like, Well, six months ago I decided it wasn’t an issue for me. I’m not sober from alcohol anymore. They threw me out of the damn club because now I wasn’t really an addict. Now I’m not really a person in recovery because nobody can do that. Nobody could ever go through a phase in their life where they used alcohol or another drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism, and then at some point later in their life go back to use at a regular level. They would say, You were never an alcoholic anyway. 
To go back to the methadone thing my patients taking the kissing cousin to their drug of choice in order to function on a daily basis -- it can be abused -- some of our patients do abuse that, they mix it with other medications, they do it in order to get an effect. The vast majority, eighty percent of the patients don’t do that and it works just fine. Fifteen years ago even to say that out loud it could put your whole career into jeopardy. I actually work it into the eight-hour medication assisted treatment --
AS: To say what out loud?
CH: To say that people could return to normal, social consumption drug of choice, perhaps without the same outcome or the same consequences. 
AS: Even something like an opioid?
CH: Even something like an opioid. An opioid is just another drug. It affects a different area of the brain and it is a very primary area that is part of our reward circuitry for sure. It is part of our survival function; it ties into all those pieces. But, to say that a person, and certainly we have evidence of this, I don’t know if people that are going to go back and try to start using -- I’m not going to go back and start using cocaine recreationally. Alcohol fits more into the social strata.
AS: I’m thinking heroin. Some people are using it socially, at first, but then they get hooked. 
CH: More people recover on their own from anything than they ever do by going to treatment. 
AS: We just don’t know who those people are. 
CH: At best, the studies that we have show a twenty percent success rate. 
AS: For treatment?
CH: For treatment. When you try and say it is only successful twenty percent of the time people say, Is that their first or second time through? People really get it their second time through. There are people that should never use again. I have seen people that have one beer and they change. For whatever reason -- chemically it is a bad idea. I certainly have heard stories of people who have two beers and go to lockup. You shouldn’t drink ever. It’s not like that for me. I think we need more people out there that say people who go through midlife crises -- they lose their jobs, grief and loss issues, and they may choose to use alcohol or some other drug as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Ultimately more often than not they move away from it on their own without having to go to treatment. Second of all, if they ever use again it doesn’t mean you are going to be dead in six months. 
With opiates compared to drinking you are dealing with a whole other level of unknowns. You’ve got carfentanyl, you’ve got fentanyl, you just don’t know. There’re so many variables. People die from alcohol related disorders every year; more people than are dying from opioids. It’s just quicker with opiates.
AS: Right, you die much faster. 
CH: That’s an important piece to get out there. I don’t think we are doing anyone any favor with the war on drugs. 
AS: That’s a whole other issue. 
CH: I will point to Portugal and leave it at that. Their numbers are there. You can’t say it would be the same across cultures, but I think it would be pretty darn close. Statistically it would be in the ballpark. 
AS: Thank you, Chuck. 
CH: You didn’t ask any questions. 
AS: I didn’t have to! That’s what’s good.
CH: It’s hard! This is going to be a twenty-hour story if I did all the twists and turns. 
AS: We might need a part two that is just an hour. I might want to come back and talk about harm reduction and where you think this is going. 
CH: That’s right! That’s how we started out and I completely disregarded that. 
AS: I think it is really important because it helps me filter and think about how I am going to write. When I wrote the chapter about mothers I didn’t know what was really going to come up. There was this piece about them being embattled. 
CH: I hope you wrote something about the crack babies. I’m still waiting to see something about the crack babies. 
AS: They aren’t there!
CH: What do you mean they aren’t there? Sorry. [laughs]
AS: Someone else already wrote that: Susan Campbell. This idea of mothers being embattled and embattled motherhood and also being addicted to mothering in some way. So, themes come up. That’s why I enjoy hearing the whole story. Thank you so much. 
CH: There are so many pieces. "

Duluth, Minnesota
Deb Holman      -DH
Amy Sullivan    -AS
AS: It’s May nineteenth, this is Amy Sullivan I’m with Deb Holman. Deb do you give me permission to record this interview and will you state your name?
DH: Yes, I give you permission. This is Deb Holman.
AS: Thanks. Okay so Cloquet. I heard you were born in Cloquet.
DH: So do you want me to start way back at age one or whatever?
AS: Just what you remember of your childhood.
DH: I kind of grew up in Cloquet. A history of alcoholism in the family, my grandpa was an alcoholic, my dad was an alcoholic. My grandpa committed suicide when I was in second grade. I always remember being scared of my grandpa because he was a mean drunk. Then my dad’s an alcoholic too. Growing up he was kind of like the weekend drunk. He’d get paid on Thursday and Sunday or something. There’d always be some kind of blow out on Saturday generally. Mom was super stable, obviously probably co-dependent. Just one of those people  that everyone loved, just because that’s just the way she was. Then I started acting out kind of young, blaming it on my dad. Being in treatment as early as age fourteen just for getting in trouble for drinking, skipping school, whatever I was doing, fights at home.
AS: You were sent to treatment?
DH: I’m trying to think of what happened. I’d end up in different places. I ended up getting a social worker. I used to run away and drink. I’d run away to Duluth which was fun.
AS: How far is that?
DH: It’s only like twenty miles. Looking back on it my home life was not bad, not really. My mom was stable. The dad thing, there was never any sexual abuse or anything like that. A lot of probably verbal abuse and some physical but not a lot. He was more the type that would break things. I don’t recall that. Sometimes I go, “Are there things you’ve shut out?” Sometimes I can’t remember. I really haven’t had a huge indication that anything super bad happened. St. Luke's used to be the detox center here in Duluth and I think I'd end up there a few times. 
AS: As a teenager?
DH: This is starting at fourteen. Then I ended up in some treatment program in Duluth and ran away. Two days later me and this girl ran away and then we ended back up at St. Luke's detox. Then we ran away from there too in our jammies. It's all about getting loaded at that time. Somehow, I don't know if I got committed or if I've got a social worker at this point. I ended up going to a group home in St. Paul for wayward ladies. Booth Brown House. It's still there today but it has a different kind of, I don't know who they work with these days. It's a Salvation Army program. I think I spent about six months there. It actually was a lot of fun, the ladies and stuff but looking back on it some of them I wish I could connect with but I can't find a lot of them. I spent about six months there and continued to drink or use. I was one of those that would use whatever. There was no like really heroin or coke or anything like that in my life at that time in my life. 
AS: What year were you born?
DH: '60. Then at some point…
AS: So this is the mid-70s you're in treatment?
DH: Yes.
AS: What was treatment like at that point? What are they doing?
DH: Oh I'll be getting to that. Oh gosh. I get a little confused but I think I have a pretty good recollection of it. I got in trouble at the group home kind of using and stuff like that. Then I ended up going to St. Mary's which is at Riverside there. 
AS: Oh the hospital?
DH: Yes, they had a treatment program. What do they call it now? I'm drawing a blank. 
AS: Was it Synanon?
DH: No, what was it? Oh God I can't believe I can't think of it. It was very confrontational.
AS: If you think of it you can just text me the word. 
DH: I cannot believe I can't think of it right now. It had a name, their treatment way. You had to sign a contract. If you left the program and wanted to come back you had to be willing to sacrifice something. Some people cut their hair or shaved their head. Then at that point they made people wear signs and stuff too. I was fourteen or fifteen I think, fourteen probably, and I wore this sign that said, ""I'm a lying, cheating, slippery, slick junkie."" I wish I had a picture of it. I should make one just for kicks. Part of my thought is that, ""Well, you made me one."" 
AS: They referred to you as a junkie?
DH: You made me wear this sign so I became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Then the other part of me knows there's addiction in my family. I know I have the addictive personality. 
AS: That was traumatic for a teenage girl.
DH: I think it was but I didn't realize it at the time. I think of course I ran from there. Then I got sent to Willmar State Hospital. I got put with the adults and it was the state hospital and the treatment. We interacted, they still had the tunnels, I don't know if they still do. They had a canteen and you mingled with the MI people. I still remember a few, Charlie, Linnette, Robert. It's like I can picture them clear as day, you know. Then there happened to be an older gal from Cloquet that was in treatment there at the time and I knew her. We kind of buddied up or whatever. I didn't really talk about my childhood partying with the Weed Weevils and stuff like that. That's kind of where it all started. That's kind of what got me in trouble. I think I stole a car one time too. That might be what started it all.
AS: Because you did something illegal. 
DH: It was Easter, we went to a keg at Chub Lake and then we went to some bar. You know what? This was later. I'm getting a little mixed up. Where did I leave off? The Willmar State Hospital. I think after that I got to go back to Cloquet but of course I never stopped using. Then I suppose if you jump ahead to graduation or whatever. Then I came down to the Cities. 
AS: After high school graduation?
DH: Yeah. Sue and them went to Colorado, they went travelling. I think I went out. I did meet up with them once that summer. I think I just got some little job. I've always been like, I'd say I'm the super responsible person, pretty responsible. Like right now the difference between me and Sue, and I envy her for it sometimes, is I like a homebase. I need to have my comfort zone. Then the other part of me right now is feeling super stressed because I've got five dogs. I'm getting totally kind of burnt out. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I wish I could escape it. Right now I'm just looking for the one good, positive thing that happens every day. It's really somewhat bleak out here. I don't know how to describe it. There are things that rejuvenate me so I'm not totally there yet but I'm aware. 
AS: What's your job right now? 
DH: I do street outreach with homeless folks. Another thing I'll mention because I know that I feel the stress that I feel that led me up to my last OD and things like that. I kind of know when I'm there but I'm really good at controlling it because when I did overdose...or at least I think I'm good at controlling it. You've got to be careful. I'm just really aware of my inner self and when I'm at that point where it could happen. Then I go well, I've got all these dogs I've got to take care of. I'm loyal to them and my last dog sat through the OD with me. I always felt kind of bad about that but we both made it through somehow. I don't know if that makes sense. I just need that spot. 
AS: So let's go back to graduating from high school. 
DH: I graduated from high school, took off to the Cities and it's kind of all somewhat of a blur. I got some little job at a photo place. I just got an apartment and started living down there. I was hanging around with some Cloquet people. At that time we were using drugs. At that time it was cocaine that was the big craze. 
AS: Are we like in the 80s right now?
DH: I graduated in '78. Yeah I pretty much worked at Maidl Photo for quite some time. I just continued to be a partier. I'm trying to think, by this time I had already been through one, two, three, I think three treatments before I was eighteen. I don't know if there was four. Every time that I started to get to the point where maybe things were getting out of control or I'm like missing work now the answer I would always think would be, ""Go to treatment."" Now looking back I don't think that was the answer. I think that was ingrained in me because of my experience. 
Then 1981, I think, I went to Twin Town. That was when it was mixed. I'm still working at the same job. From Twin Town I went to a halfway house and did the sober thing for awhile. There's just all these little groups of treatment people in my life. I'm starting to think of them all. I'm never one of those people that's been totally sober like I always smoked pot and I always will I'm sure. That doesn't go over well with the AA crowd. Especially back then. There might be a little more, I don't know what it's like now. I still think they're pretty strict on it. I'm just going to chronic smoke too. I went to Twin Town and then went to a halfway house. I was always the type of person who got really connected and hooked up. I would do well and make friends. I can't even remember. After the halfway house I moved in with somebody. I went to Jane Dickman. It used to be Jane Dickman and Team House. They were affiliated like sister, brother house or something. 
I think all this time too I didn't know if I liked boys or girls. I had a lot of boyfriends in high school. I think I started having my first attractions towards women. Of course I always fall in love with straight women. A lot of them want to try it though too. There's a few stories there too. That was going on. I think at the time I had a boyfriend at that time. I moved in with somebody from the halfway house. Eventually just back to using again at some point. I think she moved back to New York. I'm trying to think where I was working at that time. I think I was still at the photo place. Yeah. I worked there a long time. 
AS: Through all this you kept your job?
DH: Yep, I did. That's what I mean a responsible user. I always knew the way to get out and just go to your employee assistance program and now I'm going to treatment. Everything is kind of a blur when I'm thinking about it like this. We're in 1981. All of my relapse crises are over women too. It seems like there's usually a woman involved so now I'm single. There's always a woman involved in it. Sue will back that up too I bet. Now I'm thinking of all them too. Some of them were f'ing crazy. So then I think I moved out on my own. I'm still working at the photo place. Sue went back to New York. I was using. I wasn't using hard drugs at that time. It was just pot and alcohol. Alcohol can tend to get me in trouble. That's one of the reasons I don't drink now because I'm a drug user and the alcohol, I'll get to the point after being intoxicated day after day that I go ""I hate drinking and I like drugs so where's the drugs?"" Then you're back at it. I'm a super binger too. I might have a few but I try not to get drunk. 
So then I got some other job in St. Paul. I'm working in Eden Prairie at control data. I was always a workaholic. So anytime I wasn't using I was working two jobs or three jobs. So I definitely still have that issue too. I have two jobs and I have for like ten years. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
AS: You work two jobs now?
DH: Yeah. 
AS: What do you do?
DH: They all kind of roll together. HDC is like one of the mental health agencies in town and they have a homeless project. I just do outreach for them. 
AS: You do outreach in both of your jobs?
DH: Yeah. It's the same people. My thought process on it is that my job at CHUM, it's never a forty hour a week. This stuff doesn't ever end. 
AS: What does CHUM stand for again?
DH: It used to be Churches United in Ministry but now the synagogue joined so they can't use the church word anymore so it's just CHUM. 
So now, during this time my mom got cancer. She was diagnosed I think it was, I have a hard time remembering dates. September of '86 maybe. Then she died in July of '87. It went super fast. At that time I took a leave of absence. We knew it wasn't good from the start. We had prearranged that my mom didn't want, my mom and dad had gotten divorced around eighteen. I always felt like I kind of pushed that. I kind of felt bad. As I look back on it now I was a little brat to my parents. It's like, ""Why was I like that?"" Maybe part of it's because they're both dead. 
AS: That you feel guilty now about that?
DH: I try not to feel guilty just because I know that it's useless. 
AS: How many other siblings did you have?
DH: Three, two brothers and a sister. 
AS: Were you kind of in the middle?
DH: I was the oldest. I laid the ground down. 
AS: Don't you think some of that might have to do with the fact that your dad was alcoholic and your mom was so dependable. You're kind of a combination. 
DH: I'm both. I could go either way. Right now I'm on the whatever side. 
AS: Or are you finding balance? You're keeping a better balance. 
DH: I try. That can be a challenge for me too just because I do tend to work a lot. Last night I was trying to be home at seven thirty by all means and I didn't get there until eight thirty. 
Then my mom dies. It had been prearranged that my sister and I would be guardians for my brother. My dad was drinking heavily. 
AS: He was under eighteen?
DH: He was thirteen. At that time I would call my dad homeless, precariously housed. Sleeping on Grandma's couch. There was a bar in town called The Northeastern. Me and Sue can joke about Jerry. I don't take it personal when she says it. 
AS: Is Jerry your dad?
DH: Yeah. Old friends can joke. There was a homeless guy on the street one time who said, ""God I knew your dad. I used to drink with him."" It would get to the point where I'd be like, ""Shut the fuck up."" He was my dad. Oh my God. Thank God he's gone. He used to drive me nuts. Then I moved back to Cloquet, duh, to live with my brother. My other brother Mark moved out of the house. I'll slow down a little bit. I got some job at the match mill. 
AS: The one that just got bought?
DH: Did it? Diamond Brands. I didn't know that. I don't pay attention. I probably hated it. 
AS: You got a job at the match factory?
DH: Then I'm living at my mom's house with my brother. Then things went on, I'm working. Thinking back on it I did start using then at that time. My friend got married in August. She got pissed at me. We talked about this recently, it was because the coke was flying around. I was weepy because my mom's been dead a month. One of those, not a good situation. I didn't know how to deal with it. I had this little kid too to deal with it. Both of my parents are dead. My dad was suddenly. 
AS: Your dad died before your mom?
DH: No, it's coming shortly. When you know someone's going to die, I grieved all that time. I remember the day she told me she had this lump. I like bawled from Duluth to Minneapolis listening to the same song the whole way. It was making me cry. I was just worried about what's going to happen. I cried a lot from September to July. When she died I was all cried out. Then I moved in with my brother. I pretty much told my dad, ""Screw you. I'm done with you. This is your responsibility and I'm here.” I loved Jerry. He was a good guy too but just a drunk. That's probably why I work with drunks, one reason, or can tolerate them. 
Fast forward, going through all this grief stuff. I tried to do everything like my mom. I love dumplings and I remember trying to make them and it didn't work out and I started bawling. Then dabbling with use on and off through that whole thing. Then having this new responsibility now too and really being responsible for Steve. The one thing about Steve was that I was fourteen when he was born. He was this cute little baby and I took him everywhere. When I moved to the cities every year, every summer he'd come down. I spent a lot of time with this kid. It was already kind of like he was partly my kid. Then of course he's been this football kid, active in everything, As. Then he starts to be a user. I'm working shift work. Not really knowing how to deal with that. 
February of '88 my dad is super drunk and falls down some stairs at someone's house and ends up in the Emergency Room. To make a long story short he's brain dead. We made the decision to unplug him. It was kind of too soon. It's like six months later. My little brother, I felt so bad for him and my grandma. Then we go through that. They're both dead. I worked at the match mill for awhile. Then I got hired at USG. I kept trying to upgrade. 
AS: What's that?
DH: It's another mill in town. Then eventually ended up at Potlatch which is like the mothership. They all want to be there if you live in Cloquet. Then my partying started again, mostly cocaine use. I could do it for a long time, go to work. You could call in sick in those days. You could go to work loaded in those days. People got loaded at work. It's just the way it was. Then I also moved my girlfriend up here after my dad died. Nobody really knew or it was something that wasn't talked about. There was really no ill feelings about it. I would say everybody was good about it. There was still some, I had some of that shame. I wasn't this real comfortable lesbian. I wasn't comfortable telling a lot of people. 
AS: People weren't really telling. 
DH: No one was really open at that time. Eventually I got into trouble again. The relationship too because of the drug use was having some issues. I had actually moved out of my mom's house by then. We had bought another house. I'm trying to think how things went down. My sister, if you look at the AA model she's the hero. At some point there was an issue. I think my brother Steve, I don't remember clearly how it went, he started partying and stuff. He had an accident. He was found in the morning as a John Doe. They didn't know who he was at first. He took off on his three wheeler at two in the morning in the winter drunker than hell. It turns out my cousin... let me stop for a minute until they go by. It's an issue right now. I don't know why. I wouldn't' say depressed, I don't know how to explain it. It isn't depression really. 
[Conversation about the weather]
AS: So you were talking about, you'd moved out of your mom's house and your sister was the hero. What do you mean? What happened?
DH: She had been going to college at UMD. She always had an issue about me being a user. She's a mean drunk and didn't really like the way me and Carol were doing things, the woman I was living with. Carol was a very positive influence on him. He'll tell you that too. Really a pretty level headed person. Drugs and alcohol too but was a musician. That's how she was making her living at that time. She travelled a lot. I think at some point there was some issue that we ended up moving out, buying a house, and my sister moved in with my brother. Then the accident happens. They were living together. I'm getting lost. We didn't buy our house by then, we were renting. Carol and I were renting. 
Anyways, Steve has this accident and we're all at the hospital. At first they didn't know if he was going to live or die just because it was a really serious head injury. He ended up making it. There was like this big argument about where's he going to go to rehab. Julie didn't want him with the lesbians. Things like that. I think he had to go to a rehab center for awhile. This is where things get a little fuzzy. Steve goes to rehab. I think he actually was staying with Carol and I. He had to kind of learn a lot of stuff over like talking and eating. I think he lost the vision in one eye. He can't smell anything. He's had complications since because of that. Then another really stressful time. We've already been through these two deaths and we all have the addictions gene or whatever. My brothers are drinkers. My sister is a drinker. Pretty much I'm just the pot smoker these days. Julie still, there's stories about her. I think she's getting better now  but up to even three years ago it's like oh my God just terrible that I take pot and Klonopin. Then what happened? 
At some point Carol and I started having problems because I was partying quite a bit. There was a little house. By this time we had bought a house and Steve moved in with us there too. He's living with us. He's partying. I think at some point she just got sick of all that. I wasn't a super good drunk. I don't know how to explain it. Drinking doesn't look good on me. I'll put it that way. I think eventually she moved out. I took it really hard. My brother is still there at the time. I really started hitting it hard. There's a little house attached to the garage that we rented out. My renter was a cocaine dealer. I'm like, ""Billy never pay me the rent in cocaine."" This has been going on for a long time, sneaking over to Billy's or whatever. Billy also worked at the papermill. Part of the thing being back in Cloquet too, eventually, not eventually but right away being gravitated to that group. I think at first I tried to be super responsible and the mom and take care of business. Then I fell into it again. After shift work at midnight or seven in the morning people go out drinking when the bar opens at eight because that's their morning. I just remember kind of being at the mill and I was definitely in a cocaine psychosis. 
AS: Did you work the night shift?
DH: Rotating shifts. Just kind of getting to the breakdown point with the addiction. That, ""Okay I can't go to work."" I knew how to play the game to get through that. Then I went to the mothership: Hazelden. I'm like, ""This is going to be it."" Looking back it's like that whole thing that was ingrained in me that you're an addict and you've got to go to treatment. I don't think that anymore. I go to Hazelden. I always loved treatment. I loved to connect with those people. Tatum O'Neal was there when I was there. I have her lip prints in my big book. She got pissed at me recently because I posted a picture on Instagram of when we were on the Lily Unit. I'm like, ""Whatever Tatum."" I didn't say we were in Hazelden, I just posted the picture. There were like six of us in the picture. 
AS: And you could see that it was her?
DH: I went and tagged her. I think I did. Whatever. She'll just have to get over it. It is what it is. Then I went to Hazelden. It was actually Christmas. I remember being there on Christmas. Then I went to Fellowship Club which is still there today. Did super well.
AS: Is that the St. Paul sober house?
DH: Yeah. The one on Watson off of West 7th. Kind of by the old brewery down there. I think I was at the halfway house four months. I had my house in Cloquet still. I was on worker's comp. At some point they talk me into, ""You can't go back. You've got to stay."" I really didn't want to come back to Cloquet either. I just decided to get an apartment down here. 
AS: In Duluth you mean?
DH: In the Cities. I'm sorry. In the Cities. Like a block from the halfway house was this fourplex that everybody that went through the halfway house moved into. Oh cops, I like him. 
AS: An officer just drove by. 
DH: He's waving away. 
AS: And waved at us. 
DH: They're pretty nice most of them. Susan Phillips at your little meeting. She's like, ""Oh Deb."" She's the one with the shaved head. She's like, ""I just see your cop pictures and I go it's a thing I know Deb because..."" She's very active in holding the police accountable for the brutality. I mean so am I. I try to portray good interactions with the police because I do interact with them in a good way quite often. They're very helpful to me and I want people to see that. It helps the homeless cause I think too. 
AS: It does because they know you're paying attention to everybody. 
DH: Yeah. This is what happened at Hazelden too. I'm not a person that, I think, I was the president at Fellowship Club. I had a good friend, a lifelong friend that was in treatment there too, like a leaving Las Vegas alcoholic she was. She never did quit drinking. I would visit her while I lived at the halfway house. Actually it was the day I was going to graduate I get called in by my counselor. She's like, ""Deb,"" she was from Texas. ""I've got some bad news. You know we're not going to be able to graduate you tonight."" Basically because I'm talking to people that are still using. 
AS: Because you were talking to people?
DH: And spending time with her and stuff like that. I'm like, ""She's my lifelong friend. I'm not going to abandon her. No, she's not a threat to my sobriety."" 
AS: For that reason you wouldn't graduate?
DH: Yeah and I think there was a few other people too that had left the house that I was associating with. That was frowned upon. Then they told me I had to get up and resign my presidency too. I'm like, ""You're fucking kidding me."" This is kind of obviously a sore spot with me. I never talked about like when my parents died I eventually ended up going to see a therapist who really was an amazing lady. I saw her for quite a few years. I go call her because I'm in an uproar. I said I was just going to leave then. It's like, ""Screw you guys I'll just leave. I don't care about your f'ing medallion."" Then they held the thing, that would be against medical advice and your insurance won't pay. I did the whole bullshit that they wanted me to do. The next day I came back super high and I'm like, I demanded them to accept me. I'm still the same Deb that left here yesterday. It's like I'm the type of person that keeps in touch with everybody. I've usually had relationships later with counselors, they've become friends and stuff. I thought it was such bullshit. It's just bullshit. It doesn't help anybody. 
AS: It almost drives you back to your addiction. 
DH: Yeah, it does. I think treatment's a lot more gentler these days. That was like '95, we're talking Hazelden too. They really think the only way is abstinence. I don't think they really believe in harm reduction in all. A little bit now? I don't really pay attention but I know I've had a few interactions with Moyers over with the wet houses. I don't know what he really thinks about needle exchange, we've never talked about that. He doesn't agree with the wet houses. I think I pulled it together rather quickly after getting high and getting right out of there. 
I got kicked out of the house then of course, trespassed, barred, whatever. I think if I stayed sober so many days then I could come back and I could get my medallion and stuff like that too. I think I did do that. I still had a connection to the house, I did. I had a dog at that time that everybody loved Harry. He was kind of famous. Me and Sue used to joke that we were going to do the harm reduction books like: ﻿When Harry was Homeless, Harry Does Harm Reduction, Harry Does Street Outreach. ﻿He went everywhere. Just do a kids book or something. 
I don't even know where I was working. I was working for a lady that, when I was in the halfway house, she'd come and get people for day jobs. I stuck with her. She rehabbed houses and things like that, painted. I stuck with her for awhile. She knows how to deal with harm reduction. We were always relapsing and oh we didn't show up for work. 
AS: She understood that. 
DH: Sort of, she's even paid me when I didn't do a damned thing because I'm so high and just goes, ""Oh Deb."" I guess I've always dabbled in it but at the same time I've always, there's been a few short periods when maybe I was precariously...I'm trying to think at what point things fell apart. I think I remember now. I worked and lived in this duplex with other Fellowship people. We were tight. Everybody went and had coffee. It's like the bullshit AA thing. It works for some people. I still have some good friends from that time. They are totally AA people. I'm losing my train of thought. At some point, I lived in that house for eight years and pretty much the same people lived there too. I don't know what year it was. 
AS: Were you in St. Paul, Minneapolis?
DH: St. Paul. I like St. Paul better. I love Minneapolis too. I've lived both places but I think I like living in St. Paul better, I don't know why. Quieter, a little bit. Eventually people in the house started using. The whole crowd, people would start relapsing. People even died I think. You know how it is. One of my Cloquet friends, I know Sue probably talked a lot about Lisa. Lisa and I had gone out to Colorado and we stayed with her brother Joel who is the one who ended up committing suicide a short time later. Joel was kind of scary on that trip. He's kind of one of these neo-white-Nazi dudes. He was like talking the homosexual thing. Me and Joel, we were a couple at one time. In the early 80s we did a lot of drugs together. I think he had recently gotten divorced. He had a lot of back pain so he was addicted too. They had cut him off. 
AS: To pills?
DH: Yeah. I think he lost his job. We didn't know. With this supremacist attitude that can get kind of scary. He's got rifles. Even Lisa was concerned about him. I'm like, ""Shit is he going to shoot me because I'm a lesbian?"" We got through the trip. Me and Joel went out together one night. Very fitting we saw the movie ﻿Blow. ﻿That was all of our experience together, a lot of it. We went out to dinner and had a great talk. We come back to Minnesota and I don't remember at what point but it was within two weeks he killed himself. He shot himself. 
Then I come up for the funeral. Of course it's a really tragic thing. At the rendezvous after the funeral which is one of the Cloquet drinking bars that everybody would go to and a lot of people were doing drugs. That was just the crowd. I was kind of trying to do this AA thing and stay sober and off hard stuff. I did stay sober there. I drove home to Minneapolis that day. The whole way my palms were sweating. I knew. Just thinking about, ""When I get back I'm going to use."" I knew my neighbor could get me something because he was using heroin at that time. 
AS: Had you used heroin by this point?
DH: I had in the early 80s with Joel a few times but cocaine was really my thing. It really was. It was back when it was like good cocaine, not like what you see these days. I don't even know. Can you get the good cocaine these days? Probably not. You'll have to investigate that. I don't hear about it. I just hear about meth and heroin and crack. Some people still smoke crack. Rick wasn't home when I got to St. Paul. I pretty much just paced the porch. It's just that whole feeling that you know you're getting it. I asked him if he could get me some drugs. By this time I kind of missed out on the whole starting to do volunteer work with Sue. 
AS: In Minneapolis? You did some of the Women With a Point Stuff?
DH: Yeah. I had been working with Patty, just doing my own thing. When Sue started Women With a Point I started going down to shelters with her and doing street outreach out of the back of her car. I missed that whole part. Eventually I got a little job, front desk job, at Mary Hall Catholic Charities and that's kind of what got me going. I worked there for a long time. I decided to go back to college at some point. I'll have to see where that fits in. I missed a whole section. See what I mean here? I was working for Patty and decided to go back to school.
AS: Who's Patty again?
DH: She's the one who redid houses and stuff. I started to go to St. Kate's for social work. Then I was working at Mary Hall. I had a couple of incidences too doing needle exchange where I ended up in a hotel with somebody shooting up just because it's like, ""There it is."" Sue would get super pissed at me. ""Get out of that hotel room. Get out God damnit Debbie."" I don't know I was always pretty impulsive. I think I still am sort of. 
Going to college. That's when we took the trip. I go to the funeral. I'm waiting for Rick to get home for the drugs. I just proceed to go on like a four day bender. I was doing street outreach at that time for People Inc. I think I had been kind of falling apart. I had been drinking a lot. Not really falling apart just drinking a lot. I was kind of in the setup mode to use. Rick came home. We got some coke. Even though they were using heroin. I was doing needle exchange so I had all the stuff we needed. I just went on a four day binge that ended up, Sue came over and pretty much saved my life. 
I don't know if you heard this story. I had been communicating with Sue because she's in the, ""God damnit Debbie,"" mood. ""Here goes Debbie again."" I've done some crazy things. She told me some of this when we met at your deal. Stuff that she's never told me regarding that incident. I think we had been communicating. Apparently I was going to go to the Employee Assistance Program or something on Monday, whatever day it was. We were supposed to do something together that morning and she hadn't heard from me. She called Dave, her husband, and said, ""What should I do? I haven't heard from Deb."" She calls me Debbie. She's about the only one that can. Or Frybrain. Did she tell you that, Frybrain? I was proud of it at one point. Dave just told her, ""What if something's wrong and you didn't go?"" She came over and pounded on my door, no answer. This is the stuff she's told me recently. I think she was getting ready to leave and then the neighbor came out and said, ""Deb's fine. She's sleeping on the couch."" 
[Interruption]
DH: The neighbor came out and said I was sleeping. Well I wasn't. Sue said I was shallow breathing, turning blue. 
AS: Had you used heroin?
DH: We were doing speedballs. At this point they were heroin users, my neighbors. There was no more coke. I could remember during that four days you can't go to sleep or anything. There was Jamie giving me a shot of dilaudid in the neck. I can remember this really well. Then just getting up and just starting over. I don't know how it would have gone on if I didn't OD. I don't know. Like I said, my poor little dog sitting there with me. Sue called the ambulance and they Narcaned me. This is when that wasn't really…
AS: What year is this?
DH: The anniversary is coming up too. Was it 2001? I think it was 2001 or 2002. Then I was super pissed. Some of my co-workers that I was doing outreach with threw me under the bus. Specifically Brett Byfield. My neighbor, his girlfriend lived in public housing. I had went with her to public housing to get some drugs. She's not a client or anything. That's how Brett looked at it. I don't even remember how it all went down. Then I couldn't go to Dorothy Day for awhile. The executive director....
AS: To do outreach?
DH: Yeah. Eventually they fired me at People Inc. I played their game. I went to treatment again for fuck's sakes. Then I OD, I'm in the hospital. It was Memorial Day weekend. Then they start to say, ""You tried to kill yourself."" They're wanting to sign releases for my sister. I'm like, ""Hell no."" All my co-workers deserted me. The people who were calling me were my homeless people. I mean I had a few. My ex came down to see me. A few people that were supportive. 
AS: How long were you in the hospital?
DH: Nine days. I got shipped up to the psych ward because they said I tried to kill myself. 
AS: On what evidence were they basing that?
DH: Just the OD and thinking I was depressed or something. At that point I inside of myself woke up to how I used drugs. I'm like,  ""No I was not suicidal but it's suicidal."" I play that whole scenario out if I get a trigger or something. I do, that shit's all over the place. If I ever killed myself it would be with heroin. That would be the easiest way to do it. That's just where I'd go. Not that I'm going to. That'd be my choice. That was a super hard time for me then. The job made me go to treatment mostly because they wanted their paperwork done. 
It was like 2001 because it was the terrorist attacks. I was in treatment right after that. There was a bunch of flight attendants from American in treatment at the time. It was really sad. That time I went to Pride Institute. I thought, ""I'll try the gay one this time, see how that goes."" My leaving Las Vegas friend, Deborah, I got her to come to treatment. Then we were roommates. She's had a million treatments. She did the Jellinek thing at Hazelden. Do you know what that is? The intense six month. It costs thousands of dollars. It probably costs a hundred thousand these days. 
AS: Is that how they detox you? 
DH: Back when I was there the detox was called Ignatius. Then I think I was on the Lily Unit. Then Jellinek was the long term for the chronics. I did that, went to Pride Institute, went back to work, got my paperwork done and then they fired me. I was kind of depressed for awhile. I was still going to school. I was like, ""Fuck, I fucked this up."" At the same time the executive director at Dorothy Day said, ""Deb you're good with us. Just right now you've got to stay away because of Brett."" This asshole pushed it I guess. There was support that way. Do you know Monica? Did you meet her? 
AS: No. She's at Simpson? 
DH: She was the executive director at Simpson. Now she's doing something. She's had a lot of jobs in the homeless world. She's an icon down there. Monica Nilsson.
AS: What did you say about Monica saved your life?
DH: Me and Sue were at the May Day parade a few weeks ago. Monica walked by so we said hello. I looked at Sue and said, ""The person who saved my life and the one that gave me a second chance."" She hired me at Simpson. I asked her down the road, ""When you hired me did you know I had had this incident?"" She did. Then I'm like, group hug. That was just kind of funny. I just kind of did outreach and worked in shelters in Minneapolis for awhile. Always smoking pot.
AS: But you stayed away from heroin?
DH: Yeah and I have stayed away from all hard drugs ever since. That's a long time now. 
AS: That is a long time, like sixteen years. 
DH: Is it that long? Oh my God. Wow. I never thought of it that way. It's not that I don't get triggered I just know where I go and what stops me. I'm that person who needs some kind of security and I don't want to lose it. I am very grateful that I made it through the last one. 
AS: Was that the last one? What do you mean by the last one?
DH: I mean when I ODed. It doesn't seem so long ago, wow. 
AS: The way you talked about it I thought it was much more recent. 
DH: No, no. I've never really thought about that it's that long ago. It almost makes me go, ""Was it 2011?"" But it wasn't. Then I just worked. I super got into homelessness. Outreach was my thing. I've always poured my heart into it. I don't have kids or I don't have a family I've got to go home for. I've always been pretty available. Then I worked in the shelter for awhile in the cities. I really missed the street outreach. Have you heard of Charlie Parr the musician?
AS: Yeah.
DH: He did outreach in Minneapolis and he was known as Jeff Parr at that time. He had moved to Duluth and I just said, ""If you ever leave your job,"" he was doing outreach for the Homeless Project where I work part time now. I said, ""Let me know."" Then in 2005 he left to go do music. I applied for his job, HDC. I didn't work there long because their idea of outreach was, ""Oh you can do it from eight to ten am on Tuesdays."" They're a mental health agency and the boss was a controlling asshole. I can't work for you. I went to work at the Dom Yono which is like the soup kitchen in town. They have a couple programs like a clothing program. At that time they had a cooking program where you can learn a trade like a culinary. They have a kids cafe. I worked in the social service. I still really wanted to work at the shelter and do outreach. 
Eventually I got a little part time job at CHUM in the shelter. I think I also did an internship here. When I came up here I was still going to St. Kate's . Then I was going to go to Scholastica but they wanted too much money. I did an internship at CHUM though. Then I got a job there. I've just been there ever since. They let me do my thing. There's some things about the shelter that are totally punitive that drive me crazy. I don't have a lot of control of it. I can argue a lot and I do advocate a lot to the point where my boss says, ""You're a pain in the ass."" It's like that's my job. I'm kind of getting to the point where I don't feel that they do harm reduction enough to the point where it satisfies me. 
AS: At the shelter?
DH: Yeah. Even though they say they do. Some of the staff we hire for the shelter, they're mean. [Off the record statement]. As far as the heroin use, have you talked to the needle exchange yet in Duluth?
AS: Yeah.
DH: How did that go?
AS: I interviewed Mary McCarthy, the executive director and my students interviewed Maggie and Jameson. 
DH: I think we kind of find that it's hard to work with them a little bit. Yeah. Right now, I have all this Narcan and I don't have barrels and points. I've been trying to get them from them. I need to get them somewhere. I need to start passing it out. I finally got a hook up. 
AS: Talk about your job. When you say outreach what does that involve?
DH: We've developed a collaborative over the years that I've been here that involve the...homelessness used to be, it's still really bad here, but it used to be visibly much worse. Since they built the San Marcos which is actually having its ten year anniversary this year. 
AS: Greg told me about that yesterday.
DH: Did you talk to Greg Anderson? I'm glad. He's an awesome person. I love that guy. I was thinking that you should have talked to him. I was just thinking that yesterday. 
We kind of built this collaboratively where people who are homeless and chronically on the street using the Emergency Room, ambulance, fire department, going to detox and having nowhere to go. We just all work together. What it's developed into is I would be kind of the one making the contact. You're on the street. We have twelve agencies that meet once a month that include the hospitals, probation, the courts.
AS: That's different from OARS?
DH: Yeah. I used to go to OARS but I dropped off just because I don't know. They can do it. I still get all the notes though which is cool.
AS: What you're talking about is a coordinated effort for the homeless where people are talking about the people who are chronically on the street.
DH: Because I work at HDC I work with everybody but at my CHUM job I get kind of a monthly list of referrals from the police. It's just this ongoing list. He counts up the police contacts.
AS: Who does?
DH: Dave, Officer Dave the one that wouldn't talk to you. They're usually for drinking in public. They might get fifth degree assaults. It's proven that all these minor things and they can lead to a felony. Then people are really...You're the person on the street, you've signed this release that it's covered by all these different agencies so now we get to talk about you. It's more for coordination for care. I can't get medical records. You go to the ER and tell them one thing, you go to detox and tell them something else. Now we can all kind of coordinate on what the real story is. I worked a lot with Dave, the police in general. I wouldn't say work with them. I don't tell on people. It's not to get them in trouble it's more to try and help them. The frustrating part at the end of the day is that there's no housing. You can do all these things with people, or adequate shelter either. 
AS: How big is the shelter here? How many beds?
DH: We'll take anybody. I had to laugh the other day when they told me, I think the legal capacity is like twenty four or something. We have like seventy to eighty people there some nights. In the winter, yeah. 
AS: Is anybody working on housing or on another shelter?
DH: We actually have a meeting Monday because there's a guy in Duluth, Charles, he works at the county right now. He's doing something. I don't know much about it. I'm going to find out on Monday. It's some kind of a shelter he's going to open up west, out west. He's been kind of secretive about it. I don't know why. Me and Dave the cop are going to go talk to him on Monday. I will like that for me because as an alternative when I'm doing my outreach at night on the weekends there might be another option instead of just CHUM where a lot of people are kicked out of or can't go to. I kind of heard a rumor that he wasn't going to take super drunk people and stuff like that. I don't know. The ones that get kicked out of CHUM or can't come he doesn't want them either is kind of what I heard. At CHUM it seems like they do kick out a lot of people. I never kick out anybody. 
AS: So CHUM has a shelter.
DH: Yeah, that's where I work. 
AS: That's the twenty four people one.
DH: Yeah. It's always full. There's three bunk rooms for the guys and three for the women and then a common area where there's mats on the floor and then overflow too. I'll give you a tour if you want. It's not that much to see though. It's your typical dirty shelter. 
AS: Is there an issue with homelessness and heroin here?
DH: Yeah there is but it's hidden. There is. I tried doing some outreach at the Clear Path Clinic. I found it really difficult partly because of the way people go in and out of there. You never know what time they're going to show up. I see it more as the counselors. I did spend a fair amount of time there talking with people. I think just because I've been doing this so long that people know me. It's word of mouth, it gets around. They seem to not want to tell the clinic that they're homeless. 
AS: Maybe it has to do with their medical care. 
DH: That outreach part has been difficult. That's why I thought if I could get some Narcan. I know a good number of people that are using heroin but they're not like camping out in a tent. They're hiding out in a drug house. Some of them are in tents I guess. They tend to not come around. Sue just shared that harm reduction thing that the minister, did you see that? One thing she said in there is that stigma makes people go underground. That's exactly how I see the homeless population. If you're homeless and using heroin you're underground. The drinkers aren't. They're out here. You just gotta build the relationships and get people to trust you. I do have a few people that will help me out to distribute. I always like having that face to face contact. You've got to. Then you know who they are. 
I'm seeing almost more meth use. Definitely the heroin. I probably only see a portion of the heroin just because obviously no drugs discriminate but you know there's a larger group that's, I hate to say the word normal because that's not what I mean. Do you know what I mean by that? Like just you or me going to use the exchange. A lot of functioning addicts that are going to work everyday and then doing their heroin or whatever they do. I think heroin users can function. I don't think meth users can as well. I think my story's a little boring actually. 
AS: You do?
DH: I do. There's a lot of it. I haven't really gotten into too much trouble with using in this town just because it goes back to that whole OD. I'm just scared to be. I know where it goes. It's a healthy fear. That doesn't mean I wouldn't want to do it once in awhile. Sometimes I think about it. It's that whole thought process. I've got the type of personality where one hit's not enough. Damnit. I wish I could be one of those people that just used occasionally. 
I'm getting a little bored, I wouldn't say bored at CHUM. We've got some changes coming up now where Dave is leaving again. I'm getting a new officer that I work with. They hired a new social worker. It's going to be interesting. I told Dave if this pick this lady officer. I said I won't even want to work on the group anymore. I'm kind of getting to the point in my career or my life where I feel like I'm not living up to some of the principles, just the things I believe in. Sometimes I even think we're criminalizing homelessness by what I do, my little job, the police contacts. I don't know. I'm frustrated that everyone needs to have an SPMI diagnosis to get certain kinds of housing. 
AS: What's SPMI?
DH: Serious or persistent mental illness. 
AS: To get housing?
DH: Yeah. You have to have these forms signed to be eligible for some programs. Then the other side of it too. It's just like Hazelden. Everybody that goes to Hazelden you get on anti-depressants. I see that in the homeless world too. Let's get everybody an arms worker and a case manager. It's helpful to a point. They have to have a diagnosis to get all that. That kind of drives me nuts. I just go, ""Just do what you do everyday."" A lot of people tell me I make a difference. I guess I could say that I have. Now my hands are tied in a lot of ways just because of the bureaucracy. They have this new, for a couple of years now they have what's called a coordinated entry for homelessness. The whole United States is using this model. Anyone that's homeless has to do this coordinated entry. What it looks at is vulnerability. People with higher vulnerability technically would go to the top of the list and get in quicker. Which makes sense in a lot of ways. I've seen in work a little bit. One of the problems for me is I can no longer help people directly apply for housing. Then people don't keep in touch. They're on this list but they change their phone number every week. Anyone I do it with I use my phone number. I can't do direct housing apps with them anymore. You've kind of got to wait until their name gets pulled. Certain scores get you certain supportive housing. I don't know. Then people get denied because they've got criminal history. They're mentally ill and they're addicted. Why don't we lighten up on the criminal shit? They're going to win in the end anyways. Why make them wait three months to get housing or six months just because you deny them. I don't know. I don't know what it is right now. I'm kind of feeling jaded in a way. 
AS: I would think there would be a pretty high incidence of burnout. 
DH: If you look at what I do too, I worked with Street Works for awhile too. I left out that whole thing and Gail, I left out that whole thing. Gail actually gave me my first outreach job. I left out that whole thing. When I went from Mary Hall to Seton Services and Gail was my boss. We were doing harm reduction outreach at that point with youth. It was for youth escaping prostitution. I think I was using through that time too. I don't remember what happened. I think I went from there to People Inc. I went from youth to adult outreach. It was hard doing outreach with homeless youth and having them outside in the winter. It was awful. 
When I moved back to Duluth I actually moved in with my ex. I left out that part too. We were just going to live together platonically. This is one of things I think is kind of telling about me is I'm fifty six years old and I've only lived with one person my whole life and it was her. It adds up to like twenty five years worth. 
AS: Of living with her?
DH: Yeah. I don't have an interest to move anyone else in in that capacity. I just look at it that I'm loyal. She's since got married and stuff. It didn't go well, four years ago. I don't think I went off the deep end that time. But I had been on Adderall. I was super skinny. I wish I could get back on it for awhile and lose some of this weight. At the end of that too I think I was in Adderall psychosis when I look back on it. I think after awhile it didn't work for me. It made me kind of crazy. I quit taking it. I like it. I do like it. I still have one bottle. I'd like to take it for like thirty days just to see if I could fit into my summer clothes. I didn't feel addicted to that. I used it as prescribed. 
AS: Why did you get on Adderall?
DH: I got tested for ADHD. Mostly because I wanted a prescription at the time I did. I don't know if I believe in all that prescribing either. I have Klonopin. I don't abuse it. There's a time I did abuse it. I know when Lisa died I was into that phase. We didn't talk about that either. That was a super hard time, as you know, for Sue and for all of us. I was using pills pretty heavily at that time. I stay away from all of it all. I don't abuse the klonopin. My new favorite thing is wax, the old hash oil. Three or four hits at night of that stuff and I sleep really well. I don't use it during the day, maybe on the weekends. I just don't beat myself up for any of it anymore. 
AS: How would you describe harm reduction? Just to wrap up.
DH: Definitely just really meeting people where they're at. It's kind of like loving them up, trying to show them that they have worth because everyone does. No expectations really. After I've been with someone or know them in a helping situation. I have very little expectations. At some point there has to be that want, that contemplation to change. 
AS: They have to want that. 
DH: Yeah, yeah. Then I start having this much. I tell them that. 
AS: This much expectation?
DH: Yeah, like you have to participate this much. Maybe it's more I just ask them to participate even if it's just a little. I think that's pretty much what it is. If I was running the shelter people wouldn't be getting kicked out for thirty days for stealing a sandwich. 
AS: That's what happens?
DH: Yes, there's a couple that have. They're super mentally ill. 
AS: They get kicked out for that? They're supposed to find housing for thirty days?
DH: Yeah or they end up out here. 
AS: What do you mean out here?
DH: On the street, sleeping out here. I think harm reduction is pretty simple. Things like the needle exchange, that's important. People need to support those. I'm a little worried with this administration in here. 
AS: Where? In the US?
DH: Yeah. I don't know. I think RAN was saying, I don't interact with them much and I should more. I feel like they aren't inclusive it doesn't seem. 
AS: Are they a part of what you would call this partnership?
DH: No, no, no, no. I would say that the majority of the people in the CIG group, a very small percentage of them are using heroin. They're either using meth or…
AS: What's the CIG group?
DH: We call it all the agencies that meet. Community Intervention Group. How appropriate, cig. Not to say that they don't dabble in it. I think there's a lot of synthetic use too still. That causes a lot of problems. We just had a guy intubated for like eight days. They finally filed to commit. I struggle with that too. After doing this for so long, I'm like it's the only thing that works for some people. Not even, it's just to give them a break. Just take a break. I don't know. I've always had trouble with the system doing things to people. What I see out here is people that are maybe really mentally ill and get committed. It's just to keep them safe and get them help. What happens is they get off their commit, they come out here and pretty soon they're right back there again. We really need some places. I think even with that crowd you need a shelter that's just going to let them walk in and walk out. It doesn't matter. 
AS: Is that what San Marcos does?
DH: Yes. San Marcos, they even discriminate against drug users I feel. Everyone does. They have the drinking side which is like a Waukegan or a wet house. They can have thirty two on that side. The other side of the building has forty units with single room occupancy. There's a ton of people probably using drugs in there. It's not really, if they know you use drugs coming in it will be an issue getting through the process. It just came up the other day. It's like, ""Well, he's trying."" These people still deserve housing. 
There are some grants being written right now for more outreach to substance abuse users. Part of this is the OARS group, they're involved. I think there's two going on right now. I don't know where they're going to find the housing. It's like get people into housing no matter what they're using or what their mental health is and then start getting them hooked up with services. Get them inside first of all. I don't know where the units are. We'll see. I've kind of been rebellious and dropped off all meetings because I question authority I guess. I'm so sick of the bureaucracy. I go, ""Oh I just do what I do everyday."" There's good and bad to that. I probably have a strong voice in that. People get mad at me. I stand up for it. When necessary I would still do it. 
I remember we went through this, I haven't been to the Summit to End Homelessness for, this is the fourth one and I haven't been for two years. The first one I got so pissed. It's like everybody went through the whole day and at the end they came up with bullet points. Outreach wasn't on there. I wish Duluth would have even like safe spot camping like Oregon has where people can just go. More like inreach than outreach. This town you've really got to rely on tips. For a lot of years I would walk the trails. It's fruitless to do that. There's so many woods and trails and hiding places that you've just really got to rely on tips. 
AS: You get tips about where to go find people. 
DH: Yeah, to really go looking you can just waste a whole day looking and not find anything. 
AS: When you mean outreach you mean you go looking for people?
DH: Yeah, I go out in the woods and stuff. 
AS: Like that picture you posted of the tents when it was pouring rain this last week. 
DH: Yeah, I think it's funny because people like my dog pictures more than they like and pay attention to...I didn't even talk about the dog thing. Somewhere along the way I started working with animals in this. My first one was in St. Paul which I did get in trouble for. I had gotten Rusty out of the pound and I put him in my name. When he ended up there again it was an issue, it's against their rules.
AS: To do what?
DH: I had bailed this dog out of doggy jail so the dog was in my name. They felt it was a liability to them because the dog was living with these folks but was bailed out in my name. The funny thing is HDC, on my HDC time I can't take dogs home but it's always on my HDC time. So I just say, ""No, I'm on CHUM time."" 
AS: What does HDC stand for?
DH: It's the Human Development Center. They're HIPPA, they're a mental health agency. We are too I guess but we don't have a lot of the records. 
AS: So you're rescuing homeless people's dogs?
DH: Yes, somehow I started taking pets home. I don't know when I got the first one. 2005 some homeless guy had him in his backpack. He was just this beautiful little puppy. It was like twenty below and he's drunk. Bless his heart, Benny and Joy a couple were out here. I asked if I could take the dog home. The rest is history. I think Benny's eleven now. The real Benny died. I fostered a ton of dogs. I had my two originals just together for a long time. People are out here, they have pets, they can't access shelter. I'm like, ""Are you willing to foster your pet?"" 
AS: To me?
DH: Yeah, I've developed a little bit of a network too. Obviously I can't take every one. 
AS: So you'll take care of them until the person can find a home.
DH: Yeah but you never know if they're going to come back really. Most of the time they do. Now I actually have five. I think I'm going to have a permanent four. Then this little Yorkie that I just took home the other day who's kind of driving me nuts. 
AS: The one who's not potty trained?
DH: Yeah. She's in the cage. She was last night too because she peed on my bed the first night. You're just going to stay in the cage. The owner told me she let her dog go to the bathroom in her bathroom. Which I don't really know what that means. I'm like, ""On the toilet?"" They're like, ""No on the floor."" Now I got to take that one out on a leash. I'm carrying a Chihuahua up and down the stairs because that guy, well that's a long story. He's really struggling with meth and he's living in a condemned house. They're just condemning it right now. Somebody gave him five thousand dollars to get things back in order and it was gone in a week. He knows that his little dog, it's this little eleven year old Chihuahua that came from a puppy mill. She's had like ten litters. I really didn't want her forever. He knows he can't have her. I kind of look at her and go, well really is she a trouble? She just lays on the couch and doesn't really do much. Then I start to feel kind of tied down because of all these animals. 
AS: They just hang out at your house while you're working?
DH: Yeah. I've got two cats. The ex, I moved two blocks from her just to haunt her. No, we're still friends. The new person, there's an issue with her and me. I don't know if she feels threatened or what. She doesn't have to obviously. Carol comes over and lets them out everyday while I'm at work. I'm flexible. I work twelve hour days. I can go home.
AS: Five days a week?
DH: Yeah. 
AS: Do you give yourself weekends?
DH: I do. I don't work twelve hours every single day. I'm trying to now just so I can have my weekends off in the summer. If I'm not busy, if I'm just at home I usually will always answer my phone for the police or the hospital even on the weekends. Sometimes it's just a quick question or something or with that coordination thing going on. I don't mind. If I'm at home and somebody really needs something I don't really mind if I'm not doing anything. 
The weird thing about my siblings is none of us ever got married or had kids, all four of us. I think that's super strange. I do see my brothers. They live in Cloquet. They remind me of Felix and Unger in a way. They're good guys. My sister I don't see her a whole lot. I don't know how to explain. She's always been kind of judgemental of my drug use. I think she's coming around a little bit. There's been a number of times where basically she's got drunk and I'm at her house. Sometimes with co-workers. I stay there when I go to hunt for stuff. She starts shit. It goes way back to when we were kids and the fact that I did drugs. I want to say it was three Christmases ago she flipped out on me. She's kicked me out a number of times at like eleven at night. I'm like, ""Really?"" I just draw a line with them now. I won't be around her when she's drinking. I even told her, ""No drinking at Christmas."" If you're coming to my house. She didn't come. I don't care if they drink. Just don't get super drunk. Let's have a few and get along. I don't fight, she does. 
AS: I think I probably have to wrap it up.
DH: That's okay. I probably do to. I haven't even been to work yet today. CHUM is like that though. They don't care. 
AS: You do some incredible stuff watching out for the people that nobody else is watching out for. "

Interviewer
June 14, 2016
St. Paul, Minnesota
Janise Holter-JH
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan having an interview with Janise Holter on June 14th, 2016. Janise, will you state your name and address and say you give permission for recording to be used?
JH: My name is Janise Holter. I give permission for Amy Sullivan to use all the contents of this interview.
AS: Thank you. Could you tell me a little bit about your upbringing, aspects of your childhood that formed who you are, and a bit about your education and career? Whatever you say is totally fine and whatever direction you go off in is fine. If I want to bring you back I will bring you back.
JH: Okay, perfect. I’ll remind you to bring me back if I get too tangential. [laughs] Well, I grew up about two miles from where I live now, which is in Crystal, Minnesota. My parents were very young. My mother was seventeen when she had my sister and nineteen when she had me. My dad, we later discovered, suffered from bipolar. He had a lot of bouts of depression growing up, so that was a pretty clear memory of dealing with his quietude or quietness. 
My mother came from a family of ten and was very connected to her family. They were southern baptists. My grandma was from the South; my grandpa was from Sweden. So, I had a lot of cousins, went to church a lot, loved going to church. Loved being in the really vibrant community. I admit we got a little too vibrant and my mother left before I was baptized. My sister was dumped and I was not because my mother left the church. We got a minister that was actually from Mississippi. He was a little bit too much of what the church was, so my mom left. We stopped going to church when I was thirteen. 
I was kind of an odd kid. I was in the middle. I have an older sister, younger brother. My parents were married to each other three times. They divorced and married to each other three times in my childhood. So there were periods of time when my parents didn’t live together. I have an older sister who is breathtakingly gorgeous. So, that was an interesting thing to be second to. She was very, very beautiful. I have a younger brother who is four years younger than I am and he actually had an episode when he was twelve where he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized for a number of months. My mother chalked it up to him having a concussion, but there was clearly some mental illness or something going on with him. 
My parents owned a store, and I worked in the store. My mom is a folk artist. She paints scandinavian folk art [laughs]. She owned a craft store. She got into that and bought a store in Osseo, Minnesota. Small, little store, and I worked in her store with my dad. I worked in her store from the time I was fourteen until I was in eleventh grade. I got a job at a nursing home, and worked at the nursing home for the rest of my high school career. I worked with my parents and I helped my mom teach classes. She taught a lot of classes in different types of folk painting and ceramics. She was very crafty. 
So, middle class. My dad worked for the highway department until the store kind of started to make some money—he decided to quit the highway department, and he worked at the store and helped my mom. My parents finally got divorced for the third or fourth time depending on how you count it, when I was thirty! [laughs] I always thought of the Woody Allen line: “My parents got divorced, or stayed married even though we begged them not to.” That’s how I felt when my parents finally got divorced because my dad was clearly mentally ill and my mom was keeping it together and they were both being pulled down a hole that was not good for either of them. 
So, once they divorced, my dad just progressively got more and more—cycles of depression and mania and addiction. He was diabetic, and he had heart attacks. He didn’t keep taking care of himself. He died at seventy-two. My mother remarried a guy who was as mentally ill as my father, but the other end of the spectrum. Very, very, religious, fundamental religious. My dad was funny, and bigger than life, and sloppy, and everything, you know, was just sloppy. And my mother married this guy that is very rigid, and very neat, and very religious. She has been married to him for about sixteen years. She is very religious, very fundamental, very right-wing, very judgmental. 
My parents were very hands-off. That was how I was parented. I mean, maybe it was the time or maybe it was because they were young. My mom was thirty-eight when I graduated from high school. We just did whatever. I remember playing softball and my parents never came to the softball games. They worked at their store all the time. There was no discussion ever that I would go to college. Never was it even considered that we would go to college. Neither of my parents were college educated. 
AS: How did you end up going to college?
JH: I got out of school and I worked for a couple of years. I started off by going to community college and paying for it all out of pocket. My first round in college was all out of pocket. I always worked full time. I went to school, I worked full-time, and paid all my tuition out of pocket because I was raised that you did not go into debt. My dad was German, and that’s stereotypical German frugality. You don’t go into debt. You don’t go into debt for education. You go into debt for a house, but education is not worth going into debt for. It wasn’t outwardly said, but it was definitely an attitude that, you know, I would go to college and my parents would be like, “Do you know what you’re going to do? Why?” They had to see the ends. In my family I am the only college educated child. 
They had a really interesting reaction when I stopped going to school to be an accountant and decided that cultural anthropology was what I was going to study. [laughs] That was interesting. My mom could not get it right, the whole, you know, whatever turned out being over four years I was in school. She kept telling people I was going to school to be an archaeologist. I had to just let it go. So that was not a value in my family. In school I did really well. I mean it was valued that I did well in school, but my parents were really hands-off. 
I want to come back a little bit because I had my own addiction issues in high school. The first two weeks of my tenth grade year, one of my very good friends committed suicide, and that was a very difficult thing for me. I started using a lot of speed to go to school, and smoking a lot of pot. And it was 1976. Everybody smoked pot, but I started smoking a lot of pot. Like smoking pot on my way to school. My parents didn’t know how to address this. I didn’t know how to address this. I was fifteen and I had had this really close person—it was the first person, yeah I guess it was the first person that died. It was a person my same age. It turns out that it was probably because he was gay. I had glimpses of that and I kind of knew that, but it was 1976. It’s It was forty years ago. It was not a part of what you told people. But you knew, and anyways he committed suicide. 
I responded to that by using drugs and started smoking cigarettes. My biggest lifelong addiction was with nicotine. My parents were both smokers too. My grandfather was a very serious alcoholic. Many of my uncles were alcoholics. I later had an uncle that committed suicide. So there was a lot of denied mental health issues in my dad’s family. If that wasn’t a family of people who suffered from serious depression—it was a dark and gloomy family. 
My senior year in high school I kept fairly decent grades, but I smoked a lot of pot, took a lot of speed, took a lot of speed. That was my drug of choice just because it was, you know, it wasn’t a depressant. I think I was probably depressed and that was how I dealt with my depression. 
When I would talk to my parents about how depressed I was it was kind of a “get over it” kind of thing. It was: “You know it has been two years since this person died. You need to get over it.”
AS: Did you ever go to treatment of any kind? How did you end up managing your—
JH: My addiction?
AS: Or ending your drug use?
JH: I started getting serious migraines when I was seventeen. I thought I was killing myself. I thought it was all the speed I was taking that was causing this to happen. It scared the shit out of me. 
AS: It scared you.
JH: It scared the shit out of me. Because I was having all these weird things going on and I thought, “Oh my god, I am going to die.”
AS: Like those aura things?
JH: Not aural, but yeah. My fingers would go numb and stuff like that. It was all coinciding with these amphetamines I was taking. My children do not know this [laughs]. 
AS: They don’t know you used?
JH: Not to the extent to which I did. It’s just interesting because I am telling you and it’s like I mean I could tell Allison this, but—and I would but— 
So anyways, I quit using amphetamines, got a job, and moved out of the house at eighteen. Got a job, lived uptown, worked at a record company, and had a blast. Did advertising. It was the late ‘70s early ‘80s. I was just kind of going to school part time, thought okay, I’m going to be an accountant because that is really practical and that’s what I should do. So, I went to Minneapolis Community College because I could afford it. 
Then the plan was I would do the first two years there and then I would, you know, go on and get a degree in accounting and be a CPA. I did it for about a year and a half and I thought it wasn’t—I actually, do you know who Norma Rowe is? She was a University professor. Anyways, she is an Anthropology professor. I think she is dead now. She was a professor at Minneapolis Community College and she taught a class that was called Cultural Anthropology. I thought, “I’ll take this as one of my electives,” and it just blew me away, she just blew me away. It was my introduction to feminism, and you know, I was like, “Oh my God, this is what interests me! This is what I want to study. I want to study culture. I am interested in this.” [laughs] I’m not interested in spreadsheets! This was 1970—this wasn’t on the computer it was on paper! 
So, I stopped going to—I’m just like I’m going to go to the University of Minnesota. She taught there, her husband taught there. That’s what I did. I worked at the record company, I became a waitress, I had worked for Republic Airlines for a little while. I always had to work full-time. I could never just go to school. I just couldn’t. Because I refused to go into debt. 
AS: How long did it take you then to finish your bachelor's?
JH: I never did finish. I quit. I quit the U of M. I was about thirty U of M credits short of graduating. I quit to make some more money so I could—that’s how I would have to do it. It was a cycle. I was about twenty-six at this time. So, I was about seven years into this cycle.
AS: So no one talked to you about how affordable student loans were?
JH: I had such a fear based mentality about that that I wouldn’t even consider it. I didn’t consider it until I went back and got my teaching license. That I was able to break that kind of thing. So, I quit the last time, and I got married for the first time [laughs]. I married someone and was married for about a year, and then got divorced. Carey, the father of both of my kids, and  were friends for a number of years, and I started to realized that I was gay. I started to realize that very early on. I started to realize that I could actually—I guess I didn’t because I went on to marry this person and have two kids with him. I think I was still trying to have that not be the truth.
AS: Married Carey?
JH: We didn’t get married until—Andy was in first grade by the time we were married. We were together for fourteen years, but we were only married for—actually I just recently got divorced, legally divorced, last year. The year before. He was an addict. He is an addict. 
AS: Did you know he was an addict when you married him? When you two got together?
JH: I met him when I was twenty-one and then I had Allison when I was twenty-nine, and we were friends for eight years. He had a girlfriend during that time, for months, and he’s older than me by eleven years. He was at the U [of M] attempting to get his Ph. D. in philosophy. I had gone back to the U—I was trying to finish up doing nights. That wasn’t working either. 
Anyway, we smoked a lot of pot. That is a conversation I have had with myself a lot. You don’t know that when you are with someone who is smoking pot and they are smoking pot daily, but all these other things are… they’ve got a job, it’s not affecting their life. You don’t realize it. Oh, they aren’t ever going to be able to stop. I’m going to stop. I could take it or leave it. I was always that way with alcohol, drugs, marijuana. Take it or leave it. I always could just take it or leave it. I was a smoker though. That I couldn’t take or leave. I was a smoker. I smoked from the time I was fourteen until the time I was fifty-four. A long time. So, the addiction was there. When we had kids—it wasn’t a planned pregnancy. Allison was not planned. 
AS: And she’s your oldest? 
JH: Yeah, she was not planned.
AS: What year was she born?
JH: 1989. So I was twenty-nine, Carey was thirty-nine, almost forty. He turned forty the year she was born I believe. The summer after she was born. So, that happened, and I have always been someone who has been like, “This is the road my life is on.” I never had this clear, “This is the way my life is going to turn out.” It is going to be like this. I am just going to go to college.
AS: You just kind of—how do you describe it? Go with the flow?
JH: Follow the road. 
AS: Float along. 
JH: I don’t know that I floated along because that sounds so passive, and I don’t think I was passive. 
AS: Right, that does sound passive. So when you got pregnant you decided you were going to keep the baby. I mean did that solidify your relationship?
JH: Yes, yes. Carey is a really good person. He is a really good person. I have to say if there’s ever been anyone I have been connected to in life it has been him. It has been hard because the addiction and mental illness started to really kick in and that takes a person away from you. At that time, and during that period of time, I would say from that time until the next ten years, I felt really connected and really safe. We had a great relationship and there were some underlying things going on. He was an addict and I was gay! Aside from that! [laughs] 
I have to say, I never thought I would be a mother. I am not very maternal. I am not one of those—surprisingly enough I wanted to be an early childhood teacher and a mother.
AS: But you didn’t have a mom.
JH: My mother was a very, very good mother to us when we were little. She likes little kids. Once we got to be old enough where we could take care of ourselves she started having her own life. And so she was a little bit absent. In her defense, she is one of the oldest of ten. She had taken care of siblings from the time she was… and she had us when she was seventeen. So her whole life had been taking care of little kids. I think as soon as she saw a glimmer of taking something for herself she did. So the downside of that was that we all really still needed her and she was doing her own thing. She really was dealing with my dad’s mental illness and trying to do that. Happiness, with religiosity in the background. 
AS: Back to your early mothering—
JH: I loved being a mother to my kids. I loved it. I was surprised at how much I loved it. I quit my job, I had a paper route, I worked for a non-profit, I worked part-time. Carey had a pretty decent job. I own a house in northeast Minneapolis, which is tangential, but it was my house. Carey moved into that house and we just did what I am doing now. We decided that this is the life we wanted. I wanted to be home with Allison at the time. He would go to work and we became really, you know, standard model of a family. I stayed home. 
I went back to school, took classes. I did some odd things. I went to school to be an upholsterer. So I did upholstery out of my house. Then I got pregnant with Andy. Then he was born. I was a seamstress for a while, I did seamstressing. I made dresses and stuff out of the house. Did a whole bunch of things like that. I had kind of a really mellow, hippy existence that I really enjoyed. On my deathbed when I’m harkening back on my life that will be my period of bliss. You never think that it’s going to go away. I don’t know where that has come from. But, anyway, 
AS: Do you want to stop?
JH: No, I’m good. So, that surprised me that I enjoyed mothering as much as I did because I didn’t intend on being a mother. I was struggling with the whole living this life that didn’t seem to fit in so many ways, but did fit. When I finally did decide that I couldn’t live this heterosexual life anymore my kids were in middle school. People asked me, “What happened? How?” Have you ever had a pair of underwear that just doesn’t fit and... it's okay. It’s okay, you can wear it. You’ll get through the day with this underwear on but God, you want to take it off! You know? That’s what it was like living. That’s how it felt for me. I was in this life that wasn’t bad. Carey was so kind, he’s a kind person. The addiction started, those things started to happen too. 
AS: Around that time?
JH: Around that same time. I had to take some sort of step away from this. I could have waited, maybe should have waited. But I didn’t wait. 
AS: How far apart are your children? 
JH: Twenty-two months. So Andy was in sixth grade and Ali was in eighth grade and I moved into this building in northeast Minneapolis and met Jill, a woman I had a nine year relationship with. 
AS: Did your kids live with you?
JH: They lived with their dad. I moved away from the house because Carey did not want to leave the house. That was my house, and I didn’t want to disrupt the kids and the house. They were born in this house. They had fourteen years in this house. I was going to do whatever it took to keep stability in this house. Carey gave me money. We figured out the equity of the house and he gave me enough to go buy something else and I put that money into this building. 
It was 2000 and the housing market was really hot. It was right before the crash. So, all I could buy was this building, and I bought this building and there was a part of me that was like I have this chunk of money. I just started going back to school to get my teaching license so I went back to Augsburg [College]. I knew that if I didn’t buy something with this—it was only $35,000, it wasn’t a huge chunk of money, but I knew if I didn’t buy real estate with it, it would not stay. It would be gone. 
So I bought this building. It had been a convenience store. It was open space. Forty-two by forty-two. It had a little bedroom in the back. It had a kitchen. It had some nice architecture features. We lived in it… the kids had tents. Jill moved in, she had a child, and each child had a tent instead of a bedroom. They talk about that. Fondly and not fondly because I think it was a real transitionary period for Allison. As she entered the end of middle school started to show some really serious signs of depression. She started cutting. I found that out in ninth grade. I didn’t know she was doing it and the school counselor called me. I knew she had been having some depression issues, and then talking her to a therapist. So that started her whole therapy. Dealing with her depression. Andy was a very quiet child. Very introverted. Allison is loud. Any space she is in is all about her. She is also very attractive, very articulate, and very intelligent. It is all about her. If she is good or if she’s bad. Andy is very quiet. 
I could talk to Allison with what was happening with my sexuality. With Andy I kept thinking I would wait until it seemed like he could handle it. And I never really actually talked to him about it until recently. I just kind of tried to make it okay for him. So Allison started having some really serious mental health issues. Andy was just quiet and he seemed okay. He seemed like he was okay. He got into video games a little bit. He had friends. Never missed a day at school. Sweet. A little bit fearful of things. He was afraid of the water, he was afraid of a lot of things. Didn’t like to be outside as much as I did. Jill had a cabin and we’d go to the cabin and he didn’t want to go to the cabin. I would make him sometimes and coax him by saying, “You get to ride motorbikes,” but he didn’t want to be outside. He didn’t want to go swimming. 
I didn’t recognize that as anxiety, partially because Allison was taking up so much. I was going to school, and I almost didn’t make it through Augsburg because I was like a quarter away and then I was like, “Oh my God. I’m working full-time, I have two teenage kids, and I’m in school full-time.” I was signed up to do the Masters. I was going to just do the Masters program. It would have been just another nine months. I thought, “I just need the license.” That helped. I knew that if I didn’t get the license that I would… I did go into debt for this. It was like $25,000 in debt. Luckily, because I hadn’t graduated from the U and hadn’t gotten the degree I was eligible for a grant, so I got about $6,000 in grants to pay for that. So that was pretty good. I only had to do the education. So I had everything else. And religion because Augsburg is… and those were actually kind of fun. So I just had to do the education portion and two religion classes so it took me almost two years. It was only supposed to take eighteen months. I ultimately didn’t get the Masters because I knew I just had to start attending what was going on with my children.
AS: At this point Ali is about sixteen, seventeen?
JH: Almost sixteen.
AS: Is she using at this point?
JH: She is not using. Carey quit his job and is trying to be a writer. I was supportive one hundred percent. That was also the background. He had worked for a place for a long time that had gone out of business. He is now fifty-five years old, and he has decided that since his skills are fairly obsolete he doesn’t want to go back to school and he is going to be the writer that he has always wanted to be. At first I was kind of like, “You know what? You deserve to have a year to kind of—” because he supported the kids. I stayed home when they were little and I thought “Okay, I’ll do this. I’ll pick up the slack.” That coincided from just graduating from Augsburg, getting my teaching license, getting my first teaching job. So, I paid. We were used to living very small anyways. So it was like “Okay, if you need this time it’s cool.” 
When it stretched into ten years and there was no child support at all, that was kind of a lot. You can’t just halfway through your kids’ childhood decide you aren’t going to work. That is kind of part of what played into—and part of what happened was that his pot smoking, I saw that his addiction was having an effect on him, me, and the kids. That coincided with me… you know the underpants thing [laughs]. The whole Carey and I separating from each other came down to “Let’s split up because she was gay.” It never had anything to do with his addiction. That’s the story, it was always the story, and it’s not the whole story. It’s absolutely not the whole story.
AS: How was that for you as a mother? Were you fine with that because your children needed another place to go? Was his addiction affecting them?
JH: Yes. Absolutely.
AS: Was there a protectiveness for you that you just let that story be about you being gay because you didn’t want to have to disrupt their lives even further by addressing his addiction?
JH: Yes. That hits the nail. I knew that I didn’t want to take it out on them.
AS: Right. So the story was okay with you at the time.
JH: It wasn’t okay with me internally.
AS: But as a mother it was okay with you in terms of what you were trying to provide your kids?
JH: I don’t know if I want to use the word selfish but that is the first word that came to my mind, so I’m going to use it. He was selfish. I felt tremendously guilty. So much so I couldn’t stand it. So it was easier to not even stir it up partially because I didn’t want to face how guilty I felt because this was part of the reality of who I was. 
AS: You felt guilty about your…?
JH: Breaking up my kids’ home because of my sexuality. I knew there was so much there, but also a lot of it just came down to, “What do you have the energy to do? You just have to live.” Now, I’m in a relationship that’s not easy for either of us because we are both navigating this coming out late in life. Jill had a child. I was coming out to my family. My siblings were okay with it. My dad was okay with it. My mother was... [laughs] was okay with it. Was not going to ever accept it. Was trying I guess. It was a new identity. I had been this heterosexual hippy mother for fifteen years in this neighborhood. The neighborhood in Northeast—I was very connected with people in that neighborhood. People had opinions about what I had done. 
So I was trying to get through school, and trying to finish it, and be responsible. Then Allison started cutting. There was just so much going on. Addressing Carey’s addiction was very low on my—I knew it was going in the direction it was going. All I could do was do my best. This is the kids’ father. They love him. He is a very lovable person. I wanted him to stop being an addict and be a better father, but I wasn’t going to be able to make that happen. I wasn’t going to take them away from him, but I did try to protect them from the reality that he was an addict. When they were older and in the car as if I’m not even there driving having a conversation about their dad being stoned. They knew the whole time. 
AS: But you still somehow as a mother thought you could protect them.
JH: Absolutely. I have protected them by not telling them. What a mistake. What a mistake. I can’t undo that. I protected them by keeping them with me. And he, come to find out, started giving Andy pot when he was in high school. I didn’t know Andy was smoking pot, and he got busted at school. And I was like, “Where are you getting pot? You don’t have a job.”
AS: Would you say he loved his dad?
JH: He loves his dad. Both the kids love their dad. Andy has something going on with his dad right now, and my dad died all during that. Is calling it a shit storm okay? [laughs] I have a mixed CD that is called “My Fucked up 48th Year in Music.” Because I was forty-eight when all of this happened. 
Allison went off to college. She went to high school. She went to Sweden almost for a year as an exchange student and it was really challenging with her depression. She was having bouts of depression there and that was really hard because she was away. I could see that her mental health was really just starting to go on this really teeter tottery thing where… she had stopped cutting for a couple of years. This whole, “I want to go to Sweden as an exchange student,” was her whole motivation. She came to me one day and she had this interest in ska music. She is Swedish—we are Swedish. I said, “If you want to go to Sweden make it happen.  I’ll help you make it happen.” She had a job—she worked at a nursing home. She saved up $2,000 dollars. I paid for the plane ticket. Took out a loan. Which was really big for me. Took out a loan for about $3,000 so I could pay for the plane ticket and pay for her fees, so then she went to Sweden. She was sixteen. She came home and turned sixteen. She was fifteen when she went. And it was really brave. 
She came home and was struggling with high school, struggling finding her place in high school. She is really smart, and that was hard. We had a couple years when I thought she was doing really well. Was really interested in linguistics. Very gifted with language. Allison is very gifted when it comes to language, writing. She spoke very fluent Swedish when she came back. She learned Korean, Spanish. She wanted to be something in linguistics. Either writing, being a translator. She thought she would want to be a person who did the subtitles in movies. When she was a senior she did post-secondary at the U. So, her whole senior year she went to the U of M. 
That summer got on Abilify. That was working with her bipolar. She was having some bouts with serious depression but we were hopeful that they were getting better. She was doing behavior therapy, and that was helping. She got accepted to McGill [University] in Montreal. That was exciting. And she didn’t send any of the paperwork in. And so that all fell through. At the time I was really disappointed because I was worried about the idea of her going to Montreal. She was like “I want to go to McGill and speak French there. This is this great university.” Of course as a mother I don’t know how we are going to pay for it and I’m just going to let go and we are going to figure it out. But she didn’t send the paperwork in.
I found out later it was intentional. She just got really scared and wasn’t ready. I’m not ready I’m afraid to be away. I think she knew that her depression was not okay. She wasn’t well enough to go. I was like, “You know what? Go to the U of M. We’ll try again next year. If you still want to go to McGill next year.” So, she went to the U of M and studied linguistics and started working at a pizza place on campus. Stadium Village. And met this young man named Andy. I liked him. He was from the Iron Range. He seemed like a nice guy. He was going to school to be a teacher. A little older than her. And I was really relieved because I was kind of like, “Okay, she’s got somebody who is watching over her.” Because she is seriously bipolar. But it turns out he was an addict. It turns up he had broken his back in high school in a skate board accident and was an opiate addict. And had been since high school.
AS: Was he using pills or heroin?
JH: He was using pills. Allison had not really dabbled in using anything other than—she had lived with this other woman for a while, and this younger—Allison had some issues with alcohol. She told me about Allison drinking too much, so I don't know if Allison was drinking too much. I sensed that she had, but I don’t know. So, Allison was working at the pizza place and going to school. 
Then that’s when the odd stuff starts happening. “Can I borrow $50 because I don't have enough?” The stories. The stories started, you know? The elaborate stories of tuition and of this or that. And at first you have no clue. “Okay, that’s reasonable.” “Mom, can I have money for groceries?” Is there anyway you can take us to Target and get some groceries? I need to pay for…” 
AS: All of a sudden she had a lot of financial needs that she didn’t have before.
JH: She had a lot of financial needs. There was some erratic behavior that I couldn’t understand. I would meet her for coffee or something and she would be manic. Just manic. I was like, “Oh my gosh. Her bipolar is getting…” That was the first place I went. Her bipolar was getting worse. Then I started seeing these things right here on her arm. Like, this darkness. I thought “Oh my god she's cutting again. She's cutting her arm.” I didn't realize it was tracks. I didn’t realize that these were tracks. She wasn’t even hiding them from me. She wasn’t covering them up, and I didn’t know. So I didn’t know… I don't know why I didn't say anything. I didn’t know what I was going to do. She was nineteen. So, I thought she was cutting again. I think I said to her, “Are you cutting again?” “No, no.” I still didn’t suspect heroin. I had no clue. And looking back it’s like, “You dipshit! How do you miss it?”
AS: With the nodding off. I didn't even know what heroin use looked like. I wouldn’t have even expected it.
JH: Yeah, and this was seven years ago. This is something that even in the last seven years has risen to the top. Growing up in the ‘70s, heroin killed people. People don’t use heroin because it’s so flipping dangerous. My child isn’t using heroin. She dropped out of school. Was still working at the pizza place. She was being persecuted by the owner of the pizza place. The guy was kind of a jerk, so when she told me the story that he was accusing her of stealing from the till I’m still going, “Oh my God. You poor thing.” She calls, “Mom, I’m going into treatment.” What are you going into treatment for? Well, she tells me, “Andy takes Percocet for his back, and I started using it and now I’m addicted to it.” All right. “I’m going into treatment,” I’m like “Okay that’s good.” She goes into treatment, and I think she lasted, I don’t even remember. She’s been in treatment so many times I couldn’t tell you.
AS: She’s been in so many times you couldn’t...
JH: Ten. Ten at least. Ten at least, and then jail for a year. So this is in six years. That was her first time though. 
AS: How did she end up in jail? And where was she?
JH: Ohio. 
AS: So did she kind of flee? For a circumstance here? Is Andy still in the picture?
JH: Her and Andy lived here for a while. I mean you know the stories. I mean there are so many stories I don’t even know how they have stitched together over the last six years, but at some point she met up with this dude named Shake. Bad dude, bad dude. He’s got some scam he’s doing with cell phones that she’s in on. 
AS: Probably for dealers?
JH: I don’t even know. I can’t even ask at this point. I mean you fast forward… I’ve been through, “Oh, she’s going through treatment. She’s doing better.” “Oh, yes you can come stay with me.” I’m going to love you back to health. I’m going to walk in and she’s shooting up at the kitchen table.
AS: That happened?
JH: Oh yeah. I’m going to have my work friends over, and you are going to come home and nod off at the table. I used to have an end of the year school party at my school where all my teacher friends would come here and have a party here and she came home. Her and Andy came home wasted. Absolutely wasted. Talking to my friends, nodding off while they were talking. I was so… because everybody knew. Everybody knew and I couldn’t… it was a disaster. I was in the middle of this disaster. I’m the chairman of the board of this school, and my child is coming home on heroin with her boyfriend. Nodding off.
AS: What did you do?
JH: I’m trying to remember. I think it kind of solved itself. We were all sitting at the table back there. By the time they came home the party was down to some of the people who absolutely knew what was going on because I took a leave of absence to deal with what was going on.
AS: Why?
JH: To help her navigate what was going on. Her and Andy went downstairs. I am trying to even remember it. It was one of those things like the people who were left were kind of looking at me, and I could tell that they could feel for me because she was supposed to be clean. She had just gotten out of treatment. She was coming to stay with me because—
AS: Instead of a sober house.
JH: Yeah. And I kicked them out very shortly after. That was one of those things where I said, “You two are out of the house in an hour or I call the police to come and take you out of the house, so get what you need and get out of my house.” I went to my friend Linda’s and I got everything. I took my computer. She ended up stealing my guitar, and I got it back. Carey went and got it for me. I had a mandolin at the time, she stole that. Left behind just shit. I went down and cleaned up and found paraphernalia: needles, bags, all that crap. 
AS: Food and...?
JH: Yeah. Andy was still living here. My son lived here at the time. He’s smoking pot, and he’s getting sicker. I’ve already had him taken away once by COPE.
AS: What’s COPE?
JH: COPE is the Community—psychiatric team. Psychiatric emergency team. That’s a whole other tangential story.
AS: How are you functioning at this point? Are you just getting through it? Are you just kind of in that—
JH: I had a really good friend who it also turns out has marijuana issues, and I ended up having to stay away from her as well. But we were friends for thirty years. Do you know my friend Theresa? The blonde? She is an interesting person, but she has been steady my entire life. 
AS: She has been there for you. Is she the one who grew up in Texas?
JH: That was Kit. Theresa was tall and skinny and probably has one of the most Minnesotan accents of the whole group. She is a person who you will never guess she is as intelligent as she it. But anyways I have known her ever since I was nine. We grew up across the street from each other. 
AS: Is she the psychiatric nurse?
JH: Yeah. 
AS: Her sister…
JH: Was schizophrenic and died at thirty-one of natural causes. Anyways, she helped me a lot. My friend Linda was a really big help. She had her own addiction issues. I mean I was really connected at my work. I worked constantly. I was committed to work. I was very connected at that school. It was a mission. I shifted my focus to early childhood literacy.
AS: That was a charter school?
JH: Yeah. I didn’t date or anything. I was on my own. Jill and I had broken up. I don’t want to say it was the best time. 
AS: Did you have many resources around like parenting or mothering through addiction or around mental health issues? Did you have any support at this time? What was your strategy?
JH: I realized something was going on with Andy. I knew it started out as anxiety and all these other symptoms started adding to his anxiety. I knew that something was going on with him. I contacted Nar-Anon, and I went to their parent or their family’s education—it’s a twelve week thing. I went to this group in St. Paul called Families Anonymous, but that wasn’t until later. I got a therapist that I saw, Nancy was her name. I saw her off and on. 
I started getting into Buddhism. I started looking to spiritual things because clearly that was the only thing I could hold onto at this point. The only thing that was going to help. I mean, I don’t know if it is this way for you, but it is this way for me. At my spiritual group that I go to at church this week the topic is, “What was your spiritual awakening?” Bring a story of your spiritual awakening. I’m like, “Oh my God, I don’t know what to bring because I don’t have a story.” It happened over such a long period of time. And all these things and all these really challenging things that, yes, they bring up emotions and tears. They have got me here and I kind of like who I am [laughs]. You know?
That’s tangential, but I don’t like all these… I’m not going to say I’m not going to be one of those people that’s going to be grateful for my child’s addiction. I’m not, but it is what it is. I am who I am. I responded to it by going inward and outward and reaching out to people. I have good friends. I have people that get what’s going on. I have people that I can go to and say, “My child is an addict and this is what my weekend was like.” And they don’t judge me. I don’t know if I lucked out or if it… you know natural selection, how that happened. I have and am surrounded in my life by people like that. They aren’t my family. It’s not my family.
AS: The stigma around addiction didn’t affect how you reached out to people around you to tell them what was going on in your life?
JH: Not people I really cared about. Not the people that mattered. When I changed jobs and left Sojourner and went to a new school I didn’t talk about the fact that my child was an addict.
AS: But at Sojouner there were colleagues that knew.
JH: Yes, absolutely. I had a lot of support. 
Because this is about mothering, I’m so cognizant of trying to stay on that topic about mothering, and I wanted to touch on this toggle that occurred with me where I would toggle between, “I need to do everything I can to be the mother that makes this okay,” to, “I have to walk away from you. I have to save myself.” What came up was, “I don’t give a shit! Do what you want. Mess up your life. Get away from me. I’m moving.” There was a time when I thought “I’m selling this house and I’m moving. You will never see me again. You guys do what…” You know? Then, “No, that’s not okay.” Then getting really involved and, “Yes, you can come live with me after….” There were four different times I said, “Yes, you can come live with me after treatment.” Until I realized, “You can never live with me again. No. You can’t even come to my house.” You know? I hope it’s not always that way, but it’s that way now. 
I’m not saying I have reached this place of equilibrium, or some kind of balance where I’m doing the right thing, but it is definitely more balanced where I would have these… I would oscillate between, “I don’t care about these people. I have these three—” Carey and the two kids all kind of have this sameness where they are very smart, very intellectual, and they are very addicted, and they are very mentally ill. They have told me they had this conversation about how I’m the dumb one in the family. I’m not the intellect. I'm not the intellectual in the family, but I’m the only one that can function. [laughs] Yeah, you know, I’ll be the dumb one! 
One of the women in one of my circles last week was talking about how she has come to learn that intelligence is not necessarily an indicator for anything worthwhile in a person [laughs]. She said she was married to a really intelligent person but he turned out to be mentally ill, or… And you know that is what the three of them are. I do feel very separate from them. It is them and me in this family of four. Carey and I have constant conversations about the kids and about things. I never address his addiction. He’s an adult. He has lost all of his teeth because he doesn’t take care of himself. He is sixty-seven years old. He’ll be sixty-eight. He looks like he is about ninety. Every email he send me ends with “I love you” [laughs]. He’s very, “We’re in this life together for better or worse. You are what you are I accept you for what you are.” You are a hopeless addict. You are hopeless. He has written three books, published them all himself. Loves his children, but enables until the end. Ali lives with him now. She went to court yesterday for some charge. I’m sure it was a possession charge. I don’t even ask her what the charges are anymore. 
AS: At what point did you stop asking what her charges were? When were you able to detach? We talk a lot about detaching with love. Did that happen because of multiple disasters?
JH: Yes.
AS: The impact of them over time?
JH: Yes.
AS: Or was there a moment that you remember when you were just done?
JH: I don’t think there was a moment—I am not that kind of a light bulb person. I am a slow, brooding Scandinavian. Things happen over time. I don’t even know that it has happened yet, the detachment. I mean I’m still attached. I get the email that she has gotten off, and I want her to go to jail. I want her to be sentenced to treatment. I get this email from Carey, “Guess what? Ali got off!” I get this pit in my stomach and I go, “Okay, well that’s…” I walk away from it. I have really applied those, “I cannot control it, it is not about me, she is an adult.” 
This is something relating back to mothering. I am not particularly maternal. I’ve got a mother view. I’ve got to fix this. I’ve got to be with you. I want you to have your own life kind of. I’m not overly involved. I think if my children were not addicts and had mental illness I don’t know if I would be over involved either. 
That’s how my mother was. That’s how I was mothered. I turned eighteen and moved out of the house. In the course of forty years I probably met my mother for lunch or dinner, not a birthday or something, a half dozen times. I don’t have a relationship with her. I have an interaction with her. And that’s how I was mothered. I have these conflicts. I don’t necessarily want to be that kind of mother but I don’t know anything else. I have these children with these really dramatic needs and I care about them and I will help them, but I can’t fix it. I am very aware that I can’t fix it. Even with Andy I can’t fix it. There is a high likelihood he will kill himself. I know that. I accept that. There is a high likelihood Allison will kill herself, on purpose or accidentally. Surprisingly enough that doesn’t conjure up the same kinds of emotions as some of the other things have because I have so reconciled that.
AS: You have prepared for their death? Is that what you are saying?
JH: That sounds so horrible to say out loud. I know that you understand that and I can say that out loud.
AS: I do. I do.
JH: There are places I can’t say that out loud. There are a number of people I can say that out loud to. Allison was on a respirator for three days. Three days. They said, “We don’t know if she is going to pull out of this opiate overdose. Intentional opiate overdose.” So when you come that close… I came home and that was the third time. That was the third time I had been to that brink with her. It is not that it doesn’t matter because it does matter. It’s that it just gives you this thing where you go, “Okay, I’m very likely to lose my child before me.” 
This is something that I don’t know… I also don’t often say out loud because I don’t know if it will make people irritated or mad, but I’m going to say it. This is oddly comforting to me. I grew up in the Vietnam War era, and my uncle was in Vietnam, and I lived next to a guy who’s son was in Vietnam. All those mothers who had all those children in Vietnam sat in the same place I sit every day. Not knowing whether or not their child will survive that day. Knowing their child is engaged in something so dangerous that their life is [unclear]. 
Why is that comforting? To know that I’m not the first person. That I am not the only mother. That I am not isolated in this being a mother who is on the brink of losing her child. I know there are other situations that mothers are in where their children are doing dangerous things but that’s the one that comes up in my head. All these years of my childhood, because as a child that is what I thought about surprisingly enough. I have very distinct memories where as a child of eight, nine, ten, eleven thinking, “I feel sorry for the moms.” And I felt sorry for mothers because they had kids who were in Vietnam that were being killed. I think you are too young to remember that. It was on TV every night. How many kids had died? All I could think about was all of these boys had mothers who had lost their children in combat. I just listened to this Invisibilia [podcast] thing about, “You can’t control the thoughts that come up in your mind.” Why did those thoughts about mothers in Vietnam come up? I found it comforting.
AS: When did that come up for you recently?
JH: A couple years into Ali’s addiction. Maybe the second almost death. There were a number of not even overdoses where… once you realize your child is doing heroin you walk it every day. Every day. Every time your phone rings. How many times do you change your phone ringer because the sound is so anxiety provoking? I cannot stand the sound of my own phone ringing. I very rarely take my phone out at work in the coffee shop. I had it out for some reason yesterday and I was at the tell ringing up someone’s coffee order and my phone was back on the shelf and the ringer went off. This is even a new ringer [laughs]. 
And off in the distance I heard my phone and I was very aware of the physiological response in my body where I got hot. I was standing at the till talking to somebody who I knew and I could tell that my face started to turn red because I was having this anxiety and I said, it was a woman, I said “I’m having a hot flash.” I didn’t want to say I’m having an anxiety response to my own phone ringing and this is because my child is a heroin addict and I have a child who is schizophrenic who tried to cut his own penis off, so any time my phone rings I’m scared shitless [laughs]. You know? That’s why I don’t call people very much. I text and Facebook because for me it’s a less scary way 
AS: Jarring.
JH: Jarring… a phone call is jarring for me because it is. 
AS: So can you talk a little bit about, because we have prior knowledge of each other you never really talked about what happened to your son Andy when he was diagnosed and what he was diagnosed with. Can you just explain a little bit about how that happened? You did talk a little bit about that simultaneity with Ali’s addiction. What was that? You called COPE, was it?
JH: He got expelled from high school for smoking pot. He had never missed a day of school from kindergarten to senior year. Never missed a day of school. Got expelled halfway through his senior year because he was smoking pot in the parking lot. Came back and got caught. I kind of knew he was smoking pot… 
AS: And this is when she is 19, been in treatment...
JH: Ali is… yes… Ali’s addiction is… I’m not sure that this thing that starts with Andy in high school. I’m not sure… he’s a senior, Ali is 19, I’m not sure yet that I know she is an addict. He gets expelled, finishes with an alternative program, gets out, and then Andy got obsessed with video games. He had a room in the basement and so we’d… it was just me and Andy living here and my dad died. My dad died that summer. That was another story but I won’t tangentially go off on that but that was kind of… I went into what I would say was just a serious depression. Just depression. I was off for the summer. Good and bad. Basically, a number of things had happened. My relationship with Jill. There were so many things that had just… I suffered from depression. Whatever. 
Andy kind of was just doing his thing and he was starting to smoke pot and I was kind of addressing it. Ali was off to school and things were starting to get bad with her. I mean I wasn’t… I didn’t know what to do. It wasn’t that I was completely ignoring it I just didn’t know what to do. Carey wasn’t any help. I was kind of by myself. I had been in this relationship for nine years that was over, and she was kind of hostile. So I had some hostility… I might have been drinking a little bit that summer. I know I was depressed. I know I was really concerned about whether or not I was going to be able to go back to work in September. That is when I started seeing a therapist. 
My dad had a surgery that led to a heart attack. Had a surgery after he had a really long manic episode where he really wasn’t taking care of himself. Led to a heart attack where they resuscitated him. It took forty-five minutes of resuscitation and put him on life support so we could get there in time to say goodbye to him. Oh, the other thing was my sister was an addict. A gambling addict. I had taken over her house to avoid a housing foreclosure. That was a whole other story that was going on. My dad has a heart attack, they put him on life support. We get there. My sister didn’t want to take him off life support so he could die. He was on life support for twenty-one days. Finally the doctors were like, “We have to take him off. Everything else is shutting down.” She went flipping nuts. He was basically brain dead. She claimed that he squeezed her hand. She claimed that he said he loved her. Said he said goodbye to her. I mean this man has been brain dead for twenty-one days and my brother and I are like “Please, please.” After eleven days I just went in and I said goodbye. I said, “Dad, I don’t know when she is going to let you go, but I’ll come back when it is time.” 
So all those things were happening that kind of led to this depression, and Andy starts getting this anxiety thing. He won’t leave the house. He asked for a bulletproof vest for his birthday. You know… you have to get a job, you have to do something. He is becoming more and more reclusive. I am fighting with him constantly to get out of the house. He starts smoking pot. He can’t stop smoking pot. That’s not good for you! I wasn’t getting help from Carey. He said, “He’s eighteen years old.” I sign Andy up and he decided—he doesn’t decide. I helped him decide he was going to do something if he was going to live with me. He was going to go to college or work. What do you want to do? Go to school or work? 
He goes to Minneapolis Community College. Sign him up. He is now becoming afraid of everything. I am seeing this just slowly build. He is afraid of the grocery store, he is afraid of people. He can’t make eye contact. He doesn’t make eye contact. He just… anxiety, you know, if we go into a restaurant, I would take him out for a hamburger and it is crowded and he would start to have this physical kind of panic attack. He’s having panic attacks. He’s staying in his room, he’s playing video games. I shut the Internet off. I completely shut the Internet off. I had no Internet, TV.  
I am trying to… It’s like if you see that your kid is using a drug and you are the one bringing the drug into the house. That’s how it was with the Internet. He goes to school for one quarter and I think, “Okay, he is just having some…” and then this is when I’m starting and Allison is starting to fall apart too… we sign up. I’m paying for this out of pocket by the way. [laughs] The second quarter: I’m working, I realize he’s not going to school. So, he’s smoking, he doesn’t go to school, he’s not going, he’s getting more and more reclusive. He’s smoking pot and I said, “These are the rules of my house: you can’t smoke pot, and you’ve got to do something.” I signed him up for therapy. “I’m taking you to therapy.” I’m monitoring everything. I’m going down when I come home from work and saying, “You need to get up and we are going to go to the parkway and we are going for a walk.” I’m dragging his six and a half foot butt up the parkway. I’m doing all this stuff to try and get him to not do what I know is happening and that is he’s sinking into this mental illness that I’ve seen, you know. I’ve seen it. 
AS: It was familiar.
JH: It was familiar. You know I didn’t want it to be true. You don’t want it to be true. I came home one time and this is while I'm toggling through this… I’ve had enough. What happens is I—this is a common thing I think. I do all these things and then I’ve had enough and I can’t do it anymore. I just want to curl up in a ball and die. I never would kill myself, but there were nights where I would think, “If I don’t wake up I’m okay with that. I’m okay with not waking up tomorrow.” [laughs] I don’t know if that’s going to happen.
AS: If I die before I wake…
JH: If I die before I wake… oh well! So, I kicked him out because he won’t adhere to my rules. “You can’t live with me.” He goes to live with his dad who is still living in our house in northeast Minneapolis, but has let it go into foreclosure. Just stopped paying for it. So Ali who is starting to use is living there, and Andy. And the timeline starts to get blurry for me because it is just like—I mean it is a shit storm.
So, I just knew I had to separate myself. I had to deal with my… I still had to work, I still had all these things I have to do. And, all this stuff is going on. I’m not completely cutting myself off from them. By now I know that she’s an addict. I found out it was heroin on the phone at work talking to someone who was doing her Rule 25 Assessment, getting information from me. I’m at work and I get this phone call on my prep. I know she’s getting a Rule 25 Assessment, this is maybe her second time in treatment. I’m in my classroom and I see the phone and I’m like, “Okay, I’m supposed to be getting this phone call,” and I talk to the… “So, Allison has been using heroin for the last year and a half.” And I’m going, “What? Are you kidding me?” “Oh, you didn’t know that?” “No, I had no idea.” I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. I almost puked. I almost puked. 
This is such a distinct memory because I have such a good visual of my own classroom. I remember my kids were gone and there were no students because they were at music or wherever they were. I was walking around with the phone and I remember just rocking back and forth because I knew that I had to get rid of the panic before twenty-eight eight-year-olds came back. I was still a smoker at the time and I remember as soon as I got off the phone I went to my purse and I grabbed my cigarettes and I told my co-teacher I said, “If I’m not back in fifteen minutes will you get my kids?” I just walked out the back door and up the block and lit a cigarette and just paced back and around the block. I was a block from the school because I had to smoke so bad. I think I just kept saying, “Oh my fucking God. Oh my God. Oh my God.” You know? I bet that is the first I had heard heroin. All of that, you know, ‘60s stuff that I had grown up with. Nw that was Allison. I think at that point it felt like a death sentence. That is really dramatic and I understand how dramatic that is but that’s what—
AS: But you knew immediately the impact of that.
JH: I did. Of it being heroin and not Percocet. I was thinking it was Percocet. Or Oxycontin.
AS: So get back to Andy.
JH: Andy. So I kicked him out, he went to live with Carey. I went over, I would call him. He was just getting—I don’t know. He was doing drugs, not getting out of bed, or something. I stepped away for maybe a month or two or just like you know I would call him but I was really like, I mean by now they are eighteen and twenty, you know? Carey is sixty—I don’t know how old he is. Fifty-eight? These are people that I…. 
So, I call and I talked to Andy and I talk to him and he was not making sense. I went over there and something was tremendously wrong. I didn’t know if it was drugs—I didn’t know what it was. Carey’s elderly mother was living with them at the time, and I was talking to Andy and I was like, “So what’s going on?” And he was not making sense. He was delusional. I got up. Carey’s mom was sitting in the living room. Carey was sitting on the couch, and I said, “Do you have any awareness of how sick our child is?” And he’s like “What?” I said, “I’m calling the county. Prepare for it.” 
I got in my car and I called my friend and I said, “What do I have to do? This is what is going on. Who do I call?” She told me to call COPE. She said, “This is what you say. This is what you need to say to get people up there. Don’t lie. But this is how it works.” That is how she has been. “This is how the system works. If you say you’ll take him to your house, they will let you. But, you don’t want that. You say he can’t…” So I called and I said, “What is going on?” And one of the things she said, “Parents tend to want to mitigate the severity of the danger. You don’t want to think that your child is dangerous to themselves or someone else. So you say ‘No, I don’t think so.’ Don’t say that.” She said, “Don’t say that, if you had any… don’t lie. But if you think he is a danger to himself you say ‘My son is a danger to himself.’ And you say it over and over again.” 
So, she really was helpful that way for me to advocate for him to be taken in and they took him. They came. They assessed him. Carey’s mom screamed at me. Screamed at me. That I was the reason the kids were messed up because I was a lesbian. Oh my God. He also came from a very religious background. His dad was a missionary and was killed was in Ethiopia and that is a whole other story. [laughs] She is screaming at me and I’m like, “This is my child. This is my child to fix.” 
They took a 72-hour hold on… that was his first. They didn’t keep him. He came back and lived here. I mean, there are a lot of details, but he kept smoking pot and kept trying to… I mean they both simultaneously were just going down. It was just one tripping over the other. It just came to me having to step away from both of them in that way that people in recovery step away and not the way people in panic step away. I was stepping away in panic a lot. And that wasn’t helpful and then when I realized, “I’ve got to recover, I’ve got to take care of myself. I’ve got to fix myself.” Not fix myself, but I’ve got to attend to myself. 
Because I’m not being a good mother. I’m not being a good mother. I have to mother. I have to mother these disasters. That was the first, the very first key to me being able to do it better was to accept it for what it was. Because the whole time I was mothering in panic and reacting in panic I was not accepting that this is what I got. These are my children. I mean they are not what I thought it would be. It is not what I thought it would be. It is not what some of my friends are going through. That's really hard. Because all of my friends’ kids were having successful families. They are of that age of going to college. Not being addicts and schizophrenics. So, that first place wasn’t a light bulb moment, and still maybe isn’t completely solid, but is the acceptance. And that was when Buddhism came in because acceptance is everything. Not accepting is all struggle. You accept what it is. You accept that it is yours. 
AS: That is really powerful.
JH: And when it is your children. The other thing that I let myself do and I still let myself do is I let myself mourn my losses. That is something I have learned as an adult that I was not allowed to do as a child. Whether it’s a relationship like my one with Kathy or Jill—but, my children. I have let myself mourn the loss of having the kids I thought I would have. I thought I would have different children. I thought that they were really Waldorf-y kids. [laughs] I really thought that that’s what I would end up with. Even with Carey’s addiction—I let myself mourn that. I don’t think I still mourn it the way I did. I have really come to accept that this is what I have in the rights to my life. 
I have two children that have serious mental illness. One is manifesting itself in addiction and the other is schizophrenic. Andy also, they diagnosed him as on the autism spectrum, which I guess also goes hand in hand with some of those behaviors. He was originally diagnosed with Aspergers. That was the first one. Then that started off a whole round for trying to find psychiatric help for your child when they are an adult. They don’t want to find help because they don’t think they are sick. All schizophrenics—that’s their… So I’m trying to find places. Is it 2006? I am going to say from 2003 to now I had to—I’ve know he is schizophrenic. I had known he was schizophrenic. Because I have been watching him and have been reading about it and I have been seeing him. I will take him to psychiatrists and say, “He is a schizophrenic,” and they say, “Well, it doesn’t really help us to take that diagnosis. Well we’ll put him on lithium…” Well, he’s not going to take it. I can’t force him to take it. That’s what is happening now. He’s on Jarvis which is a quartered medication. I knew really solidly two years ago that my… what I had to do was to step away and watch him walk the road and fall down the hole. 
AS: Just like they tell us we have to do with our addict children. Leave them alone. Cut them off. Kick them out. 
JH: It’s harder when someone has—it has been harder with Andy than with Ali. He can’t take it. I’m going to say he can’t take care of himself. There is the mother—because he’s my baby. It is kind of true. He’s can’t—
AS: He’s not functioning in this world, right?
JH: He can’t make decisions for himself. He can’t. Here is the difference in…
AS: And he’s now in a hospital?
JH: Yes. He’s civilly committed.
AS: Just for the record.
JH: Yeah. He is in the hospital. He is civilly committed. I am working very closely with the psychiatric team. I am mothering him. I see him twice a week. He wants to see me four times a week. I bring him Taco Bell once. I set up my limits. 
AS: Did they let you take him out for his birthday?
JH: No, and that was okay. I called his psychiatric nurse. I said “I’m going to advocate for this as much as I need to.” I said, “Can I take him out for his birthday?” She said, “No.” I have a really good relationship with his social worker at the hospital. He has been there for months. They all know me. He has been there longer than anybody has. They don’t know what to do with him. 
AS: Really? They don’t know where to send him? Are there are other options? 
JH: Right now they are trying to get him into the intensive rehabilitative treatment center. He got sent to one once and he cut himself again and they sent him back. So then he just went back to the hospital. That has just been within the last two months. His commitment is through September. He still thinks he’s going to get to go back with his dad. Carey will not tell him “no.” Will not tell him “no.” I tell him “no.” I am really working on having good boundaries with him. I tell him, “You do what people tell you to do.” He will say, “These people think I’m schizophrenic.” I’m like, “Yeah, they do Andy! You know what, here’s what happens what you cut your penis off. You have to stop.”
I’m listening to this thing about the Freudian thought process: every thought that you have, especially if you are mentally ill, there is something behind it. And then there is this counter idea that the thoughts just come and go but the ones we latch onto may be kind of random. Some people latch onto these dark thoughts. I have been thinking, “What happened to him? What happened to him?” I don’t know. Because he is obsessed with the idea that he is going to be killed. That is his obsession. He is going to torture himself before someone else can. So he can prepare himself. That is what is going on with him psychologically. There is no talking to him. That was the bulletproof vest. That was the start of it. Now I start tracing it. That is the hindsight is 20/20. I see things that he was doing in high school that were like the precursor behavior to this. So, I want to stay on topic because I know time is an issue. 
AS: We should wrap up soon. This is tiring and emotional for us. 
JH: I don’t want to go off on too many tangents. So, as it stands now he is getting treatment and he is under a commitment which is kind of like jail in a way. When an addict is in jail it's like “Okay, someone else is taking care of it.” And that’s not how it is. I do talk to his county psychiatric team. He’s got a site psychiatric nurse at the hospital. For the first three months he was hospitalized he wouldn’t sign the release papers. No one could talk to me, no one could tell me anything, but I could still give them information. He was a little bit freer with Allison. And God bless her. If he would tell her something she thought was important she would pass it on to me and I would pass it on to his psychiatric team and he couldn’t talk to me but she could give me a message. This is what Andy is intending to do. He is cheeking his meds. He is stealing his knives off of his dinner tray. Just so you know this. And I would never get any response about it, you would never hear anything. I didn’t go visit him the first month. I went twice and he would say, “You are dead to me.” 
AS: Because you had committed him.
JH: Because I called the police. I called the police because he tried to cut his… he tried to cut his toe off. We didn’t discover that he was trying to cut his penis off until he was in the hospital. He had cut his little toe almost completely off and he had tried to cut his eye. I went to go pick him up and I had been watching the progression of him. I noticed some burns on his arm and I was like, “What happened?” While I am watching him go down and I know he is going down and I know he is getting sicker and I am just waiting for him to do something. Because then they’ll keep him. So I see that he is burning himself and I’ll say, “You shouldn’t be burning yourself.” We are at Baker’s Square or Wendy’s or something. I’m just like “Okay. I’ll see you next week.” I pick him up for dinner. I watch him and I knew he was injuring himself. I was preparing. I knew that there was going to be a time when I was going to pick him up and we were either going to the hospital or I was going to have to do what I ultimately did, which was call the police.
AS: From home?
JH: We were driving. I picked him up. The day that I picked him up Allison called me and I had seen him a couple of days before and I knew we were getting close, I knew that it had to come. This is the sad state of mental—I knew it had to be over a threshold. I knew if he was just burning his arm maybe they would put a 72-hour hold on him and then release him. I had COPE come out three times and the third time they said, “Maybe he needs to go to a job placement program,” and I’m thinking, “He’s schizophrenic! How can you not see this. Yeah I’ll look into it. Yeah.” 
Allison called me and I don’t even know where I was. I think I was coming home from church, yeah, it was Sunday and I was coming home from church and Allison says, “Mom, Andy just did something to his eye. He is limping and he did something to his eye. It’s bleeding.” She is like, “Get over here.” I’m like, “Allison, tell Andy that I am coming.” I had plans to see him later that night. “Just tell him, don’t panic, tell Andy I’m going to get him from lunch a little early. And to be ready.” And I’m like, “Allison don’t panic. Okay? Just don’t panic. It will be okay.” Well, I’m talking to an addict. “It will be okay. I promise it will be okay. Just tell him to calm down.” 
So, I go there and in my head I’m thinking, “Okay, I thought I was going to take him here. And, get him here and then go over to Nancy’s, or go somewhere and call the police to come and get him. So he comes down to the car and he has cut the white of his eye. He cut the cornea of his eye and the white of his eye is now just red. And he comes down and he is limping. It is clearly bad. And he gets in the car and I’m like, “Hey. Hi. Wow, what happened to your eye?” “Oh, I cut it.” I said, “You cut your eye?” Acting like I know nothing about this eye. He’s like “I cut it on purpose.” “Andy, you cut your eye on purpose? What’s going on.” “It didn’t hurt.” I said, “Alright.” I’m thinking… this conversation needs to stop. “What do you want for lunch?” [laughs] The whole time in my head I’m thinking, “How is this going to play out?” “What do you want for lunch? Do you feel like spaghetti?” 
So we are driving down Lowry Avenue and we are going towards the house and he goes, “Where are we going?” and I said, “I think we should go back to my house and I’ll make spaghetti and I made a cake and we’ll just have lunch at my house.” And he looks at me and goes, “You’re going to call the cops.” And I’m like, “Andy…” I think whatever my reaction was he opened the door and just got out of the car while the car is moving. I’m lucky we are on Lowry Avenue. I’m just going, “Oh fuck here we go.” I pulled over and 911, “My son is schizophrenic. He has just injured himself. Please, he is not armed. You need to take him to Fairview Riverside. You need to get him. This is where he is. He is not armed. He is not armed. He is not armed. He will run. He will fight. He is mentally ill. Please get him.” And I get off the phone and pulled into Betty Dangers, the place with the ferris wheel in Northeast—Lowry and Marshall. I don’t know if you know it. The cop says, “Where are you? We will come and talk to you. Pull over and we will come and talk to you.” I just pull into the parking lot and I just sat in my car and I don’t think I started crying yet… This is the weekend Kathy moved out too. I just sit there and I think I started praying, “Please don’t kill my child. Please don’t think my child.”
AS: That they are going to shoot him.
JH: Well, at least he’s white, you know. I had that thought. At least he’s white. Because if he wasn’t white he might be dead. That is a really horrible thought, but it’s the truth. I did say a number of times, “He’s not armed. He’s not. He’s going to fight you. But he’s not armed.” I don’t think he fought though. I don’t know.
AS: How far did he get?
JH: You know I don’t know. I don’t know how far they got. 
AS: He had an injured toe and a bleeding eye.
JH: I mean he’s six foot six. You’re not going to miss him. He looks mentally ill too. He’s bald, he shaves his head. He looks scary. So, they called me, “Where do you want me to take him?” “Fairview Riverside. I’ll be there. I’ll meet you in the emergency room.” 
So they took him. I have to be thankful for the police. They did exactly what I said. Don’t take him to Hennepin County, take him to Fairview. That was partly because he had been there and where his records were. He had already been there twice. There was another thing that happened in between. This is the first one of this one. 
They assured me. He was put on suicide watch and brought back to the psychiatric ward. I went back there and sat with him and he was just agitated: “I hate you. You are dead to me.” So, I sat there with him for about an hour. And I talked to the nurse and I said, “You’re not going to let him go, are you?” She said, “There is no chance we are going to let them go.” Because that has happened. I’ve had that happen with Allison and him. I brought them to the emergency room and two hours later they are telling me to come pick them up. Allison poured boiling water on her arm. I brought her... probably to get pain meds looking back. I think she was also in a meth psychosis looking back. 
AS: Can you say where is Allison now and what is she doing? Is she currently using?
JH: Yes. Allison is currently using meth daily. She works at a bagel place locally. When she came back from Sweden she worked at this bagel place. All through high school she worked in Golden Valley. And the manager of that bagel place took a risk and hired her when she came back from Ohio. She was in Ohio for a year in jail, it was like a treatment center. And then we sent her to Pennsylvania and she didn’t stay and she came home and she started using even before she got off the bus here. Started using meth again. She’s living with her dad who lives in subsidized housing because he is a senior. He lives in senior subsidized housing in northeast Minneapolis. She works and she holds down her job and she just bought a car but I guess the car is having some issues. I saw her a week ago. She came into my work because I had a pair of shoes she wanted. And I quickly ushered her out. Because I don’t want that. 
AS: At the cafe?
JH: Yes. Because she doesn’t think anyone can tell she is a user but…
AS: Oh, really?
JH: Yes. She said, “I have to quit this mom. I have to quit.” I said, “Yeah, you do.” “I’m just getting so tired of this life.” Can you imagine? You know? “You can go to AA.” “I just hate AA.” “I know you do. I hope you can do it honey. You can’t be a meth addict and have a good life. I hope that you know that. I love you. See you.” She sees her brother twice a week. So, she is really good. And I’ve said to her, “You have to survive for him. You’ve got to survive. You can’t do it for yourself. Can you do it for him?” I kind of use anything. [laughs]
AS: [laughs] Another good mothering tactic. 
JH: Don’t stay alive for yourself. Don’t go clean for yourself because you’ve got a brother who is really sick and your brother needs you. And he will always need you. There will never be a time when he is not schizophrenic.
AS: There could be a time when you are not an addict. 
JH: Your dad is sixty-eight years old. I’m pretty healthy but I had cancer this last year. It could come back. I use that with her a lot. I try really hard when I catch myself doing that. With either of them. That the coercion and talking them into it. It is loaded with hope. It’s not that I don’t have hope because I do have hope. I want to have hope because they are my kids. When you have hope you have something. I used to say when you have hope, you have everything. That's not true. When you have hope you have something. 
I don’t know what the future is, you know? There are stories of redemption and human spirit that I don’t know, aren’t my story or my children’s story. I’m not going to act like I don’t have moments of like total bleakness where I just go, “Oh my God. Who put shit in this fan anyway? Who put shit in the fan anyway?” [laughs]
AS: Right, the little plaque.
JH: Right, I have a little plaque [laughs]. I don’t dwell on the possibility that I will survive both of my children, but I do understand that it’s very possible. 
AS: That it is likely.
JH: Right, that it is likely. I know that Andy has not let go of the obsession to harm himself. The unfortunate thing is that he seems to think that he needs to cut his penis off and it won’t kill him if he does. And Allison is a drug user and and intravenous drug user. That’s as dangerous as it gets. There is a good possibility that both of my children will not make it through their twenties. I hope that that’s not the truth of my life. I’ll cross that bridge if I come to it. If I ever come to it I will cross it and accept it. Not to be flippant or dismissive but nobody is meant to live forever. I don’t believe there is a God with a plan—we had this discussion. I don’t believe there is a God with a plan for me or my children. I don’t want to. That is disturbing to me. It’s not even comforting for me. That is downright disturbing. That is a whole other conversation.
AS: You were awesome. Thank you. Thanks a lot. "

JH: Where can I go, what can I do? I find help for the him but the beds aren’t open and they won’t be open for three weeks. This guy’s using heroin daily and he could easily die between now and then. That’s what we went to go tell the Lieutenant Governor, that we can’t as clinicians stand by. Part of the reason why there’s a three week waiting list, this is why I went to her, we have a system set up in Minnesota and many states for people with public assisted medical plants, PMAPs they’re called. The PMAP will pay for treatment but all the beds in the cities are filled and we’ve got waiting lists but in Wadena they’ve got an open bed. They’re dying for people to come there because they’ve got open beds and clinicians ready to serve. The PMAP won’t pay for it because it’s out of the seven county area, thereby funneling everybody back into the cities which creates the three week waiting list. My talk with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, was can we take a look at that system and stop that? If I can get somebody a bed in Wadena and they’re willing to drive down here and pick him up.
AS: They’ll come get them?
JH: They’ll come get them. The only way that it works, you think it’s great because this guy’s got insurance. If he didn’t have insurance, if he comes in without any insurance at all now the county will say no because he has an open case here in Ramsey County so we’re not going to fund. They might Hennepin and Ramsey but you have to work at it. 
AS: Which is what I had to do to get my daughter into Tapestry.
JH: So you know.
AS: I tried to do all kinds of things. I tried to get a friend in St. Paul to let her sleep on his couch and say she’s homeless. He wouldn’t do it. I understood it but at the time to me that was not lying. That was just getting my daughter in treatment.
JH: These are the barriers that I witness, we witness every day. Part of my solution because the system is so broken. Even though somebody really could benefit from an in-patient treatment bed this is what Resurrection Recovery was kind of created for. We’re an intensive outpatient treatment with intensive case management services and we have referrals for housing, transitional housing. We’re purchasing our own house. That’s what my bookkeepers are doing today. We’re doing some year-end stuff to submit to the bank for our loan. We will buy our own house because we’ve been trying to refer people to some of the GRH housing. Have you heard of that?
AS: What does that stand for?
JH: Group residential housing. The county will pay for those. Even if somebody has health insurance. Health insurance won’t pay for your housing but even if somebody has health insurance I can request that the county pay for the housing and I’ve never had them turn me down unless somebody has an open case in another county. 
AS: What constitutes an open case?
JH: If they’re receiving food stamps or general assistance.
AS: I could see how those could get really complicated and just stop someone from getting treatment if they aren’t living…
JH: Why not a one payer system? 
AS: Instead of each county dealing with all of it.
JH: You’re a Minnesotan, how about that? Not a Ramsey County resident. How about we got to a one payer system for the entire state of Minnesota.
AS: When you think of how many of us have to work in other counties, we drive home to another county, we might even drive to another sector of the state. But for poor people they’re not supposed to be allowed to have that kind of flexibility.
JH: It drives me crazy. Because this system is so complex and is creating more barriers for people. I’m on the ground floor with this and I have people in here sitting in that chair crying because nobody will help them. I just can’t sit by and say, “Well sucks to be you. Okay I’ll see what I can do. Somebody will call you in a few weeks.” If you’re still living, if you still have a phone, if we’re still able to contact you, if you’re still in the city, if you’re still in the state. I’ll be just a little bit political here for a second. We had a number of people coming from other states, specifically Illinois because Illinois doesn’t have as easy access to chemical dependency services as Minnesota does. We have this huge influx of people that are non-native Minnesotans, not people living here or paying taxes here who immediately get put on county assistance and their treatment is paid for. They get a bus pass, they get their housing paid for, all of those things. That’s great. It’s so nice that we’re that magnanimous but what about the people who live here who have paid taxes here, whose families are here who are paying taxes here and I can’t find a treatment bed for them. I just can’t reconcile that, I can’t. If we’re going to open our door that wide for people from other states why close it on the people that live here now. My solution would be the one payer system which everybody tells me is never going to happen.
AS: One payer for health care?
JH: Yes.
AS: Nationally?
JH: Wouldn’t that be wonderful. 
AS: I just wondered about the scope of your dream.
JH: Let’s start small. Let’s start with Minnesota. 
[Break in Recording]
JH: It is our revenue generating business so that we can purchase houses and do things. Then I started a nonprofit called the Continuing Care Center which does all the case management. I have a MN Sure navigator so he helps people sign up for health insurance. That office is in this building but in another office space. All the clients that come to us are basically, have you heard of Maslow? Maslow’s Hierarchy of Need, the pyramid. Almost everybody who comes here, their basic needs aren’t even being met. As a substance abuse and mental health provider it’s proven a fact that they don’t a place to live and they don’t have any clothes, a winter jacket, and they don’t have an ID. “I lost my Social Security card and all my clothes were in a backpack and it got stolen.” Rather than just say, “Well just stop drinking and everything will be fine.” It was just so overwhelming in the very beginning. I didn’t know what I didn’t know.
AS: In the beginning when you started this?
JH: Yes.
AS: When was that?
JH: Two years ago.
AS: Just two years ago. 
JH: Partly because I worked in the field for quite a while. I have a master’s degree in Human Services. I’ve worked in Community Services. I’ve been homeless. I’ve been an injecting heroin user. I’ve been incarcerated. I’ve lived and people like us often make the best counselor because we can be relatable to people and not say, “Will you tell me why you’d this?” If somebody asked me that question, then I say you’re not ready to hear the answer if you have to ask the question. It doesn’t make any sense. It was just two years ago. I have a business partner and the two of decided, he doesn’t work here but financially we put this place together. He works for Health Care for the Homeless which is inside the Dorothy Day Center through West Side Community Health. His employer is West Side Community Health. He’s stationed at the Dorothy Day Center. The two of us together were saying “What can we do to help this population now and in real time?” In patient treatment beds were so hard to come by, still are, with the bottlenecking of everybody with the PMAPS and the seven county metro area and the empty beds in Wadena. This is kind of the beginning step to changing that system. When people come in and I say, “It’s a three to four week waiting list and I can get you started here today. I can get you in touch with case management services so that we can get some of these things moving.”
AS: Your model is to provide services immediately and to try to hold on to them, keep them for these three weeks before you can actually get them. 
JH: I’ll put out the call for a bed and we will continue to help the client call.
AS: You’re kind of that bridge then that I was wishing for a few years ago. That many parents end up wishing for because we can’t have our children in our homes. We’ve reached that point where it’s dangerous and destructive for everybody.
JH: Are you familiar with TAM then?
AS: Who’s that?
JH: The Addict’s Mother.
AS: Oh yes. I’m on that page.
JH: So am I. We’ll backspace here. Initially with my history, I’d been free from addiction if you will for over twenty years but for the first ten I didn’t want anything to do with people like me. I didn’t. I tried to work in the corporate world. 
AS: I’m going to make you pause for a second. You have to say on here that you give me permission to record this starting when I started the recording. You have to say your name and say that you give me permission. Go ahead.
JH: Hi, I’m Julie Hooker and I do give permission to Amy to record whatever I’m saying today.
AS: We are at Resurrection Recovery in St. Paul. Julie Hooker is the founder and director of this treatment and support center. I’ll have you sign this release form later when we’re done. It’s great that you actually started this talking about what you’re doing here because on the way over I was thinking, “I think what I want to do is have her start with what she’s doing right now.” I’ve usually been starting these with your childhood and going backwards. You’ve kind of given a good idea of what it is you’re doing now but why don’t you start from the point where you tried to work in the corporate world and then let’s talk about your career in treatment. Then let’s go back. The other option would be you just tell your story as things come up. It doesn’t matter to me if it’s chronological. 
JH: If I start with trying to work in the corporate world I’ve already bypassed the many “unsuccessful” attempts at recovery.
AS: Do you want to just start with your childhood and your addiction story? Where were born and where did you grow up?
JH: I’m a native Minnesotan. I’m a blond haired, blue eyed Swedish Norwegian girl, Lutheran, ate lutefisk and lefse at Christmas every year. 
AS: Where did you grow up?
JH: In the Twin Cities area but we moved around a lot. My dad was in social work. My mom was a stay at home mom. I’m the middle born of six children. We were upper middle class. There wasn’t a lot of drama. There was a lot of love and affection. I didn’t have that sometimes typical upbringing of neglect and abandonment and abuse. I didn’t have that. There was a lot of alcohol growing up. I started drinking eight, nine because Dad always drank with a can of Grain Belt Beer between his legs and drove. “Give me another beer honey.” He was nice when he drank. He was fun and he was friendly and he’d give us whisker rubs and he was not mean. He was more fun. I’d be like, “Can I have some money Dad? Can I get you another beer Dad?” The reward for going to get him another beer was the first sip out of the can. I had learned that that was a reward for doing something good. 
AS: What year were you born?
JH: ‘57. I didn’t know that that was unusual.
AS: That’s powerful.
JH: I graduated high school at seventeen. My dad got me a keg of beer. Why not? For a party. That kind of upbringing that it wasn’t a scary or negative thing when people drank. It was fun and everybody had a good time. 
AS: There was no violence or despair or negative consequences?
JH: No. Back then here in Minnesota you could, I remember doing this, I was probably fifteen. You could go to the bar with your parents and drink as long as they were with you. I learned how to shoot dice and play pool. It was a kind of different view on especially alcohol.
AS: Did you understand your tolerance then pretty easily? My parents started serving us wine at dinner when we were in our late teens if it was a special occasion. 
[Phone Call]
JH: Yes, I guess. I have recollections of drunkenness in my teens. I never really saw it as being a negative. I’ve never had a DUI. I don’t get drunk and have somebody beat me up. Historically it just wasn’t that big of a deal. The big deal I guess it was in the early 80s with cocaine. In 1975 I graduated from high school. In 1978 I went to Oregon on a vacation. I stayed for twenty-three years. True story. I just fell in love with Oregon. I ended up on this kind of hippie commune. We were growing pot. It was a cool thing to do. I’m kind of a hippie at heart.
AS: Whereabouts in Oregon?
JH: That commune was in a place called Harlan, Oregon which is halfway between Corvallis and Newport in the coast range. I don’t know how well you know Oregon. Kind of at the Northwest base of Mary’s Peak which is the tallest peak in the coast range. Twenty miles as the crow flies from the coast inland. I lived there and then I’m a musician so I was playing in Lincoln City.
AS: What do you play?
JH: Piano, guitar, dulcimer. Old Joni Mitchell fan. Who else plays the dulcimer besides Joni Mitchell. It was there that I met the man that would be my husband. We ended up doing cocaine together and growing marijuana. We ended up moving into town because I missed running water and a washing machine, a toaster, flushing toilets.
AS: How long did you last on the commune?
JH: Almost two years. That was a long time. It was probably one of the most fond memories I have of my entire life. It was phenomenal. Even then things weren’t out of hand. Everything was manageable, life was good. Moving back into the city and being in a relationship that was a little toxic to begin with, that toxicity grew. There was a lot of betrayal and a lot of abandoning the principles of the vows we took. 
AS: You got married?
JH: We got married and were childless for the first eight years of our marriage. I couldn’t have any children. I had to have surgery to make it possible. Once had my first child my focus was no longer on my husband, it was on my child. Therein lies the problem. He was not happy with sharing me. It got really sick and toxic. I think from that, we had two children together, right after the second child was born it was very, very ugly. We were living in separate rooms in the same house. We divorced and then that’s when things just went kind of south for me. I was just looking for some kind of validation. When you split up like that it feels like I’ve done something wrong even though I don’t think it’s wrong for me to put all my energy into this baby that we just spent tons of money. It’s day four, five o’clock come home honey kind of thing. It was after the divorce and the very first guy that I hooked up with was a career heroin addict. Very first guy. I was enamored. I just thought that was cool.
AS: With him or did you try it right away?
JH: Almost right away. A little hesitation. It went from no big deal to oh my gosh now this is a devastating thing. It’s really hard to get out of once you’re in. I’ve heard many heroin addicts and myself included say, “The very first time I did it, it was like, where have you been all my life?” That’s exactly what happened to me. It just felt wonderful. He said it felt like a warm hug. I went, yes that’s what it does.
AS: You don’t have to have a person there to hug you.
JH: Because people leave. Whether they’re there physically or not. 
AS: How old were your kids at this point?
JH: One and three, babies. I don’t think she was even one yet. Very quickly spiraled into selling cocaine and heroin so that I could get more heroin. I smoked some of the cocaine and shot some of it too. How did this happen? It really was kind of that. It wasn’t headstrong. I’m a mom, I’ve got these little kids. I worked like hell to be able to have children and here I am going “What the hell is happening to me?” My house got raided in a drug raid. 
AS: Was he living there?
JH: No. Well he stayed there but he wasn’t living there. He got charged with frequenting when it was really mostly his business. I got charged with possession with intent to distribute. I immediately went to jail. The kids immediately got taken out of the home. My husband and I had been divorced for quite a while and we had joint custody. Thank God we had joint custody because otherwise the kids would have gone into the system. My husband had remarried right after our relationship. He was forty I think and she was seventeen. I’m not kidding.
AS: How old were your kids when the raid happened?
JH: Six and eight.
AS: This went on for a while.
JH: About five, six years. The worst part of it was about six or seven years. 
AS: The kids are six and eight.
JH: It was terrible. There were syringes around. It was Hooker’s home for the homeless and soup kitchen. Whoever wanted to come over came over. 
AS: Hooker being your last name?
JH: Yes. Actually there’s a little funny story. As things progressed and got worse and worse prostitution became a viable option. I’d been arrested for that. I will never forget the first time when I went into court and they call your name and they read the charges. They said, “Julie Hooker, prostitution” and the courtroom erupts in laughter. Even the judge was covering his mouth. My attorney started laughing. He was a trick. This is so humiliating and you would think would this not be enough. I was charged with that. Actually it was the only misdemeanor I’ve ever had. All the rest are felonies because of the drug charges. In Oregon at that time they were just starting the drug court thing. I didn’t have any priors. I didn’t even have a parking ticket. I’d never been arrested. I was a good, upper middle class, white, Midwestern girl. What am I doing here in this? How did this happen?
AS: By this time, we’re in the mid-80s?
JH: Yes, mid to late 80s. I went to jail that day. The kids were terribly traumatized. It was a SWAT team that broke in. There were seven of them. They had masks and guns and they used a percussion bomb to shatter my living room window.
AS: Why?
JH: I don’t know.
AS: They couldn’t just knock on the door. That was the late 80s. I had a neighbor that happened to. It was frightening to be the neighbor. 
JH: It’s frightening to have it happen. My kids, for years I couldn’t talk about it without crying I still tear up a little bit. The kids were sleeping in a bedroom. I was in the living room and I’m buck ass naked laying on the floor when this all happens. I’ve got all these masked, gun toting guys come in. A guy’s got a gun to the back of my head and a knee in my back saying, “Don’t move.” I remember turning my head and seeing my daughter standing in the hallway. Oh my God it was horrifying. I don’t have any violence. I don’t have any guns. The kids witness it and then they try to hand the kids teddy bears. They came in with teddy bears. The whole thing is like what the hell is wrong with you?
AS: It’s a teddy bear that gives comfort, not other adults.
JH: I’m handcuffed. They threw a towel over me. I couldn’t even hug my kids. 
AS: To get you out of the house?
JH: For fear that I might try to hand them something. I’m not kidding. It was horrible. The kids leave and I remember one of the officers was saying, “Take them to child protection services.” I said, “No, I’ve got joint custody. You’re calling their dad. Here’s his number.” They said, “Isn’t he a drug addict too?” I said, “You sure didn’t do your research.” He had some issues but he didn’t have issues like I did. The assumption was there that he must be too. I had to fight with them. They did bring the kids; they didn’t have to go into child protection.
AS: They did take them to your husband?
JH: Yes, but he was married to that other girl. They’d been married for quite a while and they had two little kids. They were living in subsidized housing where they couldn’t have two more kids. Because of that they got kicked out of their house and were homeless and living in the shelter. I’m sitting in jail. 
AS: With an addiction.
JH: Look at how many lives are just shattered all because of that. What I know today is in other countries if something like that is going on, the percussion bomb and the SWAT team and the guns and all that stuff doesn’t happen. It’s let’s pull you in, let’s sit down with a team full of people, a doctor, an addiction specialist, a mental health specialist and find out what we can do to help you. That’s what happens in other countries. Here it’s still this war on drugs and that was literally a war on drug addicts. 
AS: It was, it still is. 
JH: It still is. 
AS: That was at the high point of that.
JH: I was in the middle of that. Consequently, that history informs who I am today. Having experienced that informs how I do treatment today. I’ve been working in the field for quite a while and every place that I have worked I’ve been called into the office saying, “Julie you can’t say things like that. Julie that’s not how we do things here. Julie she has to provide a UA today. You can’t tell her to just go ahead and go. You must toe the line.” I have never been a firm supporter of the urine drug screen policy. Let’s see what we can catch people doing kind of thing. That doesn’t matter to me. What matters to me is what can I do to help you with what’s happening in your life today. Not you have a urine drug screen today and people panic and come up with lies.
AS: And bring in other people’s pee.
JH: I had people who would go heat it up in a microwave and hand it to me. It’d be hot. One time there was a whole bunch of bubbles in there. I’m like, that’s like Mountain Dew.
AS: It was?
JH: Yes. I said, “If you peed those bubbles out you’d be screaming.” I just went through so much of that. Working in the system of abstinence only and a punitive approach flew in the face of my personal belief system having experienced what I had. I’ve been through six different treatments myself, all abstinence based. That was the only indicator of wellness.
AS: You never were in a medication assisted? You never did methadone?
JH: I refused to do methadone because I used to sell heroin and I was the girl in the parking lot at the methadone clinic. You could come out with your carry outs and I’d trade you a little piece of heroin and I had the juice lined up in my fridge for backup. That was a joke to me. I understand how it can work, I do. There was no Suboxone at that time. To me at that time methadone clinics were no different, it’s just the federal government was your dope dealer. 
AS: And you had to pee for them.
JH: You had to stand in line in a humiliating way at a very, very early time in the morning. People would drive by and see this line of people.
AS: It’s set up to be humiliating.
JH: It’s a punitive system. Of course when we are humiliated we are going to stop the behavior. In one of the treatments I was in, this is back when the field and clinicians thought this was the way to do it. Back where they put you in the center of the room and everybody in the treatment group would tear you down. I had a sign that said, “master manipulator.” I had to wear that sign and everybody would tell me how manipulative I was. 
AS: What kind of therapy was that called and where did it happen?
JH: Oregon. It was all over everywhere.
AS: I’ve heard about it.
JH: You have to tear them down and build them back up. Start from scratch. Get rid of all the ego. It didn’t work for me.
AS: It could also for some people, particularly be even more traumatizing and humiliating. 
JH: I already felt shame. Ten times what they could give me. You don’t even know what I feel. I just described to you an incident that still makes me cry and my kids are in their thirties. It’s so powerful that history that I carry with me informs why I do what I do today. You’re still thinking that punishing somebody is going to change their behavior. It’s not going to work that way. Let me do what I do, let me try to help inform. I’m a huge believer in Dr. Gabor Mate back when I first read him I went, “Oh my God. Where have you been?” I keep getting in trouble at every place that I work for having a belief system like he does.
AS: What do those POs say back to you when you say that?
JH: We’re shifting. It depends on how old they are. 
AS: If they’re younger they’ll cooperate with you?
JH: A little bit more. Not always because they’re in a box that says you have to follow these rules or else.
AS: Because what if their guy goes and does something really horrible? Does that reflect poorly on them?
JH: On them. 
AS: They’re in a punitive system as well.
JH: So let’s lock them up. Let’s just lock everybody up. When I work I try and be the biggest advocate for the client so we don’t do urine drug screens here, we never will. It creates a barrier and I want to reduce barriers. If I say, “Here. Go pee in this cup for me.” I just created some anxiety.
AS: They start feeling nervous about everything. I don’t even use and when you tell me I have to go pee in a cup I feel nervous.
JH: It’s because it’s requesting a bodily fluid to prove what? It doesn’t prove wellness. I know people who are still using who are getting well. Little by little they’re getting well. I know people who have stopped using.
AS: But what’s in their pee is inconsequential. 
JH: It doesn’t matter what substances people are using. It’s why people use substances in the first place. I believe that it’s trauma related that it’s trying to relieve some kind of pain. For me it was really kind of the abandonment, not being good enough for my husband. Did he really love me? When you start questioning am I enough?
AS: Do you believe that his assertion that this goes back to in utero?
JH: I’m not convinced of that because I don’t know on a cellular how much recall. 
AS: That seems a little extreme to me.
JH: A little overreaching.
AS: But just living in the world regardless of what happened in utero can be traumatizing. Whether you’re twenty-five or five.
JH: Exactly.
AS: That’s kind of what I was thinking about after that. You did by and large have a very loving childhood?
JH: Yeah and then I felt guilty because…
AS: Why did this happen to me? Why did I become an addict?
JH: How? That only happened to people who had terrible tragedies. I didn’t have a terrible tragedy. What excuse do I have? I went through all kinds of stuff. I went to six different treatments.
AS: Were they all in Oregon?
JH: Yes. It was always unsuccessful completion. I did have one that was a successful completion and I’d only been there for two weeks and it was a thirty-day program. They came in one day and said, “Julie you’ve been doing so well that we have elevated you.” I went, “Oh my insurance ran out.” Then just tell me that. Don’t come in and say I’ve done really well because you don’t even know me. 
AS: They would say that because your insurance ran out?
JH: Yes, then I’d have to leave. At that time Oregon had a cap on services. Once I reached the cap then they couldn’t get paid for me anymore. Of course I’d made great strides. 
AS: During those, what’s the time frame between your first treatment and say your last? And did your last one actually stick?
JH: No I used after that too. 
AS: So you were in jail? Go back to that.
JH: I was in jail a number of different times. I started off with a…
AS: When the raid happened and your kids end up back with their dad, what happens there?
JH: After jail I get out, I was there for sixty, seventy days something like that. Got put on probation with a no use contract for sixty months probation.
AS: Five years.
JH: Yeah. The funny part is in the raid itself there was very little, there was scrapable substances found. Less than a gram. Had they come the day before there was a lot. They got me on an informant, controlled buy...even though there wasn’t anything at the house that day...It was an informant, controlled buy.
AS: What does that mean controlled buy?
JH: The police give an informant money to go in and purchase.
AS:  So it’s b-u-y. 
JH: Yes. The police will give an informant money to go in and purchase the substance. They even let them do the substance quite often. 
AS: As an extra treat?
JH: As a reward because if there’s nothing in it for you what’s in it for you? I’ll reduce your sentence? That doesn’t matter to most people. If I get to keep the money or do the drug. It’s a really criminal element in criminal justice. It happens in the FBI, all over the place. The first time that I got out of jail. I will never forget this. The other thing I want to work on in the criminal justice system. I get out and they let you out extremely early in the morning so they don’t have to feed you. If they feed you then it’s another day they’ve got to pay for. They let you out really early in the morning. I got a bus token. I was told to go see the PO. The PO’s office doesn’t open until eight or nine. I’m out at five o’clock in the morning. What am I supposed to do? It’s dark. What am I supposed to do?
AS: You can’t go back to your house?
JH: I don’t have a house. I’ve been in jail. I lost everything. I lost everything ten times over. There’s a saying, “Go to jail, lose your shit.” That’s just what happens unless somebody had been there to take call of all my stuff. It’s gone. The landlord came in and took all the stuff. I lose it all. You have tons of friends when you have it all in place and the minute you’re not there they’re gone. I have no place to live, I have no support system in place, I have no money, I have no job. I’m not even a mom anymore. I have no responsibilities. What do I do? I went to the dope house where I knew I could find some people that would let me in. This perpetuates. Number one, the system itself is flawed in that you shouldn’t let people out at that time in the morning with a bus token. My house got raided March first. When I got out it was hot and I had clothes from winter. It’s Oregon so it’s not that big of a deal.
AS: You got out like in June? Sixty days you said?
JH: May, June, something like that. A couple of months. It’s warm now. Another time I went to jail when it was warm and I got out when it was cold and I had flip flops and it was forty degrees outside. The system doesn’t set you up for success. It sets you up for failure. There were no social services in place. Nobody came to see me in jail saying, “What can we do when you get out? How can we help you? What can we do to support you? What are your goals? Can we help you get the kids? What do we got to do?” None of that’s in place. I’m trying to figure it out all on my own. All while feeling like a worthless piece of you-know-what because I just screwed everything up. Look what I just did to those kids. Not just in that instance but over years. Look what I just did. It perpetuated everything.
AS: They kept cycling back on it. It was a monster that kept eating itself. 
JH: I’d just get arrested again. One time I’d gotten out really early in the morning and I was supposed to go see my PO at eight or nine or whatever. I didn’t because there’s hours in between. What am I supposed to do? Go sit? A girl by myself in the dark and go sit and wait in front of a building until somebody comes? What? I’m not doing that. I didn’t go see my PO right away like I was supposed to. I was out on what they call the stroll. It was probably noon. A police officer pulled up and went, “Get in the car.” I hadn’t even been out of jail for six hours when I got arrested again for failing to appear with my probation officer. 
AS: Just that morning?
JH: Just that morning. 
AS: Then how long were you in?
JH: Thirty days. I lose track. They had what they called the Graduated Sanction Program where you...the whole system is...meanwhile while you’re there you have nothing.
AS: I’m getting too smug. What’s a Graduated…?
JH: A Graduated Sanction Program is where a sanction is a [slaps wrist] “Bad girl don’t do that again.” It can start with fifteen days and then it graduates to thirty the second time.
AS: Graduated means it gets longer and longer. 
JH: Meanwhile no treatment.
AS: Nobody’s offering you treatment for anything?
JH: What they offered was I could get out of my cell if I chose to go to AA. So sign me up. Or Prison Fellowship to get out. 
AS: That wasn’t treatment. That’s just sitting around.
JH: This is part of the problem that still people think that AA is treatment. Still people are being remanded to AA. 
AS: Today?
JH: Yes! I have a guy in my group, he just graduated, who had to have signed cards because it was a requirement of his probation that he go to Alcoholics Anonymous. I argued with his PO saying “That’s not treatment. He’s in treatment. Support can come in many different forms. He’s got support here. He’s in a support group.” You can’t tell me that I should go to synagogue every Saturday. I’m not Jewish. How can you tell me that I have to go to AA? What if I’m not feeling it? There’s still a lot of that. I had that too. In fact, I was told that I had to go to AA or NA meetings. “Okay, alright. I’ll do that.” But I couldn’t have any contact with other felons. How am I going to do both? The NA meeting is filled with people like me. I’m just violating the condition by following the condition. It’s ridiculous. 
AS: You end up getting a felony?
JH: Multiple. I got charged with child endangerment, endangering the welfare of minors times two.
AS: Did you get your children back?
JH: They were just with their dad so I never had any legal…
AS: Did the endangerment happen later?
JH: No, in the raid. 
AS: Those were the felony charges.
JH: The possession is a felony, intent to distribute.
AS: So just to understand. You got a felony for child endangerment.
JH: And the endangering the welfare of a minor.
AS: But only served sixty days?
JH: Because I got that dropped.
AS: The child endangerment?
JH: Yes. As part of a plea agreement to “Don’t sell drugs ever again.”
AS: You said, “Sure.”
JH: Sure, no problem. Child Protective Services never opened a case. Had they opened a case then we’d be in a whole different story. Then I’d have to follow their guidelines. We work with people who work for Child Protective Services. Those things didn’t interfere with my ability to get the kids back. That was only between me and my husband, ex-husband which when the girls were teenagers he called saying, “Please take them back. Please!” What happened, I had an accidental overdose. I’ve had two. I had an accidental overdose. I was shooting some heroin, we were with a gang of thieves going from town to town boosting from stores and buying heroin. Just this terrible life. I’m caught up in this system and there doesn’t seem to be any way out. Apparently, obviously I went out, but apparently I did too much heroin and we were in an apartment building and the next thing I know I’m in a stairwell being revived with Narcan. This is in 1990, ‘91. Something like that. In 1996, December 28, 1996 it happened again but I’ll tell that story in a minute. 
AS: Who revived you?
JH: Paramedics. Somebody called paramedics. They pulled me out of the apartment room that we were in and put me in a stairwell so that they couldn’t be identified. This isn’t uncommon. 
AS: Who put you there?
JH: The other people I’m with.
AS: Just put you in the hallway and called the cops?
JH: Thank God they did that. They call it a dump and I have been part of where we just dump somebody off in front of the Emergency Room because the fear is we’ve all got warrants or we’re doing criminal activity, we’re all going to jail. We can’t get caught up in this whole thing. I was revived by Narcan and yay. I didn’t stop my drug use. What happened December 27, 1996, a similar thing. Still running around with people. Still not being a mom, still not working. I had another overdose. I was with a bunch of people. We were in this motel and I remember going, “No, no, no, no.” I knew what it felt like. That split second, you can’t take it back. I thought I was dead or whatever. I woke up on my own about twelve hours later. I was still purple all around on my face. I remember I was on the floor and my ID was next to me on the floor, on the carpet. There was a Mexican motel maid kind of kicking at me saying, “You have to pay for another day.” I woke up going, “What happened?” My ID was left. They thought I was dead. They didn’t call. They left my ID so I would be identified. Who does that? I had been part of that whole thing for a long time and that day I went, “I can’t.” They left me for dead with my ID. 
AS: And you survived.
JH: I remember when I woke up. Some people call it divine intervention. I didn’t see any bright lights. I didn’t hear God talk to me. I didn’t have anything like that. I woke up to a motel maid kicking me telling me I had to pay for another day. That experience transformed me. I got up and gathered myself and I called the only person that I knew I could call. That was my ex-husband. I said, “Take me to detox.” In Oregon you can go to detox for any substance. Minnesota what the hell is wrong with us, you can’t. You can’t go to detox. You have to go to a hospital base but detox itself is alcohol only. Unless you go to Hastings. You can go there but the detox here in town. 
AS: It’s just for alcohol?
JH: Yes. That’s a problem too. I shared that with the Lieutenant Governor. Detox should be the funneling to an in-patient treatment bed. Save them now. Reach out now. Window of opportunity is this big. If you miss that, we’re gone.
AS: It might just be an hour. It might be less than an hour that they’re willing.
JH: I was fortunate because Oregon, they’re a little more progressive I think in a lot of ways. I went to detox. Normally you can only stay ten days. We were on a first name basis. I pushed the button, “Hi it’s Julie.” They go, “Hey honey. Welcome home.” I stayed for like three weeks because I kept saying, “I can’t go out there out there. This is what I need. I need to earn an honest day’s work. I need to be in a safe surrounding with other people who are supportive.” So they turned me on to a relatively new concept for Oregon then. It was called Oxford House. Oxford House is a national organization. I have to credit the Oxford House group, organization for providing me with exactly what it was that I said I needed. I went and interviewed at interviewed at an Oxford House. It was about thirty miles away from where I was living in Salem, Oregon. Moved in and I had two thousand hours of community service to do. 
I was lucky to do that. I’m an articulate, well-educated woman. I talked my way into that. Otherwise I was going to jail. I wasn’t going to shovel shit at the zoo or pick up trash on the freeway. I came off and was very manipulative and said, “I want to give back to the community from which I took so much.” It was all bullshit at the time, truly, but I don’t know what inspired me to do that but I wrote a proposal and the judge agreed. I got these two thousand hours. Oxford House is a non-profit. Cool I live here. There’s other Oxford Houses. I’ll go volunteer to do this, that, or the other. What I ended up doing was I was part of the first Women’s Oxford House Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. Then I became part of the very first World Council for Oxford House. I started opening Oxford Houses. I’ve opened thirteen altogether. I even opened one here in St. Paul. It fell apart. I was part of the state organization. I was the national chairperson and the state chairperson all for Oxford House. That’s how I stayed, I started doing service work as they say. Some people say, “It’s picking up trash and it’s making coffee at the AA meeting.” There’s some truth to that because being of service to others takes you out of your own ego and your own misery. You start seeing things a little differently. That’s what Oxford House did for me. I was involved with Oxford House; I still am peripherally.
AS: Did they use AA as a model? It’s different isn’t it?
JH: They use abstinence and they suggest support group meetings. It is based on the Oxford Group which was…
AS: Pre-AA.
JH: Yes. They are abstinence only. If people use in the house they do have to leave. It’s self-run and self-supporting. For somebody like me who doesn’t like to have somebody tell them what to do it was perfect. At that first house that I lived in the house voted and said, “Julie we want you to be treasurer.” I’m like, “Do you know who I am?” I never took a penny. I had a group of people trust me with something. I never took a penny from them. Not everybody does that. For me it was that somebody gave me an opportunity. From then on I became president of the house and then I got to do other things. It just gave me something to do and an opportunity to start organizing things and getting involved in things. It grew from this one small house to a national consideration. That was phenomenal for me. After a few years of starting different Oxford Houses, women’s. I started a couple men’s too. 
AS: Did you start them around the country?
JH: Nope. Just in Oregon. I did one in Green Bay, Wisconsin and I did one here. Eleven in Oregon. There was a fund, Ecumenical Ministries administered the fund. It was a revolving loan fund. We could borrow five thousand dollars to open up the house and then we would pay it back. That would keep the fund going. That was phenomenal. Oregon had that insight, foresight. They have today next to Washington state I think they have the third most Oxford Houses in the nation. There are about one thousand four hundred.
AS: Is the equivalent kind of a sober house except that the people who are living in it are self-supporting? That’s the big difference?
JH: It’s self-run, self-governed under the umbrella of a 501(c)(3). They elect officers. It’s the inmates running the asylum. So many people said that would never work. The beauty of it is that it’s exactly working.
AS: You also had life experience at a commune. 
JH: I knew how to get along with people. 
AS: You knew that this could work.
JH: I knew from the minute I walk in the door that this was a really cool deal. The self-run nature of it and the democratically, you voted on things. A majority had to agree. In fact, to vote a new member in it had to be eighty percent, not just a majority. It had to be eighty percent. We got into the whole democratic process. It just turned me on. I got very excited about it. After a few years my probation officer, Peggy Banister, was like “Julie you’ve completed your two thousand. You’re done.” I still didn’t stop. What started as a real manipulative move on my part turned into be the one thing that changed my life. Who knew? 
AS: We know what we need. Even though it might look manipulative or seem manipulative some part of you knew that you picking up trash was not going to go anywhere. You needed something bigger.
JH: Something that meant something. 
AS: I’m not sure I’d characterize it as manipulative. It may seem that way to you now.
JH: I look back and I wasn’t being altruistic and going “I just really want to help people.” I want to get these hours off my plate so I can get on with this thing. That created this life and now it’s been over twenty years where I haven’t had to resort to that kind of behavior. Along the way I found healing. I did some independent counseling. I had to fire a few people along the way. I found a woman, her name was Janet, who got me, who understood me, who didn’t ask me dumb questions. She was phenomenal at helping me heal some of those tragic things that had happened, the betrayal, the feelings of insecurity and I’m not good enough and I’ll never be enough and I’m too fat and I’m too ugly and I’m stupid. All that negative self-talk that we have that perpetuated this drug use. I started my eighth or so Oxford House my ex-husband called and the girls were starting to have their periods. He’s like, “Please.”
AS: Were you living in an Oxford House this whole time?
JH: Yes. You’ve got to live in them to teach how it works. If you come in from the outside…
AS: When you say you started them you actually would go live in it?
JH: Yeah I’d go find them. I was part of the housing coordination. I would go to Ecumenical Ministries and I’d apply for the loan and then I’d go find the house. I’d talk the landlords into it. I went to community forums and neighborhood association meetings. 
AS: To convince people that it was okay to have you live there.
JH: Partly because we were women it was easier than doing it with men. It was much harder with men. When my ex called and said, “I can’t take this anymore. You’ve been sober for a while.”
[Break in Recording]
AS: Your daughters hit puberty.
JH: Dad calls and says, “I can’t do this anymore.” There were no Oxford Houses for women with children. How am going to do this? I’ve been used to this communal living for so long.
AS: Were you seeing your girls during this time?
JH: Yeah. 
AS: You were back in their lives. 
JH: I couldn’t be when I was out...I was hiding in the bushes at their school. I did some goofy stuff. I was a working girl and one of the strolls was in front of one of their grade schools. Ew, ew. When all of that was no longer part of my life there was no barrier. I was in their lives again. They didn’t live with me. My fear was how am I going to do this? 
AS: How could you personally deal with this after?
JH: I’d been living communally. How am I going to take care of these kids by myself on my own in an apartment? That was scary to me. They’re teenagers now. I’ve got to buy tampons now and you’ve got hormones.
AS: And you’re the only adult.
JH: Yes. I opened the first women and children’s Oxford House. It made perfect sense. It was a transitional thing for me. It was the first women and children’s house in the state of Oregon. I think they have six now. It’s still a tough thing to do because there’s so much trauma and so much work to be done on families that are broken. When you put them all together it gets a little…
AS: It's like a women’s shelter.
JH: Yes, but it’s self-run and self-governed. But the thing about that and the thing about Oxford House is they have chapters. There were five different chapters in Oregon. There were only three when I first started. We developed chapters four and five. With the chapters its five or six houses together and their presidents meet monthly. There’s a greater organization to come in and support. We had the support of the chapter to come in and help us. It wasn’t just in my lap. I don’t know how to figure that stuff out. We did have the support of the chapter. My girls and I, I wished I would have thought of it, there was an article in the paper written about it. 
AS: Do you still have it?
JH: Yes. 
AS: I can still get a copy from you. 
JH: Here’s what they did. They’re interviewing me kind of similar to this and only one sentence out of the two hours I spoke with them did I mention that I had prostituted. The headline is: “Julie Hooker Prostitute and Former Boozer blah blah blah.” I was on the front page in the newspaper.
AS: You’re kidding me.
JH: No.
AS: This is in the 90s?
JH: Yes, and I’m humiliated. 
AS: Of course you would be. That’s a horrible thing to do. 
JH: It was sensationalized because it’s supposed to sell. 
AS: It was supposed to be celebrating the opening of the women and children’s...I do have to have a copy of that. That’s horrifying.
JH: It talks about how the system is failing and there isn’t enough support and everything. I’m like “Why would you do to me what you just did?” Number one I’d never been interviewed before. I didn’t know to watch what I said. I just was really naive. I’ve learned a lot since then. It could have devastating me and sent me the other direction because it was very traumatizing. 
AS: And what about what it would do for your girls and their friends?
JH: What it did do to my girls. What it did to my brother. My brother read it in the paper and called my parents. “Guess what she’s doing now.” It was a nightmare. It’s the whole stigmatizing thing. Fortunately for me I was well enough at the time to say, “Okay bring it on. I’m not ashamed of where I come from, what has happened has made me the woman I am today and I’m not ashamed of that. You want to play that game wow. You stoop to that okay whatever.” After opening the women and children’s house it was great for my kids too because they had to learn how to cooperate with others. They had chores. We had a board with a chore coordinator. You’ve got to do this. They’re like, “It’s not fair.” I’m like, “Well welcome to cooperation.”
AS: You didn’t’ have to be the only bad guy.
JH: It was that it takes a village kind of thing where we all loved and nurtured one another in that setting. It was beautiful in that sense but not without drama. It was beautiful in that sense. I guess we did that for about a year. Then I wanted to come back here to Minnesota because my parents were aging and they had, in my opinion, suffered enough with sleepless nights wondering if I was...Because I had gotten well and had been doing so well I thought, “I’m going to come back here and I’m going to reinvent myself here in Minnesota. I was off supervision. I didn’t have any ties left back there to repay. I’d done everything that I needed to there. 
The kids and I moved here in 2000. We left that behind and started fresh here. Still I didn’t want to work with people like me. I started an Oxford House and that’s how the kids and I when we first moved here, I stayed at my parents in Rochester for a little while. While I came up here because I had heard there was an Oxford House in St. Paul. I was still involved nationally. Paul Molloy who’s the founder, he says “You should talk to Oxford House such and such. Here’s the address.” I’m like, “Okay.” I went and talked to them. They’re kind of like, “Huh?” It just didn’t have the same effect here because there were so many sober houses in St. Paul that were run differently because the inmates couldn’t run the asylum. That democratic process was not going to work in a house with people like us. Trying to break that, we’re talking the Hazelden huge billboard. To come in and try to fly in the face of that model was not successful. 
Although I did open a house, a women’s house. Then almost as soon as I moved out it shut down. I just kind of said, “I’ll go in a different direction then. Minnesota may not be the place to grow this model.” Although it works really well in North Carolina, huge. Louisiana, my friend Mari Walker is going crazy in Louisiana. Oregon and Washington, Texas. Those five states. Just among those five states I think there’s a thousand maybe, Oxford Houses. It’s phenomenal.
AS: Do you think it was a political thing here, the reason it didn’t work? Do you think it’s because of the influence of sober house industry?
JH: And Hazelden. The Minnesota Model…
AS: Their model is one that says you need to be monitored all the time and you’re not to be trusted.
JH: You can’t be trusted. It is kind of the Minnesota Model of treatment. I did my master’s thesis on it. Ninety-five percent of treatment centers in the United States as of five years ago were abstinence only.
AS: You did your master’s thesis on the Minnesota Model?
JH: Not on the Minnesota Model but on abstinence versus harm reduction model. I know that harm reduction is not the antithesis of abstinence. It’s a bridge. Most people don’t see it that way. “They’re just going to keep doing it if you provide them with clean syringes.” The same thing happened with handing out condoms. “They’re just going to have more sex if you give them condoms.” No they’re going to have safe sex if you give them condoms. I think that’s why it was really difficult. I used to have this spiel down because I said it all the time. It was in the Ronald Reagan administration who made it law that this revolving loan fund shall be available in every state to provide the model for Oxford Housing. It was in 1990, ‘88 or ‘90. 
Oxford House started in 1978 by Paul Molloy in Silver Spring, Maryland which is a suburb of Washington D.C. Paul was a chronic alcoholic, politician, worked in the House or Senate or whatever drunk. He beat his wife. He wasn’t a really nice guy. They were living in a halfway house and the halfway house lost its funding. They were all going to get kicked out of this house. Paul in his infinite wisdom. He calls it he stumbled into it because he was drunk. He stumbled into this idea of a democratically run, we can do it ourselves, let’s not close this place, let’s do it ourselves. That’s how Oxford House started was this guy’s vision. A bunch of drunks could get together and vote on whether they were going to purchase an electric can opener or get the hand crank one. They had to vote on it. That’s a true story. He said they had a debate for forty-five minutes over whether they were going to purchase one or a hand one. That’s the democratic process. 
I think that model was supposed to have been open to all states. Ronald Reagan made it law. When I came here I quoted it. I used to have the spiel down perfect and I don’t remember it now. I came here and I spoke to somebody in the Department of Human Services about it. His response was, “I think we may have had something like that but I don’t think it’s in operation anymore.” I went “That doesn’t even make any sense.” So because I couldn’t access any money through any kind of revolving loan fund that’s when I went to Oxford House and said, “What do you guys got in the bank? Will you help us open this house?” I talked to the landlord and brokered a deal.
AS: Were these rental houses?
JH: They’re all rental houses. Oxford House cannot own. It’s a transient population. 
AS: The loan is for an initial down payment of rent?
JH: First and last month’s rent.
AS: But people pay rent to live there?
JH: They have to. You have to pay to live there. 
AS: The benefit is you’re living with other sober people and making your own rules. 
JH: You’re being supported.
AS: It’s the same community support that seems to work.
JH: Yes, and it’s lacking. We have a little bit of it with this GRH but with GRH housing it is run by somebody. If that person is kind and gentle and considerate then that transition can be wonderful. If that person is not, I can think of a place now that’s transitional GRH housing for men where the guy who runs it is just a jerk. He’s mean to people, threatening people. “If you don’t tell me who did this I’m going to kick you all out.” That kind of...You lose power; you don’t have power in that GRH housing because it’s not democratically run. It was autocratically run. Minnesota believes that that system has been working for them and that’s what they want to continue. I disagree and I really support the Oxford House model. But guess what? There’s no money in it for anybody. There’s no money in it. There’s nobody running it. They run themselves. It’s hard to fight against that system here. I just recognized that pretty early on. I’m not fighting this battle right now. I started to work in the corporate world. I was working for an inventory service company that did inventory and probably traded companies. I’m good at it but I hate it. I absolutely hate it. What happened was almost everybody that I work with would come to me at one point or another and say, “This is what’s happening and I don’t know what’s going on.” 
AS: In their own life?
JH: In their own lives. Then I was like, “What are you doing?” 
AS: People should pay me for this. 
JH: Yeah. I decided to go back to school to become a licensed alcohol and drug counselor which was a great idea at the time. I’m still pleased that I did it but it led me to become face to face with a system that I can’t work in, this punitive abstinence only system where I was in trouble almost every place I worked. I would get called into the office saying, “Julie you can’t do that. Julie don’t tell people that story.” You know what I mean? “Julie don’t. Julie stop. Write Julie up. Julie’s a malcontent.” I was like, “Oh my gosh. Is it me?” You’re questioning yourself. Meanwhile I’ve still got Gabor Mate over here. I’d been reading In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts and I’m like, “I know that person he’s writing about. I love the way he’s responding to that person.” Relationships are everything. This whole notion of abstinence only and the punitive nature does nothing to repair the disease, it perpetuates the disease. 
I left, not really left the field, but started working in mental health. In the mental health field there’s more harm reduction and a little more compassion. I don’t know how else to put it. I went to work for South Metro Human Services, they call themselves something else now. I worked on an ACT team which is a sort of community treatment where we go to people out in the field. We meet with them. They don’t come to our office. I was their first LADC that they had hired. I got to try and do some of this, they call it integrated dual diagnostic treatment IDDT, it was truly integrating the two. It was there that I saw my approach, the way I’ve always been my entire life was not only accepted but encouraged. I went, “Well how do we do this in the field of substance use treatment?” My business partner and I over many cups of coffee and lots of lofty dreams narrowed it down to let’s do this. He’s working for Health Care for the Homeless. He’s working with this very damaged population with great need and lengthy substance use, chronic.
AS: Like the Portland Hotel Society.
JH: Exactly like that. 
AS: His name’s Eric?
JH: Eric Bacon. Just the two of us starting having these conversations. He’s an AA guy. He’s an abstinence only but he’s in that little bridge where he says, “Okay maybe.” He’s supportive of the Minnesota Model and whatnot. I am too but I’m also flexible in there are multiple paths. There’s not one size fits all. 
AS: There are people who know that they can’t touch anything because touching the one thing, the one beer, leads them back to meth. Then there’s people who’re like “I can drink a beer every once and awhile. It’s not going to be a big deal.”
JH: I am one of those people. I was told, “Julie don’t tell people that.”
AS: When you would say that at work?
JH: Yes. “I had some champagne on Christmas Eve.” “Julie don’t tell people that. You cannot say that. Are you sure you’re okay?” I’m like what in the world? As I had said earlier, it wasn’t ever really problematic for me. The problem arose with other substances and the trauma and the betrayal and all those kinds of things that happened to me. I don’t drink. I don’t call myself a drinker. I can drink and not have to have ten. I can have a glass of champagne. I don’t run and go look for some heroin. Early on I was in AA and NA. I had a sponsor. I was doing the deal because that’s all I knew and that’s all I was told. I scratched the cornea of my left eye. I don’t know if you’ve ever done that but it’s so painful. It’s very, very painful. I went to the doctor and said, “I can’t have any pain medication because I’m an addict.” I had a couple of years at this time of sobriety. I’d been taught “Don’t do that. You were a heroin addict. If you take that opiate medication you’re going to run right off.” The doctors gave me a shot of Tordol which is just liquid ibuprofen. I’m thinking it’s a shot so it must be good. It didn’t do anything for the pain. It was horrifying. I actually considered going to get some heroin because I knew that would relieve the pain. What is happening here? This is not cool. My sponsor said, “Don’t do it.” If you do it, you’re going to have to change your clean date. I said, “I don’t give a shit.” 
I called the doctor and said, “This isn’t working. Please give me something to relieve this pain because I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want a bunch.” He gave me ten Vicodin. I didn’t take all ten at once. I didn’t crush them up and snort them or shoot them. I didn’t do any of that. I took them as prescribed, they relieved the pain. I had two left over a couple of days later. I didn’t even take them all. It didn’t reignite the dragon as I was told. My sponsor fired me because I refused. She said, “You have to go to home group and tell everybody you’ve relapsed.” I said, “I did not relapse.” 
AS: But it’s really common. It’s still the same today.
JH: This was years ago. Even then I went, “This is not right.” It didn’t happen. What you said was going to happen didn’t happen. I like to question things. I’m a person of faith but I’m also a person of science. If you can defend a position I’ll listen to you but if you’ve just got some knack and you can’t defend it, shut up. That’s what she had. That’s what she’d been told. When I questioned it she fired me because I refused to go and humble myself before the group and say, “I relapsed. I’m sorry.” 
AS: Did you go back to that group?
JH: No. I never went back to any. No. I sought support elsewhere. I understand support. I’m a communal liver. I’ll probably be her when I’m eighty. I’ll find a bunch of other eighty-year-old women; we can all live together. I can find support but that wasn’t support to me. That was adhering to a strict set of rules as it was in almost any treatment center I’ve ever worked in. Adhering to these strict set of rules. That just doesn’t work for me. It doesn’t. When Eric and I opened this place we talked at length about what the curriculum would be, how we were going to do it, and what role we could play in bridging the gap between coming to us for an assessment and finding an inpatient treatment bed. What we have found is that many people didn’t actually need that inpatient treatment bed. What they needed was the support that we have to offer, referrals for housing resources, but immediate engagement in some kind of program.
AS: The minute that they walk in.
JH: And I’ve seen so much success with that. This business is only two years old. Last year we had forty-three percent growth. It’ll be even more than that this year. 
AS: How many people can you serve?
JH: Sixteen at one time but if we have more than sixteen then we’ll split and we’ll just have two different groups. We can do thirty-two. 
AS: Have you stuck at sixteen right now?
JH: Yeah because we’re not ready to jump off yet because this house. We’re going to start our own housing which will not be strictly GRH. We will accept some GRH beds but we’re going to have beds available for people who have self-security disability. There are seven hundred and thirty-three a month. We’re not going to take six hundred of that. We’re going to take three hundred. We’ll take a percentage. You can have a safe supportive place to live. Minimal outside involvement. We’re going to go on a case by case basis. I don’t believe in kicking people out for continuing to use. I just don’t. 
AS: How will you screen?
JH: Case by case. 
AS: What are your thoughts about screening? How’s it going to be like an Oxford House versus a sober house?
JH: There still has to be, if we’re going to accept GRH funding then there has to be somebody that runs the house. 
AS: GRH is?
JH: Group Residential Housing. It’s funded through the county, through the chemical dependency treatment fund. 
AS: You will need someone on sight?
JH: For this first house. I have bigger plans. I want to head in the direction that the overriding theme of this whole conversation today has been about the supportive nature of communal living. As tough as that can be. It sounds to people, you just shake your head and go, “There’s no way it will work.” I beg to differ. I have seen it work. It’s still working. I can’t even tell you how many there are now. 
AS: Isn’t it fascinating how that if the idea is not present within your little realm and you haven’t actually seen it work how long you can convince yourself that therefore it must not be able to work? “We already have that here.” Or “That will never work. We tried an Oxford House in St. Paul.”
JH: I’ve heard those stories too. 
AS: Things are changing in the treatment world really fast. One thing I’ve heard and I’d like to know what you think about this that insurance companies are starting to look a little bit askance at how many times people are going into treatment, how much it costs and how high their rate of relapse is. They’re not happy. They’re losing a lot of money. They might start looking more favorably on programs like what you’re offering.
JH: Do you think? That’s kind of the goal although we didn’t come to that conclusion as a business model. It has revealed itself to us.
AS: It reminds me of what’s happened with midwife assistant births. I was one of the first wave, after the 60s, in the 90s to use a midwife. I didn’t have a doula that came a little later.
JH: I don’t even know the difference.
AS: A doula is someone who is just a labor support person. To have a midwife assisted birth or to have a birthing center costs four thousand dollars or three thousand dollars but to go have that same baby in the hospital a natural birth costs fifteen. The insurance companies were like, “Let’s do it.” It’s kind of reminding me of that system.
JH: Very similar. I think what will happen ultimately is it’s not like this was a novel idea that I just came up with and I’m that brilliant. This is just the experiences that I’ve had in my life have led me to see that this is a viable option. We have to operate within that little window of opportunity. The minute somebody calls. Right now if somebody were to call me and say, “Can I get a chemical health assessment?” I’ll say, “Can you be here? I’ll do it today. If I can, I’ll do it today. Or first thing tomorrow I’ll make room for you.” Because I know that there’s that much. For people that say, “I’ve got to have in-patient treatment.” I say, “The beds are three to four weeks out. I get that. Can we get you started here? So you can have access to services.” Sometimes those people end up not going to in-patient treatment because they’re receiving what they need immediately. It’s intensive. It’s four days a week. We have, this is the mental health room, we have two LICSWs. We do the mental health diagnostic assessments. They will do individual therapy with people and then they do group therapy every Tuesday. Then we have the specialist with the LIDCs on board and integrating the two. Our non-profit which is right down the hall. The guy that was just leaving today. He got out of group at noon and was down there for two hours. He got help doing whatever he was doing down there. Getting some stuff done. In house.
AS: I don’t want to take the rest of your time. I wanted to ask what is your assessment of what’s happening with the opioid epidemic. Is it going to get worse before it gets better? Can you talk about what your take is on that and what we’re doing and not doing?
JH: I have six years working in methadone. I’m very, very familiar with the rules and regulations surrounding methadone. I worked in methadone because I understand that population. Although I was never on methadone myself. I understand the population and I can support that modality. Not permanently but as a tool. I worked in methadone in six years. While I was working in methadone my boss one day said, “Hey can you go to this meeting? I can’t go and this might be something that you’d like to do.” The meeting was the Opioid Coalition. It was at Fairview Hospital. It was run by a woman named Mary Kay Bergstrum. This is probably five, six years ago. I said, “Okay. I’ll just be a representative for the company I was working for.” I went to that meeting and went, “These are my peeps. Yes. I like this.” Pharmacists, doctors, service providers, other methadone providers all focused on the opioid epidemic. 
I had been a volunteer with Minnesota AIDS project handing out syringes. I worked out of the ambulance and drove around and we passed out kits so people could have safe injecting materials. I would walk around the park and handout condoms and syringes to people. I’d already been doing some harm reduction things. Meeting a group of people who had similar ideas was like, “Yay. We can get some stuff done here.” Through that organization and through where I was working I met Lexi Reed Holtum. This is probably six years ago; it was shortly after Steve died. She was a warrior by herself. We were at a sheriff’s conference or something and she just had a little table and she was on fire. I was like, “I know her. I’ve been her.” I just bonded with her right away. She started attending the Opioid Coalition meetings. I put her in touch with my dear friend Sarah Gordon who works with…
AS: I know all these people.
JH: Sarah and I are dear friends. Sarah and I met years ago because I was working in methadone and I wanted to do syringe exchange through methadone which thank God I’m doing now. There was some political reasons because I was a malcontent. Hepatitis C and HIV instant testing at these sites where we have people, this population is highly prone to these diseases. Sarah Gordon and I have been friends through that process. Sarah was coming to the Opioid Coalition, no she wasn’t but Lexi had said, “We’ve got to try to introduce a bill and get this Steve’s Law.” It wasn’t called Steve’s Law at the time. The Good Samaritan 911. “You know how to craft legislation?” I said, “I don’t know how.” But Sarah said, “I do.” I said, “Well Sarah you and Lexi got to meet.” Me and Sarah and Lexi all got together and then this spark turned into a flame turned into meeting Senator Chris Eaton and hearing her story and meeting Star Selleck. 
AS: You know her too?
JH: I know these people.
AS: We know all these same people. I can’t believe that you sat down right next to me.
JH: There are other places I could have sat. It’s very serendipitous. I know all these people. 
AS: I’ve interviewed, I’m going to or I have. Do you know Sue Purchase?
JH: Who doesn’t know Sue? 
AS: I didn’t know Sue. I talked to her for an hour today. 
JH: She’s in Colorado.
AS: I’m going to go there and interview her.
JH: She’s phenomenal because she has twenty years of this thing behind her. She started syringe exchange in Minneapolis. 
AS: Women with a Point. 
JH: Sue is phenomenal. Mention my name.
AS: I will. 
JH: We’re dear friends. She would carry syringes out of the back of her Subaru and I’d meet her at the park and we’d pass out syringes in Loring Park. All of these very powerful women all ended up kind of at the same place at the same time. Steve’s Law was created in those conversations. I became part of the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation. I went to Congress to testify. I sat in the bleachers waiting to be called on because I have a historical, I was saved by Narcan. I was happy to share that.
AS: I was at some of those.
JH: It was pretty phenomenal. 
AS: It was really powerful.
JH: Mishan Jenkins, I’ve sure you’ve met Mishan. 
AS: She’s who I walked around with to talk to the Senators. 
JH: We were called the Narcan Girls walking around the halls of the Senate Office Building. Going Senator to Senator saying, “Will you support this bill?” It didn’t pass the first year. We had to make some adjustments. 
AS: It must have been the second year that I was involved. 
JH: It didn’t pass the first year because Sheriff Richard Staneck, although he’s a supporter, was not supportive of the letting the drug addict go free. Have you ever met him? He’s fricken huge. He’s like six foot seven. I was in an elevator with him and I’m like trauma. “Oh my God I’m going to jail.”
AS: You were having your PTSD?
JH: A little bit. I have some stories there. He’s a friend to the cause but he challenged quite a few of the points. The first year it did not pass. Then we got the bipartisan support with Dan Schoen. The powerful stories of the women, it broke my heart to hear these testimonies before Congress. You’re a parent. 
AS: You can’t deny a mother’s grief when it comes to this. It stops you a little bit in your tracks. 
JH: Hearing the stories. Star Selleck, we call each other twinsies because oftentimes in pictures we look like each other. Somebody will respond to a picture she’s posted going, “Julie you look great.” Star will go, “That’s me.” The same thing happens with me. We’re doppelgangers, not in person. She’s a lot larger on the bottom than I am but our pictures. It’s funny. When Star and I first met, we met at public television did a thing on the opioid crisis. 
AS: I’ve seen that. 
JH: We were in the audience for that one. We sat next to each other and just bonded immediately. She’s a nurse and she told me the story of as a nurse she knew what her son needed when he died on her kitchen floor. The powerlessness she felt as a nurse she knew exactly what he needed and didn’t have it. Powerful stories like that helped create the Steve’s Law as we know it today. I have two Narcan kits here. I do the trainings. Back when Dr. Satterlee was the open prescriber. It’s somebody new now. It was Dr. Satterlee initially. That was the other thing, when Lexi was looking for somebody to have an open prescription I got Dr. Solum who was a prescribing physician at Valhalla Place Methadone Clinic, said he would sign on. 
AS: What clinic did you work at?
JH: I worked at STS to begin with and then I worked at Valhalla Place. I got fired from Valhalla Place. It’s the only job I’ve ever been fired from in my entire life. That’s okay. It messed me up quite a bit but I still stand behind, I have a point here and I’m not going to remain silent.
AS: Was it about all the drug testing?
JH: Yep. I’ll just briefly tell you a quick story. I had a client, I’d been in methadone for a long time and I’d had clients follow me from STS to Valhalla Place. I’d been working with them for years. This is profound because it doesn’t happen in this field. I had this phenomenal relationship and I understand this client very, very well. This client is traumatized and has significant trauma behind bodily fluids and things that have happened in bathrooms. I know this. Every time a UA would come up she would just go into crisis mode. The law states, the FR42 says you have to have at least eight a year. The methadone clinic, the state says once a month. The Feds trump, pardon the expression, that law. She only has to have eight a year. I would let her go and not have to UA because it would re-traumatize her every single time. The thought was…
AS: How long had she been on methadone?
JH: Years. She was being re-traumatized over and over. I think partly why she clung to me was not because I was saying, “You don’t have to UA today.” But because I was saying, “I’m not going to traumatize you again.” She would come in and say, “I’m using but I’m not going to UA. I can’t do that.” 
AS: She was willing to admit to using to go ahead and get in trouble but didn’t want to do the UA. 
JH: Because of the punitive nature. There was another kid…
AS: She’s not being dishonest. 
JH: No. There was another kid who had something similar, a young guy, who had some horrible events happen to him. Having to provide a urine drug screen that was witnessed, that was his thing. He couldn’t have anybody come in that room with him if he had to pee in a cup because of things that had happened to him. He would literally roll up in a ball and cry. The belief was that he was hiding something and he wanted to go in there by himself so that he could bring in adulteration urine. What little you know of me today, I couldn’t sit by. I didn’t get into this field to do that. I’m not going to do that. 
AS: Especially given what we know about trauma, sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress disorders. Why can’t we integrate that?
JH: That’s a whole other story. I understand that when people are using other substances adding methadone on top can be dangerous and deadly. I get that. I truly do. There has to be another way. 
AS: There has to be some exceptions to the rule.
JH: I made those exceptions.
AS: And then you got fired?
JH: Yeah. Not just for that but that was over a long period of time. Write ups for those kinds of things. I wear it like a badge of honor today. At the time it was…
AS: I’m sure it just killed you at the time.
JH: Yeah. It devastated me. I am the one true thing that’s working here with this movement and I’m being deemed a malcontent. What the hell is happening here?
AS: Often people that are forward thinking, we get in trouble. We push the boundary. 
JH: It’s been most of my life. As funky as that was when it happened it laid the groundwork for this to become the reality because in essence I can’t be the square peg in the round hole. I’ve got to make my own way and follow it through because there’s a part of me that says this is real and true and this is good, let’s move towards this. This is the beginning of that bridge, bridging the gap in treatment, having treatment available today right now. Outpatient chairs are available all the time. They’re always available. The worry is they’re fine when they’re here for three hours and then they have to leave. What are we doing?
AS: How do you keep them?
JH: We have a case management services organization who says, “Come in. What do we need?”
AS: After group, how can I help you?
JH: He was here for two hours after group getting help. That to me is the essence of why we do what we do because we bridge that gap. Although I can go into the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and say, “These are barriers.” Change doesn’t happen overnight. I know that and we’re talking and it could be a decade before things really change. What are we doing in the meantime? I don’t know that it will work or not but can we try this? Can we try that? We know what doesn’t work and we keep doing it. That drives me crazy. To go back to your question about the opioid coalition and the opioid crisis. That’s been an ongoing thing. I’ve watched it happen. I’ve over the years lost, personally I’ve lost nine friends during my addiction which was devastating. I go to the vigil every year and I call out their names as a way of honoring. Then I hold hands with Chris Eaton and Mishan and we just love one another. My goal here is we have, I have people coming in all the time. I just had a kid last week, twenty-four-year-old, Caucasian, middle class, white kid. Started on some pain pills. Couldn’t get anymore, got cut off abruptly and found heroin. That’s kind of what killed Steve Rummler too. 
AS: It’s what kills a lot of them. 
JH: It does. It kills a lot. He came in last week and I said, “Here’s what I can do.” I gave him some options. These are my people; I know what options you have. “What do you want to do?” He said, “I want to get stabilized on methadone so at least I’m not sick. Then I want to do treatment.” I said, “Okay. Then what?” He’s living with mom, he’s not working, he has a girlfriend who’s living with her mom. They have a son who’s been taken by the state. This is not uncommon. 
AS: My expression is because I’ve heard all this before. 
JH: My challenge to him was maybe some longer term support. I said, “You can recycle through these.” “I need in-patient treatment.” “Why? What does that mean to you? What’s going to happen at in-patient treatment? You get out of mom’s house and eat different food for a month?”
AS: And not have to think about…
JH: And not have to do anything. Not take action, not think about it. 
AS: Which actually could slow down your progress when you get out. 
JH: My challenge to him was, and he’s doing it right now, he’s at a methadone program. I know if he’s not stabile then he’s not going to be able to participate here. He’ll be off and running. I stay in touch. I’ve called him twice already to stay in touch with him. Once he feels stable, meaning he can make it twenty-four hours without being sick or close to it, to come here. Then from here we’re going to help him find a place to live, find some employment, help him find some purpose and meaning to his life to empower him to get up off mom’s couch. She’s doing his laundry for him, cooking his meals for him. Yelling at him because he keeps using. I can’t fix her. I got him sitting here. I’m going to help empower him to do exactly what I did. 
AS: And what a twenty-four-year-old man should be doing.
JH: Yep. What’s happening?
AS: Parents are part of the problem right now.
JH: Right now for him in that case.
AS: In this era, in this generation of parents we are definitely part of the problem. 
JH: The enabling.
AS: When I was nineteen I couldn’t imagine having to live at my parents’ house for more than a month.
JH: I couldn’t wait to get out.
AS: I loved them, everything was fine but it was nothing anyone did. We didn’t do that. You were gone.
JH: You wanted independence. I wanted to see who I was. 
AS: They don’t even want their driver’s licenses now. 
JH: When my daughter turned eighteen she was still kind of lounging around. I said, “You’ve got until spring. You’ve got to figure it out.” Spring came and she was not making any progress. I said, “It’s spring. Guess what?” “I don’t have any place to go.” “Why don’t we get a job? Let’s do that. You have until this time to get a job. You better get off your butt and go look.” There was a lot of, people call it tough love, it’s not tough love at all. It’s just straight up love. I love you enough to say no to you. 
AS: To teach you how to be independent. 
JH: That’s what my goal has always been. I did well and then I did shitty and then I did well again. Let’s keep going with the well.
AS: How are your girls today?
JH: My youngest daughter is a buyer for Macy’s. 
AS: How old is she?
JH: She’s thirty-one. And the thirty-three-year-old has two children, both out of wedlock. One when she was fifteen, sixteen. She struggles with some alcohol and marijuana use. She’s coming around. I don’t enable. I will support but not in the way of “Here’s some cash honey.” I’ll bring some groceries over every now and again. I’ll put some gas in the car. I’ll always be there to love and support and guide. She’ll say, “Will you please take off your counselor hat for once?” I’ll say, “It’s permanently affixed to my head.”
AS: So you have grandkids. 
JH: I have grandkids, yes. The gift there is that they’ve never known me like that. My kids did but they’ve never known me like that. That’s a gift that it stopped. They say recovery is possible. We do recover. One last thing and I kind of brought it up to you….
AS: I’m so glad you just remembered because I almost forgot. 
JH: You know Gloria Englund? 
AS: Yes.
JH: Gloria and I were in the bathroom just before I came back and sat down with you. I saw her out in the hallway and went to the bathroom. You know, women we’ve got to go bond in the bathroom. She pees in one stall; I pee in the other. “How are you doing Gloria?” “Oh great Julie.” She got locked into that stall. She was going crawl out from underneath. I go, “Gloria stop. We’ll help you get out.” She was going to crawl underneath. “It reminds me of being stuck in the birth canal.” I was like, “Oh my God. Gloria you’re just so bizarre.” We started laughing about that and we somehow or another came up to doctors. I don’t know how it shifted from that. She had said something to me, “Are you still being treated poorly?” It reminded me. It keeps happening. All these years of sobriety or recovery or whatever it is you want to say. 
AS: Twenty.
JH: Twenty-one. I’m a taxpayer and a voter and a productive member of society. When I was fifty, I’ll be sixty this year but when I was fifty I went to have a colonoscopy. I don’t think I showed you but I have really significant scars on my arms. These are abscesses and tracks from injecting. These will never go away. You can tell they’re old. They’re not fresh. There’s nothing fresh about them.
AS: They’re white and they’re not…
JH: That’s arms. I have some on my breasts and on my legs. It’s what you do. I went in to go have a colonoscopy. I told the prep nurse, they want you to have the IV in this hand because you have to lay on this side. I said, “You won’t get a vein here.” “I’m a professional.” “No, trust me. You won’t get a vein there. You have to go here. This is how we’ve got to do it.” I’m explaining it to her. She goes to tell the doctor and it pisses him off. 
AS: That you need to turn the other direction?
JH: Yes, no. That I have to use this hand instead of this. Now my hand is hanging out over the edge of the bed where the guy who’s monitoring my, it’s fentanyl and versed that they give you to calm you down. 
AS: It is fentanyl?
JH: Yeah it’s fentanyl and versed which are pre-op drugs and anti-anxiety. He’s already mad at me and I can tell. I’m like, “Whatever. Shut up.” I feel kind of some of what he’s doing. I remember moaning a little. I like I felt that. He said, “If you think you’re getting some more fentanyl you’ve got another thing coming.” This is a true story. I’m laying there going, “What the hell? What is happening right now?” I’m compromised. Really?
AS: He thinks you’re drug seeking during your colonoscopy?
JH: Yes. I’m thinking, “Then you’re really much less educated than you come off. If I want drugs I don’t have to come here and have you do this. I’ll go buy some” Good Lord what is your problem? Really? I’m so mad at him.
AS: Didn’t you know that was the new thing to go get a colonoscopy?
JH: I’ve heard, I won’t mention him by name, but I did have a doctor who worked at the Valhalla Place who was prescribing methadone physician. He and I would chat quite often. He said, “You know, I just hate when those drug seekers come into the ED. I’ve been working in the ED for years. First thing I do is get them the hell out of there.” I would say, “Richard why not help them? Why would you just immediate disdain?” This is just a few years ago. It’s still very common. I wrote a letter of complaint. My daughter was there to drive me home, I was sedated. I was telling her. She was like, “Mom this has to stop.” Stuff like that happened a lot. I wrote a letter, nothing happened. I didn’t even get a response. Basically like, “Shut up you drug addict.” I’m well enough to where I can take that but I’m mad as hell. 
AS: It’s like the stigma of incarceration that you did your time but you still pay for it the rest of your life. 
JH: That’s a whole other story because that did happen to me too because I have felonies. That was a nightmare in and of itself. It’s just one thing after another. I went on a cruise with my brother. We were up on the deck on the last day. It was cloudy and I got sunburnt like really bad on my legs, so much so that they were swelling. I worry about a clot. I went to Regents.
AS: Why would you get a clot?
JH: When you have swelling like that and the skin swells then you can get a blood clot because the swelling constricts the veins. I’m worried about that. I know my veins quite well. I’m worried I’m going to have some kind of clot. I go to the emergency department, it’s bad. It’s a pretty significant burn. The guy comes in and he’s looking at my legs. I do have scars on my legs as well which are much more pronounced now that my legs are all swollen. He can see my arms and he says, “I’m going to go get my attending.” I went, “Oh God here we go again.” The attending comes in and looks at my burns and then looks at me and says, “I hope you know we’re not going to prescribe any pain medication.” I said, “I’m here for the burn. What I want is some cream to help my burns. I wonder why you would think that was my first reason?” I went and got a burn on purpose? What is your issue here? I’m just flabbergasted. I could name a dozen other times where something similar has happened.
AS: You’re a middle aged white woman.
JH: Well educated.
AS: They’re kind of going to this extreme.
JH: These aren’t fresh.
AS: They’re not pink.
JH: I can see sort of if they were fresh. I could. 
AS: And if you looked strung out.
JH: Then the reaction should be, “Honey what can we do to help you? Let me offer you some resources before you leave here today. What are you injecting? Is it heroin? Let me send you home with a Narcan kit. Do you know where you can go to get help?” That’s what they should be doing and they don’t. They still don’t with me. Not with that doctor but with another one I got a rash, a really bad rash, just external, no bumps just weird discoloring on both ankles. I thought “What the heck is this?” Three days later it was still there and maybe I should go have it looked at. She didn’t even look at the rash. She just looked at my arms and my legs and started scolding me. I wouldn’t even let her. I was so mad at this point. This is probably the tenth time it’s happened to me. Okay lady now we’re having it here. I stopped her and I said, “I have eighteen, nineteen years free from addiction. How many years do I have to have before you stop treating me like this? Twenty-five? Thirty? Do I have to be dead?” I remember saying that. “Before you stop treating me like this.” She was mad. How dare I question her? She went even so much as to humiliate me. The rash is here on both ankles but I’m in a gown. She comes over and lifts, I’m totally naked, she lifts up the gown. She asks me first, “Do you have it anywhere else?” I said, “No it’s just here on my ankles.” She comes and lifts the gown in a humiliating fashion until I pull it back down. “What are you doing?” I was so mad. How many years do I have to have? My goal is here, I’m a huge advocate for change and faces and voices and recovery, I’m on board. I do with the groups, I’m the one who comes in to do the advocacy training. You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. You have the right to be thought of as capable of changing. Those kinds of things. I have a room full of people who don’t know that, who’s doctors talk to them the way they talk to me. Only their fresh and still immersed in the…
AS: In the shame.
JH: They can’t fight back. I refuse to let their voices not be heard. That’s my big goal, a very lofty one. It’s hard to change. 
AS: Little by little the acorn said.
JH: I want to be heard in that respect. One of the things that both my parents, my dad is eighty-six and my mom is eighty-three. The two of them will look at each other and go, “What? Who is this?” That kind of thing, having become who they always knew I could be.
AS: They say that to you.
JH: Yeah. The person that they always knew I could be. The people who in my opinion have the right to judge or question me are the people who support me the most. They don’t judge or question. They say, “Oh my God. You have emerged. We always knew you were there.” What I’d like to see happen. Other people’s families may not have that same insight or support. Many people’s families are not. I want to help be the advocate and the supporter, this is a safe place to be. This is a safe place where you can come in and say, “Bobby showed up last night with a rock and we smoked it.” “Okay, let’s talk about that.” Instead of saying, “You’re out. Get out. Come back when you’re ready. You’re not done yet.” That’s what I heard. 
AS: I’ve heard that. My daughter’s heard that. 
JH: What is done? Dead? People say, “You have to hit rock bottom.” Rock bottom, I kept digging a deeper hole. There was no rock bottom, only death. That is a ridiculous way to look at what is happening here. The way to look at it is with love and compassion.
AS: The old tools aren’t going to work with the opioid epidemic. 
JH: Not at all.
AS: They’re not working because people are dying.
JH: The really cool thing that has happened in the last decade and the most significant because I remember when it happened. When Hazelden said, “While maybe we should look at some Suboxone because our recovery rate for people…” They had so many people die. Steve Rummler was one of them. You know that right? He went to Hazelden, they got him off every medication he was on. Told him he couldn’t be on any medications. That was the problem. Sent him home with no medications and an opioid addiction. He tried and couldn’t. The easiest thing for him to find was heroin. He bought heroin for the first time, did it, and died the same day. I’m not blaming Hazelden, I’m not. Please don’t hear that. That model.
AS: I agree with you one hundred percent. 
JH: It’s dangerous, especially with opiates. Although we can and do recover, it took a long time for my brain to heal. It took a long time and it was really only through diligence and perseverance and going to do things outside of myself for other people that helped me stop obsessing on that warm...They just out of the blue in the last ten years, Dr. Mars Sepala bless his heart, he dipped a toe in the water. How did he put it? They were going to do research. “Let’s at least research because our addressing the opiate dependence problem is maybe not as…
AS: It’s kind of an emergency.
JH: You think?
AS: Thank you.

Amy Sullivan    -AS
CJ: I'm not an addiction specialist but you can't be involved in this problem as much as I have without learning something about it. The typical model of putting someone in someplace for however long and you take away their job.
AS: Thirty days, sixty days.
CJ: Yes, they feel better. Then, ""Well that works then. Look they're feeling better."" It's sort of like, I liken it to someone who treats compulsive hoarding by just cleaning out their house and saying, ""Oh look isn't it nice to have a pretty house now."" Without dealing with the underlying compulsion. Why with that pretty house did this person feel like keeping every newspaper? Why did they attach emotional significance to having every ﻿City Pages ﻿even with coffee and other stains on it? 
AS: We're just going to clean you up and get the drugs out of your system.
CJ: Without dealing with the underlying, what sort of mental anguish were they escaping from. That also explains why certain people are unique. You look at their history and say, ""That was going to happen."" Severe physical or sexual abuse. A person with that little self-worth, every minute is an anguish. That person is looking to escape that constantly. Some people do get better with intensive therapy. They get into a new situation where they can find an answer and they don't feel that. Sometimes you can't. Sometimes that person tragically—let's say they were eight years old when all this happened or just high school, these experiences where you're trying to develop a sense of worth and trust in the world and you permanently destroyed it. A person like that, a high percentage much higher than the average population, that person is a higher risk for developing chemical dependency. The stress, the anguish they're escaping is just them every day. 
I think the traditional treatment community doesn't get it. I think they do what's typical, what they can build for. When it doesn't work they come back and build some more. It's in their interest to have people relapse because that just fills their beds again. I'd like to say that medicine would have higher ideals but my experience has been not really.
AS: That medicine would?
CJ: That medicine looks out for what's their long term health. 
AS: You would hope that that would be the case.
CJ: My experience has been I've found that that has been compromised. Have you seen my talks?
AS: I saw you at the Saving Lives.
CJ: When was that?
AS: In September. That's when I met you and a lot of people came up to you at the Convention Center in September, Downtown Minneapolis. It was put on by Hazelden and the DEA.
CJ: I just did a panel, was I just sitting up there with a bunch of people or did I have a whole hour?
AS: I honestly don't remember but I remember being impressed with what you said. Why don't you just say some of those things but if you've already got the text or video of things that you would want to share with me you don't have to repeat them right now. 
CJ: They recorded it. If they send me a recording I can forward a link to you. I sent you my articles right?
AS: No.
CJ: Really?
AS: No.
CJ: You saw my CNN article right?
AS: No. 
CJ: I'm sorry. 
AS: It's fine Chris. We're just meeting each other. It doesn't matter right now. 
CJ: People request me to talk, I'm like here's some of my stuff.
AS: We didn't. This was just going to be an interview. I'm going to pause this for a second. People say their best things in the first couple of minutes. 
[pause recording]
CJ: If you're not familiar with some of my opinions on this my guess is you just saw me as a panelist.
AS: I saw you apologize on behalf of all doctors. You talked about quite a lot. 
CJ: Did you see slides?
AS: I don't think so.
CJ: I don't think you did. I think you got me as a panelist. If there's no slides and it was the convention center, are you sure it was the convention center?
AS: Yeah. 
CJ: Then I did not speak with my slides. It was put on by the law enforcement. I was one of a group of seven.
AS: Law enforcement and Hazelden.
CJ: There were seven people up there.
AS: You were one of them.
CJ: I got a ten-minute spiel. 
AS: I can tell you why I'm interested in this and how this all came about. Oral history is my area. I looked at the 1970s, a tragedy at a Girl Scout camp in the 1970s where three girls were murdered and had been sexually assaulted, three little girls. I went back and interviewed survivors because I was at that camp that night as a survivor myself and grew up with no knowledge with what PTSD was or anything like that. When I did finally learn that and work through all those things as a women's history student I had an epiphany one night that this was what I needed to write my master's and my dissertation about. I went and I found women who were now, some of them, were willing to talk. I learned a lot about trauma and how things change. 
Of course historians look at how things change over time. I saw a parallel to what's happening with heroin and opioids with a shift in thinking about it and a little bit of a decrease in stigma in some respects and a demographic shift from who were the main users and how are they being treated differently from previous users. I wanted to just document people who are active in this world right now for an oral history collection of interviews. Then I was approached by an editor at the University of Minnesota Press who asked if I was interested in talking to him because he saw I was doing this project. We started talking and he said, ""Well why don't you think about it as a book and let's talk about it."" That's kind of how this has come about with chapters that look at different sectors of what's happened since 1980. I'm not sure exactly what year I'm going to start with but up to the present. I'm interviewing doctors as well as treatment specialists. I'm very interested in looking at what places like Hazelden are doing with this. I have a historian's eye on it and understand the history of why the Minnesota Model came to be. I understand that but I think with the opioid epidemic and meth I'm not sure it's helping everybody in the way that it could be. 
CJ: You understand that the Cochran Club Organization looked at twelve-step recovery and found no evidence that it did anything. They did that in 2006. No evidence. Honestly it shouldn't surprise you. It's a religious based program.
AS: I'm very interested in your childhood, where you grew up.
CJ: I'll go off on that. Tell me how you want me to start.
AS: I want you to start by saying your name and that you give me permission to record this interview.
CJ: My name is Chris Johnson, I'm an emerging medicine physician working at urgent care with Allina Health. I give you permission to record this interview.
AS: Thank you. Now we can kind of start. What was your childhood like, where did you grow up? I'm also as a writer, not just as a historian, I'm more of a narrative driven person. I would really love to hear some basics about your childhood and how you got into medicine. 
CJ: My childhood, there was some significant family dysfunction in my childhood. My parents were and are, one of them is not alive anymore, they're both very bright. Both my parents went to Harvard. My mother was an economist, majored in Econ at Harvard and my father was English. That's where they met. 
AS: He was an English major?
CJ: He was an English major. He did not have a very functional career. He was a bit disorganized, very disorganized. He couldn't decide what he wanted to do after Harvard. He apparently got into Columbia Law but stopped Columbia Law after two years then got into the PhD program at Tufts University for English, never finished that either. Things started off looking well then lost interest. Ultimately ended up being an opera singer. He was a good singer, he was in the Harvard Glee Club, that was always one of his passions to sing. 
My mother, she didn't have the traditional female skill set. It was maybe reversed. She was math, she was about the mathematics. She will say she is a failed mathematician in the sense that she couldn't do math like the real Harvard math people. She could do pretty well. She went to the PhD program at MIT for Econ, the best Econ program in the country. After that got a job teaching at Stanford, Economics. I don't remember things much before California. My early memories of life are Palo Alto. My mother was there as a Stanford Econ professor. My father was singing in the San Francisco Opera. 
AS: How old were you by that point?
CJ: Do you even remember things at age four?
AS: Four is when you moved?
CJ: I think I moved when I was like three. I don't remember. My earliest school memories are in Palo Alto, California. I remember saying goodbye to my dad every day, he had rehearsal which I guess was in the evenings or something like that. I'd see him the next day. I realized later the marriage was kind of breaking up at that point. Part of the going away in the evening wasn't just for rehearsal. In any case, that family life that at least my brother and I. I have one younger brother, he's one year younger than me. The last time we were together as a family would have been 1979 in California in Palo Alto. 
My mother did not get granted tenure at Stanford which is not all that unusual as an Associate. You go there to begin and then you go off and hopefully you become famous and publish. Then if you can come back when you're famous. She did not get tenure and she was snatched up by the Federal Reserve in Washington D.C. to be an economist there. That's when my family moved to Washington D.C. My mother, my brother, and I moved to northern Virginia right outside of Washington D.C. A town called Falls Church, Virginia. At that point it was single mom. My mother worked as an economist for the Fed. We lived in a small single family home. My brother and I went to regular old public school in Fairfax County Public Schools. Eventually it became clear, the story initially was my father was going to rejoin the family, he was going to get more and more important opera parts and then maybe try out for The Met in New York. There's lots of banks in New York. She could be an economist at a bank in New York. That was the vision. It turned out later it wasn't going to happen. I won't go into that, that's not for the book. In any case, I grew up with my younger brother in Falls Church. 
AS: How old were you when you moved?
CJ: Nine and he was eight.
AS: You were born in 1970?
CJ: I was born in '70. From that point on it was just going to finish elementary then junior then high school. Then I went to college at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Neither my brother nor myself were as smart as they were. I applied to Yale, I went to public school. It worked out. Now I'm actually very proud that I haven't gone to a single private school in my education ever. Public school the whole way. People will say, ""Oh yeah. UVA, so tough. The mean streets of Charlottesville, Virginia with Monticello and Jefferson. It's a tough environment. Dodging bullets on your way to art history class."" At UVA I was actually a government major. It wasn't medicine. I sort of had this kind of a social justice part of me that was always kind of there. I thought maybe policy or law was a way to manage big problems. I'll admit I wasn't a great student. I wasn't the best student. I did things that didn't make a lot of sense. I was government/foreign affairs; it was more foreign affairs. Wouldn't it be great if people could just get along on a national level? I concentrated on the Soviet Union. I was so stupid; I didn't take Russian. What do you plan on doing with your great theories about improving relations if the nation you're studying and their government structure, which was the Soviet Union with a central committee, but I didn't speak any Russian. While I was there then the whole thing fell apart. That's when the revolution happened again and the Communist Party went away. Now technically it's back in a different form. The same sort of centrist is back. I won't say that I had a great deal of direction in how I proceeded with my academic career at UVA. 
When I graduated I considered with a degree in government you choose academics or you choose law. I paralegalled for a little while. I mean like a year. In the Washington D.C. area. That was a pretty serious recession at that time. That was when Clinton got elected. Jobs were tough to come by. It was not a very happy time of my life. You graduate college in 1992, I think I just got out of a break up. It was bad. On top of all that there's no jobs. Especially for young, undergraduate degree in D.C. Paralegal work was all I could get not even full-time paralegal work but temp paralegal work. It was enough for me to learn about the law. I realized very quickly even though I was not doing law type work, I learned about the process of law. Some jobs I got to interact with lawyers quite a bit and learned about what was it that made them interested. You realize that it's just the process of filing this and being sort of a champion, usually it's one company suing another company. Your contract said this, you owe us this. It's the company defending themselves against the Department of Justice. You violated this anti-trust whatever. If you didn't really enjoy the process of it and that sort of confrontational, it wasn't for you. It wasn't for me. 
The whole idea of fixing big problems on a national scale, a bit naive. I thought well maybe if I can't do national level problem solving maybe I can do it on individual levels. I did like science. If I was a physician, I could fix problems on a patient by patient level. I'd only taken some introductory science at UVA, I didn't do well. I was a goof off. I was one of my high school valedictorians, I was at the very top with the 4.0 plus something. I used that as a reason to goof off for first semester in college. I had the 2.2 GPA to prove it. It was that time I took Chemistry and it was impenetrable to me. When you only study one day a week lots of things were going to be impenetrable. The poly exclusion principle of up and down arrows for the electron orbitals. I thought, ""Who can understand these orbitals and quantum theory and stuff."" Then you realize later on when you took it again, one goes up one goes down. You just count. You don't have to figure it out. They figured it out you just have to do your little exercise. In any case, the idea came to me that maybe that science wouldn't be as bad if I actually studied. 
I went back to school. I did part time work. I actually worked retail, I worked at Circuit City. Circuit City existed at that time. I worked at Circuit City as a sales associate. I took the science classes part time at a nearby university that was just a commuter. George Mason is not well known outside the D.C. area; George Mason University is in northern Virginia. It has a fairly large student body because a great many of George Mason students are commuters. They're getting more education while they live and work. I took the Chemistry, the Organic Chemistry, the Physics, some math, Biology. I did all that there. I did very well because when you sort of get this idea when you studied, ""Oh, it isn't that hard."" When you've got purpose. 
AS: You're doing it for something.
CJ: You're doing it for something. I treated it like a job. I had a leg up over the eighteen or nineteen year olds who were kind of goofing off like I was years earlier. 
AS: By this point you're twenty-four?
CJ: I'm twenty-two, twenty-three. It took a couple years to get it done. You can't take Organic Chemistry until you take Biology and regular Chemistry. That set you back. It took like two and a half years to get that done. I studied for the medical college admission test. I aced that. I found out I had aptitude for science so I did it. I applied to medical school and got in. 
AS: Where did you go?
CJ: I went to the Medical College of Virginia which is in Richmond, Virginia which is the home of Phillip Morris Tobacco and former capitol of the Confederacy. They really never got over that. They still haven't gotten over that. It's not Martin Luther King Jr. Day there it is Lee Jackson King Day. As in Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and the civil rights guy. Civil War, Civil War, Civil Rights. It's actually not called the Medical College of Virginia anymore; it's called the Virginia Commonwealth School of Medicine. There was always a relationship between those two but they just made it more explicit. What I'm saying is if you go looking for the Medical College of Virginia you're going to get redirected to VCU. I went to MCV from 1996 to 2000. 
After 2000, in that last year, I decided I wanted to do emergency medicine. Hennepin County Medical Center was at the top of my list of places to go. Hennepin County Medical Center was one of the top five, certainly top ten training programs for emergency medicine in the country. I was a good medical student. I wasn't top ten percent but I was top quarter. On the board exams I was top ten percent in the board exams. I knew my stuff. I was lucky enough to match at Hennepin. That's what brought me to Minneapolis and I haven't left. I did my emergency medicine residency in Hennepin County, graduated 2003. Then practiced full time emergency medicine at St. Louis Park Methodist Hospital. That's sort of the arc of how I got here.
AS: How did you get into this work around addiction or opioids?
CJ: How did I get into work with opioids?
AS: How did you get into that?
CJ: It began at Hennepin County in the sense that we saw a lot of chemical dependency there. 
AS: In the ER?
CJ: In the ER. They had sort of a program where you keep a look out for known people that are suspicious for this or that behavior. But you kind of blow it off a bit in the sense that it’s a county hospital with a county population. You’ve got lots of minorities. Not just minorities but people from terrible family backgrounds, absent fathers, prison fathers, single moms, mothers are gone, grandmothers are raising the kids. Lots of pathologic family structures that lead to dysfunctional behavior. 
I saw a lot of abuse of drugs like heroin. Also drugs like oxycodone, OxyContin, Vicodin, all that stuff. Coming and looking for pain pills. I was like, this is so absurd, “When I get out of here then I’ll get back to doing what I’m supposed to be doing.” Then I went to Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park. They’re the patients from St. Louis Park, from Minnetonka, and Edina. You realize, “Oh. Suburban people are looking for oxycodone, OxyContin, Vicodin, Dilauded. It isn’t just the inner city. It is the suburbs, it’s everywhere.”
AS: Was it pretty soon before you realized that?
CJ: It was within the first year. You couldn’t go a shift without seeing it. Someone who had a “chronic pain exacerbation.” They’d have a diagnosis of chronic pain. You’d look at their chart they’re on oxycodone plus OxyContin plus oxycodone for breakthrough. They would come and say they were helping a friend move and helping a friend move is apparently the most dangerous thing you can do because apparently the friend will drop the other end of the couch, you’ll pull your back out and now you’ve got a pain exacerbation. 
AS: They might have on their record chronic pain as a diagnosis?
CJ: Yes.
AS: Then they come in for pain exacerbation.
CJ: Right.
AS: Which means they’re just looking for more meds.
CJ: Something flared up their...something stronger, something to temporarily boost them up now. Something flared it. Chronic pain exacerbation became the bane of my existence. It was the bane of everyone’s existence. It got to the point where you couldn’t go a shift without it. Usually you’d see more than one. It was almost comical how often it was helping a friend move. You can see where if you’re trying to generate sympathy. They’re just being a good friend. “I was trying to help my friend. I didn’t want this. I would otherwise be stable and fine. I was just trying to be a good friend.” Granted you can’t disprove whether than actually happened or not. It was a story that could generate sympathy.
AS: The fact that it got passed around and repeated.
CJ: It was repeated so frequently by that population. It was suspicious. It was certainly suspicious. What happened is maybe a year, two years of this, you’d see the same patients back again with another exacerbation for something. This time maybe they were in a car accident, someone rear ended them, it wasn’t their fault then either. “I didn’t ask them to rear end me.” They don’t have an accident report. “No we didn’t call the cops.” Whatever incident was immune to disconfirmation. They were there for flare up. At that time the flare ups are treated, we were being told that pain is a disease, pain is the fifth vital sign, opiates aren’t really that addictive. They were getting multiple doses of Dilaudid in the emergency department. They would be there for about three or four hours. After about three doses you’d ask them, “Hey can you go home now?” Maybe you got an x-ray if they looked like something really serious might have happened. Usually you didn’t have to. They get two or three doses of Dilaudid. Either they’d say they could go home or they’d get admitted. They’d go home with another prescription or they get admitted, they’d stay for three days and then they’d go home with another prescription. Then they’d be back. 
You would see that this was, the patients weren’t getting better. They keep cycling through. It was frustrating for us as doctors because they’re often very demanding patients. They require a lot of nursing staff to keep going in there. You’ve got other people to see. You’ve got the heart failure patients, you’ve got the COPD patients, you’ve got the septic patients, you’ve got febrile seizures. You’ve got other things to do. The patients weren’t getting off their meds, they were staying on them and they were coming in with more flare ups. What clinical progress are we seeing with them? It was frustrating for the doctors. This is not interesting medicine. It’s making my job harder to deal with this other stuff. Invariably they can be very demanding patients that are difficult to get along with but you must be nice to them so they give you a good performance review. They became very stressful; you want to get customer satisfaction surveys to go very well. The hospital wants to make sure you make everyone happy and they pay their bill on time and pay their bill in full. It wasn’t good for the hospital in the sense that when these people get admitted they wouldn’t be compensated for the second or third day. They might be compensated for one day. The hospital’s losing money with these prolonged admissions of people who won’t leave but they won’t take the step of just kicking them out the door. No one’s benefiting. The patients aren’t getting better, the doctors are frustrated, the hospital is losing money. 
I decided, I think it was 2005, I’m going to do something about it. At that point I decided to contact the pain clinics in the area. I spoke to the Britton Center, I went to MAPS in Edina, I went to United Hospital and spoke to Dr. Hesse. I spoke to Dr. Belgrade. I spoke Dr. Matthew Monsein. I independently set up interviews with all these medical directors on my own and started talking to them. 
AS: On your own time?
CJ: Just on my own time and did it. I found out later it was weird. Most people don’t do that. What’s this thirty-five-year-old doctor doing investigating pain clinics and figuring out what the hell are we doing wrong? This doesn’t make any sense. 
AS: But they talked to you.
CJ: They talked to me. They were happy to talk to me. No other ER doctor, no one else asked them. I told them what we’re seeing here. They said, “You need to have some sort of a policy, some sort of universal way of approaching these patients.” That’s when I went to Methodist Hospital which was Park Nicollet, now it’s Health Partners. It was Park Nicollet at that time. I contacted risk management and said, “Hey look. Everyone’s seeing this problem. The hospitals are furious. It’s in everyone’s interest to get a committee together.” We put together this chronic pain committee at Park Nicollet. Then I spent the next four years from 2005 to 2009 meeting every few months. I was a pain in the ass to them. There’s no money to be made.
AS: You’re just asking them to come before work or after work.
CJ: Or in the middle of work to meet and talk about this and what should we do and put together this. It’s not making them money. It’s not going to make Park Nicollet money. 
AS: Who were the people who were on this committee?
CJ: Risk management was there; the director of the hospital service was often there.
AS: You pulled those people together from the hospital.
CJ: From the hospital, the clinic system.
AS: You were trying to work within the hospital setting that you were in to make a change.
CJ: To make a change, to have a universal policy that we could all abide by. The pain doctors said, “This is entirely appropriate.” I brought that to them. It took four years. A few months go by and nobody does anything and then you see another chronic pain patient. Then I fire off another angry email, “Oh hey. Just checking on how we’re doing. Just saw a patient. Could have used this policy.” After four years we eventually did come up with this policy about opiates and how we use them for chronic pain and how we would not do IV opiates for chronic pain exacerbations unless we found an objective new injury.
AS: That’s the Dilaudid that you’re speaking about?
CJ: The IV Dilaudid I was talking about. 
AS: You stay there.
CJ: If you have chronic back pain you came with a back pain flare. Usually we just did IV Dilaudid but we’re not doing that anymore unless there’s a new kidney stone, okay. You’re back flared up again, no. You’re going to get two tablets of whatever it is you normally take. Two Vicodin or two Percocet. That’s it. You’re not going to be admitted for pain medicine. If you feel you couldn’t go home safely, like “Oh I can’t walk.” You’ll be admitted. You’re still only going to get two more tablets, whatever your scheduled dose is. You’re not going to get hooked up to the IV, here you go. If you want to stay because you feel unsafe we’ll keep you because you’re unsafe. You’d be amazed at how few people wanted to stay in the hospital when that was the policy. They left. They got up in a huff and stormed out of the ER with amazing speed for someone with that critical amount of back pain they were in. That dramatically changed how the hospital functioned, having that policy. It didn’t change how difficult it was in the ER because the patients would still come in looking for this. It helped the hospitals because they wouldn’t be admitted. 
AS: You were still on the front lines dealing with people and having them be mad. 
CJ: The hospital would never put out signs in the waiting room saying, “This is how we treat chronic pain.” They never did that. They want you to register. Once they register you they generate a bill. Once they generate a bill they get money. They didn’t want to turn away any customers. They didn’t want anything that would dissuade them from registering. That’s not their reasoning. “We don’t want to miss anything.”
AS: Something else could be wrong. 
CJ: What happened is admissions for chronic pain went down to almost zero. These patients weren’t interested in coming in for what they could do at home. 
AS: Can you describe who these patients are? What’s their kind of demographic?
CJ: They’re middle aged, they’re in their forties. Thirties to fifties. Twenties is more like, it’s hard to have a chronic pain diagnosis at twenty. Late thirties to early fifties would be it. 
AS: Men, women?
CJ: More women than men even. 
AS: Middle class?
CJ: Middle class people. 
AS: Mostly white in St. Louis Park?
CJ: Yes. You’d still get minorities. It was never Hispanic. Hispanics hardly every have chronic pain. You have African Americans, but I don’t any more than just their normal percentage of the population. 
AS: I’ve read something about this, I can’t remember what it is.
CJ: African American doesn’t mean you don’t have the chronic pain and all that stuff. You’d see very few Asians, very few Hispanics with the chronic pain diagnosis. It was mostly Caucasians. That was the demographic. Once the pain policy went into effect the admissions went almost to zero. They would still come into the ER. We don’t want to dissuade anyone from registering. It didn’t make the ER jobs easier because you’d still have unpleasant conversations. “Why aren’t you doing this? You used to do that.” The truth is even after that I would see chart of my partners, even with this policy, they didn’t want the argument. They would just be here, IV some more to go.
AS: Say that again?
CJ: Even some of my partners in the ER.
AS: Would choose not to follow the policy?
CJ: Would just ignore the policy and would do what was easy.
AS: They didn’t want the conflict.
CJ: They don’t want the conflict; they want to make sure they still get a good performance review. 
AS: They don’t have to follow it. 
CJ: There’s no teeth behind it. There’s no punishment if you don’t. 
AS: It’s a recommendation.
CJ: If you wanted to show the patient you could show a little letter. There’s nothing forcing you to follow it. There was no punishment if you didn’t. There’s no enforcement, there’s no teeth. It was very much ignorable. I only came across this because patients would come in, I wouldn’t do that, and they’d say, “Hey the last time I was here a month ago I got this.” I go, “Really?” Then I would look it up. Sure enough. That’s exactly what happened. 
AS: Did you confront your colleagues about this?
CJ: That’s a tough thing to do. They’ll say, “This person was in tears. They gave a good mechanism, I thought something was really wrong.” What are you going to say to that?
AS: That’s you questioning their decision as a doctor.
CJ: You weren’t there. You’re jeopardizing a partnership and a friendship to bring that up. 
AS: That is intense. 
CJ: Hold on one second. [pause]. People are reluctant to approach their physician partners and say, “What the hell were you doing?” They also didn’t want to get a negative performance review. They don’t have any exceptions for that. That would still go in your file. There were still incentives to get it done. Make them happy, get them out.
AS: Is this about 2009?
CJ: Around 2009. Granted some partners were very good about that. They knew what would happen. It gets that conflict over easy but then you’ve incentivized them coming back. At least half, more than half did use the policy. There were certainly handfuls of those who would not do it.
AS: How many doctors are we talking about?
CJ: The department group that I was in was probably about twenty docs. To staff all the shifts, it was around twenty docs. Most of them were good about it. None of them went through the effort that I went through but they were all frustrated with how things were going. They were frustrated. They were good about it. They would be frustrated with their partners when they wouldn’t do the policy because they knew they could expect to see them back. 
AS: The repeat behavior ends up proving that the policy might be necessary, it might be a useful thing. 
CJ: It wasn’t enforced, there were no teeth behind it, it wasn’t universal. It didn’t stop anyone. All it takes is one or two, the patient’s like, “I might get it. Might as well go in and see.” For a patient who is dependent on these medicines. That’s the most important thing they’ve got to do that day. They have nothing they’re going to do. There’s this asymmetry. As a practicing physician you’ve got all these other patients. You’re responsible for them. This person’s going to try to take up all your time, is going to wear you down, is going to make things unpleasant, get the nursing in here to try to make it not worth your while to fight them anymore. That would happen a lot. It would also be especially compelling when they would bring their kids in. When they bring their children in the pain doctors that I met over at the clinics had a word for that. They were called props. When you bring the kids in it sends that added message. “You’re not only making me suffer but how am I going to take of my kid in this pain?” You’re harming them too. That’s extra pressure they bring. 
AS: You’re in a compassionate field.
CJ: Your default is to trust. Your default is to care for and relieve suffering. 
AS: Do you need to stop?
CJ: No. This person forgot that I was doing this. 2009 ongoing there was still that battle. We had support but it wasn’t great support. What I had hoped to see with that policy was the number of chronic pain patients go down to like zero. The word would get out. That policy became my department policy but became department policy for all of EMPA, which is the largest emergency medicine group in the Twin Cities. It’s not large, large but it’s like six hospitals. It became their policy. Then it became the policy for the American Emergency Physicians, Minnesota Chapter. This goes to show you that look, if you have a policy without enforcement who cares? Drunk driving is against the law but what happens? We tell you not to do it again. We penalize your license. You’d have to be caught drunk driving twenty times before anything happened. Who cares that it’s against the law? Behavior doesn’t change. The policy really never changed behavior that much. The only thing that policy did was it helped the hospitalists because these patients wouldn’t be admitted. Even with this policy the patients kept coming in. As you can see, deaths haven’t changed. The curve for opiate use and overdose and admissions, nothing changed really. 
AS: It wasn’t saving lives. 
CJ: It was doing some minor thing for hospital function but no real change was happening. 
AS: Was it your intention to save lives at that point? What that in your awareness?
CJ: I had thought there was a multi-pronged benefit to this. The chronic pain patients weren’t getting better so this would help them. The doctors were being extremely frustrated and burned out with all this so it’d help them. The hospitals were losing money so it would help them. I thought all would benefit. It turns out really only the admissions, that’s all that really happened from this. They were still coming in, the doctors were frustrated, the patients weren’t getting any better.
AS: They were just finding other ways to get their drugs. 
CJ: Right. After doing that, it was 2012 they were still having these meetings. “Is there something else we can do?” We’re having occasional talks about the chronic pain committee. But a lot of these chronic pain committees after these policies went into effect was how do we make sure patients are comfortable coming out of anesthesia? Making sure the chronic pain patients have enough pain medication after surgery so they’re comfortable. What are we talking about? Why are we not talking about we have to get this massive population off these medicines? We’re talking about making sure they’re safe and monitored after surgery. Basically, there was some safety regarding that but mostly it was make sure the customer’s happy. If you look in terms of how things are practiced. If you think the ultimate paradigm is make sure the customer’s satisfied with their experience. You will find that explains much of medical behavior. 
AS: The patient customer, together the two words.
CJ: The buzzword in the industry was the patient experience. You want the patient to have a good experience. You just take the term customer and replace it with patient. The customer experience. Just swap them out. There it is. The patient experience is the word in the industry for measuring how well you’re doing. It is not patient outcome. That is not the measure for how things are going. If you’re measuring patient outcome with pain meds and opiates we’re doing terribly. There’s more and more prescriptions coming out, more and more people becoming dependent, more people going into treatment. People are dying. If you’re measuring it by outcomes you’re doing awful and you’ve been doing awful for years. I talk about this in the articles, I’ll send them to you so you can review them. If you look at what governs how medicine is practiced in terms of what would make the most business sense you will find that is a streamlining paradigm to understanding how medicine behaves. 
AS: How’s that for you as a physician?
CJ: I feel that there’s been a great bait and switch. We have the Hippocratic oath, we got the little white jacket, the health of the patient is the paradigm of everything. No it ain’t. There’s no data saying even back surgeries are helping. Back surgeries however make half a million dollars for one procedure. It is cash money. Hospitals have spine centers. Look at what’s serviced out there. Is it mental health? No. Why do you think there’s heart and vascular centers everywhere? Stents pay money. There’s actually very little data that stents do anything. If you’re in immediate heart attack it helps. It helps a small like three percent of the population that has what is called Severe Left Mane Disease which is the main artery coming out of the heart. Unless you have Severe Left Mane Disease for your heart or if you’re in the middle of an acute infraction but if you just have chest pain from exertion relieved by rest that’s typical anginal pain. A stint isn’t going to do anything. It isn’t going to make you live any longer. The only thing it’s says is it might improve your pain for about two years and then there’s no difference. Vascular centers and stents make huge dough. You can throw a rock and hit them. You can’t find a mental health clinic. You won’t find these other services which are neglected because they don’t pay. 
AS: They’re nothing about technology.
CJ: As I’m doing all this chronic pain stuff I’m also observing this about how medicine is functioning and it increasingly looks like is the patient what they’re really thinking about or are they thinking about them? They’re thinking about them. The patient care is the means through which to maximize what’s benefitting them. It’s not like doing a stent doesn’t involve patients. It isn’t like their number one outcome is what they’re thinking about. 
AS: It’s for profit.
CJ: If it’s not for profit it’s for revenue. Some hospitals are not for profit.
AS: Of course they are technically.
CJ: They are. You’ve probably studied this. You just don’t have shareholders but you have business interest that you answer to and high salaries you try to pay. They know that very well. If you look and see what you see all over the place is what’s paid for which is cancer centers, imaging centers, heart and vascular centers, neuro centers, even eating disorders, those pay.
AS: Even the addiction treatment centers and the recovery centers.
CJ: Those pay and you can hire cheap labor.
AS: People will keep coming back.
CJ: They don’t get well permanently. I’ve seen the data especially with the opioids. I’ve seen it get worse and worse and worse. I thought there would be this human cry from the medical profession, we’ve got to put a stop to this. As you’ve seen it’s been very tepid. You’re not seeing people up in arms. “Oh it’s so sad but you don’t want to cut off the people who need their medicines. You don’t want to have them suffer.” 
AS: They’re starting to feel like bad people now.
CJ: It’s always these measured tones of “We’re not really doing that bad a job. You can’t make these people go through that.” If you look at from a standpoint of you want to keep your customer happy that makes sense. That has been spurring my research not into just pain but also into medicine as a business. I’ve done quite a bit of reading on that. I think the American system is fundamentally broken. If it really had the patient in mind the opioid epidemic would have been fixed a long time ago. But it doesn’t. It still isn’t.
AS: It’s rising. It’s not even falling yet.
CJ: What do you see in the news? You see we need more funding for treatment. It’s a very consoling answer because medicine creates the problem and sells more medicine to solve the problem. 
AS: By medicine do you mean medication assisted treatment?
CJ: Medicated assisted therapy which is better than leaving untreated but they’re not doing what I advocate when I do all my talks. Stop writing for these medicines in the first place. Cut down drastically exposure. Just like you have to smoke more than one cigarette to become addicted to tobacco, more exposure equals higher risk. You need to drastically reduce the amount of pain medicines that you are exposing the populations to.
AS: This is just something that physicians can do. More people are overdosing on prescription pain pills than heroin.
CJ: Four out of five people who abuse heroin now started on pills. You understand how it started with OxyContin right? You’ve done all the research knowing that the opioid and heroin epidemic was not an accident. This was engineering, this was engineered by deliberate pharmacy campaign in the mid to late 90s with the introduction of OxyContin to persuade the medical community that chronic pain is an undertreated epidemic characterized by needless suffering. Opioids are safe and the risk of addiction has been greatly exaggerated. What were these long acting opioids used for primarily beforehand? Hospice patients mostly.
AS: Hospice and surgery recovery in hospital.
CJ: Acute injury in hospital and hospice patients but not back pain. Back pain doesn’t suddenly cure. Back pain’s an ongoing thing. You don’t take oral heroin ongoing for back pain. That’s what happened. You can’t get rich on hospice patients. You can make billions if you suddenly for every arthritis patient and every back pain patient you get them on these medicines which those things don’t go away, bulging disk and what have you. It’s just the back version of arthritis. Those things are lifelong. It’s a perfect drug for pharmacy. They don’t want to do antibiotics which you take for two weeks and are done. They want you to invent a drug that you’re on for the rest of your life. Lipitor, number one drug of all time. There’s not great data that says Lipitor helps anyone in the average population. It’s multi billions. They pay physician leaders. Cardiologists or the pain specialist at the Beth Israel Hospitals and Harvard recruit and pay the physician leaders at some of the top departments. Have them sort of fudge the data or find ways to manipulate the data. Spread the message down to the rest of us. We don’t have time to go back and reduplicate all these studies. We have to function with a level of trust like we do in all society. We trust that they’re giving us good information. Porter and Jick. 
AS: It wasn’t even a study. 
CJ: It wasn’t a study it was a paragraph.
AS: It was a paragraph in a letter to the editor.
CJ: It was a five sentence paragraph. It was an observation. Observations are useful in that they often can lead to studies. 
AS: That was a level of trust, coming back to the idea of trusting you colleagues with what their research is. You reach a level of professionalism and you want to respect their opinion. Of course you’re not going to go back and recheck everything.
CJ: Are you going to do every study about every condition? 
AS: You can’t. You can’t be a sceptic because you don’t have time. You’re taking care of people in pain. 
CJ: You have to trust that there is a code of ethics and rigorous scientific skepticism and that the population you’re intending to use these medicines for, chronic pain patients, you’ve tested it on that population. With Porter and Jick they tested on hospitalized patients briefly.
AS: And said who was addicted? Who got addicted? One lady.
CJ: You got morphine after a fracture and you were likely to be okay. We knew that. It’s suspicious. That letter to the editor was 1980. Suddenly sixteen years later? Now it’s evidence that opiates aren’t addictive?
AS: For Purdue Pharma. 
CJ: That could only change the medical culture if they could coopt and manipulate physicians and they did that, paid them well. I’m very critical of my own profession that we are as vulnerable as we are to having our mission compromised by money. I can reach no other conclusion based on what I’ve studied and learned. That’s what happened. The culture was changed. Pain became the fifth vital sign. The risks of opiates were exaggerated. The prescriptions if you’ve seen the numbers went from like eighty million in 1992 to over two hundred and fifty million now. You can just watch in lock step as the number of prescriptions went up. 
AS: So did the deaths.
CJ: So did the deaths, so did treatment admissions. Which tells you another thing. I say this in my lectures. Traditionally addiction is a moral issue. Here’s where I strongly disagree with the recovery community that uses terms like character defect and moral inventory. What an extraordinary thing that as marketing and sales changed and sales increased. At the same time, you had a dramatic increase in the number of immoral people in this country. 
AS: Which huge character flaws.
CJ: With huge character flaws. Who knew? What a coincidence. Right when you started throwing all these prescriptions and here’s five tablets, here’s thirty.
AS: And now we blame parents, parents blame themselves. It’s a perfect storm. You can blame poverty. There’s all these things that you can blame without having to look at what actually happened.
CJ: Everyone should recognize too; the reasons these medicines do anything is your brain has a receptor for it. Your body makes morphine. That’s what endorphins are. Endorphin is just a contraction of the two words endogenous, meaning made from within, morphine. Endorphines or endorphins. Your brain makes these chemicals. In physiological doses, not pharmacologic doses. Your brain doesn’t want you to be that happy all the time. 
AS: You’ve got stuff to do.
CJ: Giggling like an idiot all the time isn’t good for survival. You need to be worried about is it too damn cold? Do we have enough water? Am I going to get eaten? The state of the brain that helps survival is what evolution selected for. It’s not giggling like an idiot all the time or that’s where we’d be.
AS: Or blissed out. 
CJ: If you’re blissed out you’re not worried enough. That’s not good for survival.
AS: You’re bait.
CJ: The brain doesn’t actually want you to be that happy all the time. It wants you to be happy in selective situations and rewards them. It doesn’t want you to be happy all the time. What these chemicals do, you realize “I can be happy all the time. This is awesome. I’m happy all the time.” The brain pushes back. The brain realizes, the brain wants homeostasis. That’s a term in medicine that means the brain wants stability. It doesn’t want to be there. The brain pushes back. The brain stops reacting so well. You take that medicine the next time, “That was nice but it wasn’t really quite as nice as the time before.” The reasons these medicines work is they cause an increase in dopamine in your brain’s reward center. That’s simplified but it’s a basic enough chemistry for most purposes. It causes the release of dopamine, you feel euphoric, you feel awesome, “Why I shouldn’t I feel like that all the time?” That’s what leads people to keep going. I can be happy all the time, who wouldn’t want that. 
The brain pushes back. Suddenly it doesn’t release so much dopamine. It down regulates its receptors. The morphine is there but there’s no receptor for it to bind to. That’s what happens when people use it for a while. When you start to alter the brain’s chemistry you alter its receptors, you alter its circuitry, you’re in real trouble. Now when you stop using the medicine all together the brain says, “Alright this is not good. This is not good. I don’t feel good.” Because the normal physiologic morphine, you’ve kind of switched it off. The brains notices, “Where the hell is my morphine?” Because you’ve stopped making it. Just as a body builder who takes testosterone their testicles shrink. The body says, “Why am I wasting all this metabolic energy making testosterone when I’m just getting it from the environment.” So the testicles shrink. Same thing happens in the brain. It realizes if it’s getting all this from the environment there’s no reason to make it myself. When patients who are using these medicines and take it for a long time have completely distorted their brain chemistry you can’t just stop it because once you just stop it they feel awful. Everyone would. I can put you, me, you put all of us on it for around the clock for two months you will not feel good if we suddenly say no. That is enough to change your brain chemistry. That’s the issue. It’s not even just an issue for chronic pain. Obviously chronic pain, guaranteed, since chronic pain never goes away you’re going to be on these medicines for at least three months. That’s plenty of time to change your chemistry. Now you’re on it for good. 
AS: Then your pain comes back and you feel bad.
CJ: It doesn’t feel like I’m addicted it just feels like my pain came back. I’ve got to get back on. Withdrawal is painful. People coming off heroin say they feel awful, they’re in pain everywhere. Being on these medicines for chronic pain almost guarantees they’re going to be on it for life. Three months is plenty of time. It even is concerning when they have an acute injury like a surgery or something like that. Even if you have a knee replacement or have this bad fracture. It’s not like the brain says, “Oh well I’m not going to adjust to these medicines because look you broke your bone.” No. It will still start to change over time. 
AS: Your brain will.
CJ: Your brain doesn’t care that your leg is broken, therefore I won’t respond to these medicines in a normal homeostatic reduced responsiveness over time way. Even if you do have a fracture don’t take these medicines for two months. Take it for two weeks and then realize it’s going to hurt while you heal. Then you go back to the customer service thing. 
AS: It’s been three months and I’m still hurting.
CJ: I didn’t pay for this. How expensive health care is makes it worse too because when you’re paying so much for healthcare, you expect “I should have zero suffering in this.” 
AS: But that’s a cultural construct about pain and money. If we have more money we’re paying a lot for something we should be getting something really good. It’s understandable in our cultural context. 
CJ: You’re a paying customer and medicine in general has encouraged this.
AS: Then the hospital calls you and refers to you as the customer. 
CJ: We sell you the idea that your health is a commodity to be bought and paid for. That we can provide you as the health care industry rather than something that is primarily and always has been your own. Health care can maybe be about fifteen percent of your health outcome. The other things are diet and your ability to keep active. If you don’t keep active your body ages and gets worse.
AS: Where we ever got the idea that we can’t be in pain, that we can’t have pain. 
CJ: And you should have a great night sleep every night and you should always have sex like you’re eighteen. These are all things that are kind of a denial that the human condition is to age and things don’t go so well. They’re meant not to go well on purpose. For evolution to work you can’t have infinitely long lived organisms. That’s how mutation and evolution changes over time and the genes happen. You have to have temporary organisms and beings and humans otherwise change won’t happen. Evolution builds in the temporariness which is insulting to us as conscious beings. I’m so awesome I should be here forever. I should be able to do what I want forever until I decide I’m done. That contributes to this issue. You hear things like life is too short to be in pain. I’m like, “Life is too short for me not to be ecstatically happy all the time and for there not to be wizards and magic like Harry Potter.” 
AS: Why don’t we have all that?
CJ: In a fourteen-billion-year old universe and I get like eighty, maybe if I’m hopeful. Yes. You get a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of an instant. Yes, you can justify. The truth is evolution and life don’t care. When you try to manipulate your brain and you try to manipulate your experience usually things don’t go well. 
AS: I’m going to pause for a second. I need to use the bathroom. 
[Pause]
AS: Okay. We’re back. 
CJ: When I speak about selling medical assisted therapy as consoling to medicine it’s because you still get to sell more medicine. More importantly you don’t cross pharma. In other words, prevention. Reducing the amount of prescriptions, reducing the market share for these medicines there is very serious opposition to them. 
AS: For reducing the opiate prescriptions?
CJ: Right. Instead of two hundred and fifty million prescriptions go back to like eighty million. Cut it by like two thirds. That’s a lot less many.
AS: The resistance is from pharma.
CJ: It would also be from the physicians who just write these medicines.
AS: When you say medication assisted treatment are you talking about things like methadone.
CJ: What I’m saying is methadone, Suboxone that’s why you hear politicians mostly talk about that. Access to treatment. They don’t talk about reducing prescriptions on the other sides. I’m saying that it’s a politically expedient answer, to increase funding for medical assisted therapy which does say lives. 
AS: We’re going to open more methadone clinics. 
CJ: We’re going to address the opioid epidemic by increasing access to treatment. 
AS: But we’re not going to restrict…
CJ: We’re not going to turn down the faucet.
AS: I absolutely agree. 
CJ: And reduce exposure of the population. 
AS: It’s a total ruse.
CJ: Which is my focus. 
AS: Your work is on reducing the opioids.
CJ: There’s no reason to put people on these medicines. It’s oral heroin. There’s nothing wrong with heroin. You understand heroin is used in the United Kingdom every day in hospitals. It’s called Diamorph for diacetylmorphine. Perfectly fine. You have a kidney stone you’re going to get two milliliters of Diamorph and you’re going say to the heroin, “Thank you.” But then they’re going to stop. Don’t take it again. You use heroin for acute injuries. Dilaudid, we use that all the time, Dilaudid is actually stronger. 
AS: Fentanyl.
CJ: Fentanyl is even stronger. This is what infuriates me. When patients that are on these medicines find that they're not working and need more and are looking to get more. That's called aberrant behavior. They're violating their contracts. Having these medicines over time do less and less is exactly predicted by homeostasis and what the brain physiology is supposed to do. It isn't the patient breaking the promise. It's the body doing what's it's designed to do which is respond less and less as the environment changes. It wants to keep a constant environment. They look at that like you've violated your contract. You've committed a crime. Pain contracts have been around for a long time and haven't done a damn thing.
AS: What has?
CJ: These pain contracts. These agreements haven't done a damn thing. In my view they're a way for physicians to cover themselves. It also always them to not think about it. 
AS: Think about what they're doing.
CJ: They don't have to think about what they're doing so the patient actually just does their contract. They just go, ""Here you go."" They don't have to think about it. The contract has taken over the management of the patient. The document now runs things. That is negligent. 
AS: We're getting into Foucault territory. 
CJ: It is negligent in my opinion. You're now letting this document run the care. If they fulfill their little obligations, you give them another ninety-day supply of oral heroin. ""Well this contract says their okay. I'm doing what the contract says now too."" All the while they're going to get worse and worse and worse. They're getting into higher risk situations with these contracts. Having a contract didn't prevent any people from becoming dependent. They just became dependent with a contract. 
AS: Where do you see this going? 
CJ: We didn't finish. Crossing pharma is a big deal. Pharma has among the most powerful lobbies.
AS: I understand what you're saying now. Crossing pharma. Like breaking down.
CJ: Like having major policy changes to dramatically reduce the number of pills that are flowing. They don't want that. 
AS: It's probably not going to happen is it unless it's legislated. 
CJ: Or the whole U.S. healthcare system blows up. Here's the thing. Other countries, Britain for example, they've got the same group of people. They're getting big like we are, they're getting over weight, they're getting arthritis, they've got back pain. They don't die like we die. They don't use these medicines for chronic pain like we do.
AS: Now Purdue, they're going globally.
CJ: They're going to see if they can. They don't have the same customer driven healthcare. They're going to have a harder sell if they know these medicines, they can see what happened in the United States. ""Let's change so we can develop the same problems that are in the United States now."" 
AS: That's comforting at least.
CJ: I hope. In the British and the National Healthcare Service in Britain they have more data driven stuff. They have the acronym is NICE which stands for National Institute of Clinical Excellence or something. Their job is basically to see overall is the science being followed. In some cases, the science isn't clear but they do the best they can to make it sort of data driven. They also have fewer surgeries. They have fewer stents placed. Can you believe it? They don't die any younger from heart disease than we do. Even though they have like half or fewer of the stentings than we do. They have more data driven. The prescribe opiates like we used to back in the 80s.
AS: They can watch what's happened.
CJ: That's how they're functioning right now. They don't have much incentive to change and develop this problem. Given how their systems function either with a single payer or with the National Health Service they don't have an incentive to cause these problems. The tax payer takes responsibility for the patient from the time they're born to the time they die. It's in the tax payers interest not to cause opiate use disorder and treatment admissions. No. That is not in their interests. They have different economic incentives. They can try to export it but the United States being as customer and business oriented as we are we are more vulnerable to that. Honestly I think the opioid crisis is kind of a litmus test. If the U.S. healthcare industry can cause this problem and permit it to exist and hurt this many people, and kill this many people in flagrant disregard of the science and the oath. Does it deserve to exist? 
AS: Does the system as it exists deserve to exist?
CJ: You could make a very strong case that if you can create and permit to persist the greatest public health issue that kills sixteen to nineteen thousand Americans per year then either one of two things. Either you blow the system up or actually tell the medical schools stop telling the kids to take the oath. That is not what their loyalty is. Get rid of that cognitive dissonance. 
AS: That's chilling. 
CJ: Get rid of it altogether. So you're not conflicted. You're in the business of healthcare. You're not here for the patient's best interest. You're here for the business of healthcare. Then at least you'd be consistent. 
AS: Who are you speaking to? Are you going around?
CJ: That's my take on the responses to the opioid epidemic so far. They've been easy. Improve access to treatment.
AS: They're kind of lazy.
CJ: They don't cost anyone anything. They won't jeopardize. Pharma contributes more money to political campaigns than any other industry. You're going to say no to that money. ""Who's running against you now? We've got a friend here. How would you like this much money?"" 
AS: What about the comprehensive, the CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Did you look at that very much? 
CJ: It was more focusing on the backend on treatment.
AS: It's a band aid.
CJ: I think there was one study I saw where the mortality of a person in medical assisted therapy per year is about one percent. If you're in medical assisted therapy, you're on Suboxone, you're on methadone or something, your risk of dying per year is one in one hundred. Now it's like five times higher if you're not in treatment. One percent is three times higher than if you never developed the problem at all. It depends on your age. If you're in the thirty-five to fifty your average mortality is like three per thousand percent. It's still three times more likely to die if you're on medical assisted therapy than if you never develop the problem. I'm saying let's never develop the problem. Your mortality if you're even younger like in your twenties is even lower. Granted you have car accidents and stuff like that but your mortality when you're younger in your twenties is even lower. Your five times more likely to survive if you never develop opioid abuse disorder. All of this tells you is what you already know which is prevention is better than treatment.
AS: Prevention is better than the cure which is what doctors have been saying for a long time.
CJ: It isn't so simple as diabetes and just saying, ""We'll just get you on insulin."" If you become a diabetic. You're sedentary, you get overweight, you develop insulin resistance, then you develop Type 2 diabetes. You get on regular insulin. I guess if you keep tight control of your sugar you can live a pretty long life. I don't think quite as long as you never develop. It's kind of seen like ""Oh that's too bad but we got this."" That's not true, medical assisted therapy should not be seen as just getting on insulin for diabetes in terms of your risk. 
AS: Your risk for?
CJ: Dying. The other thing is this. It's not like insulin or glucagon. By the time you get to medical assisted therapy for opioids. You've probably lost your marriage, you've lost your house, your kids won't see you, you've got legal action. That's not true when you're diabetic when your blood sugar keeps going up until eventually you're on pills and then maybe going to insulin. You haven't lost your life prior to that treatment. The person who gets to medical assisted therapy has probably lost a great deal. If you never develop the problem in the first place you can avoid that. That is my big talk. Prevention. Focus on patient outcomes not patient satisfaction. Don't do what's just business savvy actually obey your oath and do what might be unpopular with a patient temporarily with their long term interest and their outcome.
AS: Are you talking to doctors?
CJ: I do. I've spoken around the state. I speak in communities. I’ve spoken in Montevideo. I've spoken in St. Cloud. Most of my talks are local. I did testify in front of the FDA Advisory Committee. I did speak at the Fed Up rally in D.C. in September. I give my talk all over. I speak to disability adjustors, like insurance companies. Why are we doing this? Is there any reason why we're still doing this?
AS: Is there some way to get at this...?
CJ: Payers, I've spoken to Medica. Payers have some stake in the game.
AS: I wonder is there some way to get at this to put it on your policy brain which you said you chose not to do it. It seems like you actually are moving in that way. 
CJ: It came full circle back to my political science. 
AS: That's what I was thinking.
CJ: This sort of overarching sort of ways to benefit people. I couldn't have done that at age twenty-three.
AS: Of course not. We have to have our life.
CJ: Treating one patient at a time and doing my medical career for as long as I have and understanding how the problem happens. Now I can come back with authority and experience.
AS: And evidence.
CJ: And street credit. This is what needs to happen. I can tell them you're going to do this and this and this for a year. We're going to be here in five years because nothing is going to change. 
AS: Chris do you think it's possible to use the insurance companies to quit paying for these long term prescriptions? Is there some pressure in our own system the way it currently works or are they just as culpable as pharma and hospitals?
CJ: Insurance companies, you want to get stakeholders involved with an interest in having this problem not happen. Obviously patients and families have a stake in not having this, that's their lives. That's their homes they're going to lose, their jobs they're going to lose, their families they're going to lose. They have a stake in it. The medical industry doesn't have as much of a stake in it. Saving lives and saving people, honestly the more people get on medical assisted therapy, people who go into treatment that's business. People in chronic pain going to the pain clinic that's business. 
AS: The idea of reducing it isn't...
CJ: Health care is paid for with consumption of health care services rather than outcomes. There's always this incentive, there's always going to be a problem when you're looking to reduce consumption of healthcare. That is business that's not happening. I'm not saying it's a good situation.
AS: I'm just feeling sad and cynical.
CJ: Until like the president's daughter dies. 
AS: In a way those things don't even seem to matter. Deaths of icons.
CJ: Prince is dead.
AS: Prince and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. 
CJ: Heath Ledger.
AS: Heath Ledger.
CJ: I mention all of them in my talk by the way.
AS: Not to mention all the sons and daughters and parents of kids. 
CJ: I've been to these meetings where the doctors who are pain doctors who have been prescribing these opioids still say, ""It's terrible but you can't take away the meds. Some of these people really need them and if you take that away from them they'll probably commit suicide."" That's what they say. 
AS: It always circles back to the pain. 
CJ: Yes. Listen, it's oral heroin. It's all what it is. I show people the slide. This is what heroin looks like, here's what oxycodone looks like. It's basically the same. The ring structures. Their receptor is the same. There is no separate heroin receptor in the brain. 
AS: Your purpose for saying that is to kind of bring heroin, because of its negative connotations, into the discussions of recognizing...
CJ: If you say, ""Oh some people really need their opioids and they're in pain."" They need their heroin. You might as well just say they need their heroin.
AS: You could explode the stigma. 
CJ: Trying to destigmatize what heroin but you're also trying to stigmatize this dichotomy that they think they're being responsible.
AS: My kid wasn't a junkie.
CJ: ""I'm responsible because I'm using opioids in the form of OxyContin for their chronic pain."" I'm like, ""You're just giving heroin for their chronic pain."" 
AS: When you say the oral heroin to other physicians what do they say? The same thing you just told me?
CJ: They don't like me saying that. They like to just call it opioids and use more scientific names and sterilize it and clean it up. They feel like they're doing responsible medicine. All they're doing is oral heroin for conditions that life just creates because life is life. Here's the other thing. Have they really helped people? Not if you look at the disability rolls. If you look and see are people ""getting their lives back."" Then you should see massive decreases in people with chronic back and joint pain who are back at work now that they're on their opioids. You absolutely do not see that. In fact, disability claims have done nothing but gone up. These patients will almost universally say they're helping.
AS: But they're still in pain and they can't work.
CJ: Right. When they come off the medicines...
AS: They actually are in pain.
CJ: They're withdrawing. Then when they take their medicines they feel like it's helping them. But they're not back at work. In terms of being engaged in life.
AS: And healing.
CJ: They're not doing that. It is giving emotional consolation so yes they say they're helping but especially because we're paying for their disability. Healthcare and insurance, they're paid for collectively. We're paying for that. We have a stake in helping you get back to work and pay into the system. We have a stake in the fact if you're not back and work and doing all this other stuff we're not getting what we paid for. 
AS: We don't see it that way. Can you talk a little bit about how you got involved in the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation?
CJ: One of the other docs on the board, Reznikoff, I think it was after I gave a lecture in 2012 at Park Nicollet. I don't know who heard it. Somebody somewhere either heard that talk that I gave and told the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement or ICSI about me. ICSI invited me to be on their pain management group. I participated in their document they produced. I think it was 2010 or something. Then they reconvened in 2015. I went back and did it again. Charlie was on this ICSI group. He learned who I was through ICSI. Then he approached me later. He was already on the Rummler Foundation and said, ""Would you like to be on the board of the Rummler Foundation?"" I met Judy and Bill. They told me their story and I told them my approach. I've been on their board. It's been a good relationship. I'm not sure how helpful I am to them. In the sense that a lot of their board meetings are about financials. A lot of what I do is advocacy and message. I'm not good with money. I'm not a fundraiser.
AS: They're raising money to get more Narcan kits.
CJ: They've been very good about; they bring me speaking opportunities. Can you go talk to this group? I also point out when they do their Narcan. Narcan is catching it, if you're at Narcan you've lost so much already. Granted let’s save your life and help you get back and give you a chance to get that stuff back. Let's stop it upstream so a person never needs Narcan. While I applaud Narcan and medical assisted therapy and helping people who've developed a problem. My main message is medicine had no business causing this problem in the first place. We are not helping people we're harming them. We have no accountability and we have a system that is geared to continue to have business proceed as usual. In what I view as a very egregious violation of the Hippocratic Oath. That's the message that I bring. 
AS: I think that's a helpful message for them even. We need those voices. 
CJ: A lot of the meetings do tend to be about, like any board meeting.
AS: It's not that exciting.
CJ: Is the organization functioning? The organization needs finances to function. Where's our finances? Where are we getting them from? Where's our donors? How do we get this? All of that is very important. They don't just spring up out of nowhere. I'm bad at that. I'm not good at that. In that sense I'm not a good board member. I look at a page of figures and I'm like ""Sure. Is that good? I don't know."" 
AS: Boards need all kinds of people. They need people they can count on to go and speak articulately, be on message for them. That's important.
CJ: I have been told I'm a good speaker.
AS: You are. You're a very good speaker. What do you see happening in the next few years in this environment? You just said a few minutes ago you don't think it's going to change anytime soon. What would like to see?
CJ: I chair the Department of Human Services Opioid Prescribing Workgroup. I told that right?
AS: No.
CJ: The Department of Human Services has an Opioid Prescribing Workgroup that was, I forget who set it up. 
AS: That's Mo.
CJ: I'm sure I brought cat hair with me. [Talks to cat]. I chair the Department of Human Services Opium Prescribing Workgroup. We've been at it for over a year now. We're coming up with our recommendations for chronic pain. They are going to reflect the things that I've said to you. We've got, Charlie Reznikoff is on this too. The recommendation that are going on the commission are going to be for policy. They're going to reflect the fact that you have to reduce exposure. Whatever it is you're doing, stop the patient after two weeks, whatever it is. Tell them ""You're going to hurt. That'll be okay. Your body will heal."" Healing is another way that things get better. The body heals. 
AS: Nerves have to readjust. 
CJ: Your brain stops responding enough to the nerves. Remember other countries live and function without it. That's going to be the message. The question is then, after this what kind of buy in are we going to get from the medical community? You need everyone to do the same thing at the same time. Sort of the way the ACA mandated insurance companies to stop discriminating against people with preexisting conditions.
AS: And women.
CJ: One insurance company couldn't have an epiphany of conscience and decide it's not right that these people with these expensive things that they can't get insurance. We're going to just start doing it. What happens when one company decides to do that? All the sick people go to that company. Right? Their premiums don't remotely cover the cost of their care. That would be an insurance company to go broke. You had to have a piece of policy that said everyone at the exact same time had to pick up these expensive patients. Granted you also had to mandate that people have to buy in. They're trying to get rid of that. ""You do that we all go broke."" That's why I think they need to stop this nonsense. Single payer, you take it right out of their check just like in Canada or Britain. You don't get the option and it's going to happen. The idea behind the ACA was they recognize you can't have one conscientious insurance company that just is going to do it by themselves. They would be destroyed. You have to make them all do it at the same time. That is the idea with a policy. If everyone sort of gets on board at the same time, ""We're not doing as many meds."" At the same time, we can decrease the exposure, we can decrease the number of prescriptions, decrease the number of pills that are getting to the population. That will bring the numbers back down. 
AS: What's your target area for this committee, this policy?
CJ: We haven't finished yet. We have to finish these recommendations, they have to go to the commissioner, there's going to be a public comment, a revision process. 
AS: To do actual legislation?
CJ: That's what we're going to find out. 
AS: That is awesome.
CJ: Nothing might happen. It might be like, ""Those are nice recommendations.""
AS: For the state of Minnesota. That would be your first....
CJ: We need to track the number of prescriptions. Are we reducing the number of prescriptions? What's happening with that? Then watch it over time. Are the prescriptions going down and with it are we seeing treatment admissions going down and the deaths go down? 
AS: I would think you would.
CJ: Considering the relationship that was very clearly evident when the problem started. You would like to see as the sales went up these other problems followed, as the sales go down the other problems go down. You'd like to see that relationship hold. There's nothing special about heroin. It doesn't become popular. There's no special sauce that changed. The reason heroin is popular is we created this whole new market for it with the pills. 
AS: And it's cheaper and it's easier to get.
CJ: A person who then became dependent on the pills, whereas a forty-five-year-old woman with back pain would never just go to heroin for their back pain. You put them on pills for five years because that's medicine from a doctor and a pharmacy. They look the same as aspirin. You put them on that for five years and then say you're taking those away now that now fifty-year-old woman their brain's desperate. They will go to heroin. They can't feel like that anymore. It is not tolerable to their brain to continue feeling like that. 
AS: Then kids who start playing around with the pain pills then aren't afraid of heroin. They don't have the same exposure and their not as afraid. It's not as shifty and dark.
CJ: Say they've snorted the pill. They know how it feels. ""I can manage it."" It's that halfway point that allows people to get over it. They would never go straight to recreational heroin.
AS: Although there are kids who are because of the way that it's being explained to them. It's not any different than the pain pills. 
CJ: They're sort of this halfway house that allows someone to get over that psychological...
AS: There was a lot of stigma in my generation. I'm going to turn fifty soon. Heroin was like no.
CJ: Heroin was inner city, jazz musicians.
AS: It was Jim Morrison and The Doors died. 
CJ: It was with blacks usually in poverty.
AS: To me it was like death. You saw the skull and crossbones when you thought of it. 
CJ: The rock n' roll musicians it was the typical hard partying, the Janice Joplins, the Jimmy Hendrixes, the Kurt Cobains. Now it's different.
AS: It's different because of the opiate pain killers. 
CJ: Prince was a Jehovah's Witness. They have their own beliefs. What is true is that he didn't drink and smoke and do all these typical rock n' roller things. His parties were clean. They didn't have alcohol. His brain was no less vulnerable just because it wasn't that type. That's why this problem has unfortunately drawn the attention. It has hit that segment of the population. 
AS: Middle and upper class white people.
CJ: Middle class professionals with kids going to the good schools. 
AS: The high school football hero. Thank you.
CJ: Is there anything else? Did I forget to cover something?
AS: Are you good? Are you getting cold?
CJ: I'm fine.
AS: I'm getting cold. Any last thoughts?
CJ: People wonder do I have a brother or family member who got addicted to opioids. The answer is no. 
AS: I kind of assumed that because you didn't tell me.
CJ: Honestly I'm just filled with righteous anger. 
AS: That's a motivator. 
CJ: I really feel this naive crusader in me that wanted to break policy things and right wrongs. I thought I'd go to medicine to do it one at a time. Then as I learned in medicine, I'm not sure if I'm doing that. Don't get me wrong. Most people in medicine absolutely are trying to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing. We straighten out fractures and we intubated people in respiratory failure. We're doing that. That is the goal of most doctors. They still do great things. The motivations that people who create that climate don't do it with the patient's best outcomes in mind. When you hear these stories about patients being held in ERs for two days because there's no mental health bed for someone who's suicidal. There's a reason for that. The ER doctor who sees them puts them on a hold because they're trying to do the best thing for them. They are. But the reason they can't find a bed for them but they can get a heart attack patient up there in thirty minutes is a matter of economic priority and who is invested in that and where does that come from. That comes from the level above the level of doctor and patient. 
Anyone who tells anyone that what your health outcome is just you talking to your doctor. Nonsense. It is never ever been you and your doctor. What determines that outcome is also a matter of economic investment and priority prior to that doctor ever getting there. That doctor who wants to do the best for their patient can get the acute heart attack up to the cath lab. They can do that right away. That same doctor is going to put their patient on hold and they're going to sit there for two days. There's no medical outlet. There's no place for them. We've decided this is not valued. 
AS: Mental health and addiction are treated the same.
CJ: I sympathize with hospitals that are put in the position of losing money on some types of healthcare and having to make up for it by doing other stuff. You'd like to think that healthcare that provides a service and a value should always be in the positive. Like you're doing something good. You shouldn't lose money for doing a service that improves the health of someone. Hospitals are in the business where providing the service causes them to lose so they have to make up for it here. Don't think that doctors and hospital people are a different class of human that are removed from incentives. There's a reason you need a federal act to stop patient dumping. Do you know what the Emergency Medicine Treatment and Active Labor Act is?
AS: No.
CJ: EMTALA. It's in 1986. That was the act that stopped patient dumping. That's why you can go to an emergency room and you have to be seen.
AS: Any emergency room you go to now. Right because there were places that said ""You can't come in here."" You could turn them away.
CJ: They were poor patients they found that had appendicitis. We're going to send you to county. They do a lot more than we do. 
AS: Now I remember this but not the name of it.
CJ: That's what George Bush said, or George W. said. That's what Mitt Romney said, ""We do have a universal health care system. We have emergency departments."" That's what they meant. You had to be seen. 
AS: That was their big Reagan era contribution to healthcare.
CJ: Understand if doctors and other hospital healthcare people weren't sending off the poor patients you wouldn't have needed that law. If they were doing what their oath said. They were trying to maximize return on their time so they sent away the patients who weren't paying. They were forced by law to not do that. Don't think that you've got this different class of animal human in the healthcare industry that doesn't pay close attention to that. 
AS: What do you want to do in the next few years? Where do you see your work and your career going?
CJ: I've moved to urgent care because the hours are better. It doesn't pay as well. I sleep at night better. Would I go back to emergency medicine? Probably not full time. The burn out in emergency medicine is really high. It's not what your body was meant to do. I don't have children so I don't need tons of time. This public health work I do does give me purpose. I feel this is a good mission to be on. It just so happens that this problem I began work on over a decade ago is now the number one public health problem in the country. That's why I'm front and center on it, at least in this state. Since it hasn't stopped I'm imagining that the work for me to do here is going to continue. 
AS: For the meantime you'll stay in urgent care?
CJ: I'll just keep doing that unless I get to the point where the work I do public health wise, speaking educating, helping systems develop policy, that itself becomes compensated to a point where I could do that. At some point does North Dakota need help? I haven't talked there. Wisconsin do they have a problem? I don't know of anyone doing my job in either of those places.
AS: In this way. What's the name of the opioid group that you're working on? 
CJ: The Department of Human Services? DHS is the Opioid Prescribing Workgroup. I'm also on the board on the National Organization of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. 
AS: I'm excited about your Opioid Workgroup. Let me know if you need any help with that.
CJ: I think you've got a system of incentives that are poorly designed to solve this as they are constructed now. With people, many of whom are well meaning, but are operating in a system they didn't set up. The people who can control how the incentives are set up don't want to change. That's our system right now. 
AS: Thank you. Thanks so much. That was really great. "

Minnetonka, Minnesota
Dean Johnson-DJ   
Amy Sullivan-AS
Ann Perry-AP       
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I'm with Dean Johnson at his home in Minnetonka. It's January 20, 2017. Dean would you just state your name and say that you give me permission to record this?
DJ: This is Dean Johnson, and you have my permission to record this.
AS: Thank you. Would you start by talking about your childhood? Where you grew up, your family of origin?
DJ: I grew up in ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land, which is how I characterize my childhood to a lot of people. I was born in 1952. I was number six of seven children. We're all baby boomers. My hometown was Valparaiso, Indiana, which is about fifty miles east of Chicago. When I say ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land it's because all the neighborhoods resembled the show. That relationships—getting away with a couple of little criminal activities periodically was okay. Lecturing, even a paint stick periodically from my father, kept me in line. At that time Valparaiso had a thriving, wonderful, hundred-year-old downtown. You could ride your bike everywhere. This was ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land. 
AS: Where'd you go to college, or did you go to college?
DJ: I did go to college. My father was a piano teacher. He has a master’s degree in music. In the course of his career he was primarily a private piano teacher. He had his own clients; he rented space at a music store. At times he had piano lessons at our home. I think as my oldest brother and sister were approaching college the notion of putting seven kids through college was strenuous. Somehow he found himself in the music department at Valparaiso University. All of us, having a relationship with the university, got free tuition. All seven of us went to Valparaiso University.
AS: That is a good deal.
DJ: Pretty extraordinary. Then in the course of that tenure, I honestly don't recall, and both my folks are dead so I can't ask them. I don't know where my father abandoned the music and became a librarian or a library scientist. Ultimately he became the director of libraries at the university, which was the job he retired in shortly after I graduated. Maybe it was a little after I graduated. He was still employed there when I graduated in 1974. I don't know, because music was the love of his life.
AS: He must have had some…
DJ: More money, who knows. Valparaiso University wasn't the place for him to continue his private piano clientele. I think part of it simply was that he needed to decide if he was going to nurture private piano students outside of the university career or just abandon it. He only took cream of the crop; his piano students always won state trophies. He was very well known. He played the organ in my church for forty-five years, something like that. We grew up in a Christian environment. Of course we went to Sunday school because Dad played the organ.
AS: What church did you attend?
DJ: This was Emmanuel Lutheran Church, which when I was in my youth was a very small, maybe two hundred seat, one hundred and thirty-year-old building. It was pretty cool. Attached to it was a lunchroom in the basement and a gymnasium on the second level. That church started a Lutheran school. At some point where my oldest brother, who is ten years older than me, was already in fourth grade or something like that. They started not a kindergarten but a first through eighth grade parochial school. My class size, again ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land, was twenty-four kids. Twelve boys, twelve girls. I didn't know anyone that was divorced. I didn't know anyone of different color, persuasion, religion, nothing. When I graduated from Emmanuel Lutheran School as an eighth grader I was just shocked to go to a junior high in the public school system and meet hooligans for the first time. Big boys. I was a big fish in a little pond. I was very good in all the sports. 
AS: At your small school.
DJ: We only played other private schools, Catholic or Lutheran schools all around the region. Get into junior high I couldn't even survive on the C team in basketball. That was probably my first mental challenge: you used to be hot stuff and now you're not. My favorite sports: basketball, football, baseball—I couldn't compete at that level. I absolutely could not. I did play tennis in high school, but I quit that when I was a senior. 
Anyways, went to Valparaiso University and worked only because at that time was the oil embargo, '73, '74. The economy was terrible and it was like, “Now what do you do?” I had a geography degree. I started out as a civil engineer. I hated engineering and did criminology, philosophy—all of the liberal arts stuff. As a Lutheran university you took theology. I actually have a minor in theology. I took those courses not in pursuit of anything other than they were all interesting and stimulating. Here I said my class size in grade school was twenty-four. Most of the class size in the theology department were seven, eight students. You got to become very intimate with all the professors. This was the love generation and I had experimented with the drug of the day in those times. It was very stimulating to be able to have really a one-on-one relationship with a lot of professors when you are in school. All of my friends went to Purdue, Indiana University, Indiana State, some went to Butler, some went to very small schools like Shelley [Dean’s daughter] did at DePauw. A couple of my friends went to Notre Dame. All of those schools with the exception of DePauw, the class size you've got freshman English and it's six hundred students in a stadium. I had a very cultured education from the time I was born in a very sound, stable family environment when I got out with a geography degree and a minor of theology it was like, ""Where are you going to work?"" 
Valparaiso University is ten miles from all the steel mills that are on the south side of Chicago or Lake Michigan. All of my older brothers at one point in time worked at the mills. I was the only one that hadn't. I had a neighbor that was a general contractor and I did a lot of road construction work from the time I was a sophomore in high school all through my undergraduate years. I worked at that construction company. I didn't have to endure the mills. A friend of mine who worked with an engineering firm said, ""We're contractors to Youngstown Sheet Tube Company and they need help. It's not working in the mill. You don't work for Youngstown Sheet Tube you work for this engineering firm."" I interviewed, they hired me at the steel mill. [Phone rings] It's a massive structure. I suffered a year at the steel mill. They wanted to hire me. I started out as an engineer and they said, ""Look we'll give you a full-time job not with this engineering firm but with Youngstown Sheet and Tube."" We were assigned to the engineering department. They said, ""We'll give you a full-time job and you can go to school and get your college degree and stay here forever."" I thought there couldn't be anything more ghastly in the world. 
I went and met with my advisor in the geography department. He said, ""I have a friend down in Illinois that they have a city planning program. I'll see if I can get you in."" A week later we met and he said, ""You're in. The good news is for most of the term that you're down there you'll be a graduate assistant and you'll have free tuition. All you've got to figure out is room and board. Your first fall quarter you have to pay out of state tuition and your room and board and whatever."" So I went down and I have a sister in St. Louis. I lived with her that fall quarter. I don't remember what it was, but I saved money from my previous job and paid out of pocket for that first quarter. Then I had a free ride for two years. This was a two-year master of science in city and regional planning. There were not a lot of planning schools in the country back then. 
I'm in line the first day of registration and who's next to me but Ann Roberts Perry from Minnesota. I'd never been to Minnesota. She'd never been to Indiana. These were the old days when you didn't do everything online, you stood in line. You're killing time chit chatting and I was just madder than heck after we finally had table openings and went our different ways, I didn't write her phone number down. Here we are in a graduate program—how hard is it going to be to find somebody? I had no classes with her that fall. I finally bumped into her in a hallway somewhere. Then we exchanged vitals. She hated where she was living and I told her I was living with my sister and I didn't like that, and from that following quarter we had classes together and one thing led to another. By the end of our second year we decided we were getting married.
AS: Did you move in with her?
DJ: She moved into my house. I had roommates in the first semester, first year. They were all done after that year. I'm wringing my hands and going well, ""I've got this place and nobody's going to be here next year."" She goes, ""Okay."" It was like, ""Woo."" We weren't officially even dating at that point because she was trying to dump this guy who was graduating a year ahead of us also. I didn't like him. He was from Montana or Wyoming or somewhere. She goes home for the summer and I stayed down there and worked at an outdoor festival, which was another story and a great thing that doesn't relate to addiction. Ann came back and I called her over the summer. She said, ""I'm planning on staying with you."" That worked out and I dragged her to my parents at Christmas break and on the way home she said, ""I could never live in Indiana."" You have to drive through south Chicago, Gary, Indiana to get to Valparaiso. She said, ""Nothing about Valpo, but I couldn't live that close to all that crap."" Our deal was whoever got the first job that's where you go. The options were we could stay in St. Louis, which was a hellhole of the world. We could move to Indiana, which was another hellhole of the world according to Ann. Or bless her heart she found a job. She diligently went out and got a job. 
We moved to Minnesota and got married the week after we graduated. I'm a Minnesotan now. I've lived here officially longer than any other time I spent in Indiana or Illinois. We were married five years before we had Spencer. We had both gotten sick of our careers to the point where we had gone through a period of time when all we talked about was our profession twenty-four/seven—got old after a while. We kind of figured that out. I think we were both thirty when Spencer was born. We had talked it out. It used to be you had kids at twenty and now today it's forty. At that time thirty was kind of a pivotal time otherwise the medical community was concerned. When I first met Ann her first words to me were, ""I don't want a family."" 
That's the difference between being in ﻿Leave it to Beaver ﻿land and her experience with an alcoholic father and a mother that was a little bit milk toast, couldn't deal with the family. Ann was the second oldest and she literally raised all of the younger siblings. She was always a take charge, very strong personality. We didn't clash that much because I've a very strong personality, but I'm also very outward. Ann is a little bit more of an introvert when it comes outside of her personal ground, her corporate environment, or the immediate family. She's not as gregarious or outgoing as I might be. She might prefer a less travelled path when it comes to being with people and I'm okay. 
In all of my working career through construction I learned how to communicate with and deal with complete blue collar, almost uneducated people to very prima donna architect and engineer types. It gave me a wonderful background on, “How do you succeeded in life?” That was probably the best training for me to have that much variety. Also I knew how my brothers hated working in the steel mills. That kind of cultured my attitude about a lot of things. I can't be emotional in front of a crowd, but I can stand up and talk business in front of five hundred people. None of that bothers me. When I get emotional I can't contain myself. I can't even talk sometimes. I just have to pass. I'll tell Ann, ""You finish it."" I can't do that. My stomach's in my throat when anything is emotional. When it's professional I'm lucky. I can wing it. When I go to meetings now I don't do any prep. I listen to book tapes on the way. I just mellow out and go in there and hit them. That's a blessing from a career standpoint. Now people that have to deal with me professionally say, ""That guy talks more than anybody. Are you going to talk all night Dean, or are you going to let us get down to business?"" You have to be conscious of how far to explain things. 
I'm right now in this process of working with twenty-three communities doing long-range comprehensive plans. I've got sixteen of those clients with orientation meetings in January and February. They're all night meetings. It's ghastly. I had four meetings this week. I’m just exhausted. Back when Ann and I met you're used to having twenty-hour days. When you get retirement age this night stuff is a killer. That's the far end of this mental issue. What do you want to know about children?
AS: When your babies were born. You guys were thirty…
DJ: We were thirty. Spencer was born in 1981 and Shelley was born in April of 1984. Three years apart. Spencer was delayed in school as a summer baby. They were class years apart. Spence was a great kid. I participated in the delivery for both of them. Spencer was a little rough on Ann. We had a midwife and he was not breach, but he was rolled over and she couldn't get him to do this and that. They were wanting to do this in one of the new-fangled birthing chairs because it was so much better on the woman. Then here's Ann on her hands and knees in the bed propped up and getting a massage trying to move Spencer a little bit. Finally, a doctor came in and helped. 
He came out naturally, but when he came out all I saw was this white, wrinkly stuff. I thought, ""My God he came out butt first."" It was his head, it was severely wrinkled and it was pure white with this cheesy stuff. They whisked him away and I'm hearing all this chatter and clatter, ""Give me this! Give me that! I need the..."" I'm panicking. I'm like the kid's got problems. They're just cleaning his nose. They're just cleaning his nose but they're doing it all quick. I'm just watching this. When Shelley was born, the doctor said, ""Do you want to clip the cord?"" The whole thing was calm. She had an epidural so she was calm. That was the difference of the two, but they were both perfectly healthy at birth and essentially healthy as they were raised. 
Spencer was terribly shy. He was my shadow. He not only looked like me, he walked in my footsteps behind me. I'd turn around and look for him and he'd be right there on my butt. He'd almost walk with his nose in my rear end. He couldn't talk to people. He was extremely shy. Shelley on the other hand—if some criminal was sitting on a park bench going, ""Hey, honey come over here."" She'd run right over there. They were very different in that regard. Spencer was one of the more inventive, creative people that I knew from children. Certainly more creative than me. He could build a spud gun. He and his cousin built a guillotine for mice and frogs. Where did this devious, I don't want to say it's violent, but I mean it was violent. You're chopping the heads off of frogs. We don't know where that came from. We didn't hear about any of that stuff until these kids were in college. They started sharing stories.
Well he was in ninth grade and got caught taking liquor to school. Three boys got detained and just based on the work schedule I lost the draw and had to go sit with the DARE cop, the principal, and I don't know who else. Looking back, it's a serious deal. They had taken a 7-Up or a Pepsi bottle and poured vodka in it or something. Somehow they got in study hall. I don't even remember the details. Three boys got bounced out. One of the dads was an assistant coach with one of the sports. It was an embarrassment. Of course it was all his fault.
AS: Spencer's fault?
DJ: Yes, I think the blame largely came. He physically brought it. They all planned it, but it was the first time that he stole alcohol, that we're aware of, the first time he stole alcohol out of our liquor cabinet. 
AS: Where was he going to school at the time?
DJ: This was Wayzata East Junior High. He went to junior high. I think by the time Shelley got through they converted to a middle school system. Spencer started going to high school at the old Wayzata High School, which was all of three miles from here. He graduated from the new, magnificent, enormous facility eleven miles from our house. It was either bussing for a half hour or me driving them for half an hour or ultimately when Shelley was at the high school he drove one of our cars and drove the two of them to school. They went to school together I think his entire senior year and her sophomore year. They got along pretty well. He, like any kid, would pick on a little sister, but defend her to the death if somebody else wanted to pick on her. Otherwise they were natural irritants to each other. 
I can picture Shelley and her cousin who was the same age and then her brother and Spencer who were also the same age at Easter. The little girls are in their dresses and got their beautiful hand woven baskets and they're getting ready to go collect the eggs in the yard. The boys are in blue jeans. They're laughing like little devils. They went out and scooped up all the goodies before the girls even walked out the door. Then you're consoling these weeping little children. The boys are sitting there behind the tree. This is the way they were. 
He was diagnosed with ADD. I think that was before they added ADHD to these. At an early age it was recommended he go on Ritalin. At a relatively early age, I think fourth or fifth grade, I can't remember, he was on Ritalin all through high school. He personally claims that that was what put him down the path. That somehow got him into this habit even though it's a well-used, monitored, legal medication. He attributes this to that. He and Jamie [Spencer’s girlfriend] talked about whether Aidan [Spencer’s son] would have ADHD, or whatever his position was, don't get him on Ritalin. Avoid it like the plague. There were a couple of times when Spencer was not performing as a student. He was not necessarily ever a stellar student. You could tell he was capable of getting As and Bs, but he was more frequently getting Cs and some Ds. There was an attitude change at junior high probably before high school. We went to a family counselor. This was dismal. The guy was a specialist with adolescents. We go in there and he stands up and he's just a nerd. His barn door's open. Spencer's laughing and he couldn't take anything seriously.
AS: No, after that point. It's over you might as well leave.
DJ: He's like, ""Don't you ever force me to go to one of these clowns again."" He developed a very nasty attitude about anybody who was under the guise of the medical community. He always felt he knew what was in his brain not some other moron. That was consistent. That developed at an early age. 
Shelley if I can depart, was a wonderful, a delightful little girl. Dolls and all of that stuff. She had a doting mother and father. You try to be careful not to spoil. We had a lot of wealthier friends where they got all the great toys. 
From an early age we emphasized to them all of the natural things—and particularly Spencer. He grew up with this whole outdoor mentality. I'm not a hunter, so I don't know weapons. None of that included weaponry, but it included fishing, hunting, camping, outdoor skiing, cross country, downhill, everything. From the time he was eight months old was the first time we went up to Ely to Burntside Lake—a place called Camp Van Vac and took him on a weekend before he was one-year-old. Ann and I had been to the boundary waters and one of our acquaintances, a neighbor right here who could see the house said, ""You don't have to give up that experience. Come up to Camp Van Vac."" It's true. These were glorious sixty to eighty-year-old cabins that were far enough apart you didn't see the neighboring cabin. They had pit toilets. They had a central toilet for people who couldn't stand the thought of an outhouse. You had running water in the cabins but you had privacy. Most of them had boat docks. We climbed through the ranks from 1982, the first year we went there, until we left in 2003. We had stayed from 1981 to 2002. Twenty-one years, thirty-one years. That's twenty. That's right. I was thinking Spencer was thirty-four. We were twenty-year alumni at this place and again graduated from having the worst cabin to having the best cabin by the time we were done. Most of the people in camp take the same cabin the next year. You grow up with all of these families that are in your week. We actually gravitated to two weeks. From that standpoint they both learned new friends with no other connection other than Ely, Minnesota. Both kids went through boat training and all of that and got their license to boat. Both learned how to water ski and all of that stuff. 
When they were in middle school we said, ""Wouldn't you guys like to go to Washington D.C. or Yellowstone or something like that?"" ""Yes."" ""Well we'd have give up our week at Camp Van Vac."" ""No way."" They never went on those educational trips. We never took Christmas trips unless it was skiing somewhere up in Duluth or Wisconsin. Every spring break we went to New Mexico, California, Colorado, wherever and did ski trips. They never saw Washington D.C. or Yellowstone because our emphasis was always these family trips that were outdoor oriented. 
Shelley was on the high school ski team at Wayzata. Spencer never did that. He played football, baseball, didn't like basketball, tried hockey. So they were both very sport oriented. To go back to Spencer, I think there was a bit of this rebellious attitude that probably was eighth or ninth grade. There was a lack of commitment for school at that same age. Even though he had gone through the public school, I should probably say because he went through the public school system from the time he was in kindergarten versus me entering and being shocked at what I saw in eighth grade. He was used to it by then and whatever element was kind of over the edge was his preference. He had no time for anybody that would think about being in choir or band or those sorts of things. They were the laughable segment. As a parent you're like, ""Oh please get into choir and get into band."" We don't care if you're a nerd. Get in the computer club. That wasn't for Spencer. He was always on the fringe with his friends. 
AS: What do you mean on the fringe?
DJ: The ones that wanted a different type of experience. It wasn't just going to a movie. 
AS: He was around those people.
DJ: He would prefer to be somebody that would come up with the idea that, “Let's go to auto racing.” Something a little more thrill seeking. If I could characterize him it was he was a thrill seeker. He was the type that would find, and they did find, an old zip line at a former gravel pit. We're talking a sixty-foot drop. He'd be the one that would do it. He had a friend take a picture of him when he let go of the zip line into the water. He's halfway down to this thing. That was high school. Yes, a thrill seeker. 
We were aware of—because the Orono police called me, and one of our friends who happened to be there, that they had both of our boys at the police station. They were caught at the Wayzata Country Club, which was closed because it was November. When a neighbor called and said there's a car parked there the cops snuck up on them. Opened the door and the guy he goes, ""Man there was one cloud of smoke that came out when we opened the door."" Steve, my friend, and I said, ""Alright we've got to keep a straight face. We have to be stern."" We told the cops, ""We want you to scare the living shit out of them."" They did a good job of that. First offense, whatever. They turned them over to us. It's part of our own discipline.
AS: They were smoking pot?
DJ: They were smoking pot big time. It was his buddy's older brother, who if I could describe the Eddie Haskell of the world. Steve, his father, showered his love on the older boy Matt, who was Eddie Haskell who got away with murder. He bought these kids pot. But Johnny, the one Spencer's age, was always the one who got caught. He was the troublemaker. I always felt bad for John who spoke at Spencer's celebration because his dad never gave him the time of day. They've got to rectify that because his older brother's got some health issues and other stuff and owns a business. John's kind of running the business. I'm like, “Okay, Steve, when are you going to go back and let John know maybe not that there was a mistake all this time, but how much you appreciate him?” That's a different topic. 
Spencer was on the edge. We were aware of a culture of trying things. We never witnessed, and it's easier to witness alcohol than any other thing that kids might get involved in. Sometimes as long as they chewed gum or whatever and the high from pot was down or it was just lousy pot in those days. It was easy to masquerade that. I'm not aware of other things other than pot or alcohol at that time in high school. College I think it all entered into a whole new realm. Friends of his who freely admitted to exposing him to Oxycontin were the ones that didn't have these genes missing and had no trouble with saying, ""Hasta la vista. It's time for me to grow up and move on."" The time period—I think in his early twenties, late teens until mid-twenties—he was in that period of trying a lot of different stuff along with friends to this day we'd bump into and they have normal lives and have walked away from that wildness. His fringe buddies, I could name seven of them, Spencer's the only one who couldn't walk away from it, which is completely consistent with what the medical community—
AS: With statistics.
DJ: Fifteen percent. If you're one in seven that's it. He was not doing well in school. We could tell that and we said, ""We're not spending this kind of money on that."" I don't know if it was a year and a half or two years that he lasted at the U [University of Minnesota]. The U would have been the last place on earth he should have gone. He should have been at St. Cloud, a much smaller place. He's not this extrovert. He's the introvert. He'd have done much better in a smaller setting. 
AS: Lost in the crowd a little bit.
DJ: It was easy to be overwhelmed by somebody who's like, ""Class? You go to class?"" That's what happened to him. There was nothing serious, nothing pressing in his mind. That's the real start of being high more than half the time. In high school it was way under the radar. I don't think terrible, but only he could confirm that. 
Then there was a period of time he was working in the landscape business. He worked for one of my brothers in law at a flooring company. He was maintaining jobs. We'd bump into supervisors and one of his supervisors was at our old church. He'd go, ""Oh gosh Spencer's conscientious. He's a top worker."" Yet, like most of the people in construction and landscape tend to be a little high on the job but most of them are not doing pills. They're smoking pot when they move from one job to the other. They're able to deal with that. Spencer, from when people introduced him to Oxycontin, was spending more and more of his money on that sort of legal medication. It wasn't until—
AS: Was he getting them legally?
DJ: He was buying from anybody he knew. He's buying them on the street. At the point in time that he was getting them off the street they were still being dispensed like today. Today the quantities are certainly down which has led to the increase in heroin. There's a complete relationship to that. 
Let me back up. He had a girlfriend that was off the charts with personal problems. She was adopted. Her parents tried to put her in a commune down in Arizona to straighten her out because she was a nonconformist and was experimenting in drugs. They left her down there for a year. Anyways, she latched onto Spencer and she was the type when she'd get high or mentally unstable in a crowd of people she'd scream rape and cops would come and accost Spencer. It was a terrible relationship. When she was normal she was a sweet, wonderful girl. Ann and I found ourselves sitting in downtown Minneapolis at the Hennepin Medical Center because neither of her parents would come and she had freaked out. We're sitting in the room until they can get a psychiatrist in there, holding her hand and getting phone calls. The mother's just going, ""There is no way. Her father's out of town. He's coming back tonight."" Finally, the dad calls me and he's madder than heck that we're dealing with her. It was a very, very peculiar thing. 
That resulted in her getting into some personal calamities legally. Doing bizarre stuff, kicking a window in, whatever. She finally got into some sort of rehab and then had gotten into some women's housing in downtown. I haven't seen her personally, but Spencer saw her seven years after the fact and she'd been sober for seven or eight years. Actually one of his sober home managers was dating her. It's a small world. When that relationship ended, which would have been probably 2005 or '06, I'm pretty convinced at that time Spencer had not seen or done anything with heroin. I know he was snorting coke with this woman. He told me, he admitted it. Blowing a lot of his money on that. Whenever he was able to get the pain pills he was routinely getting them. 
He met Jamie, she was still a student at the University. We had moved from our house to this house. The old house was vacant. We let Spencer and Jamie live in our house while she finished school. Unbeknownst to us until she's about five months pregnant, other than saying, ""Geez is Jamie putting on a little extra weight here?"" Neither of them told us she was pregnant. She finally got fed up with him not telling us and she told us. I'm like, ""Okay, good. That explains a pretty large posture there young lady."" It was just getting worse. When we had first met her, she was slim and trim and appeared to be the type that could struggle with weight gain but at that time was attractive and very conscientious about her appearance. It was just like, ""Boy school must be rough. Something's slipping."" 
Aidan was born in September of 2008. During the time they were living at our house she would never tell us anything. She just didn't know us. She didn't feel comfortable with us and so we weren't getting anything from her. It was only in my dealings with Spencer: “Well, wait a minute. Jamie's the student. Why is she able to pay rent and you're not?” It was apparent to me again that he was wasting all of his money on medications. 
AS: Do you think she knew that he was using? 
DJ: I don't know to the extent about the pills. Clearly they met through mutual friends who had gone to Wayzata. She went to Wayzata as well but she's like five years younger than Spencer. They were never in school together. She was partying with a group of kids who may have had other siblings who were also in Spencer's group. They met while she was with a younger element of the same group that Spencer was hanging out with. That's how they got together. She liked him. Spencer was a good looking kid. There wasn't any reason on the surface until his situation deteriorated that he shouldn't be someone you'd want to be with.
It was only after Aidan was born and Spencer called me in the morning. He says, ""We got off on the wrong side this morning and Jamie's upset. I just want you to drive down to the house and see if there's a cop car down there."" He was real agitated. This was like 7:30 in the morning. I'm going, ""What are you talking about?"" He couldn't to my satisfaction come close to explaining himself or describing what the situation was. He goes, ""I got to go. I'm late for work already. We just got into an argument."" I would officially, other than some bizarre times that he was with this former girl, this was the first time that I thought there was a pattern. When he was with this other girl he was still drinking. The last ten years he didn't drink, it was all drugs. When he was with her they were drinking, smoking, cocaine, a lot of stuff.
AS: You thought maybe drugs were a part of Jamie and Spencer's relationship?
DJ: I think Jamie has this potential of being a binge drinker, but doesn't have a sustained drinking problem. We've never seen any of that. She's very capable of, like when you're in college, overdoing it. I mean getting hammered to where you don't come home or stuff like that. We had Aidan and she was supposed to get him and didn't show up. Her parents would leak a little bit of information that she could go over the edge. We thought maybe this nursing student isn't quite...That's not her character. It's just that occasionally she can get out of line. She'll get out of line in an environment that she shouldn't be in. That could be with other men or it could simply be with her girlfriends but just totally overdo it. 
It was sometime after September 2008 that Aidan was born and this behavior was going on. I remember that Christmas we had a lot of snow activity, so Jamie and Aidan were both over here waiting to open gifts and stuff like that. He's shoveling for twenty-six straight hours. He was just a mess. Part of it you'd say is natural for having to snow plow like that but he was a zombie. It was these pain pills. He was probably getting speed and other stuff to keep up with that regimen. 
We had an intervention, if you will, in February of 2009. That's the first time he went to The Retreat [rehabilitation center]. We just said, ""Your behavior is bizarre. Here are your options."" We literally read him the riot act and said, ""You're either going to go and take care of yourself or you’re done."" Jamie was firm in spite of the fact that she probably was covering for him a lot. She got to the point where she realized she couldn't cover anymore. She said, ""That's right. You're out of my life."" 
I remember taking him down to Fairview and they were evaluating him. They didn't even tell us that he had Oxycontin in him. They released him and we had already booked a room at The Retreat. In the middle of the night they said, ""You've got to take him. He's got to detox. We don't take them unless they detox."" That was the first time we ever even heard the word detox. Apparently he was going through some physical reactions to not having this Oxycontin. I remember when we were heading down to Fairview to have him evaluated. I'm like, ""Spencer where is this stuff?"" He took me to three or four different places in the basement, up in the rafters, in the insulation. He's pulling this out, he's pulling that out. A bag of pills here a bunch of pot. I'd say, ""Is this it? Is this it?"" Afterwards six months later I can't believe he threw all this stuff down the toilet. He's just weeping. He probably had five hundred dollars worth of stuff in there. Once he sobered up it was like, ""I can't believe he'd do that."" That's kind of his mentality and attitude for the next ten years. ""I'm not responsible."" 
He told us every time and where there certainly were real moments of recovery they were glorified and his pattern of reuse was almost immediate for the first five years and then the next several years he would occasionally have what I think Nancy [Espuche] just experienced with Lucas, a year of sobriety. You go to a meeting and you go, ""We've made it a year. This is incredible."" You're so thrilled, you're so happy. Deep down inside you're saying to yourself, just outwardly when you have no evidence, ""It's been a year."" In Spencer's case and in Lucas it wasn't the case. I can't say because there were several times when we thought for sure, five months, six months of sobriety so forth that he could turn the corner. We knew enough about alcoholism but that's a life challenge. You always want to have a drink. It'd be the same thing with opiate addiction. All during his rehab it was, ""I can't do Twelve-step. I don't believe in Twelve-step."" 
AS: All rehabs or the first one?
DJ: In every one. It was always, ""Twelve-Step is a bunch of bullshit.""
AS: He went like thirteen times, fifteen times.
DJ: I think where Ann gets that number includes the detox not just a physical rehab program. She's kept that chronology. Someday we should corroborate that. At least a dozen rehabs for the thirty-day period of time.
AS: A dozen harsh stops right?
DJ: Yep. In controlled environments. However, as we learned, even if you're down in the resident program in Fairview they get the drugs right when they're in rehab.
AS: Did he get kicked out?
DJ: He got kicked out of The Retreat.
AS: He did it on the first one?
DJ: Second time. He made it through the first Retreat. That's a function of early on, I'm convinced many of these places didn't know how to conduct urine tests. He routinely cheated them. I don't know if you were at one of the Nar Anon meetings. This is how life goes on after death. I had like a squeeze bottle, it's a liquid, it's a prescribed not antiseptic but a bacterial agent. My scalp dries out. It's not psoriasis. It's very seasonal. I would get dryness in my scalp and the doctor says, ""This is called betamethasone and it's liquid."" I also used betamethasone because in the winter I break out in a rash. I had this little bottle of betamethasone and here it was just before Thanksgiving or something. I take this thing put it in my hair and I'm like, ""What's that smell?"" It was full of urine! The SOB had taken the top off, filled it with urine and so in one of his tests he'd have this little bottle and if anybody saw the bottle it's a prescription. When we were going through his things I'm like, ""That's my betamethasone. He must have borrowed that."" It was full of pee. All over my head. 
AS: That is horrible.
DJ: Six-month old pee on top of it. Whose pee was it? 
AS: It was probably not your son's.
DJ: No. If he was carrying it around, he needed clean pee. They had these other methods where you warm the urine or you freeze the urine. All these things that they claimed worked. Scientifically could it? I don't know. I couldn't care less. I don't want to go there because that's not my responsibility anymore. I am convinced that while he only got caught and kicked out of The Retreat his second visit—I'm beginning to believe that there might not have been thirty days of sobriety when he was in those residential programs. You don't know. Where do you want me to take this?
AS: Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Spencer as a father through all this? Some of your experiences and some of your emotional states.
DJ: Before, during?
AS: If you could describe what your relationship was like before? It sounds like it was pretty good. During his addiction and as you became more drawn into trying to help, could you just talk about your experience as a parent and a father?
DJ: Both kids growing up, and even their friends will say, ""Oh my gosh your dad is the greatest dad on earth."" On the outside you'd say whatever this guy was doing was working. It was how not only his kids reacted but his friends' kids. Our old house was a neat piece of property, the yard was huge. We owned a quarter mile into a wetland. There was an island and upland area of trees in the center of this big wetland. In the winter we'd make paths out there in the snow in the cattails. The kids would build forts. They weren't getting an experience where their dads were with them. I went out with them. You can say up that hill—it's starting to melt—I create sledding paths. Aidan and his little sister sledded all last weekend on this little dinky hill. We did that in both our front and back yard. Not only my kids, but my friends would say, ""He's the greatest dad.""
AS: Did you feel like the greatest? Did you feel like a good dad? Were you enjoying yourself?
DJ: I had a wonderful relationship with my dad, but it was different. My dad never threw a baseball to me. My dad never pitched a horseshoe, tossed a Frisbee. My dad was not that type. I didn't seek to go do anything other than what I liked. My father tried to give me piano lessons, what he liked. I was incapable of receiving that gift. I had to play baseball, basketball, football without my father. That didn't inhibit the relationship we had. There was not a physical, recreational—but my parents bought a cabin on the border of Michigan and Indiana right near the border of Ohio when I was in eighth grade. My dad learned how to water ski, and it was a big piece of property and an older cabin. We had lots of sweat equity in taking stumps and rocks. All during junior high and high school I was the only one really at home. I worked my butt off and so did my dad. Here's this prissy librarian/music teacher and he's working his butt off and I liked that. I taught him how to water ski because I knew how to water ski. He water skied at age fifty, the first time. I was real proud of him. 
I didn't go out to seek this natural relationship with my kids. That's just my preference. When we have Aidan, we're like, ""Aidan you can take your iPad to the cabin, but you're getting a half hour in the morning and a half an hour at night. If you don't want that than you need to stay home."" Here it's lot harder because his mom raising two kids alone, working twelve hour shifts. She puts him to bed he's got the iPad. That's the sad fact of life. He puts himself to bed. When he comes here we read to him until he falls asleep. He loves that. We did that to our kids. We read to them at night. When the kids had their friends over for a sleepover we read to them. I think that relational thing is pretty simple. 
AS: You were present.
DJ: We were always there. During his addiction I was not the textbook person. I was getting lectured a lot. I would freely say this in front of Ann. I'd be sitting at my desk working and she'd shove an article in my face. I'd go, ""Set it aside."" ""You need to read it."" While we were on the same page dealing with addiction she absorbed herself in finding out anything and everything medically, physically, socially, emotionally, and was constantly pestering: look at, read, do this, do that. Much of that time she could not deal personally with Spencer. ""I can't deal with him right now."" I'm caught in this barrage of being the one that deals with him and also being lectured about what I'm doing wrong to where clearly more than once I'd say, ""Fine. You do it. You feel so strongly about it you do it. You do it that way."" 
As we went through this I certainly got far better and recognized and understood what enabling was and letting go and things of that magnitude. My early enabling was like anyone's you would expect. When he was using we kicked him out. We got to the point where when you're not using, when you're in recovery we'll help you. That's where the dilemma in talking to people in our small groups at Nar Anon, that's a personal thing. You have to decide what's crossing the line again when you're helping. Spencer understands that I promised and would deliver on coming through when he's in recovery. Of course he would. It's just him. He's going to hold me to it. Ann and I were mostly in sync throughout this process. Obviously some couples get divorced. That was helpful. 
Spiritually both of us advanced in our own faith maturity. I grew up in it. Ann bounced from one, and some pretty kooky religions, to the other. Nothing was stable. My environment was real simple. I got baptized, I got confirmed, I went to a Lutheran grade school, a Lutheran college. How straighter could it be? I had a little bit of rebellion though when I got out of college and it was like, ""Okay, the pressures aren't here anymore. Where do I take all of this?"" It didn't go anywhere. That kind of got recreated for me. A part of it was when we had kids. We didn't force Sunday school on them, but we were going to church fairly well in the time they were being brought up. We also went to different churches because I never had one here. I never have. I also struggled with the notion—and this is all of Christianity—that it's Jesus or it's no one. That message can be conveyed by certain churches to be completely exclusive and by other churches to allow some inclusivity of those who are heathens. I got over that hurdle during this addiction. I also got involved, pushing ten years, so it's about the same time we're dealing with addiction. 
The neighbor you can see back here is a very passionate Christian and a musician and involved with prison ministry and got me involved in a Monday night men's group. We went to a church in North Minneapolis for three years—we actually operated out of the Salvation Army Men's Center and that was okay until a new captain, or whatever you call the leader—we not only had to take our own breathalyzers every night, we had to sign statements about this and that. We were doing pat downs to come in there to go to Bible study. It was just crazy. Under the old management the men's center, which Spencer went to two different times, could hold a hundred and thirty-eight people. At the time we were in our Bible study and this new mission came in. They were routinely filling thirty-eight beds. They were excluding—for whatever reason I never understood—one hundred people. Our Bible study group divested itself of the Salvation Army and our group is called Freedom Works, which is a post-penal rehab with housing options for people. It is a Christian group. They go and recruit people while they're in prison. Somebody decides good candidate and bad candidate. They pick them up when they're released from prison and bring them to safe housing. I'd say the rate that they have is far better than the rate for most.
AS: Of recidivism you mean?
DJ: Their recidivism is like—I can't remember if it's a high number? Is that bad or is the... Their people sixty percent of the time are not going back to prison. Without a program like that that recidivism is the opposite. It's eight out of ten are going to wind up in the same spot. 
AS: You're doing this prison ministry. Are you doing this while your son is in active addiction?
DJ: It started right at the time when we had the first encounter, when Aidan was just born. That would have been 2009. Did I think that something like that would allow me to have an awareness of what prison and what prison recovery is like? No way. I did it because my neighbor badgered me for ten years to get more involved and do some volunteering. ""Don't be so damn selfish."" I go, ""John, the big problem is I got three or four night meetings a week. I don't need another night commitment. If you go and hold this Bible study on Saturday noon and we're not up at the cabin…"" They're all evening. 
I started going and then while Spencer was in Montana, he and Jamie moved to Montana a year after this first encounter. We could tell that while things were going well for six or eight months after his first rehab and he was working again and she was working. She was at a nursing home and wasn't happy with it. The nursing employment options in the Twin Cities in 2009 were awful. People were leaving. She went on the Internet and found a job in Wyoming and another one in Montana. I said, ""I've been out near Kalispell, that's a nice place. but you don't want to go to Wyoming. That is nothing more than a hillbilly, redneck, oil refinery town."" She interviewed them both and took the job in Montana. He was visibly using and the issue was whether she was going to let him come or not. By default, having a one-year-old at that time she let him come. 
He claims to me, and I don't have any reason not to believe him, that he was clean for nine months out there. Maybe it was because he didn't know a damn soul. He finally was advertising, he was putting flyers in mailboxes to do handyman jobs, snow plowing and whatever even though all he had was a shovel, no truck. Eventually he got a job with a landscaper out there and that's what got him in trouble. They said, ""You don't need Oxycontin. We've got heroin."" That's where it started, of all places, out in the middle of Montana. That would have been like 2010, something like that. Six or seven years ago. While heroin has always been prevalent in this market it's like it's out in Kalispell, Montana? That lasted about a year. Then she finally for the first time told us what was going on. He was stealing her stuff, pawning her stuff. I'm reimbursing her for the lawn mower and stuff like that. Little did I know at that time, relating back to this Freedom Works Bible study, what criminal activity was associated with drug use.
AS: Thank you for the soup, it's really good. Did you make it?
DJ: Yes, we had some turkey breast for the kids last week. I always keep the carcass of anything.
AS: Me too, and boil the heck out of it.
DJ: Split pea with ham and Aidan loves this. I love making soup. I'm drifting, point me, steer me.
AS: Let's talk about his last month or two, and then what's happened afterwards for you.
DJ: There was a period of time being on and off again with Suboxone. There's no housing for Suboxone. Nobody accepts it. 
AS: Or methadone.
DJ: You have these programs where hospitals are administering this and line you up with a doctor that can administer it, but insurance or whatever—you graduate, you're on the street and there's no safe, sober environment for people who are being medicated through the medical rehab community. I can't tell you how many philosophical arguments I had with people. ""Do you take Suboxone?"" ""No, no, no. We're an abstinence program. We can't have that influence here in our group."" I get off on a tangent. Why are people putting them on this and no one out there is tolerating it? One guy says, ""I've been in this business thirty years. We're an abstinence-based house. I can't change. You may have a valid issue."" I always would apologize to people. I'd get too furious. We'd have the names of forty places. We found two. Cornerstone in St. Paul and…
AS: New Way in Minneapolis will.
DJ: New Way, yes. There were two or three of the places right around 20th Street, South Minneapolis. I was thinking of Serenity Village. We're the only two sober homes. Then you had these other rehab/living places. I can't think of the names. Kim's daughter's been there. There's two or three of them. If you wanted a single-family house, inconspicuous where you can have rehab it's two places. In St. Paul if you're on Suboxone it was $980 a month. If you weren't on Suboxone it was $580 a month. They doubled the price plus they kept the Suboxone so you'd have to find a way to get from whichever living unit it was to their dispensary. I'm like, ""What is that teaching anybody in recovery? They're still in the hospital?"" Give me a break.
AS: And we don't trust you.
DJ: Part of our problem was having exhausted all the options. He got kicked out of Serenity Village. He got kicked out of Cornerstone in St. Paul.
AS: Because he relapsed?
DJ: Using. The last time at Serenity, by the way the owner of Serenity has relapsed twice—he's a meth user, probably crack too. They will let people come in if there's evidence of recovery and they're clean or whatever but the minute there's any kind of secondary behavior they're just like, ""I'm sorry you're not a good influence."" I don't blame anybody for that. I have no problem with that. 
However, the progression had taken place and we filed charges legally with the police, as did some others. We had mounting legal problems. When he got out of rehab two years ago there was no place to go. We finally said, ""If you're clean you do this."" We both agreed, it wasn't just me pushing Ann; we both agreed: what are the options? Send him to some other state that allows this and then he's not close to his son? His son was part of his rehab. We let him stay here. On a day when his son and his son's mother were coming over here and we were all going to go to the auto show or the boat show, we're like, ""Aren't you ready? We've got to go."" He was acting agitated and I go upstairs and the bathroom’s locked. I finally go get the little stick and push it open. He's hunched all over the floor and had shot up. Here it was five, six months. 
To this day, or up until he died, he maintained that he got overwhelmed because of his continued feelings for his ex. This remorse about how bad he felt and he had to use. I said, ""You know what? I believe that. That couldn't have been Johnny-on-the-spot because I don't keep heroin in my house. Somehow you had figured out in advance."" He's going, ""I had that hidden in the bathtub for longer than you think."" He did. He had this panel that ripped out underneath the whirlpool and he claims he could have used it two months earlier and he didn't. That day everything overwhelmed him and he couldn't deal with it. I have no reason to doubt that. I'm not an addict so I can't understand that. From what he has told me in his moments of sobriety and in moments of use. 
What I've seen in all these family programs and when I hear other recovery professionals talk about things all of that made sense to me. We think he was probably sober for another five months and then something fell apart in the fall. We were like, ""We're not tolerating this. We're not dealing with it."" It was benzos. That's when he got into this period of benzo use. He met a guy that was buying all this crap on the Internet. These were like elephant tranquilizers. I had a state patrol office say, ""You've got to come down here and get your son and move his car."" They didn't even incarcerate him. He couldn't even talk. I'm looking at this guy, “Like why didn't you remove him from the scene?” As a result, he was getting a bunch of warnings, repeated warnings that we're not unaware of.
AS: You were not aware of?
DJ: We were not aware of. Finally, he gets a notice. I just opened it. I violated every rule in the book. I just opened it and they revoked his license. You're going to have to go, too. It's a procedure where you have to have a medical person saying he was on these meds from his Suboxone doctor. He's blaming it all on this stuff. I'm like, ""No, there's something else out there."" His doctor confirmed that the stuff that he was using even if he tripled the dosage wouldn't make him drive that way. We found out in his police record that he had like five call-ins, people on the road, ""Hey, here's a license number. The guy's swerving all over the road."" He had five of these. They never found him. That's what was leading up to the Christmas before he passed away.
AS: A year ago.
DJ: We were frantic. We started the week before Christmas trying to find him a place. We thought, ""St. Joe's in St. Paul."" At the last minute the guy's going, ""We've got an insurance snafu. You can't do this,” or, “We can't do that."" We were just beside ourselves. We went through Christmas with him here. He came to Church with us and he was sound asleep the entire service. He had used before Church and used again Christmas Eve. We had all of Ann's family, twenty-five people here that night. He was just a mess. The odd thing—we were just oblivious to it. We were like, ""We're not going to let it ruin our party."" Ann's brother just was like, ""Why aren't you dealing with this?"" He got real ugly about it. Everybody else pretty much was like, ""That's what the disease is."" Her brother's not one that has any remotely liberal leaning thought in his bones. Something happens it's military and it's black and white: fix it. When Spencer died he came around a little bit. Political persuasion didn't, but I think he understood the seriousness of this disease. 
Leading up to all this we finally get him back into Fairview again. I go up to visit him. Ann said, ""I can't deal with it. I can't go up there."" I took Aidan twice I think. I was seeing him the evenings they had open. I cheated a couple of times and just went in until somebody kicked me out. Every Sunday for the family I would take Aidan there. He's like pumped up. He goes, ""I got the greatest counselor this time. They're like, ‘Get back across the street. Get yourself a degree in counseling and share these experiences. Help others.’"" Was this a ruse? Was it the ultimate in his ability for deception? I don't know. To see somebody so pumped up. 
We had housing at something called River's Edge, I don't know what it was. It's out of Burnsville, but they have a Minnetonka facility. We're on the way there and Spencer's calling them up and going, ""Well we're coming over. Where's the house at?"" They said to him, ""This is a lockdown facility."" We had no idea that where he had gotten located by one of his counselors was no cell phone, meds were regulated by the whatever, and in the first thirty days he had no visitation rights. I'm freaking out, too. He's going, ""Did you know this?"" We didn't show up. Then it took us a month to find Greg, where he died. 
AS: Greg's sober house.
DJ: Greg McFarland, New Heights Sober Living. The irony of that is he was connected to our church for the last six years that we were there. We had no idea that he was in this business. He's a former alcohol abuser. He said, ""I used every drug. Alcohol is probably my weakness."" That very last weekend then, Spencer earned his first overnight away from New Heights sober. All we think is turned this leaf, everything looked great from his attitude at Fairview. We had Aidan for the weekend. He came here. The two of them got to sleep together. He gets up Saturday morning and said, ""I missed the meeting at New Way on Thursday. We have a makeup day today. I need to go down there."" We're like, ""That's cool. We've got Aidan anyway. Are you coming back?"" ""I'm coming back, but I can't spend the night. I only got the one night."" We knew that. Sure enough he came back at three o'clock and then after dinner he went home. I'll tell you his complexion, everything, all the good signs that you want when you're seeing somebody in recovery. He wasn't broken out with all kinds of crap. He wasn't spooky and talking weird. All of those signs were gone and he spent that quality time with his son. 
We get the call the next day that he's dead. It was a mind blower. It was inconceivable and yet when you package it that's the hideousness of the disease. We learned, as did Nancy, that there was a ruse within that last month. He was in fact using and getting away with it. While he wasn't stealing from us, and apparently wasn't in trouble or stealing from somebody else, he had figured out probably from new contacts at Fairview, all the time he was there, plus probably hanging out with people who are in mandatory rehab at New Way. He nurtured some contacts and in the police report that we saw, the night that he acquired this stuff from the woman who's killed five people he was buying it from some woman in Bloomington. My feeling is he probably had one, two, or three of these relationships going on. He went and told us that he had saved some couple over at Walmart in North Minneapolis when in fact it was probably he was getting them this stuff. Maybe he could have helped them. I'm sure what was happening was he'd get four bags and he got to keep one or whatever. Somebody else was buying it. That was our last weekend with Spencer. 
How was your walk?
AP: I don't want to interrupt. I know you're recording. I want to send you a podcast that was especially made for today. I'll look it up, but you have to listen to the entire thing.
AS: I will. I don't skimp on podcasts. 
What do you want to tell me about where you are now and where you've been since he passed in your thinking and in your grief and your own recovery?
DJ: As I mentioned at the first Nar Anon meeting that I went to. Both of us. It was probably four weeks or five weeks after he died. Not knowing how to feel, not knowing how everybody else is going to react to you. Not knowing what possible contribution you have any more when you're the face of death. Your experience is the end. It's not what anybody who attends these meetings wants to go to. You sit and say, ""How do I contribute?"" Fortunately, Barbara had come and relayed her own personal experiences.
AS: Of losing her son.
DJ: And how positive things can be. Not necessarily how they were at that moment but how it can be and how it's helped her life. How she related all of that to Twelve-step and so forth. I found myself—that first night when it came for me to say something—saying, ""This is the ultimate letting go."" People in grief can't let go. I'm not saying I've done that, but I had my own personal spiritual experience, as you know, three days after he died that still provides all the clarity I need.
AS: Can you tell me about that? I've only heard little bits of it. What happened?
DJ: How detailed do you want me to get?
AS: As detailed as you want to get.
DJ: I know you said one thirty. 
AS: I've got ten more minutes or fifteen.
DJ: Without getting carried away. Our first night was with Ann's family. You're total zombies. Our second night Greg, the sober home owner, had talked to us the first night and said, ""I have a house meeting and this is a first for us, too. Could you possibly come down here and talk to us?"" We're like, ""You've got to be kidding."" Somehow Ann and Shelley and I all went down there and it was powerful. We're all just absolutely weeping. Nobody had done this. 
AS: Nobody had done what? 
DJ: Nobody had gone through this experience. They were there. They had eleven police vehicles, emergency vehicles blocking the whole street off. They put tape around the entire block. 
AS: Because he had just died there.
AP: The death investigation.
AS: But people were still living there.
DJ: Yes. Twenty people in this house. They've got some of them that were upstairs when it happened. Some that were outside. Some that weren't home at all or were coming back. They've got police tape everywhere. It was just this trauma. How do we talk about this? We go do that Monday night, Tuesday we see the pastor about our celebration. I'm in the back yard with Pee Wee and at that moment while she's peeing I had this feeling. The next day, I knew I had heard the words on Tuesday. ""I'm not alone, I'm finally home."" I couldn't see him but it's probably the Holy Spirit saying, ""He's with me."" It was the start of having confidence that his life was so horrible that now it's good. He needed to go. It's allowed me to accept losing my only son. Anyways that happens Tuesday night. 
Wednesday morning, the third day, I wake up and Ann and I weren't sleeping at all, four hours, three hours, wake up frequently and didn't go to bed until like 2:00. At 6:00 in the morning I'm like, ""Oh my God, I thought of a client."" I'm the only one that can do this and they had this scheduled public hearing. I hadn't done any of the work. I woke up and I went down and sat at my computer and thought, ""How am I going to do this?"" I didn't even get that client file open when this ""I'm not alone, I'm finally home"" comes back into my head. I picked up a piece of paper and in ten minutes that song was there. I still have the handwritten version. I just sat there. I probably sat there twenty, thirty minutes just thinking what happened? How did this happen? On the back of the paper I wrote, I was sitting here so I wouldn't forget what happened. If I had gone nuts or if something happened to me. I wrote it down. This took like ten minutes. Maybe an hour now has past by myself, sitting at my desk. It's light out at that time of the year. 
I'm chomping at the bit to share this with Ann. I go up there and she's sound asleep. I'm like, ""I can't wake her up. I'm not going to do that."" I went down and I sat in her easy chair. I never do that. I was just looking out the window and again not seeing anything I had my body or my mind filled with a spiritual experience, which was not specifically this, it wasn't specifically that. I wasn't seeing something; I wasn't hearing anything. There was an exhilaration. I mean like fireworks, but I'm not seeing them. My body is slowly getting pumped up. I'm not moving a muscle. Ann comes down there and we're used to seeing each other sitting in a chair, blind, looking out the window. She's going, ""Are you alright?"" I jump up and I'm going, ""This is beautiful!"" I'm going, ""No, no, no. I'm not some crazy Evangelical freak. I don't know what I'm saying."" I'm babbling. She's not buying this. She's not coming any closer. I just go, ""Go over and read that on my desk."" She went and saw the music and then she read this other thing. We're hugging each other and crying. 
Finally, she gets up to make coffee. Goes into the kitchen and I'm exhausted because now it's probably an hour and a half since I got up. I got down on my hands and knees. I was going to pray. I found myself walking. I had sandals on and I kicked them off and I laid there and I just started praying. I laid on my back and I started feeling the same thing I was feeling in the chair. I wasn't seeing lights; I wasn't hearing a thing. The ground wasn't moving at that time. I'm feeling this presence that is inexplicable. I'm like, ""Lord, I'm yours. I'm convinced. I'm not a doubting Thomas anymore. I'm yours. Take me."" Then I thought—because now I'm feeling physical movement in my body. I'm not levitating, but I'm feeling this. I'm like, ""You can't take me now. This will kill Ann."" I'm saying to God. I said, ""Okay."" These experiences were obviously physical to me. I'm probably racing to beat the band even though I don't recall a physical activity. My pulse rate was probably exploding. ""I'm yours. Take me. I'm joining you right now."" Then I said, ""No give me five minutes."" I called Ann and I said, ""Come in here."" She finds me laying on the floor. What did I say? ""Hold me.""
AP: You were saying, ""Feel this.""
DJ: I wanted like the movies where you see, ""Take this moonbeam"" and it shoots out of my finger into you. I'm holding her and she's like, ""What's going on here?"" I tried to explain that this was spiritual. It's not me. We probably laid there for five, ten minutes. She's like, ""I just have to figure this out."" She went back in the kitchen. I laid there and now this shaking was concerning me. ""I'm yours."" All of a sudden. I probably was doing breathing trying to tone myself down. Maybe I was there ten minutes and I rolled over on my side and slowly pushed myself up. I'm going, ""This is cool. My number wasn't up."" I walk into the kitchen and Ann looks at me like, ""Your face, you're tan, your bags are gone under your eyes."" I'm like, ""Let me tell you. I didn't tell you when you were hugging me, but I was crawling on the floor and I found myself kicking off my sandals like Moses in front of the burning bush."" She told me first about my face being tan before I said anything about Moses. If that isn't enough. 
I text the pastor. I'm going, ""You've got to find a little time for me. I had a pretty bizarre..."" He didn't answer me. That was Wednesday. Thursday I get a text back. He's going, ""I'm so sorry."" Wednesday they have a Wednesday night service. ""I'm doing a new sermon series and I was just struggling yesterday and can you come over?"" So I went over. I'm sitting down and I'm relaying all this to him. He's smiling and I'm thinking ""Oh my God. He's heard it. He's heard this fifty times. He's just going to pat me on the back and say 'Let's see how you're doing after the celebration.'"" Before I was finished with the story he goes over and he's got this enormous cupboard that's a dry erase board and he had his entire outline of this new seven-week series and it was referred to as ""A Call versus a Calling."" He says, ""I just wanted to tell you how I struggled all day yesterday coming up with the final content."" While I'm going through this is when he was trying to figure out what his final content would be for this series. He says, ""I never had a call. You've just had a call. You're one of the lucky ones. My call I was sitting on my ass."" He said that to me. ""I was sitting on my ass watching a football game eating a whole bag of potato chips and my high school Sunday school teacher calls me and says, 'Get off your fat ass and go to theology school.' I had a calling, but it wasn't a sexy call."" Here his whole thing is about call versus calling. ""I just got to tell you the timing of all of this is so remarkable because for the first time in my career as a minister I used an analogy from Hollywood."" There down here was call and next to it was Moses and the burning bush. [laughs]
In between that time Ann and I went back to Greg's to get Spencer's belongings. I told him of my experience and he said, ""What time did you go to bed last night?"" Ann says, ""Two o'clock."" He said, ""I woke up at two o'clock. I came down here and turned off a couple of lights. I just couldn't sleep.” I was sitting at my computer and I heard a door close. I got up and I looked over. This is an old B & B, so it's huge. Twenty people live there. He goes, “Then I hear the same thing. A door close, but nobody came down. I went back to my computer and just like you always feel somebody's eyes on the back of your head."" He turned around and he claims that he had a vision of Spencer and Spencer said, ""Hey, it's cool I was just checking on all my friends."" Pretty spooky. I have never had a vision of Spencer. I've had many Spencer moments. This takes the cake, that whole song. The whole time leading up to the celebration.
AS: You wrote a song? You wrote music? I wasn't there.
AP: Amy wasn't at the service. 
AS: I couldn't be there.
DJ: I'll print and e-mail you. I wrote this summary down, and then it has the song. 
AS: Could you take a picture of it and send it to me?
AP: Did I give you a copy of his memorial? I think I've got an extra.
AS: I don't think so.
DJ: When you say a picture.
AS: You had written it down, your handwriting.
DJ: Oh that one. That one I still have in a file somewhere. 
AS: If you can.
DJ: The song now, everything's packed up.
AS: Are you saying that a tune came to you?
DJ: Even the melody came to me. On my handwritten, again my father being a piano teacher I know what notes look like. I used to sing in the choir in the Lutheran school. I was trying to as this melody was coming to me and then I hummed it and even recorded myself and gave that to the pastor. The music director at our church was on vacation until the Thursday before the celebration. All she had were the written words and I actually sang a verse and the chorus. She nailed it. 
AS: That's so beautiful you guys. I never saw this.
AP: I thought I gave you a copy.
AS: If you did I'll return this. 
AP: I've got like five extra.
AS: Oh, my dear. 
DJ: I have a hard copy right here.
AP: You could just take a picture of it.
AS: Is this the song?
AP: Yes.
AS: I don't remember seeing this.
AP: Did you ever meet Spencer?
AS: I met Spencer very briefly at the first picnic that we had at St. Louis Park. 
AP: That's right.
AS: Aidan was there.
AP: That's right.
AS: Doreen's daughter talked to him, went outside with him and chatted with him. I think he was in some form of recovery. 
AP: Usually he'd relapse in the fall, Christmas time is what I want to think. I've got it all written down somewhere. That's what I've got on my list to do. To start this insurance. They're looking at the insurance. Then I thought that I should talk…
AS: Thank you, Dean, that was really very powerful. I appreciate it. 
DJ: Yesterday Jamie tells us about Aidan moving and she got all emotional. All I have to do is hear somebody whimper and I'm gone.
AP: He can never speak publicly. I mean you're a great public speaker.
AS: But with emotions.
DJ: It can't include emotions. I couldn't go to my own retirement party. Don't plan one. That got me going and then Ann says, ""Nancy wants to talk to you.""
AP: Nancy called yesterday. 
DJ: Talk about our experiences. Nancy and I talked for about forty-five minutes. We're both bawling. Then I had to go to a meeting last night. Then this, it gets me pumped up. 
AS: Thank you. 
DJ: It's positive. 
AS: I have to agree with that.
AP: It is very cathartic to talk. Have you talked to any other people who have lost their kids? 
AS: Yes.
AP: Is it helpful to them, too?
AS: Yes. I did. People in different stages of grief. I think that you two are the first people who I've talked to so quickly after. We talked in the beginning of July. It had only been two months, three months.
AP: That was right near his birthday. 
AS: You brought the pictures out. 
AP: I still haven't taken them out. 
AS: Sometime when we have a moment more. I have to go. I would like to talk with you about or just get your thoughts even in writing about this case with the dealer and these five people whose death she's being charged with. Your take on it. How you've processed it.
AP: I haven't.
AS: Kind of just if you have a moment and you're thinking about it and you just wanted to write it down for me. I feel like it's very controversial because there is this grey area. It's not the black and white. Even though the drugs are illegal and what they're doing is illegal what the addicts are doing is illegal, too. I'm just kind of interested in that grey area. 
AP: That's what's difficult. Especially—I'll put it in Aidan's perspective. Here we tell him that his dad died of a brain disease. Yet, somebody's being charged for his murder. 
DJ: Even outside of that perspective, his behavior is such that whether it was this woman or another he might have had three dealers. He voluntarily did this plus we were told from a victim advocate…
AP: I got the letter yesterday.
DJ: Having to go see therapists, losing work, or whatever. We get a letter back going, ""You're not eligible for this because your son did illegal activities."" The question you're posing is not a sensitive one to me. I'm in agreement with you. But I've gone beyond that. If I was forced to go to this trial I probably, whereas when you read some of the things from the other parents. They want to go in there with a gun and shoot her. I'd probably forgive her.
AP: I'd like to have the drug companies up there with her. 
AS: The oxy. 
AP: The therapist I'm seeing, I said, ""I just don't know how to deal with this. I don't feel anything towards her. But yet I want to represent how Spencer would feel and he'd want us to forgive her.""
DJ: I think so, too.
AS: Think about Dylan Roof who just went into that church and gunned down all those people and what was their response? We're going to forgive you.
DJ: And his was no remorse.
AP: And no remorse. She might choose to have that, too. It doesn't matter. Then we think well, maybe we shouldn't even participate at all in it.
DJ: I have no intention at all.
AS: Of going you mean? Participate how? They want you to testify?
AP: No, no, not testify but just go and hear what the trial is. I'd probably go more for interest or to read a victim's statement, which would be one of forgiveness for her.
AS: That would be powerful.
AP: Or ask why the drug companies aren't up there with her.
AS: Just get that in the record. That would be powerful. Has she been charged?
AP: She was supposed to go on trial two days ago, the 17th, but then the judge had a conflict so now it's rescheduled for the 20th of March. You're more than welcome to come with me. I don't want anybody making a political statement out of it.
DJ: I don't want the newspaper sitting there.
AP: All the other men that have died using her heroin have been named in the paper and Spencer hasn't. That's the way we want to keep it.
AS: For Aidan.
AP: I could care less for us, but for Aidan.
DJ: Maybe the silver lining is that he's moving to Kansas City and this won't hit the street until after that. 
AP: We haven't talked to the prosecuting attorney at all. She might plead guilty, or they'll come up with some settlement. What's scares me is that the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, this is political hay that he can make by getting somebody with five convictions against her. This other mother that's such an activist, I just don't want to talk to her.
DJ: If you consider somebody like Michael, relatively young person, early in the stage of recovery this would be devastating.
AS: Who is this?
AP: This woman, this family that lost their twenty-year-old son. He'd only been using about a year. They don't have the experience of dealing with the disease that we've had.
DJ: If they're ever viewing us and her at the same time the answers would be well we're like, ""Our son had absolutely no quality of life.” “Our son didn't have a chance to experience life."" When you ask that question and you think you've got five different individuals you’ve probably got at least two and maybe three different opinions on how they attack this. Part of my release, part of my letting go is not wanting anything to do with this. I don't need to read police reports anymore. I don't want the details. It's part of letting go because it can't possibly help me. It might hurt me. I'm not fearful of that. For Ann to want to pursue it, she's got to do it. I don't have any problem, but I don't want her to be dragged into my attitude and I don't want to be dragged into hers. The pastor made that clear. You're going to have totally different paths on how you do this. Let's just hope you can stay joined at the hip while you're going down these paths. You too Pee Wee.
AS: Pee Wee's the dog by the way. "

Duluth, Minnesota
Jeff Kazel-JK
Sara Ludewig-SL
Sam Aamot-SA
SA: First we'll have you state your name and tell us you give us permission to record this. 
JK: My name is Jeff Kazel, and you have permission to record the interview.
SL: We're at the Duluth Building for Public Safety. Today is May 19th, 2017. 
SA: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your childhood, or your background, before we get into the work you do here?
JK: Okay. I was born in New York and came out to Duluth when I was in Kindergarten. I grew up in Duluth. I ended up going to college here in Duluth. I joined the army—served in the army for a couple of years and then came back. I eventually got into law enforcement here.
SA: Did you go to college?
JK: Yeah. I went to College of St. Scholastica. 
SA: Do you want to talk about starting off in the Building of Public Safety? What you were doing right away when you got here?
JK: Well, we haven't always been here. This is the new building. We moved up here in 2012. We were downtown before. 
SL: Can you tell us about the OARS program? What it does, how it got started?
JK: I wasn't one of the founders, but I joined the OARS group in 2014 when I became the commander of the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force. The group was put together to look at ways of combating the issues we were experiencing with the opioid epidemic in this area. 
SA: Is the Lake Superior Task Force for a bigger area?
JK: Yeah. Our task force is now—we just merged with another task force in January of this year. Our area of operation is from all of St. Louis County, Carleton County, Lake County, and Douglas County in Superior [Wisconsin]. 
SA: Did you merge with that task force because you felt like that would better serve your mission?
JK: There were many different reasons. Some of it was grant funding and the criteria that task forces needed to continue to get funding. They were our northern partners and it was the right thing to do. Now that we're finding that our contacts with north and south St. Louis County are a lot--the fact that we did the merger was probably a really good thing. 
SA: What do you do on a typical day? What are you doing with OARS?
JK: With OARS we normally meet once a month. I'm part of the law enforcement and more of the proactive side of the OARS group. We deal with the enforcement side and trying to reduce the amount of drugs that are coming up to this area. We realize that just enforcement alone wasn't going to be enough. That was part of our reasoning to going to the OARS group and trying to look outside of the box, and more than just enforcement action. It comes down to economics. You guys have taken economics in college, I'm sure, and it's supply and demand. We deal with the supply and people that are sending the supply, but we never really looked at the other side of the equation—the demand. By going to OARS we brought in lots of partners that deal with the demand side. We talk about reducing—we have a pool of addiction here in this area, specifically this area. That's why we had so many people coming here to sell because they know that there're people that are going to buy. We talk about reducing the pool of addiction. Turning off the tap of people going into that pool. Getting into the schools and talking to young kids and say, ""Hey, do you really know what that pill does? And what could happen if you become addicted to it?"" The fact that a prescription for Oxycontin is no different than a [unclear] of heroin down the street. It's the same stuff. Getting that message out to reduce the tap—turning off the tap—of people going into the pool of addiction. 
But also taking people out of it. The people that are addicts that are overdosing continually throughout the year—looking for a way of getting those people out of the pool of addiction. If we reduce it at that end we are going to make it a less attractive area for people. 
SL: What year was OARS started in Duluth. 
JK: I'm not the person to ask. Like I said I didn't found it. I think it was like 2013, but I'm not sure. 
SL: When did you get involved with it?
JK: I got there in 2014. 
SL: Is there anything that has changed since you started in 2014 until now?
JK: I think we've morphed into—it used to be more informational, and partners getting together and saying, ""Hey, this is what we're seeing. This is what's happening."" When I got there that was great, good to have that information, but we realized that we needed more than just information. We needed to start moving on the demand side and reducing the demand. 
Myself and a few other members that joined the group really started working on getting the word out about what's going on. I started digging into the statistics specifically for this county. I think it was the 2015 report from the Minnesota Department of Health. That came out and I looked through it and I was like, ""Wow, this is—we know we have a problem, but I've never really been able to quantify what it is."" When that came it was like, okay, this is our issue. We are number one in mortality rate of opioid related mortality in the state. We've been number one or number two for the past five years. That right there says a lot. 
SA: Do you find that opioid addiction and the drugs coming in here—is that the largest problem in the area? I know you said the mortality rate is the highest, but does that influence a lot of issues?
JK: Yeah. When you're dealing with drugs—earlier I said it's economic—when there's big money involved and it's underground or black market you're going to have people willing to commit crimes to get money for this type of [unclear]. Yeah, it drives other forms of criminal elements in the area. 
SL: Is there anything that you wish people knew about OARS, or the opioid epidemic in the Duluth area?
JK: I think we are doing a good job of getting the information out. We have an awesome core of people that are willing to do presentations and talk with the media. We are working on a forum for the legislation to come to Duluth to talk about some of our problems. Looking on the legislative side some changes in the laws would help us out. The OARS group is more proactive. 
SA: What does it look like when you are dealing with the demand side and getting people out of the pool? 
JK: We're right in the middle of a grant process. We've applied for state grants and federal grants that are coming up later in the year. We're hoping to get it. The program that we proposed—let's say we've had an individual that's overdosed on the street and they call 911. We get a police response that shows up, and we have Narcan on our officers now. A lot of that was credited to OARS and the work that they did. But they give the person Narcan, and part of our protocol is that person goes to the hospital. So as it stands right now that person will be treated, stabilized, and most likely will just be released. And nothing really happens. What we're finding is that people are overdosing again. Sometimes it's the police that are giving them Narcan and it's multiple times. They're overdosing and [unclear] unresponsive. We looked at that and said, ""Yeah, that's just a loop that needs to be changed."" 
In 2014 they came up with the Good Samaritan Law, and it made it easier for people to call 911 and they can ask for help for someone who is overdosing, which is really—what they problem and the cost is it left a loophole in the law. We are no longer prosecuting people for a fifth degree amount of illegal substance like we were in the past. But, the good thing is that more people are calling. The bad thing is in the past we were prosecuting those people and they were getting into the system and the system was saying, ""Hey, you need to get into treatment."" Those people aren't getting that referral anymore. They're not getting that step into treatment, pushing them to get out of that pool of addiction. 
So we said, ""What can we do to go after that?"" We proposed a project coordinator where a patrol goes to an overdose and if they distribute Narcan to somebody who is an OD if not that same day then the next day we track down that person and say, ""Okay, we know you overdosed. Here are some of your options."" The sooner we can do it the better. Once that person is stabilized we say, ""Hey, we know that you're having issues. There are some things that you can do to get out of this state."" Having that person, having that direct contact with resources we've found has been very important. 
The other issue that we have is the wait. Say you have somebody that says, ""Yeah, I've got a problem and I want treatment."" You get a Rule 25 Assessment on the person. Well, you're looking at two to three weeks before they can get into treatment. What does that person do in two to three weeks?
SA: Change their mind. 
JK: They change their mind. Right, so the other part of the project with our chemical treatment plan is they want to have some extra beds for individuals that say, ""I want to go to treatment and I need help."" It's a safe place to get somebody that's ready to go away from the other ailments that are making them go back to the pool of addiction. So, you've got the two week, three week waiting period for the person [unclear] and get them to treatment. That's kind of the progression of that. That's between the police department, the county, the treatment facilities. They all come together at OARS and put this plan into play. 
SA: What would you say is the hardest part of your job in terms of working with these populations or this issue?
JK: I would say the hardest part is dealing with the individual on the street as far as for officers. And if we have a death. We've done many forums and we talk about the issues. And more and more of these forums we have family members of people who've passed show up and they'll hold signs up. We've brought several of them up to speak and to talk about what's been going on. It's really hard to look at a mom in the eyes and say, ""I'm sorry."" It's not an easy thing to say, ""I'm sorry that you lost you're kid because he wasn't aware that this was the risk he was taking when he did this."" For me that's the hardest part. 
SL: Would you talk more about the educational programs you're doing in schools and at these public fourms you've talked about? What do they look like?
JK: Yeah. We just sent some of our school resource officers to the new D.A.R.E. program. There was a lot of controversy about the old D.A.R.E. program, and there were some details that didn't work. This is the new program. They do have statistics that show that this is much better. We're doing a good job of getting the information to the kids. 
We do forums for just about anybody who asks for them. We do find that there are high school kids that will show up. They want to know. I guarantee you that you go to the high schools and junior high schools and you ask them about the pills in their mom and dad's medicine cabinents and getting them to understand that the pain pill that mom got for her knee surgery and the heroin that's being sold down on the street are the same thing--that's huge for a kid to [unclear].
SA: Do you find you travel around the area more or are you staying in Duluth?
JK: Well, with the new task force we're going all the way up to the Canadian border. We're traveling a lot. 
SA: Do you find you have a most vulnerable population? Maybe in the rural areas?
JK: I haven't really dug into that yet, but I'm sure there're probably some correlations with who's being [unclear]. But what I've seen is the movement is more of a younger crowd, which is really scary. A good example: we conducted a drug [unclear] operation where we arrested some people. A nineteen-year-old kid we ended up arresting for buying heroin. He talked to us and told us a little about what was going on, and what he said is that when he was seventeen he played high school football and got hurt—hurt his leg—and ended up having surgery. He was prescribed painkillers to get through the incident, and two years later after the pills dried up and he couldn't get them on the street he came over to this area and bought heroin to feed his addiction. Last winter, or last fall, a fifteen-year-old girl, high school cheerleader, we ended up arresting buying heroin. We actually stopped her right before she shot up. It's scary. 
SA: Any other stories you're comfortable sharing that have made an impact on you?
JK: Our task force has done an incredible job. Statistically we've doubled the number of search warrants than we've done in the years past. We're well above the numbers that we've had the past few years. They're really stepping up their game and handling the law enforcement side [unclear]. We're trying to make this the most hospitable place to conduct business. I think we've done a good job of doing that. That's kind of what [unclear] out there. 
SA: Are the arrests mostly people buying or selling?
JK: Selling. And that's the big thing. People get confused that, oh, we're just arresting people that are users. Sometimes they get caught in the mix when we do a search warrant on a house because there are people selling [unclear]. But our main focus are the people who are taking advantage of our pool of addiction. And that's what it is is pure greed. It's sickening because the people who are doing it are not—the majority of them are not using the product that they're selling. They're here to make money and take advantage of people. Here they double or triple the amount they would make anywhere else. 
SL: What sort of community organizations does OARS pair with? How does the police department work with other organizations in Duluth?
JK: We work with everybody. That's part of our mantra, I know. We're always looking to work with the community. When you have problems and you can bring more people to the table that have skin in the game it makes things a lot easier. This organization recognized that a long time ago. Bring partners to the table to go after the big problems. OARS—you've got an awesome relationship with St. Louis County Public Health and Human Services and the treatment facilities in these areas, the doctors—we've even got a dentist. The school pharmacy—I forget [unclear]. Anybody who really has skin in the game. When we find new people it's like, ""Hey, this is what we're working on. These are the proactive things we've done so far."" If we see something that's in that vein we invite them to the group and say, ""Hey, you'd be a perfect fit to bring what you bring to the table.""
SA: Because it does require everyone coming together and pooling those resources.
JK: Yeah. When you're dealing with a problem as complex as this one is you really need to get as many people as you can on deck. 
SA: What does a typical day look like for you?
JK: Like I said I'm a commander of a task force, so pretty much business for me is dealing with the arrests that we make, [unclear] the reports, evidence that's brought in, paying bills for all the different expenses that we incur to go out and enforce the laws, purchasing Narcan. We're running out of Narcan, so we actually solicited to a group that purchased Narcan for us in the past--there was a church that stepped up last year that donated fifteen hundred dollars for Narcan kits. They stepped up and did that so hopefully we can get through this summer until the grant comes in. I do a lot of presentations. Getting the word out to the public about what's going on [unclear]. Grant writing—that was, you know, as a police officer [laughs]. I do a little bit of everything. 
SA: Any other instances like the church giving those funds? Have you connected with churches? That's pretty incredible. 
JK: We haven't really. And that's an area probably we need to look in more. They came forward to us originally. They said, ""Hey, we'd like to do something for you."" I said, ""Hey, this is a need where you can definitely make a big impact."" They stepped up last November [unclear] and then again just recently [unclear]. It's incredible. 
SL: How would you say the opioid epidemic in the Duluth area compares to what is happening in the Twin Cities or southern, rural Minnesota? 
JK: Like I've said, the mortality rate here is high. We only have three percent of the whole population in the state and I think we account for eight or nine percent of all opioid deaths. Obviously there's an issue here. I haven't quite wrapped my finger around what that is. The community here is—we've got a large pool of addicted people. People that are out there that are selling the poison—it's spread through the different avenues of [unclear]. Once that's out there, once they know that I can sell the exact same thing in a big city and get four times the amount that's what they're doing. My whole goal is to look at it as an economical problem and do what we can and double down on what we can do for [unclear] but if we can slowly start moving people away from the pool of addiction the demand is not going to be there anymore. The risk of coming out here and getting arrested is just not going to be worth it for people. That's kind of how we look at it. 
SA: Anything else you'd like to add?
JK: We're really hopeful for the grant. A lot of good work has happened so far with OARS and our task force and other departments that we've met along the way, but there's still a lot of work to do. It's a work in progress. 
SL: I think that's all we have. Thank you so much. "

Chandra Kelvie-CK
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan and I am in a Starbucks in St. Louis Park with Chandra Kelvie. Do you give me permission to record this interview?
CK: Yes, I do. 
AS: Do you want to talk about where and when you were born? 
CK: I was born November 30, 1976 in Minneapolis. I want to say I was born at St. Mary’s, but I don’t think it exists anymore. I have a sister, but we don’t share the same dad. I have a brother and sister who we have the same mom but different dads. Then I have a brother who we have the same dad but different moms. 
AS: Are you the oldest?
CK: I am the youngest. 
AS: Where did you grow up?
CK: I grew up in South Minneapolis. My dad had a house on Fifteenth and Lake Street and my mom moved around a lot. I moved back and forth between them both until I got a little older and then I was with my dad. 
AS: What were the circumstances that led to you living with your dad?
CK: My dad just wanted me to have a stable place. I think my mom tried but it was just really hard with three kids. I felt that my dad could financially support me better than my mom. I don’t know if this will be in the book, but I have never confronted my mom about it, but her boyfriend was really mean to me. I was treated differently because I was biracial and my siblings weren’t. 
AS: What is your background?
CK: I am Hispanic. My dad was Hispanic. 
AS: Was he mean to you physically?
CK: Yeah. He would hang me out of a second story window by my feet and let me go and then catch me again. He would lock me in the porch and say I was sleeping with the porch monkeys. I didn’t know what any of that meant. I haven’t talked to my mom about it, whether she knew it was going on or not. I just feel like I’d rather not know because I am close with my mom now. I never told my dad because I was afraid he would hurt him because he was a violent person. 
AS: That’s a lot to hold onto. 
CK: My dad dated his first cousin for ten years. I had no idea. When I was young I just thought it was his girlfriend. I didn’t put the dynamics together until I was a little older. I just thought we were just going to family events. I didn’t know. 
AS: That is complicated. 
CK: It is a lot now that I’m older. It was always the, “Don’t talk about it” in our family type of thing. 
AS: On both sides?
CK: I’m not that close to my mom’s side of the family, but on my dad’s side for sure. We just don’t talk about it. Nobody talks about it. 
AS: How old were you when you moved in with your dad? You’re dad must have know things were going on that weren’t good. 
CK: I don’t know if he did. If he did know what was going on I really think he would be in jail. 
AS: Is that guy still around? Is he still with your mom?
CK: No. My mom met somebody when I was around ten and he’s a really good guy. I’ve never even heard him raise his voice. I think my mom drank a lot then, too. When I look back my dad was doing drugs back then and I just didn’t know the signs. I didn’t know what was going on. 
AS: When you were small. You have memory of that. So you moved in with your dad when?
CK: I went back and forth until we moved to Andover when I was around eleven. I would go to my mom’s and visit but I lived with my dad. 
AS: How was your middle school and high school time?
CK: It was fine. I was pregnant in middle school, so I had to leave middle school.
AS: Do you want to talk about that?
CK: Nobody ever talked to me about sex or anything so I had no idea what I was doing. I got pregnant the first time I had sex. I got pulled out of school to go to the Teen Parent program in Anoka. I went to school there. I should back up. My dad was livid, obviously, and he wanted me to give it up for adoption. I was young and scared and I didn’t know what to do. We went to this adoption agency and went through everything and met with families and stuff. When I talked to the doctor before I had her she said if I say that I don’t want to give her up in front of the nurses and the doctors my dad can’t make me do it. I did that. 
AS: She let you know about your power. 
CK: Yeah. I did that and it was rough. It was hard. 
AS: You got pregnant at fourteen then?
CK: Yeah. I think I was pregnant just when I turned fourteen and I had her when I was fifteen. 
AS: Talk about that a little more. What happened when she was born? What did you do?
CK: I got my own place. I got emancipated. 
AS: What happened in the hospital?
CK: I had her and right after I had her I looked at my dad and the nurse already knew I was going to do it. I just said, “I don’t want to give her up for adoption. I’m not okay with it.” He left and took her dad’s shoes. I don’t know why but for whatever reason. I stayed with him for a little bit and finished a little more schooling. She went to school with me because in the Teen Parent program you went to school and then you worked in the day care for an hour or an hour and a half a day and then you went to your other classes. All the girls in this school were pregnant and we all switched off. There were some other staff there too. 
AS: How many of you were there?
CK: I want to say there were maybe fifteen. 
AS: Did they come from one high school?
CK: No, it was from all over. 
AS: When was she born?
CK: March 27, 1992. I ended up getting my own apartment on Twenty-ninth and Lake Street and I went to South High School. My mom helped watch her while I worked two different jobs. At that age you could only work so many hours legally. 
AS: You worked and you went to school full-time and you have a newborn? 
CK: Yeah. I ended up not finishing school. I went back to finish school, but it was too hard. I had to support myself. 
AS: I can’t imagine. Did you ever get connected with WIC [Women, Infants, and Children Program] or any of those assistance programs?
CK: I was on WIC. She was allergic to formula and she had to have goat’s milk or something and I remember back then that it was twenty-eight dollars a can. I did end up getting on WIC. In my entire life I think I have been on welfare for six months. I was determined. Everybody told me my life was over. There was no encouragement there. None. My life was over instead of being like, “this will be a different path” and encouraging me. 
I remember being young I never felt stable because I was bounced around and back and forth so much. I didn’t want that for my kids. It made me feel like I never had a home really. I did get what’s called Homes Park Village. They are subsidized townhomes and I did end up moving there which helped me a lot. And then I met my youngest daughter’s dad and we ended up getting married and bought a house. We ended up getting divorced, but we were together for sixteen, seventeen years. 
AS: What did you do then? When did you go back to school?
CK: I think Ashley was two.
AS: That is your second daughter. What is your first daughter’s name?
CK: My first daughter is Ashley and my second daughter is Asia. When Ashley was two I ended up going to get my GED and then went to Lakewind Dental Academy, which was on Lake Street at the time near Lake Calhoun. I went there to get my dental assisting license. I didn’t like it. I finished all the bookwork and paperwork and I opened someone’s mouth and I couldn’t do it. I ended up getting a job where they made dentures and stuff and I worked there for a few years. I ended up getting my job at Regis and I have been there for fifteen years. I work in the corporate office. 
AS: What do you do?
CK: I am an education coordinator. I work for the Super Cuts brand. There is an umbrella, so we own ninety percent of the hair industry. Super Cuts is mainly franchise owned, so I work with the franchisees. Before a stylist can get on the floor they go through a weeklong training so I schedule those. 
AS: Do you have another job?
CK: I do I work at Abbott [Northwestern Hospital]. 
AS: What do you do there?
CK: I schedule the nurses. You schedule the hospital every four hours so you have to get the floor staffed every four hours based on their needs. You have the scheduled staff, but people call in. 
AS: Are you full time?
CK: I am a point seven. 
AS: How much do you work for Regis?
CK: I work for Regis full time. 
AS: So you basically have two full time jobs. 
CK: Yes. 
AS: You have worked hard your whole life. 
CK: When I got divorced was when I had to pick up the other job because I couldn’t make it without it. 
AS: When did you notice your dad’s addiction issues?
CK: I noticed my dad’s addiction issues before Ashley was born. Probably around when I was twelve. He would walk around the house like a zombie. I didn’t know exactly what was going on but then I realized it because he would send me to go get his drugs because he couldn’t drive high. We lived in Andover and I would drive. I think I was about thirteen or fourteen then. Go to the houses and get his drugs and then bring him home. I did it because I was scared. 
AS: How long of a drive?
CK: To Minneapolis from Andover. I don’t know if you know where that is. 
AS: Where did you go in Minneapolis?
CK: Do you know where the Sears Tower is? It was right there. 
AS: You drove in your dad’s car to get him drugs. They just knew you were coming?
CK: Yes. I remember being so scared when I would walk in the halls. We would get it and it looked like a can of hairspray or something. We would unscrew the bottom of it. 
AS: And you would hand over the cash?
CK: Yeah. I never looked in it. It was like a little envelope and one time I did look in it because I was curious. 
AS: What was it?
CK: That time it was white.
AS: It was heroin? Was that his main thing?
CK: Yes it was, but he would get high off anything if he couldn’t get that. 
AS: How many times do you remember going for him?
CK: Through the years, several. I don’t even remember. 
AS: It was frequent though. It wasn’t just one time.
CK: Yeah. Eventually I ended up getting my license so I could drive and then I felt like I had to do it because what if he got in an accident or hurt somebody? You know what I mean? In my head it was like I was doing the right thing
AS: Even though you could have gotten in terrible trouble. 
CK: Yeah. None of that crossed my mind. Never. It never crossed my mind because I guess I never thought that the cops could raid this place or the cops could--none of that ever crossed my mind at the time. 
AS: Where are your older siblings at this point? Do you have contact with them?
CK: Yeah, but they were completely separate with my dad. They were with my mom. 
AS: All your other siblings are not his children? You're his only child?
CK: My brother. My brother was with his mom and he has addiction problems, too. He was never raised by my dad has seen him, but not a lot through his life. 
AS: So your main priority was protecting your dad and other people from him getting in a car?
CK: I think in my mind honestly it was more protecting him than anybody else. Yeah. Then I remember I moved back home. I got my place until fifteen and I moved back home when I was--he moved because he was living in a woman and he moved into a trailer and I think I was there for about a year. 
AS: You lived in the trailer with him and your baby?
CK: Yes. I would just stay there because I was scared he was going to die. I was so young. I was scared he was going to overdose and be by himself. And so I stayed, I would watch him--the minute I would even talk to him on the phone I would know he was high. I knew instantly. Then I remember I tried to commit suicide once. I just wanted him to wake up. I didn't really want to hurt myself, but I just wanted him to see he was hurting me, and I didn't understand why I wasn't more important than this drug. He came to the hospital.
AS: Where did you try to do that? Do you mind talking about it?
CK: No, I don't mind. We lived in Oakdale at the time when he moved into the trailer park. It was called Glandfall. 
AS: You did that where you were living with him? What happened? Did you take something?
CK: I took these pills called trazodone. I took like twenty of them. 
AS: Which he had?
CK: I don't remember how--I don't remember where they came from, but I remember taking them. My girlfriend knew something was wrong and she called the police and they pumped my stomach. Now when I'm older I think, ""Why didn't social services step in at any point?"" They had to have known he was high when he came to the hospital. 
AS: You were fifteen?
CK: No, I was probably—I have to remember because the way I deal with things is I just don't think about it. I had to have been sixteen. 
AS: Because you had had that year and then you moved back with him. Do you remember ever talking about what was upsetting you?
CK: I was very--yeah and he would say he wants to clean; he wants to do better. He went to treatment several times and every time he would get out he would relapse. 
AS: Was he ever on medically assisted treatment that you knew of? Was he ever on methadone?
CK: Not that I know of. He tried to hide it for so long because he was a Minneapolis firefighter. 
AS: Can you talk about his life? What you know about your dad's life and his parents?
CK: I know that my grandpa was very abusive to him. 
AS: Where did your dad grow up?
CK: In north Minneapolis, I believe. He used to tell me about stories of how my grandpa would kind of shave his head, physically abusive to him. My grandma—the Mexican side lost custody of him so my grandpa Jack—I think it was boiled down to who had more money. 
AS: Was grandpa Jack white?
CK: Yeah. So they had more money, so my grandma Margaret ended up raising my dad. It was Jack's mom. She was my great grandma. I loved her. She was my grandma. My dad was her favorite, and she knew my dad was sick. She always used to tell me, ""He's sick."" 
AS: When you were little?
CK: When I was older. 
AS: So she seemed to have some compassion with that. 
CK: Yeah. 
AS: Did you ever know your grandma on the Mexican side?
CK: I did. I did but when he was dating his cousin she wouldn't—I didn't get why we would never go over there. We would see her at Christmas or when they would all get together, but it would never be where I would go over there and visit with her. I didn't understand until I was older why—that she didn't agree with it. 
AS: She had a point. [laughs]
CK: She did. [laughs] 
AS: What else do you know about your dad's life? His career? His schooling?
CK: He didn't finish school. I remember when he passed away I tried to get his school records 
because I was curious and he didn't make it out of elementary school. When he started in the fire department he was grandfathered in, and my grandmother was able to read the test to him because he couldn't read or write. I remember he would be able to take tests home and I would read them to him and he would answer the questions. I mean he could do basics, but he really couldn't spell. 
AS: He missed out on a lot of school.
CK: Yeah. He was very lucky to get the job with the city. I believe my grandma Margaret told me she took his GED test for him. I don't know how. Back in the day it must not have been how it is now. I have no idea. 
AS: So he did get a GED?
CK: Yeah, but she took the test for him. I don't know how—I've always wondered, ""How'd you do that?"" Did they let him take it home? I don't know. I would be curious. It was so long ago who knows how it was. 
AS: This would have been in the seventies? Do you know when he started working in the fire department?
CK: I don't know the year, but I know he was there for seventeen years. I think he passed away probably four years—I can't even, I don't even know the time frame after he retired early. 
AS: How old were you when he was retired early?
CK: I was in my twenties, maybe thirties. No, I was in my late twenties. 
AS: Can you talk about your life once you got a little older and you started—
CK: I didn't let my kids see him. I just didn't want them to have to see what I would have to see. I would get calls from him like, ""I'm hungry,"" or ""Can you come get me?"" and I would always go. I would leave the kids with my husband and I would go and I would always help and it took me a long time to realize I'm not helping him. I'm not. I'm enabling him. 
AS: Because you would get him food and bring him what he needs. 
CK: Yeah. And then someone was like, ""That just gives him to use his money for drugs because he knows you're going to bring that stuff to him."" I think when I finally moved out of the trailer is I took a nap in his bed and I woke up and there was a needle sticking in my leg. I had to get tested for everything for seven years. I don't know if it was, I can't remember—he used to, I don't know if there was anything in the needle at the time. Probably not. There wasn't anything left over. [laughs] 
AS: And that was it for you?
CK: Yeah, I was done. 
AS: And you were eighteen or so?
CK: I was probably seventeen. Sixteen, seventeen. 
AS: So that lasted about a year?
CK: Yeah, and I just thought, ""I can't do this."" You know? It was just—it was every time he called I would be like, ""What now?"" It was never a happy feeling when he would call. 
AS: Your whole life pretty much. 
CK: Yeah. He was in another jail. 
AS: And he would be able to go back to his job?
CK: I guess this was after he—I don't know when he—I'm serious I just completely...After he got let go was when he was in and out of jail. I believe when he was working a few years before he was let go they did raid the fire department and found stuff in his locker. I think it is actually online because I remember printing it and reading it. 
AS: So for you this is like putting piece together about what you experienced, but you never had all the information. 
CK: Just when I look back now at all of the weird stuff that would happen would make sense. I knew very young he was using. And I didn't—until my twenties was when I realized this is how he was going to die. I remember when I got the call when he—he had a drug induced stroke because he would shoot up and he had a stroke in his brain stem. A week, maybe a week and a half prior to that he had this terrible headache where he was—he had never called me like he was in pain and I took him to Region's hospital in St. Paul and they were like, ""We're just going to give him some—it was either Percocet or Vicodin—two of them because he was labeled as a seeker is what they called him. I was like, ""Are you going to do any cat scans or anything? Are you going to do anything?"" And they didn't because they just looked at him as a drug user. 
AS: What was going on in his brain? 
CK: He was having many strokes because basically the nerves in his brain were misfiring and that was what was causing the headaches, but he was shooting up and he had MRSA [methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus] and it went into his blood stream and somehow in his brain—before that he was hallucinating, he would start hallucinating. I donated his brain to science, the coroner asked me to, but then when I got to the hospital when he had the big stroke he was coherent and he was like, ""Do you know her?"" And he was like, I mean, he couldn't talk. He lay down and that was the last time he was conscious because he had it in his main brain stem. He was alive for three days before they took him off life support. They said he was never going to—and he has told me he doesn't want to live like that. 
AS: Can you talk and unpack that story a little more about the treatment at the hospital when you took him for the headache? 
CK: I was angry. I called them after he died. I called the patient representative and I told him, I said, ""I feel like..."" I don't know if anything could have been done, but I feel like he wasn't treated fairly because he was a drug addict, and it's crazy because I remember calling the hospital and being like, ""Someone needs to help him. He is not capable of taking care of himself. He's hurting himself, he's hallucinating,"" and they were like, ""There's nothing we can do unless he walks in here on his own."" 
AS: This was before?
CK: This was way before this incident happened, but I would remember being so frustrated. No one would help and he is an adult, you can't make him get help. I just wanted—he was hurting himself. I remember thinking, ""This is ridiculous. He is hurting himself."" I remember in the hospital when he died I had to sign a waiver because they had to put him in this machine—it's like a big tube—because they wanted to see what was going on in his brain. 
AS: After he died?
CK: No, this is before. This was like the first day. The MRI thing. I had to sign a waiver because he was an addict. They put tape on his arms right here and right here. When he went in all the needles that were broken in his arms and his hands burned up to the surface of his skin. Because it is a giant magnet. They knew—I didn't know that was going to happen, but they knew. I'm assuming they had seen it before, but they made me sign a waiver that if there's any metal in his body—that explains why they put tape on his arms and his hands. I felt guilty. I felt guilty for a long time because I remember when I got the call I was like, thought to myself, ""Let this be it. Let this be the end.""
AS: I can't imagine thinking anything else after what you had been through. 
CK: Yeah. Because he had been hallucinating so bad up to that point. He was at my uncle's at Stacy, Minnesota and he broke into a fire house. Out there they don't stay in there. When there's a call they go. He stole the fire truck and went to my uncle's with full lights, everything. It is a funny story because I can't imagine what my uncle was going through, but he had the full lights on and walked in there fully geared up and put a flash light in my uncle's face and said, ""There's a bomb in the house."" He thought people were—the CIA was following him. He really was hallucinating. 
AS: And even at this point that's not grounds for mental health—
CK: No, they wouldn't help. Not if he doesn't walk in there on his own. I think that was a couple, maybe six months before he died. 
AS: Was he using meth do you think?
CK: No, he was using cocaine and heroin. He was doing speedballs. There were always burnt spoons and cotton balls. Alcohol—I didn't know what the alcohol was for. 
AS: When we talked on the phone I think you talked about what it was like walking into his place.
CK: After he passed away. It was sad because he didn't have much. He was an addict so he—
AS: Had you been there recently? 
CK: I had been there a couple of times. He was at a house—he rented a duplex and he rented the top floor to I think he was a former captain of the fire department, Larry. He rented it from Larry and I think Larry felt bad for him and knew he had some issues. It was hard because I had to warn people and be like, ""You can't just dig around and go in pockets and lift things up because there's going to be needles."" He would hide them everywhere and I think when he was high he would hide them or put them places and forget where they were. Used ones. That's when I found out about the needle exchange. I didn't know what to do with them. I was like, ""I can't just throw these out,"" because I knew he had hepatitis. I was like, ""I don't feel right because what if someone gets stuck with these, what if..."" I don't know. I didn't know. 
AS: So after he passed you collected them all?
CK: Yeah. I called the hospital and they're the ones that told me about the needle exchange. Access Works. I think it's on Nicollet. It's almost downtown and you would never know it was there. I remember walking in and there were couches and there were people sitting on there, and I remember walking in and bursting into tears. I just did not know—I had no idea what I was—it just was really sad to me. The people that were there were getting clean needles. And I just thought, you know, it just broke my heart. 
AS: Because your dad didn't overdose?
CK: No, no. He died of his drug complications due to his drug abuse. 
AS: How were they with you? What happened?
CK: I didn't stick around. I do remember that she asked me if I was okay. I just said, ""Yes, I'm okay."" I just explained that these were used needles and they were my dad's. She was like, ""Do you need to talk to anybody?"" And I just wanted to get out of there and I just wanted to leave. It wasn't a scary place. It wasn't anything like that. It just—I just didn't know this type of stuff existed.
AS: And your dad didn't either. 
CK: I don't know where he would get his needles. I don't know how. I never figured that out. How he would get access to them. 
AS: Did you ever go through his cell phone?
CK: Did he have a cell phone? Yeah, he did. I never went through his stuff because at that point he was just gone. I remember when I was younger though he was a good dad when he was sober. I remember being on the boat. Those were the happiest times when he was sober. I always think about those times. 
AS: There was a nice picture, I think he was on a boat. Did you pick that out? For his obituary.
CK: Yeah. 
AS: Do you remember the story about him delivering the baby?
CK: I do when they talked about it at the—because the fire department came to the funeral. 
AS: Because he got some kind of award?
CK: Yeah, but he was also in the Star Tribune. He rescued a young girl from a fire. I always thought it would be really cool to see her. [laughs] You have to be an EMT for a little bit before you're a fire fighter. She went into labor and he delivered the baby in the ambulance.
AS: So he had EMT training?
CK: Yeah, and he couldn't read. It was just weird to me. 
AS: You think of all those things as being literacy dependent, and yet, if you can retain stuff—
CK: And that's how he was. He had been doing that for a long time. He could fix anything. He was a roofer for a while. That was his side thing. He would roof for Donner Construction. He could make anything, fix anything. 
AS: He was let go of the fire department because of his drug use? Had they worked with him in 
the past to get him to treatmen?
CK: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know exactly what they did. I don't know how many times they actually put him into treatment because it was never discussed with me. He would never tell me—
AS: Would he go away?
CK: No, it was always outpatient. He was at inpatient at Unity for—this was towards the end after he had lost his job. He worked with the fire department for so long that they retired him early so that it didn't look like anything so he got half of his pension. They did try to help him. 
AS: And there was a point where—did he show up to work high?
CK: You know, I don't know if he did that. I think he would just get randomly tested. When you are a fire fighter you work one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off, then you got ten days off. Then you would work one day on, one day off. So, I mean you had a lot of time off. They would work twenty-four hour shifts, so he would work one twenty-four hour shift and then have twenty-four hours off. I remember when they came to the funeral one guy spoke and he said that my dad was always the first one in and the last one out. 
AS: He was brave. Kind of fearless.
CK: Or it was the adrenaline rush, or I don't know. When they said that I was like, ""Was that what he..."" And he told me about the first time he tried heroin. He said it was a high that he never had had before. He said he never got high like that after, no matter how high he would get it was never like that first time. 
AS: That memory of the first time. Wow. Yeah I've heard that.
CK: Yeah. Have you?
AS: Yeah, people describe it as this incredible hug, just this incredible warmth. A feeling of complete peace and calm. No worries, no nothing. 
CK: I've always been too scared.
AS: Yeah, so talk about that. Your own relationship with it, with substances. 
CK: I just think I was too scared because I had seen him so many years hurt himself. What he would go through—I just was scared to try anything, anything. Even this I wouldn't take pain pills for. And they did try to give them to me. I was like, ""No thank you."" It's just that—because my sister struggles with—she's had some addiction problems with pain pills. I've seen it. I've seen plenty of friends that I've grown up, went to school with, have issues with it. It's just insane to me how many people have issues with it. There are a lot of people. That's considered fun for them to take pills. 
AS: What about shooting heroin? Do you know people who do that or would admit to it?
CK: I don't know people that would admit to it, no. I know that they've done it, not—
AS: How old are you?
CK: I'm forty. 
AS: Is your sister older?
CK: My sister is forty-two. 
AS: That's mostly pills that you hear about?
CK: The heroin is more—they call it recreational. They don't do it all the time apparently. To me 
there's no such thing. My dad used to say that when he first—he said he did it recreationally or did it to party. 
AS: And then he couldn't control it. So do you drink socially?
CK: I do. I'll drink wine, but I feel like—
AS: Was your mom an alcoholic?
CK: She was. She hasn't drank in—probably since Ashley was young because she's a juvenile diabetic, too, and it made her very sick and she had to take her health—she had to change. 
AS: And she was able to do that. 
CK: She just stopped, but she would drink a lot I remember. It was like her and my aunts would get together and they would party. That's just what they did, I don't know. But it was a lot of drinking. That's where I don't know if her judgment was very good when she was dating the guy she was dating. I don't know. 
AS: How about your girls? What are they like? When you look back on yourself as a mom?
CK: This is what my oldest tells me now—that I was way too strict on her, and I was. I was. I was really scared. I'm a little more lenient with my second one, but with my first it's always like, ""Well why does she get to do that? I couldn't do that when I was young."" It's always like that. But then I realized that I had to let her, my youngest, because I feel like my oldest was like, I feel like I sheltered her too much. She's very smart. She got a full, four year scholarship to the University of Madison, which was only one of ten girls. She didn't end up going. She went every summer, but she ended up going to school here because she had a baby at eighteen, which I thought I was dying when I heard because it was like, I tried to—I told them all how rough it was, I thought I was open. 
AS: Did they know about sex?
CK: Oh yeah. I mean it was probably too much. They were probably like, ""Just stop talking."" My youngest is strong willed, I'll say. She's twenty-five and eighteen. She'll be nineteen in June. 
AS: Did she finish college? 
CK: Yeah, she works at the University of Minnesota. I'm not quite sure what she does there, but she just enrolled back into school. 
AS: And you have a granddaughter or a grandson?
CK: I have both. I have a granddaughter and a grandson. My grandson is seven months old. My youngest graduated. I was a little nervous about that one. From high school. It was a tough road to get there. Not that she was just—mouthy. She just was very defiant. When I separated from her dad was when she really got—but she's starting to turn around. She just got a job at Wells Fargo. She's going to enroll in MCTC [Minneapolis Community and Technical College]. I don't care what she does, just something. 
AS: Had they had substance abuse issues?
CK: Nope. I was open with them when they got older why they didn't have a relationship with my dad. I did let them know why. They don't know specifics as far as the stuff I've been through—they know some of it, but I just didn't want them to have to know their grandpa that way. 
AS: So it was just better to not know him.
CK: I think so just because at the end it was so bad. 
AS: They were pretty young because he died eight years ago?
CK: Has it been that long? Wow. It doesn't even seem that long. It was May. I think you're right, and I can't believe it's been that many years. I just put it so far in the back of my mind. It's probably not healthy to do that, but it just helps me because I don't want to sit and think about how he lived. 
AS: The thing is too when we're ready, when we're strong enough, or motivated enough, something sparks it, then we do. Some of us do. 
CK: I just think it was so hard because I looked up to him. He was a fire fighter, he was my dad, he protected me. I was a daddy's girl. I just didn't understand why wasn't I more important than that. Why can't you see you're hurting me? And that was really hard. 
AS: And that's nearly impossible. Do you know that now?
CK: I do. I do. 
AS: You know it intellectually, but you still feel that sadness.
CK: Yeah. Because you know he would steal from me. He would steal from everybody. It got that bad. 
AS: In these last four years?
CK: Yeah. 
AS: So as soon as he was retired there was nothing else for him?
CK: There was nothing. He tried a little bit. I can't remember how many times he went into treatment, but he would be good for a little bit, and then he would fall back. Then he would try to sober up a little bit. It didn't ever last very long. 
AS: There's no long period that you remember of months and months?
CK: No. And I always wondered—he would get arrested and get out. I don't think he was ever caught with it, it was just paraphernalia. It would never be on him, like drugs. But I guess it's because he would do them. 
AS: He would get off?
CK: Yeah. 
AS: Because do you think they knew him as a firefighter?
CK: I don't know. I just think there was never any—he had paraphernalia on him and that was it. He would get off on it. He would do it again a few months later. Don't they like arrest people for being high and driving? I guess I never thought about the fire fighter thing. 
AS: Oh yeah. I know people who have been arrested just sitting in their car not even driving. 
CK: That's crazy.
AS: And kids who have gotten off when they have crashed on the side of the road. It seems pretty random who gets busted and who doesn't. 
CK: I guess I never thought about that. I would just be like I don't know if it's because he was a user and that's why he would get out and say he would go to treatment. I don't know. 
AS: Have you ever requested any of his records?
CK: I could get them, I haven't ever. No, no. I remember after he died the bill collectors—I'll never forget T-Mobile. [laughter] 
AS: So he did have a cell phone!
CK: Yes! He did have a flip phone at the end. He did, but it was like they would call non-stop and I'd be like, ""He's dead."" And this would be a year later. And they were like, ""There's no way to take him off this collection."" And I was like, ""You're not getting your money. He is deceased. Do you need me to send you something?"" They were like, ""It's not going to stop."" I just thought, ""How insensitive."" For a year I got those calls. Then I remember my grandma thought—my grandma was really selfish. His mom. His mom who didn't raise him. I haven't—I've seen her maybe three times since the funeral because it was so—she made me pay her back for the flowers she put on his grave. 
AS: Because you were the beneficiary—
CK: Of nothing! [laughter] I mean I don't know why people thought I was going to get this big payout because I knew he didn't have any money left. I was his beneficiary. He had, I remember the fire department called me and he had I think it was fifteen hundred dollars, and I said, ""Can you send it to the funeral home to help pay for that."" That was the great inheritance she thought I got. I really think she did. When we got the cards and everything she made me open them in front of her and the people that gave me money—I had to give her half. I specifically remember a check for six hundred dollars and she was like, ""Now you know you wouldn't get this unless it was for me because these are people I know."" And I was like, ""So what are you saying?"" And my girls were sitting there. I just thought, ""You know, you'll have to answer to someone else bigger than me someday for what you're doing,"" in my mind and I gave it to her. I think I had to give my grandma over a thousand dollars for food and stuff she had contributed to the funeral. And that was really hard. I just don't know how to forgive it. I know people are like, ""You have to forgive."" And I don't know if I have that in me. 
AS: Is she impoverished?
CK: No. She lives in Shorewood.
AS: She didn't raise him? She's the one that lost custody?
CK: No. Yeah. My grandma Margaret raised him. I didn't even have enough money to pay for his urn. They let me make payments until I was able to pay it off, and I never—I just really have never had a relationship with her like that. After the first cousin thing and I got older we had a relationship, but it was more like Christmas and holidays. After that I cut it because I feel like my other cousin she would have never done that to ever. When it's your grandma—I think about that with my grandkids. How can you feel okay with that? How can you feel like you are going to benefit from this somehow? I don't know. It was really hard. I know the family is like, ""Well, that's your grandma."" My aunt, my dad's sister is like, ""I don't think she's malicious in what she does."" I really think she is. I really think she knows what she's doing. 
AS: It's hard to imagine a grandma being malicious, right, we don't want to think about the consequences of that. 
CK: I really just feel like it was really heartless. I feel like, ""You don't really care what I was going through."" I'm sorry, just random things are coming to me. I remember my uncle had given my dad an air compressor and my dad had pawned it and it was in the pawnshop. My grandma——this is not even two days after my dad, after the funeral she's like, ""Well, he pawned his compressor,"" and I'm like, ""Grandma, I can't go get it, it's in his name."" I had to call a police officer; I had to do all these things to get this air compressor because I was trying to do the right thing. My dad pawned it, who shouldn't have pawned it, I understand that. So, I went to get this air compressor and it was just a source of contention for me. It sat in my garage for over a year, and I was like, ""You hounded me about this."" They never picked it up, so I donated it when I moved. I was like, ""It was that important to you,"" and I felt bad. I felt like, you know, this was my dad who did this stuff. I'm trying to just do something right; try to make it right somehow. I just was like, ""You can't even let me mourn my dad without—I know how my dad was. I know what he did wrong."" I just was trying to do the right thing, and then for it to sit in my garage for a year? I would get so mad every time I would see it. 
AS: Where do you think you got your moral compass? Your sense of wanting to do right? You said there were things you loved about your dad. 
CK: I remember there were times where—I don't know where I got it because when I was young I would watch my dad beat up his girlfriend really bad, and I remember thinking, ""I'm never going to let someone do that to me."" I remember that. I don't know where I got it. I don't know. I don't know if it was just—I just remember I never liked the way I felt as a young child. The situations I was in I always just felt scared or uncomfortable, you know. 
AS: Do you feel better today?
CK: I do because I know it's me who I'm responsible for and my kids and I don't have to rely on someone else to take care of me. That's a good question. I guess I don't know. I think working around good people—I really learned a lot from the people I work with. There are three women who I work with who have all been there the same amount of time. 
AS: Did you have good support from friends when your dad passed away? Do you have a support system?
CK: I don't. I don't really, so I've always just—I think that's one thing I could do better with my kids because when they're having a hard time I'm like, ""You've got to just pick up. You don't have time to feel sad about this."" And I do find myself doing that because I was like that. I remember when my dad died my ex-husband was like, ""You've got to just pick up and keep going,"" and I remember that was probably the beginning of the end with him. He just would not let me mourn. I didn't have time—not that I would have ever fallen apart, but just can people around me just give me a moment to do nothing and just sit? And it was never like that, so now I see that I do that with my kids and I try to correct myself, but I do see that in myself, like, ""No one is going to do this for you."" Kind of a little insensitive I think, I mean, honestly that's how I feel. I know and I see it in me, and I try. 
AS: It might read as insensitive, but it seems like you had to do it for survival to keep yourself going because a lot of bad things could have happened to you. You could be not the person that 
you are right now sitting in front of me. Do you know what I mean?
CK: I do. It takes—you can go one way or the other, and I remember thinking that as a small kid: I'm not going to live like this when I'm older. This is not how I'm going to live. I'm not perfect.
AS: That came from inside you.
CK: Yeah. Like I said I'm not perfect, I just knew I wanted a stable place to live, I wanted a family, I wanted to just try to be normal whatever that means. 
AS: Do you ever talk to your mom about your dad? You said you guys are close.
CK: We are. We have talked, yeah. He was abusive to her, too, physically. They were never together though, they were separated when I was a baby, so I've never seen them in the same room except for a courtroom. I remember when we were going to court for custody with my mom and my dad. 
AS: Over you? You were there?
CK: Yeah. My dad—I remember we lived in these apartments, I don't know how old I was, I can't remember, I was really young. I don't remember the circumstances, but I remember my dad grabbing me and running, running down the street with me and I remember the cops throwing him on the ground. I remember I thought they were going to hurt him and I was so scared. Not that he was—I think he was just taking me from my mom. I don't know why, I don't know any of the circumstances behind it, but I remember watching the police do that to him. We lived in an apartment on Lake [Street] right by K-Mart. [laughter]
AS: That's still an intense place. 
CK: Yeah. I remember it was in the summer and there were all kinds of people out watching. This was on the street. He took me from the apartment building. The courtroom I just remember they would ask me, ""Who do you want to live with? Who do you want?"" And I would say whatever anybody wanted to hear. It wasn't what I wanted because I didn't want to hurt anybody. I think about that now, like I was way too young for that. Way too young. 
AS: I hope they have learned something. I'm just sorry for all the people who had to experience 
that in the seventies and the eighties. I think the eighties was probably the peak of that.  
CK: I think they have. Yeah. And they would ask me in front of both of them. Like, how? [laughter]
AS: So what is your take on addiction and people who struggle with it? What do you notice and what do you wish was different? Do you read about it or think about it very often?
CK: I do. I think people associate it with people who have had rough lives, but I don't think that is at all what it is. I think it's the people we hang around, the people we—as young kids—who we associate with, where if you're daring—I just feel like you can't pinpoint it to one reason why people—sometimes there's no reason and it's just curiosity. Some people aren't strong enough to overcome that curiosity. Some people are. Some people can do it one time, and that's it and be done with it and some people can't. I think it doesn't have any bearing on how you were raised. 
AS: What do you wish would change about the way we deal with addiction from your perspective?
CK: I wish the medical field would care a little bit more. I really wish they would not treat them as not people or that they don't deserve health care or that they don't deserve to be treated kindly. I see it all—I even see it now. I see the way the nurses talk about it at my job, and I don't say anything. 
AS: What do they say?
CK: They're like, ""Oh, yeah, they're just here to get their fix and then they're back on the street again. But guess what? They're fixed up when they leave the door so they'll be in next week for their next..."" you know? It's stuff like that. I know they're probably frustrated because I work at Abbott [Northwestern Hospital], which is in the middle of—you know? I see it all day long. I guess I'm not a healthcare provider, so I don't know how frustrating it is to have to deal with people like that, but I know what it's like to have to live with someone like that and know that they deserve to be treated the same way anyone else would, regardless of—not that they should be prescribed pills and leave, but, treat them—I just remember how my dad was treated when I went into regions. It was like—they just treated him like he wasn't a person. I remember like, ""Can you please do something? Can you please scan his head?"" Because my dad never complained about headaches or anything, and I was like, ""Can you just do something? Anything?"" And they were like, ""There's nothing we can do. We gave him two—"" I don't remember what it was, and sent him on his way. I was like, ""You're not going to do anything?"" 
AS: And later he was back in there in the MRI?
CK: It was about a week and a half later. He was transported by ambulance to Unity Hospital and that's when he had the stroke. I never asked how—who called. I know it was his girlfriend, but I didn't know her very well. She was a user, too. Something must have happened, I don't know, and that's when I got a call saying, ""Your dad's in the hospital. We think he may have had a stroke. Can you come down?"" Then when I got there I remember the nurse saying, ""Do you know her?"" And his mouth was open and that was the last time he was conscious. I remember when the doctor pulled me into the room and said, ""You have to make a decision."" And I struggled with it because I struggle with religion. I don't know what I believe. I believe in something I just don't know what. I don't know what type of religion he was because he was trying to comfort people—the hospital chaplain. I'm just looking at everybody and I was just like, ""This does not comfort me."" I asked if I could speak to him alone and I just said, ""I hear you saying he's going to go to a better place and you're praying, but what if you don't believe that? What if you don't know?"" And I can't even remember how he explained it to me. He explained it somehow with being born and—
AS: Because he was trying to convince you that your dad should be taken off?
CK: No, he was trying to convince me that he was going to be okay. That he was going to be in a better place. I think that's how he was comforting everybody. I was just sitting there and I was like, ""This isn't working for me."" [laughs] 
AS: You started to say that you never say anything to the nurses—what would happen if you did? What would you say?
CK: Sometimes I just want to be like, ""You have no idea what it's like to be that person or a loved one of that person, you know?""
AS: Would you get in trouble for saying something like that?
CK: I don't know. 
AS: One of the things that I keep coming up against is that the only way—and this isn't to put any guilt onto you—but the only way that we can break that stigma is by calling people out on it. It's the same with sexism and the same with racism. It's just the next thing we have to do or keep doing on a new topic. 
CK: Yeah. 
AS: I had that experience of my daughter being referred to as an ‘OD’, and it just pierced me in a way. And my sister who is a doctor—my daughter is completely unconscious, completely hooked up to everything you could imagine—my sister who had come, who is a family physician, came up from Texas and she saw me and she just went into the hall and was like—because this guy was a resident or something—""It would be really good if you didn't say that in front of family."" And they do, it is part of the work, they can't think of everyone with all these feelings and all this. They are in a field where they're supposed to be helping people who are suffering, right?
CK: Yeah. The nurses at Unity were very, very nice to me. 
AS: They have a different approach at Unity. They do. 
CK: Yeah, I felt like they did. I felt like they had compassion for what he was going through, for what everyone was going through at the time. I didn't feel like they treated him just like he didn't matter. There is one other thing. I remember when he was dying they gave him morphine and my grandma had a really hard time with me okaying him to have morphine. Yeah. She said, ""He doesn't need that."" I said, ""Grandma, he's probably in there withdrawing on top of going through all of this and he is trying to fight this."" This is my thought. And she didn't want him to have 
morphine and it was like, ""I don't care what you think at this point."" 
AS: Could it matter at that point?
CK: Right, it didn't. But these were the challenges I had in the hospital. I remember them telling me, ""He's not going to make it,"" and my grandma, for almost two days, the family thought that he was going to come out of it because he would twitch, but they told me when you twitch, when they do pain tests on him you don't go in, you try to get away from the pain and he would twitch in—his hands would twitch in. I remember I told her I didn't want all kinds of people at the hospital. I just wanted to deal with this as him, me, you, and my aunt, and the whole family was up there. I was so angry. I didn't leave the room—they were in the waiting room—I didn't leave his side. For three days I sat there. I had to wear gloves because he had MRSA. I just didn't like it because I was like, ""My dad is not going to want people to see him like this."" His fever was like one hundred and six, and it was just bad. Antibiotics did nothing. After he had the stroke he was done. I don't know why it took three days for them to finally say—because I remember the nurses telling me very early, ""It's in his main bloodstream. He's not coming out of this."" They didn't say it like that, but they were very nice about it. I just said, ""I want to know, honestly, I want to know the truth,"" because I needed to prepare. I needed to know what I was doing. I knew his wishes—we had talked about what he wanted. He didn't want to be kept on life support. I mean probably all kinds of other stuff will come to mind, but it's just that I've never really sat and talked about it.
AS: I'm just so honored that you sat and talked to a total stranger about it. 
CK: It feels good to talk about it.
AS: Good. Well, you're really a remarkable person to have gone through what you did and to hold on the way you have and to get through that. You must have come into this world pretty darn strong. You're not a newbie! You've got some power in you. That's a powerful story. I'm really sorry that you lost your dad. I'm sorry about all of it.
CK: Thank you. I think he's—there's a museum, I don't know if it's still there, I should look—it's of fire fighters. He's in there. I'll have to look it up and see if I can find it. 
AS: Look it up and share that with me. I would appreciate knowing more. 
CK: And the fire department gave me all of the awards he won for things he had done. And the picture of the girl in the Star Tribune. It has her name on it, but I just—I should share that with you.
AS: Yeah, I would love to see that. 
CK: I think it was in Minneapolis. It looked like she was Native American, I can't—I don't know. 
AS: Thank you, Chandra. 
CK: You're welcome. "

Marisa Krause -MK
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan in Victoria, Minnesota on December 30, 2016. I'm here at the childhood home of Marisa Krause. Marisa could you state your name and say whether you give permission for me to record this?
MK: I'm Marisa Krause and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record. 
AS: Thank you. If you could just start by telling me how old you are, your birthday, whichever one you want to do. Then talk a little bit about your childhood. Your earliest memories, where you grew up, what life was like for you as a little girl.
MK: I'm 23. I just turned 23 in December and I grew up here in this house in Victoria. Childhood for me was good. I was adopted when I was five months old from Korea. As far back as I can remember my parents always gave my brother and I love. They always made sure that they told us that they were proud of us. That they love us and to keep focusing on what our long term life goals are. There was discipline in the home which I think is a very structural thing...I grew up with good parents. I grew up with very good parents. They love each other, they love their life, they love us kids, and there was nothing less than that in our home. I went to private school. I went to preschool, private school for K through 8 and then my freshman year I went to a Lutheran school for three months, and then I went to Catholic school for however long the school year is, the rest of it. Then sophomore year I went to public school and graduated from Chanhassen High School in 2012. In high school things were good. I was a three sport athlete and I loved playing sports. That was my life. I wasn't so good at academics. 
AS: What did you play?
MK: Volleyball, basketball, and soccer. I kind of grew up playing these sports. My brother was an athlete in school as well. That was just something that we loved to do, play sports. We had a basketball hoop outside and we would shoot hoops outside after dinner. 
AS: How old is your brother?
MK: He's 24 I think. 
AS: You're a year apart. 
MK: He'll be 25 in April. We're like a year and a half apart. We got along like siblings get along that close in age. We're two polar opposite people. He's very book smart, very into school. He's just very intelligent. I on the other hand was more of the social butterfly in school. I always wanted to go to parties on weekends or have friends over or go to friends’ houses. I met a lot of people through sports. When I was 16 years old I met a guy who I started dating and he was a marijuana dealer. 
AS: How old was he?
MK: He was a year younger than I, so 15 at the time. It was my first boyfriend. My first really any sort of relationship. We were together for six and a half years. It was a whirlwind of a relationship. It started off unhealthy and it ended unhealthy. I got into a lot of trouble with him. I started partying a lot. I started skipping class, not going to practices for my sports. I just ended up quitting everything. 
AS: By what? Your junior year?
MK: Yes, it was my junior year. Exactly. I would still play summer softball for the city. I grew up with a lot of girls around here; they were playing softball as well. We would do that in the summer. School wise, no sports anymore. 
AS: What do you attribute that to?
MK: Really my attention was on my boyfriend. Those few hours after school that I would be at practice or a game or something like that I could be with him. I didn't want to take that time away from him and be doing something that I loved. I look back on it now and it's baffling to me that I would do that to myself. Now I watch games on the TV and I go, ""Oh my gosh. If only."" I think I could have gone to college for volleyball. That's what everybody said. 
AS: Can we back up a minute? What did you mean by that it was unhealthy? Did you know it was? Is that in hindsight or did you know at the beginning that it was unhealthy?
MK: I knew at the beginning. When we first got together he was cheating on his girlfriend with me. They broke up and then we got together. For six and a half years it was him being unfaithful. I liked the lifestyle that he was living and I hadn't started drinking yet. I hadn't started smoking cigarettes yet or doing any sort of drugs or any substances. When I turned 17 that's when I got into the party thing with him and started drinking a lot. He would have friends that did cocaine and smoked weed and all this stuff. I did it all with him. Every single thing, every single substance that I've done, I've always done with him first. I've never done it by myself. It was always with him or his friends. With that, a couple years into our relationship my parents didn't like him from the start. 
A couple years into our relationship I started getting into a lot of trouble with him. I would stay out past the curfew that I was given. Under 18 you have an 11 o'clock curfew or whatever. I would always be late for that. I ended up getting pulled over and got a curfew ticket. Which I think is funny now. I was out past 11. I would lie to them about where I was going and who I was going to be with. I was just getting into trouble with him. We went to a party one night and the next morning my dad was checking my spare tire in the trunk of my car and he found a loaded stolen pistol in there. It was one of my ex's friends who had brought it to that party. I didn't know because I was cleaning out my trunk that night, throwing things in the back seat. They must have just have tossed it in there when I wasn't looking. That morning, it was like a Sunday morning, we were going to church. I woke up to six squad cars in my driveway.
AS: How did that happen?
MK: My dad found it and he found a bottle of vodka back there too. I was drinking. 
AS: Did he call the police on you then?
MK: Yes. Well he called my uncle who was a cop at the time. He was like, ""I don't know what to do. What do I do?"" My uncle just told him, ""Don't touch it. Don't put any of your DNA, your fingerprints on it. Keep it there, call the police. I'm sorry to tell you this but Marisa probably will go to jail at 17 years old."" So the cops came and they put me in handcuffs and I was bawling. I had just woken up. I didn't know it was there. I was trying to tell my dad that. Of course they're not going to believe me I was out until 2 o'clock in the morning.
AS: You already had a history of lying?
MK: Yes. 
AS: Had they caught you in lies at this point?
MK: Oh yes. I think I'm slick but I'm not. [Laughs]. I try to be slick. I just begged my dad. I said, ""Dad please, don't let them take me. I promise you I'll do whatever you want me to. I'll obey any rules that you have."" Then my dad talked to the officer. They didn't take me but I didn't have a phone, I got my car taken away. I couldn't go out anywhere except to school. Like nothing. I had to be home by, school got out at 3:15, and I had to be home by 3:45. That's when a lot of things started to happen. Of course I didn't obey those rules for very long. 
AS: How long do you think?
MK: Probably a week.
AS: You went from having a car, and a phone, and a very extensive social life...
MK: To nothing. I'm a very good manipulator. I got my dad to give me my car back. Then it was my car and then my cell phone, whatever else I could do to get myself out of this trouble I was in. I sweet talked him and I got everything back. It was the exact same the next week. It was parties and my boyfriend and people that I shouldn't be hanging out with I was hanging out with. Subconsciously I knew I shouldn't be hanging out with these people because of how I was raised and how they were raised. Meaning that I grew up in a really good home, I have a very put together family. They come from broken homes and they haven't had the best upbringing, childhood. Then I just started doing a bunch of cocaine and smoking a lot of weed every day, doing every drug under the sun that you could ever imagine at 17, 18 years old. 
AS: How did you manage to graduate high school?
MK: I don't know. [Laughs]. I don't know. I honestly couldn't tell you. I know I had a 1.67 GPA. I got low Cs. I guess in high school that's passing. I didn't know that. I thought you had to have high Cs. I remember my graduation day. I had a bottle of vodka in the trunk of my car. It's June, it's hot out. Right after I walked across the stage I went out to my car and took a shot of vodka. My friends and I would always joke, ""We're such alcoholics, we're such alcoholics."" I didn't know what that meant at the time. I didn't know what addiction or alcoholism was because I don't have any in my family. I don't have any alcoholics or addicts in my family. All of the sudden here I am drinking right after I walk across the stage at graduation. I tried to go to college. 
AS: Why does that stand out to you?
MK: Just because I was raised in such a good home and such a good family. I had discipline but it wasn't abuse which I always thought it was because I'm a teenager. I got what I wanted and needed and then some. I thought that people that were alcoholics and addicts were the ones that came from broken families, the ones that are homeless, and the ones that don't have any money. My parents work hard for what they have. They've worked hard their whole lives for what they have. I've always known that but I was like, ""I can't be an alcoholic or an addict because my parents have money, because I've never been homeless or because I've never struggled with them.”
AS: That moment of going to the trunk of your car and drinking hot vodka. Why does that stand out to you? Is that a moment when you saw that you might have a problem? 
MK: Yes. That's when I thought I had somewhat of a problem. I didn't have a problem. I had somewhat of a problem. 
AS: What a good way to put it. That's how a lot of kids think about it. 
MK: Right. I was 18 years old at the time. I'm 18; alcoholics aren't until they're like 60. You know what I mean? I remember that and then I tried to go to college at South Central Community College in Mankato. I got an apartment out there and a job out there and I was working full time. I never went to class. Ever. If I was at work I would go home and sleep and then go to a party that night. I would just not go to class. I would wake up on time but I wouldn't go to class. 
I remember homecoming I was running down this hill with a bottle of vodka. I trip over my own feet and I tumble down this steep hill on the street. I woke up the next morning after homecoming weekend and I was just like, ""Oh my God. I never want to do that again. I never want to drink like that ever again."" I was telling my parents, ""I'm not going to class. I don't enjoy going to class. I don't have any friends out here really. I have a couple but they're actually going to school and doing the right thing."" [Laughs]. They're actually enrolled in college and going and they're going to graduate unlike me. I went to class maybe one day, the first day of school. I hated it. I moved back to my parents.
AS: Was that one semester?
MK: Yes. I was still with the boyfriend. That's really when I turned 19, no I turned 20 I think. Then I moved back here and I started partying again, doing a lot of drugs. Whenever I was at home with my family or whenever we would have a family get together I would always just leave. I wouldn't stay. I wouldn't be paying attention to anybody. I wouldn't be caring about anybody or anything like that. I think about it now and I feel very guilty about that. I started doing heroin in February of 2014. 
AS: How did that come about?
MK: My boyfriend had been doing it for a few years before that. I had never been exposed to it or anything. I caught him actually in my bathroom by my bedroom doing it. I remember...
AS: Were your parents home?
MK: No. I would never bring him over when they were home. When I knew that they left for the cabin or out of town that's when he would come over. I was really close with his family and I was welcome there at any time. I caught him in my bathroom doing it. I was mad and I was hurt because he had been lying to me. Then one day we were at his friends house and I was like, ""Let me try it. You're doing it and I don't see you do it and not me. We've done everything together."" 
AS: He didn't want you to try it?
MK: Nope. He didn't. I think he low-key did but he didn't put it out like that. His friends were telling me, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" I did it and I remember that night I was driving home. I didn't really feel it. I didn't feel any different. I was driving home and I was like a block down the road and I thought, ""Marisa just make it home, make it home."" My stomach was turning and I was going to get sick. Right as I'm pulling in the driveway I threw up all over myself in my car, all over the steering wheel, all over my clothes. I'm trying to take off my clothes in the garage before I come inside. It's like 3 o'clock in the morning. My mom was standing there, ""Where have you been?""
AS: So at this point you didn't have a curfew? 
MK: No. We had a conversation when I went to college. I told them, ""Mom, Dad I'm kind of sick of having this curfew. I'm 18 years old now. I'm an adult."" They're like, ""Alright you can make your own decisions as you want to. You get in trouble you're going to have to deal with the consequences."" I was like, ""Ok, no problem."" I didn’t think I would be getting in trouble. I thought I was slick. [Laughs]. I threw up all over myself. I walked in the house buck naked. I told my mom, ""I spilt a Coke on myself."" I remember going to bed and I don't remember how I got up to my room or anything like that. I woke up the next morning and I was like, ""Oh my God. Why do I feel like I need to do that again? I've never felt that."" 
AS: That quickly.
MK: I was smoking weed, doing coke; I never woke up the next morning and wanted to do it again. It would just be on weekends. 
AS: Can I ask you a question? Did you ever take pain pills for recreation use?
MK: Nope. 
AS: You went straight to injecting?
MK: I didn't inject. I smoked. I was doing uppers like cocaine. I would smoke weed which kind of just puts you to sleep, other than that no pain pills. 
AS: That wasn't your route into using heroin. It was just...
MK: I was exposed to cocaine and then I was exposed to heroin which is uncommon. Usually it is pain pills or like my parents had surgery or something or my grandma had surgery and I'm going to take their pain pills. None of that. I never was a pill popper or anything like that. I never found that enjoyable. When I started smoking heroin the next morning, it was barely even 12 hours after that. I was like, ""Oh my God I need to do this every day."" I was working in Chaska and my boyfriend lived across the street. I remember I would just call him every day at work, ""You need to come to the parking lot. Let's go for a cruise."" Meaning that we're going to get high. ""I have a half hour lunch break. We can just drive down the road.""
AS: You'd get high and come back to work?
MK: I'd get high in the morning before I'd go to work. I'd go to work for a few hours, have a lunch break and then get high in the parking lot of work. 
AS: And then after work probably?
MK: Then after work of course.
AS: What were you doing? What was your job?
MK: I was working at a call center, sitting there talking on the phone all day. 
AS: To who? For what?
MK: It was called Heartland America in Chaska. It was a magazine company. 
AS: Did it require much...
MK: Nothing. 
AS: …Thought.
MK: No, no thought. You need to know how to type numbers and work a computer basically which I'm very good at. Nobody knew, none of my friends knew, none of my coworkers knew, none of my family knew. I kept it very under wraps. I was using for a few months. April is my brother’s birthday and we went out to dinner for his birthday with my family. I decided to leave early because I just thought, ""Why do I need to be here?"" I don't like my family at this point. I don't have anything in common with them. I was playing the victim. 
AS: The outsider.
MK: Yes. I left and I went to my friend's house who's also a user. I ended up that night getting into a fight with a girl and I guess hurt her severely. We were doing a drug deal. It was a drug deal gone bad basically. I fought her and she ended up going to the hospital with a broken face basically. I was arrested that night and I remember calling my mom from the Scott County Jail at 4:30 in the morning. I called her and said, ""Mom."" She's like, ""Where are you?"" ""I'm in Scott County Jail."" ""You're where?"" ""I'm at Scott County Jail. My car's getting impounded. I don't know what to tell you."" ""What do we need to do?"" ""You need to get a lawyer and come get me out of here."" I ended up sitting in there for a few days. I was released without a bail hearing or anything. I really don't know what happened. I don't think that it was because of any human power. I think it's because of God that I wasn't charged with anything. To this day I do not have any charges on my record.
AS: The girl didn't press charges?
MK: She was going to press charges but she didn't know who I was. She didn't have a name, she didn't have an address, and she didn't have anything. With her injuries the state picked it up and the state didn't have any proof. They weren't there. They just had no evidence. I wasn't charged with anything, thank God. That could have been some serious jail time. My charges were aggravated robbery and assault even though I didn't use any weapons. 
AS: You were never...
MK: I was never charged. 
AS: What was the robbery?
MK: I stole $80 from her and I broke her phone. 
AS: Do you remember doing this?
MK: No. I remember leaving but I don't remember why I decided to hit her. [Laughs]. Then that's when my parents really are like, ""What are you doing?"" I got released from jail, I came home. Before my dad picked me up I walked down the street to my friend's house to get high and then I walked back to the jail so I looked like I just got out of jail. I was out for a couple hours. I know.
AS: Did you get dope sick in there?
MK: I was kicking in there and I was dope sick. To me jail for an addict is the worst place to be. Especially if it's an addict that doesn't want to get clean. I met a lot of people in there that are users that gave me numbers to all these people where I could get drugs for really cheap. It was really good. Of course I take with me out of jail and I use those resources. That's when my parents really found out. I told them I had been using heroin with my ex, with my boyfriend. 
AS: That was in April?
MK: Yes. Then in May I got pulled over in Bloomington. My boyfriend had gotten into a fight in a parking lot and we got pulled over and the officer called my dad and he searched my car and found paraphernalia. Still no charges, he didn't arrest me. He just called my dad, ""Can we search your daughter’s car? She said no but you're the owner of this car."" My dad's like, ""Yes of course."" I'm like, ""Oh crap. No! Dad don't say yes."" The officer's like, ""Your dad said yes."" They found paraphernalia; they found a scale because my boyfriend and I were selling at this time. They told my dad and my dad told the officer just to leave the car on the side of the road, he'd come pick it up, take the keys with to the station and he'll come get the keys. I remember the officer's name was Sergeant Williams and he told me, ""Your dad told me to take the car."" All of this paraphernalia is ours obviously. We walked from Bloomington to our friends’ house a few miles down the road. My dad was telling me, ""You need to be home in an hour."" ""Well Dad you took my car. How am I supposed to get home?"" ""You'll figure it out."" I was like, ""Man I am in trouble."" 
I pull in six hours later. My mom is standing out by the front door with a list. I get out of my friends car and she's like, ""Marisa."" I remember this is the first thing she said. ""I know you and Andre are having sex but I just want you to know that birth control is free on our insurance."" I'm like, ""Ok. Alright. Whatever."" She's like, ""I know that you've been doing something that you're not supposed to be doing and you can take one of two choices. You can leave Andre and have your family and we'll help you or you can go with him and continue on what you're doing but we have no contact with you, you are completely cut off. Your phone's cut off, you don't have a car. You can pack what you can in a backpack in 20 minutes and you can leave. I was like, ""How are you going to make me choose between my boyfriend who I've been with for four and a half years now and my family who I grew up with?"" My mom was like, ""I don't know what to tell you. It's up to you."" I was like, ""Alright I pick my boyfriend. See you later."" I packed my backpack and I left and walked down the street about a mile and a half and had a friend pick me up and take me back to my boyfriend's house.
AS: How did you have a friend pick you up?
MK: I used a gas station phone. He came and picked me up and brought me back to my boyfriend's house. His mom told me that I could stay there for a little bit, temporarily not for a while. I stayed there and we continued to do what we were doing. A few weeks after that I was waking up to go to work and I took a shower and was getting dressed. I walked out of the bathroom in a towel into our room and I hear a big knock on the door. I look outside and there's nobody there. Then I just here the door bust down. It's the task force. 
AS: Who's the task force?
MK: The drug, the police and the drugs and all that stuff. They're searching through; they put us all in handcuffs. I'm in a towel sitting on the couch. My boyfriend's older brother lived there, his mom, his sister, and then his nephew was there as well. We were selling and we were all sitting on the couch in handcuffs and the police were searching our room. They flipped everything upside down. They found some old foils and straws and stuff. They were trying to tell us, they talked to all of us individually and they said that if we would give up the name of the person we were buying from that they would let us free, we wouldn't have any charges. Basically if we were to snitch then we wouldn't have any charges. We agreed to it and we were supposed to contact him the next time we went to our dealer's house.
AS: Every single person agreed to it individually?
MK: Yes. Well it was really just me and my boyfriend. They knew his mom wasn't using or his brother wasn't using. They knew our names; they knew we were pretty big dealers around this area. They knew our names. We agreed to it and we were supposed to contact them when we went to our dealer's house next. We never did and never did and never did. No charges were filed once again. I don't understand still, I don't understand any of that still. I just remember when I started doing heroin my boyfriend and I were arguing a lot about money, about drugs, about everything. He was still being unfaithful and cheating on me and all that stuff. I remember one day, this was in May and then June, nothing much happened in June. Just the same thing, using, dealing, using, dealing, stealing from anybody and anywhere that we could. 
AS: Were you still living at his mom's?
MK: After the raid she kicked us out so we were kind of couch surfing with his friends and some of my friends that were using. It wasn't fun.
AS: Did you have any contact with your parents during this time?
MK: No.
AS: How long?
MK: It was like a good two and a half months. I would call them every once and awhile and just say I'm alive. I never told them where I was or who I was staying with or what I was doing or any of that. July comes around...it was June or July. I was at work. I used a work phone to call my mom because I was really sick. I was dope sick. I called my mom and I said, ""Mom I don't know if you still want me in your life at all but I need help. I need you to come get me from work right now."" She came speeding in the parking lot and slammed on her brakes and she said that she had an assessment set up for me at Hazelden so I could go and check it out. They would let me know if I could get in. I went with her and I don't remember the assessment at all. All I remember was on our way back home I told her that I need to go to my boyfriend's house and get my stuff. She said, ""No, we'll get it later. We don't need to do that now."" She was afraid I was going to get high which I of course was. I jumped out of the car with my mom going 60 miles per hour. I jumped out of the car and tucked and rolled. My mom slammed on the brakes and I just remember the look on her face when I looked back. I was running from her. I remember I looked back and the look on her face I've never seen my mom that upset and I never want to ever again. I think that's really when she was saying goodbye to me. I should have died. I should have died jumping out of that car. I should have died using. I should have died hanging out with the people I was hanging out with. 
A few days after that I told my mom, ""I'm actually ready. Here's the address where I'm at. Come get me. Have a bag packed just what I need and we'll get the other stuff later."" She did, she came through and I went to Hazelden. I don't remember getting there. I really don't remember much of what happened there. I do remember learning the 12 Steps and thinking that this is complete bullshit. Bullshitting my whole way through my first step and every assignment they had me do. They wanted me to stay 60 days. I said, ""Fuck you."" I left at 27 days. I couldn't even stay another day to make it 28. I walked out of Hazelden, I sat by the sign. It's June or July and it's like 91 degrees but it’s cold in the building. I was wearing leggings and a sweater. All my stuff was packed in my bag and a lady from across the street came in her car and said, ""Can I take you somewhere?"" ""Just take me to the nearest gas station. Get me out of here."" Her husband I guess had been through Hazleton a few years back. She took me to a gas station. I called a friend and my friend came to pick me up. I had all the intent of staying clean. I had all the intentions of not using or not drinking. I didn't want to go back to the way that I was. It happened and I relapsed that day. 
AS: Did you talk to your mom before you left?
MK: Yes.
AS: She knew you were going to leave.
MK: I talked to her and I said, ""Mom I'm sick of this."" She said, ""You're not welcome here. You're going to have to figure it out. Right now this is the best place for you. You have a roof over your head, you have three meals a day, and you have a shower, all this stuff."" That wasn't enough to stop me. I was out for three weeks and in that three weeks my boyfriend and I had broken up.
AS: You were out?
MK: I was out using three weeks after I left Hazleton. My boyfriend and I broke up and I was still getting high as a kite everyday by myself, doing it alone. On the streets sleeping outside, sleeping under bridges, sleeping wherever I could that was decently warm. 
AS: Did you stay around in the suburban areas?
MK: Yes. I called my mom and she took me back. I don't why...my counselor David at Hazleton when I got back he made me write a paper to get accepted back in to be able to go back. What I'm willing to do. I guess my paper was good enough for him to accept me back. He asked me, ""To what lengths are you willing to go to stay sober?"" I said, ""I'll do anything. Just help me."" He said, ""Ok. Are you willing to be honest this time?"" I said, ""Yes."" I did a complete first step as thoroughly and honest as I could be. 
AS: What was it that made you go back? What happened?
MK: I don't know. I was just sick of it. It was exhausting. I wasn't sleeping. When I relapsed I had relapsed and I was using meth as well which is something that I never thought I would use. As a teenager I was, ""Those are dirty drugs. Those are for disgusting people."" They are dirty drugs. They're disgusting. I went back and I was honest and I built relationship with a lot of the girls there. 
It was my three week mark back at Hazelden and David pulled me into his office and said, ""To what lengths are you willing to go to stay sober?"" ""I'll do anything."" ""Anything?"" ""Yes. Why do you keep asking me this?"" ""Well we think that you need a higher level of care. We want to send you out to New Found Life in California."" ""Ok, pause. Not going out of state. I'm staying in Minnesota where my family is, where my friends are, where I grew up."" He's like, ""Ok just think about it."" I talked to a couple different counselors at Hazelden about what I should do. I woke up one morning and I ran to David's office and I said, ""David I'm ready to go. I'm willing to go."" We called my mom and told her, ""I need a plane ticket. I'm leaving on Friday."" I packed my bags; I left that Friday and was off to California. When I got to California I committed to doing there that treatment center they brought us to AA meetings. We had to call two more alcoholics and addicts a day before we could make any more personal calls to family. You couldn't sit down when you smoked which I thought was stupid. 
AS: Why was that?
MK: I don't know because they think it's lazy which I kind of agree it is. I don't know. 
AS: But you could smoke which is different from Hazelden.
MK: Exactly. When I was talking to the intake at New Found Life they were like, ""Our facility is right on the beach. We go to the beach a lot. We take the girls there. You can go on beach walks. We have beach meetings."" I get there and there's like a large fence in front of the house where you can't go out to the beach. The beach is like across the street. I was so angry. 
One of my friends from Hazelden was actually at that treatment center as well. We were trying to make this plan to leave. We were going to take all the change we had in our bags and go live on the beach and be beach bums. 
AS: So you didn't quite have your brain back yet?
MK: No, not at all. I don't know what it was there either that I was like, ""Let me try."" My 21st birthday came along and my mom came out. I was able to spend a lot of time with her outside of treatment. We got to a mall, went to get massages. That day we sat down with my case manager.
AS: Were you still planning to leave at this point? 
MK: Not so much. I was more okay with it. Obviously I still wanted to leave but I wasn't like, ""Let's jump the fence."" My mom came out; we talked to my case manager. My case manager, ""Alright Marisa you've done your two months here. It's up to you now what you want to do. What's up?"" My mom said, ""It's your decision if you want to come back home and do sober living, if you want to stay out here."" All I remember is saying, ""You're crazy Mom. I'm staying out here. I don't care if I have to stay here longer and go to sober living out here. I'm not going home."" I remember looking at her and I was like, ""What did I just say? Crap! What did I just say? What am I doing?"" My mom started crying of course because she was so excited. I ended up staying two and a half more months in New Found Life.
AS: In treatment?
MK: Yes.
AS: How many months of treatment were you in?
MK: Total it was four and a half...five and a half. I went to sober living in Long Beach, California.
AS: Can you tell me first of all were you on medication assisted treatment? Did you get Vivitrol?
MK: I did get Vivitrol. I got Vivitrol the week that I left Hazelden. I continued it out in California. Every month I would go, in treatment they would take me to the doctor to get my shot and have assessment. ""How's it working for you? What do you feel?"" When I went to sober living I continued Vivitrol for another...I was on it a total of 13 months. 
AS: How was it for you?
MK: It was good. I did see a difference. When I first got it I felt really sick, I felt tired, I felt icky. After like the second, third month I felt like myself. I didn't have any cravings once you hit that 28 day mark you'd be like, ""Oh my God.""
AS: It would come back?
MK: It would come back and it would hit hard, when I was going to meetings with the girls in my treatment that would help it a lot. Then I would go back to the doctor and get another shot. It really helped me. I recommend it to all my friends in treatment. Still even the girls that are at this treatment center now I recommend to them. I was scared too though. I was like, ""I don't want to be on this and have it be like my crutch. I want to be able to do this part by myself with the help of a program."" 
Sober living was hard too. I didn't really get along with the house owner. Actually there were a lot of times when we bumped heads. I got a job, a get well job. I had a couple of them. 
AS: What kind of a job?
MK: A get well job. It's just like a little minimum wage...
AS: They call it a get well job?
MK: Yes, it makes you feel...before I was making $600 a week at my job before treatment. There I was making maybe $100 every two weeks. It makes you humble. I needed to find out my own ride to work and home from work. I worked at Coldstone and I hated it. It was on the beach and it was busy. There were a lot of people and it was hot. I was doing it because I needed to learn how to live in society again. I had a couple get well jobs before I got my year. September 19 is my sobriety date, 2014. September 14, 2015 comes around that quick. Then I was working in treatment.
AS: You were working at the...
MK: I was working at a treatment center in Costa Misa. Not the one I went to, all females, just as support staff. I got to share my experience with them every day. I got to encourage them to keep going on the path of recovery. I think really working in treatment and seeing it from a different side has really helped me in my recovery. I know how I was but not everybody's like me. There's a lot of people that really want it and that are really willing to do anything.
AS: You were resistant for a while?
MK: For a while, a long time.
AS: You were in for four and half months...did you say four and a half or five and a half?
MK: Total five and a half.
AS: Was there a point where you really started accepting yourself as a person with addiction? You can say that you did the first step but is there a point during that time where you felt more secure in your recovery or did that happen outside of treatment later?
MK: It happened in treatment because I remember asking the question, ""How do you know if you're an addict or an alcoholic?"" The only answer I would get every single time is, ""Normal people don't end up in treatment multiple times. Normal people don't end up in treatment at all."" That's when I was like, ""That makes sense. I'm not normal."" I was journaling a lot in treatment. I was really looking closely at my patterns in my life. If I didn't get something that I wanted I would throw a fit. We have home video of me having fits, laying on the ground rolling around.
AS: One of the questions I was going to ask you when we first started, you went on to another topic and I decided not to interrupt you, this gets back to what were you like as a child?
MK: Very needy. If I didn't get something I wanted I would throw a temper tantrum. It was always more, I always needed more. More makeup as a three year old, prettier dresses, more dolls, more bags, more food, more candy, everything was more. 
AS: You just had a hole.
MK: Everything was more. I thought at that time it was because I was bored and I was a kid. What else am I supposed to do besides eat and play with my dolls? I would scream and I would cry.
AS: You remember that?
MK: Yes. I remember my dad bought me a very, it was an expensive dress, red with pearl buttons on it. I loved it because when I would twirl around in it would look like a big Cinderella gown. I absolutely loved it. I remember one day I wore it to church and I went home and I ripped all the buttons off of it, I was throwing them all over my room. I tore the dress off because I didn't get something that I wanted. I wasn't a fun kid to be around even in my teen years everything was my way or the highway, whether it was with my family or my friends or my boyfriend, very controlling. 
AS: You worked a program; you worked a twelve-step program. How was that? Are there parts of that that have helped you outside of just dealing with sobriety?
MK: Absolutely. I think that the twelve steps aren't just to be applied to people who are getting sober. I think that if everybody in this world were to work the twelve steps of whatever kind you want to, the world would be such a better place. Just because it's taught me how to live again and it's taught me how to be a good person. It's taught me how to get down on my knees every day and pray and not just for the things that I want. Thanking my higher power for what I have and where I'm at in life. Apologizing to people when I need to and accepting people as who they are for whatever they did and not playing the victim. Just looking at myself instead of other people and judging myself instead of other people. Everybody has a story to tell. You never know what somebody else is going through. If everybody in this world were to work a twelve step program and actually work it and do the things they say they're going to do I really think that the hatred in this world would go away. It's gone away in my heart. 
I can actually sit down and have a conversation with my mom now. I can sit down and have a conversation with my dad. My grandma just turned 90 on December 27 and her siblings were there that are close to her age and smell like old people [Laughs] and I was able to sit down and have a conversation with them and ask them how they're doing and how their lives are. I got to ask my grandma, ""What was your favorite memory of your life?"" And actually listening to what she had to say instead of going, ""Oh ok. I didn't really mean to ask that question.""
AS: Or even that you would sit down.
MK: That I would even actually seem like I cared but I actually do genuinely care for people now these days. It's easier for me now to take time out of my day just to talk to you rather than really not having anything else to do but just leaving the house and doing nothing.
AS: Just to leave.
MK: Right, just to say I'm doing something but I'm really not doing anything. I have genuine friends in my life now. My best friend who I live with in California she has a two and a half year old son and I'm trusted with him alone at the house. I'm trusted driving with him and picking him up from school and dropping him off at school. He loves me as much as I love him. I've never felt so much love for my best friend and her son in my whole entire life.
AS: That is so neat. Did you meet her in treatment?
MK: No, funny story. She went to my high school out here in Minnesota. She moved to Kentucky. She was friends with my ex-boyfriend but I had never met her before. She added me on Facebook and we kind of started chatting. She's been with me my whole journey of sobriety and even before that. She knew me when...we would Facetime when I was getting high. At that time we had never met face to face. When I moved out to Long Beach when I got into sober living she had moved out to California as well to her dad's house. I come to find out her dad lived right around the corner from my sober living. We got to meet in person after three and a half years of being friends on technology, Facebook, Facetime, Instagram. We've been inseparable. We live together now. We've lived together since last May. We go to school together. We're going to school to be nurses now.
AS: So you're in school. When did that start?
MK: In November. I have a 3.0 GPA.
AS: Congratulations.
MK: I'm in the medical field and the medical field is hard. I was going to school for just general education in college and I didn't even feel like I could do that. 
AS: You focused back and your brain and your life are back. You just didn't know you could do it? What do you attribute it to?
MK: I didn't believe in myself enough. I didn't believe I could take the time out of my day to sit and study for 8 hours. That's a huge blessing. I live in a beautiful house on the golf course in Yukipa, California. I drive a nice car. By next year I'll have my license as a nurse. It's crazy to see where I was sleeping under bridges and outside. Being able to take a shower every day and put makeup on and brush my teeth every day. When I went to Hazelden the first time I took my hair out of a bun after not showering for a month and a half and it was dreaded. I honest to God thought I would have to shave my head. Now it's like I have my family in my life. My mom's my best friend. She trusts me to drive her car when I'm home.
AS: You don't take that for granted. It's still special.
MK: They're letting me go out for New Year’s tomorrow night with some friends. They're not questioning about where I'm going. They asked me one time where I'm going and who I'm going to be with. It's not, ""What time are you going to be home? Who are you going with? What's their phone number? What's their address?"" I feel like I have my space as much as I'm giving them their space. We're still able to come together as a family and enjoy time together. 
AS: Do you ever worry about relapse?
MK: All the time, all the time. I got asked the other days if I have cravings. Not really. But just because I don't have cravings doesn't mean I couldn't go out and pick up something. It doesn't mean I don't want it. That was part of my life, it was a short amount of time I was using heroin, but it was a part of my life for that long. Really the thing that I don't...I could lose my car, I could lose my house, I could lose going to school, I could lose the clothes that I have, but I never want to lose my family again. 
AS: What advice would you give to a parent who finds out that their child is using heroin, let's just keep it to heroin? What advice would you give to a parent now?
MK: To a parent? 
AS: Someone comes to you and tells you, ""I've just found out my daughter's using heroin.""
MK: Honestly I would tell them...what a lot of parents are being told these days is it's not your fault, you didn't do this to them. I would give them my phone number if their child would ever want to call me and talk. Tell them to keep their boundaries strong and do what they have to do or do what they think is right. I hate to say this but most of the time parents are right. Parents have a very good intuition and what their gut tells them is probably what is right. I don't have kids of my own but I am starting to feel that with my best friend's son. He asks me to do something if I feel like he shouldn't do it I'm like, ""No. You can’t do that."" Let them know that there's other parents out there too. I'd give them my mom's phone number. My mom doesn't care. I'm very open with my mom; she's very open with me. She asks me for my permission to give someone my phone number after the fact that she's given them my phone number. As long as I can help somebody and as long as I'm helping my family help other people I'm good with that. 
AS: Do you have a sponsor and are you a sponsor?
MK: I do have a sponsor and I don't have any sponsees right now but I have in the past. It's hard right now with school.
AS: It's a commitment. 
MK: Not that if someone were to ask me I'd say no. That's important and I honestly think that helping someone else with their sobriety and helping them get their life back is more important than me going to school at this very second. Do I think it's important for me to go to school? Yes, but when somebody's life is involved that's really become important to me.
AS: Have you had the same sponsor?
MK: I switched sponsors when I had five months clean. I've had the same sponsor ever since then. I love her. My life is good. 
AS: That's great.
MK: It's very good. 
AS: Anything else that you've got?
MK: No.
AS: I think that's good. I'm really happy for you and I'm happy to see you so happy.
MK: Thank you. It hasn't been easy, it's been hard but it's been worth and I know there's a lot more hard work to be done. 
AS: Thank you Marisa.
MK: You're welcome."

WL: I give Dr. Amy Sullivan to use the content therewithin. 
AS: Thank you. It is January thirtieth and we are at my house in Minneapolis for this interview. You were holding a thought, so why don’t you just start with that. 
WL: Well, I don’t know if I lost that thought. We were talking about opiates and—
AS: And pain and trauma. 
WL: Yeah. I was stealing opiates at the height of the opiate epidemic. 
AS: Where were you stealing them from?
WL: From customers. 
AS: In your carpet cleaning business? Let’s hold that one. [laughs]
WL: We will come back to it when it is chronologically appropriate. 
AS: That’s where the big jar came from you were talking about?
WL: Yeah. 
AS: When were you born? Where did you grow up? What was your family life like?
WL: I was born in 1972, Marshall, Minnesota. I born to one Patricia Hanson. My birth name was Wade Hanson. I was raised by my grandmother and grandfather until I was four years old. My grandpa, who up until that point I thought was my dad, had a massive heart attack and died. There is a blank in my life up until probably either five or six years old. There is a year there where I really don’t remember anything after he died. It is really cloudy. I should probably get some therapy around that. 
The next memory that I have is my current stepdad coming into my life and moving into a little town called Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. I didn’t know any of this information as far as my birth name being Wade Hanson until I was fourteen years old. I didn’t know I was adopted until I was fourteen. It was kept a secret. 
AS: How old was your mom when she had you?
WL: Eighteen. 
AS: She never married?
WL: No. I have no idea who my dad is. I have a picture of him. He looks like Cheech from Cheech and Chong sitting on a comforter made of several different colored—like a quilt, or something like that.
AS: The height of the seventies?
WL: Yeah. Pants that were sewn together and a long mustache that showed his ethnicity. He was very Hispanic. That’s about all I know. I never met him. I looked for him when I was eighteen or nineteen for a little while. 
AS: Do you know his name?
WL: My mom told my now wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, his name was John Rost, but it just doesn’t even sound right compared to what he looked like. I grew up in a community where ethnicity was not celebrated. 
AS: That’s a nice way to put it. 
WL: I took a multicultural class. I know what I am supposed to say here. [laughs] There was a lot of shame, I’m sure. I was the darkest thing in my neighborhood probably until 1981 or 1982 when the migratory employees started to come to town. That was the first four or five years.
Because this is so closely tied to my opiate use and my drug use in general the first recollection I have at age five or six was being sexually molested by a female babysitter on a weekly basis. Every Friday and Saturday night because my step dad played in a three piece country band, and they would leave at four or five o’clock in the afternoon and return at two or three in the morning. They left me and my baby sister that was probably a year or a year and a half at that time. Then she would go down and the act would take place every time. That was pretty impactful. 
AS: You remember that?
WL: Here’s the thing. I had repressed that memory until I was probably nine or ten years old. We had a little clubhouse that we built, me and the buddies back in the day, and we found a crumpled up old Playboy in a garbage somewhere. We went Dumpster diving on our bicycles to find treasure. We found this magazine and we took it back to the clubhouse to look at it. When I looked at the female anatomy everything rushed back. All the feelings. The overwhelming loss of time, loss of location, I didn’t know where I was. I remember telling my best buddy at the time, “Carl,” I said, “There was this babysitter and she did this and this and this.” Carl just was like, “What?” And I was like, “Yeah.” You know? You can’t tell your mom! I had never told anybody. Not for many, many years. 
AS: So you didn’t tell your mom? 
WL: No, I didn’t tell my mother until I was thirty-three years old. That was five, six, and seven. Probably almost to eight years old when that occured until my babysister got old enough to really get in the way and know what was going on. It was the full gambit of sexual molestation. It was not good and it warped my sense of sexuality and perceived position and appropriateness. As a young six, seven, eight year old I would grab grown women in wrong spots because I thought it was okay. I didn’t know any different. 
I was punished for things but I didn’t know what was going on. My stepfather uses a belt and a stick and his hand to try to correct everything. I am really confused. I have a double bind situation going on where I have this thing going on and I can’t tell because it is a secret and if I tell I am going to get in trouble, but I’m getting punished because of the behavior and the behavior is because of the thing that I can’t tell about. 
I started to eat. Eating was my first addiction. I would eat everything and anything. Crackers, cups of sugar, anything I could find in the house to the degree that my mother had to put a lock on the refrigerator door. An actual combination lock on that and on the pantry doors because I would get up in the middle of the night and eat, or I would get up earlier than they because they were out doing this band thing until four in the morning. They were exhausted and drunk and they would sleep until noon. She would lock us in our rooms. They put locks on the outside of our doors so we would just have to stay in our rooms until noon. I remember as a kid I would piss in the closet because I couldn’t get out to pee or anything. I would just pee in the corner of the closet. I had a boot that I would pee in every once in awhile and then pour it out the window. I would hide food in there the night before because I knew I was going to be hungry. I remember packs of white almond bark I would put in my underwear drawer and stack it in there because I knew the following morning I could sit and eat white almond bark. 
AS: Were you in the same room as your sister?
WL: At first, yes. We stayed in the same room. There was a time where we had to separate because I think I was being inappropriate with her. They separated us in two different rooms. We would talk to each other through the doors. I would say, “Go holler for mom.” When she would holler she would come. When I would holler for mom she wouldn’t. I would entice her, “Go holler for mom.” This is all normal. This is what everybody goes through! This is just a stage. [laugh] You laugh because otherwise you cry, obviously. 
I ate and ate and ate and at nine or ten years old I was pretty obese. I was getting teased I remember. Uncles used to grab my fat rolls and squeeze and shake them. They would pinch so hard that it would leave black and blue marks. It was as if they were going to try to rip it off me. Again, I’m this dark skinned, young—the word they would use was bastard. They would call me a little bastard child. I didn’t even know what that was. I ended up using it one time when my stepdad was around. I was mad or something and I said bastard and he came at me with a wrench in his hand and ended up cutting my brow. He said, “We don’t use that language.” And I didn’t even know it was language. That’s what my uncles called me. I didn’t even know that was a swear word. I was learning. I was getting it down one cut at a time. I ate to soothe. 
By age twelve was my first drink. I remember distinctly this young kid came over to the house and he had a can of Tab in his hand. I said, “Give me a drink of that” and he said, “No, you don’t want any of that.” I said, “Yeah. Give me a drink.” He said, “You don’t want none of this.” I said, “What is it?” He said, “It’s whiskey.” I was like, “I want some!” “No. You can’t handle it.” I grabbed that can away from him and guzzled half of it. I remember him getting mad because I was drinking all his whiskey. 
It was Tab and Sloe gin. I’ll never forget that warmth in my belly and how fuzzy my mind felt. That overwhelming warmth. It was almost as if I was seeing the world through new eyes. Everything was brighter. I could run faster, jump higher, ride my bike faster. I loved it. I just recalled that my stepdad had some of this and it was in the basement. They had a whole liquor cabinet . A bar. I was like, “We can get more now!” He said, “Okay!” So, the first time I drank I got intoxicated to puking because I didn’t know how much was enough. Now, with my addiction you can see that I had this propensity to escape into whatever I could find. Having that I was like, “Okay, I am going to drink this.” Twelve, thirteen, and fourteen— 
AS: Did you get caught at that point?
WL: No. Actually, I didn’t. My parents were very removed from parenting. They were actually just like people that lived in the same house. We took care of ourselves. We parented ourselves. They would throw down a couple of bags of Doritos and a frozen pizza and they’d leave.
Probably at about twelve I started babysitting my nine year old sister, my six year old half brother, and my next half brother was three. I was taking care of them at age twelve and stealing from the old man’s liquor cabinet the second they walk out the door. That works. 
AS: Did you get a baby sitting badge? [laughs]
WL: I went to babysitting training, but omitted that I used alcohol. I didn’t want to lose my badge. [laughs]
From eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve it was all food until I found liquor. It was quicker, so there was no reason to continue to eat. I still had a hard time with food and portion distortion and governing my amounts and kinds. There was always this lack of food in our house. We were poor, we didn’t have much money. We had government cheese, powdered milk, WIC [Women, Infants, and Children] came out about that time. Food was a commodity that was scarce. When it did come around—
AS: When it was there you ate as much as you could. 
WL: All of it to the point where my mother would not store food in open areas. My other siblings used food as their comfort as well. She became obese very quickly because of it. It was a great way to escape into Doritos or a frozen pizza instead of thinking of how shitty life is. How we don’t get encouraged and loved. There was no parenting at all. Again, we lived with them. 
The drinking continued on an every other day or every day basis to the degree that I started stealing beer from garages around the community. In Minnesota there is this thing where you have the house refrigerator and then you have the garage refrigerator. The garage refrigerator is full of beer and liquor and wine coolers. And sometimes old cake from graduation or something. You break into a garage and you steal a case of Stross thirty pack and a cake because you are going to get hammered and then maybe eat some cake after. So, that was always a treat. 
We would steal beer for quite a long time there. The alcoholism really got to a point where I would drink at school. I remember taking paneling off the wall in my bedroom—a whole four by eight sheet of paneling—and I pulled the nails out, pulled the paneling away, and then on the cross member two by fours I stacked [unclear beer name] beers inside the wall when I would steal from these garages. I had several cases of these beers stored in the walls. That way when I was quarantined to my room and locked in there I was okay. I could survive because I had several cases of beer in the wall. 
My parents have since sold that house and I really thought I want to go back and pull that paneling—I wonder if they ever remodeled because to pull that off there there were empty cans of beer in that wall. Lots. There was another spot I put empties. Another piece of paneling that I took off where I left a four foot portion and then I crumpled them and put them in the wall in the insulation. Probably not much of an ‘r’ value there with the aluminum. [laughs] I wonder if some of the cans were tin? No, I don’t think I was that old. 
The drinking got really sickening for me to the point where I would buy booze—I would get other adults in the community to buy me booze. I started working for a dairy farmer out of town and there was this man named Chizzy and he was one of the hired hands and he was an alcoholic. I think that out of all things I have this real intuitiveness. As soon as I saw this guy I knew he was an alcoholic. I knew he was a drinker. I went up to Chizzy and I said, “Listen, if you get me a six pack of beer tonight I’ll buy you a six pack.” He said, “I better not do that.” I said, “Come on.” “Alright.” So, that became our arrangement. He got a six pack then I got a six pack. Pretty soon I would get a thirty pack of Strauss and he would still get a six pack because Chizzy started to rely on my income for his alcohol. That’s how I kept him. I just made sure that he always knew that I was going to hook him up almost every day. I became the guy to get alcohol from in ninth or tenth grade. If you needed beer you came to Wade, but I’m charging a premium. If they want a case of beer it’s going to cost them double. One for you and I get one. I would store it in my room. I would, at times, literally have hundreds of beers. Warm, in my room, stored. I drank warm beer and I didn’t care. I would slam them by the threes and fours and get the buzz on. It wasn’t for the flavor. 
I graduated to alcohol and liquor and whiskey and I just got tired of beer. I went to everclear and it was the next level. Until I started blacking out and wandering around town and didn’t know where I was or how I got there. Where’s my bicycle. Pretty soon it was, Where did I leave my truck? When I was sixteen I ended up getting and 1971 K-Ten Blazer. That probably was a bad mistake. I never did get a DUI; I was smart enough to know that if I was going to drink I was going to walk. I just knew I couldn’t drive. I was not that good. I was a sloppy drunk. I didn’t want to drive. It was too nervewracking for me. I like to find a spot in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of people, or towards the end with just myself, and just drink. 
That’s how it went until I was seventeen years old when I was introduced to marijuana. I took a job at Kentucky Fried Chicken and one of the employees who was an adult said to me, “Hey, I’m going to consult the dugout on break. You in?” Like you, I did the same thing. Eyebrows down and I was like, What the hell does that mean? I didn’t want him to think I wasn’t cool, so I looked at him and said, “Sure.” Breaktime comes around and we stand outside. He pulls out this little wooden box and puts this little steel bat in there and he goes, “Here.” I said, “Go ahead. You go first” because I didn’t know how to do it! [laughs] I had no idea how to do it. 
AS: You had a good sense of how to get somebody else to show you. 
WL: “You go ahead, go ahead.” I’ll watch. I’ll learn. He hits this oneie [a smoking device], smokes his weed, and hands it to me and I did it. I think I took two, maybe three puffs, and then we went back in at the end of the break and I thought, This did nothing. I hate weed! It’s stupid. Ten minutes later I’m giggling. I just can’t stop laughing. We are throwing chicken across the kitchen, into the friers, I mean, I’m just doing stuff and it is the funnest, most funniest day in my entire life. I can still remember today how we played with flour, throwing food, giggling at patrons as they are coming in. I was so in love with marijuana I thought, Where were you when I needed you most? Where were you when I was eight and nine years old? I could have used you then, but welcome to my wonderful world. We are going to have such a wonderful love affair. 
I think I probably stopped drinking almost immediately. I asked him if I could get a little bit of that to go. I asked him how I could get it. He would sell me joints for a while until I said, “I can’t afford however many dollars for each joint. How much for a bag of that?” Within a couple of weeks I’m walking around with a bag of pot in my pocket everyday. That became my new love affair. 
In the tenth grade I met this gal who I really was head over heels for. She was in college and I was in tenth grade and I thought that was great. I had scored. I definitely scored. She was cute, but she didn’t like weed at all. I had to hide it. That was hard to do because it’s stinky. There was a lot of fighting back and forth. “You can’t do that, but it is okay to drink.” That was the social expectation in my community: drinking was fine, but don’t smoke weed. Don’t be a druggie. That’s what they would call them. It’s okay if you are bombed off your ass with alcohol, but not marijuana.
When I met her I tried really hard to moderate. I tried to not use, and it wasn’t easy. When I tried to stop using marijuana I’d go back to alcohol. It was like, I can’t do this. She wound up getting pregnant when I was in the tenth grade. Now, I’m going to be a dad. Now I need to get my poop in a group. This is not a good idea to do this and try to be a dad. School is not good. I am starting to experience this—looking back on it I can see it plainly today—there’s this emotion disregulation that has happened because of all the prior stuff. I go from zero to one hundred with anger. So quickly. 
AS: At this age, you mean?
WL: Yeah. Throwing things, breaking car windows, slashing tires. I don’t know if this is incriminating, but we’ll say I think the limits are out, but my principal at one point told me, “You’re nothing but a piece of shit. You’re going to end up in prison before you even graduate.” He called me a bunch of names and I walked out of his office. That night I went back to school and I cut every wire in his brand new Chevy S-10 that I could to teach him a lesson. That you don’t fuck with me. I was that kind of person. Very malicious. If you wronged me I will burn you’re house down. I will cut you’re car up. I will do something to hurt you. I will do something to retaliate. I can plainly see today that that was supressed anger and emotion from all the PTSD that I was dealing with at the time. I didn’t know how to deal with it. If I wasn’t self medicating it was coming out other ways. 
In the eleventh grade I joined the military. 
AS: What happened with the pregnancy?
WL: She had him. Zach was born on the sixth of November in my eleventh grade year. I went on about being a teenager and a dad. I went to basic training through my eleventh and twelfth year. It was called spit training at that time. I went to basic and then came home for my senior year. I was excused from ninth grade English all together. I never took English. Don’t tell my master’s program that. [laughs] “Do you have all your credits?” “Everything but ninth grade English.” My senior year the principal and I had an understanding that I only needed to come to school twice a week. As long as I showed up and did the tests I didn’t have to do anything else. I worked two or three jobs at the time. I worked at Perkins at night where I bused tables. I worked at Godfather’s Pizza during the rushes to deliver pizza’s, and another restaurant job someplace, but I can’t remember. But I had three jobs. 
I finally fought back at that point with my stepdad. I omitted most of this, but he used to hit me with everything. He used to have a two by four that he carved his hand into. It said Board of Education on it. It literally was a fucking two by four. When he would hit me I would put my hands behind my back to try to guard my ass and he’d break a finger periodically. That pinky finger right there has been broken so many times. It is just part of the deal, but I would never cry and I prided myself on the fact that I would never cry. I remember him asking the question: “Have you had enough?” My response: No. He would bring it again. Whack, whack, whack. He would keep hitting until he was tired. Guess who won? Me. That’s how it was. That’s how my will was. You can beat the shit out of me, but you will not break my will. It will not happen. That has carried over into adulthood, of course. 
AS: It also shows a very strong core person. 
WL: Tenacity. Unending tenacity. 
AS: Whatever we want to call it it is a survival—
WL: He called it stubborn. I like to shift it into tenacity!
AS: It is also a survival mechanism. 
WL: I would just go to the other place. When I’m getting hit I would just go to the other place where it didn’t hurt. I didn’t feel anything. I can hear it. I can see it. I can’t feel it. It’s not there. It never did work. I think he threw me up on the cupboard one morning. It was bright and early. I had come home and I was drinking and he punched me in the face, and once in the gut and then threw me up on the counter. He was hitting me over and over and my mother got involved. She was crying and grabbing onto him. He hit her with his elbow as he is coming back to hit me again. That’s when it ended. I came back at him. It wasn’t with a knife. It wasn’t with anything. I just came back at him with all I had and it wasn’t enough. After all of that I had had enough. I didn’t come back. I moved out. Went and stayed with friends for a while. 
I ended up buying a 1974 Schult mobile home. They rented to me out at the skyrise mobile village. 
AS: Were you seventeen?
WL: Yes, seventeen years old. 
AS: This is all still in Sleepy Eye, New Ulm area. Even within that, at fourteen years old I had found out that I was adopted by him and it was this huge shellshock of, You have to be fucking kidding me. You beat me from the time I was able to remember until I was fourteen and you’re not even my fucking dad? You don’t get to do that. It was at fourteen, fifteen when I started fighting back. 
I’ll get to this later, but there has been a shift today where it’s not like that anymore. 
AS: With him?
WL: Yeah. He’s very remorseful, timid, and apologetic in his way. We don’t talk about it, of course, we do the Minnesota thing. [laughs] Even as a psychotherapist I know not to touch that. What good is it going to do? Shame him? Make him feel terrible that he was unable to parent in an effective manner? He was born and raised by an alcoholic, my grandfather, anyways. You just do what you learn and that’s what he did. 
Going back to progression. From my senior I had to go back to AIT, which is advanced infantry training. I went to Newark, New Jersey. It was during that time that my then fiance was coming into being twenty-one years old, visiting bars. I had learned while I was active duty that she cheated on me. I wasn’t there to break shit and hurt her and retaliate, so I just shut off. I shut down all my emotions. I shut down everything and was like, You’re done. You’re dead to me. That was pretty much how it went. 
I went back home after AIT. There was this brief time where we tried to make it work, but I couldn’t let go of the fact that she had been with someone else. I took a job in Iowa just to get away. I remember driving away that day with all my shit in that same K10 Blazer driving to Iowa with her holding Zach and running down the road begging me not to leave. I never turned around. I took this job at another restaurant down there and lived in a little house by myself. I would assistant manage this restaurant during the day and hold on all day until I could get Stauss at night and drink. It gets rid of all of the pain. I would fill up these to-go cups of beer—like six of them every night out of the keg—and it wouldn’t cost me anything. 
AS: From the restaurant?
WL: Yeah. I would go home and drink these six large drinks of beer nightly until I’m puking. One day I got promoted to manager and they moved me to Indianola, Iowa and I’m still doing the same behavior, but moderating a little bit. Not by much. I had been introduced to a lot more by then. I was introduced to cocaine and methamphetamine. This was in 1993 and 1994 when crank was big in Iowa. That was when I met my now current wife. She was going to Simpson College at the time and she walked in after a football game on October third. I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. She comes up, puts her order in, and I’m being Joe-Cool and I say, “It’s on me.” Didn’t card her, didn’t care. I was just giving her the stare the whole time she was in the restaurant. Just straight up cute. She comes up and asks for another beer and of course it’s on me and we would chit chat for a little bit and then she goes and sits down. 
The one thing about me is I don’t think I have ever asked a woman out ever in my life. It goes back to being sexually molested by a woman, you know, I’m intimidated by women in most cases. Of course, being a psychoanalyst I’m going to analyze my own behavior. If it wasn’t for my wife, who was the girl that I gave beer to, she called me that night at home. One of my employees called and said, “Hey, the girl that you gave that beer to? She called in and wants your number.” I’m like, “Yeah, idiot, give it to her! You have to call me to ask that? Dumb! Give her the number.” She calls.
AS: It is appropriate for him to call and ask. [laughs]
WL: Yeah, but I think I was nineteen or twenty years old at the time. I didn’t care. She could be an axe murderer. It’s a female! Have her call! Because I don’t have the gumption to say, “Hey, you’re hot. Do you want to go out?” That wouldn’t have happened. That has never happened for me. 
She calls me at home and said, “Hey, I just wanted to call and say thanks for the beer.” “Yeah. Cool. Great.” “I’m going to this frat party. Do you want to go?” That was not okay, because I was not frat party material. Even the word frat party doesn’t fit. I am lower than blue collar. I don’t go to school. I had asked to go to college when I was in the eighth or ninth grade and my mother laughed at me. I don’t go to college. This is not me. I said, “Yeah. I’ll go. Tell you what why don’t you come over to my duplex first and I’ll get changed and we can go from here.” “Okay.” She comes over. We never leave the house. I got her drunk or high that first night and we had sex on the living room floor. I didn’t feel comfortable going to that frat party. Plus, she’s hot as heck and didn’t—
AS: Didn’t want to watch other guys looking at her. 
WL: No, not at all. She left that night. The following day she called me again and we have this real quick she wants to talk to me everyday and I’m enthralled by it. She is just cute as a button and I had just got done talking to my old fiance about three days prior to meeting her. I had talked her into moving down to Iowa and it was because I was lonely. I wanted to uphold my responsibility in being a father to my son who was now two. I convinced her and she rented a U-Haul and she put everything in the U-Haul and she was coming the following Friday. That same Friday. The weekend happened with this new girl and she keeps calling me and my old fiance moves in and puts all of her things in my duplex. This new girl is telling me, “I don’t care if you smoke weed. That’s fine with me. You can drink. I don’t care if you do that.” I’m thinking, My finance is not okay with that. You are. I didn’t know what to do. 
Fiance is there about two days and we get into our first fight. Immediately I’m thinking, You’re gone. My fiance leaves for the weekend and she’s coming back the following Monday with her mom with more stuff. Colleen comes to the house, this new girlfriend, she stays, the following morning she is in the shower and I go to work. My fiance comes home, raps on the door several times with a ‘who the fuck is in there’ type screaming directive, and this new girlfriend comes walking out in this skimpy green robe and waits until my fiance collects up all of her belongings out of the bathroom and walks out. She grabs as much as she can and leaves and calls me—the girlfriend calls me—at work: “Did your fiance have blondish-brown hair?” “Yeah.” “I think she was just here.” “Oh shoot. Okay. How are you?” “Yeah, she screamed at me and I thought she was going to hit me, but she didn’t. She left. I think her mother was here.” I’m like, Oh great her mother was here, too. 
I’ve got this history with this woman, I can’t stand to be alone, so I have her move down and then my girlfriend is in the bathroom. I had to make a decision immediately. The desicion was already made, but I can say this with all authority that when I made that decision I didn’t love the new girl at all, but that was the choice I made.
AS: Would you say it was because of her tolerance for you’re using?
WL: Definitely. She was okay with it. It was the first time I had ever heard that from any girl. It was always, I don’t want you to do that. Don’t do that. There was always this control factor. So, that drew me to her. That was the deciding factor. You allow me to do drugs, so you’re in and she’s out. That started quite a long love affair with drugs not her. 
She ends up moving in with me. We cohabitate for quite awhile. Her parents are really—I don’t want to say strict and Christian—but they have a moral value system. You don’t live together before marriage. You do this the way it is supposed to be done. My wife—that girl—is telling her parents that she is living on campus, but she’s really living with me so they are paying for a dorm, and she’s living with me and we are engaging in all kinds of drug use. We start using meth and cocaine. Mostly meth at the time because cocaine was cheap and hard to come by. We get involved with some people that are cooking so they are making it in their bathtub. We get it cheap and I start selling it on the side. I’m selling it here and there. There’re several years there when I just went from job to job because I could never keep a job because of the drug use. 
Colleen and I got married in ‘93. Six months after meeting her I asked her to marry me. I lost my job at the restaurant because of drug use. I was manipulating money to meet a bonus structure for labor. I ended up getting caught, so I got fired. Fired meant that I wasn’t just going to find another job, I was going to go home. I don’t have any money. I went back to Sleepy Eye, Minnesota and lived in my parents’ basement. I got this girl from Iowa who is calling me, is okay with me smoking dope, and my brain went, How do I get out of Sleepy Eye? I’ll ask her to marry me. I drove down to Iowa. I went to her dorm room and got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. She said yes. I did that so I could get out of Sleepy Eye. I didn’t do it because I loved her. I did it because I wanted out and I wanted to go back to drug use again. I couldn’t use weed and alcohol and methamphetamine in my parents’ basement and get away with it. 
Her parents helped us get an apartment in Clive, which is a suburb of Des Moines. They said, “If you are going to get married we are cutting her off from nursing school. She will have to do that on her own.” “Okay, fine.” Well, I ended up slinging dope and working in a restaurant to pay for her college. I don’t know how much weed, but by the quarter pound we would buy it and flip it, buy it and flip it.
AS: So she could go to nursing school?
WL: So she could go to nursing school! Yeah. I put her through nursing school. She is a great nurse. She is the director of nurses now. The whole foundation on which she stands is based in drug sales. That’s how I financed that. Much more lucrative than trying to work an hourly wage. 
She graduates, gets a job as a nurse, and I am constantly trying to tell her to bring some fentanyl home. Some kind of an opiate of some sort. Tell them that it fell on the ground and you threw it out. Big deal. Bless her heart her upbringing prevented her from ever doing it. She would never do it. I stopped asking. It was not going to happen. 
I ended up learning that I wanted to be a white collar person. I was up late one night at two or three in the morning and I was watching Carleton Sheets. You can buy property no money down. I know this sounds funny, but when you’re an uneducated kid from Sleepy Eye, Minnesota you don’t know how to become anything other than a factory worker. Make calendars. You don’t know anything. I am watching this TV program and I’m half soused and I thought, I’m just going to do that. I’m going to be a white collar worker. I am going to get some suits and I’m going to buy and sell real estate. I am going to flip houses. That’s what I am going to do. No money down!
The longer I am sitting there I am thinking if they make a lot of money I bet realtors make a lot of money. I looked at my wife at the time and I said, “How do you become a realtor?” She said, “I don’t know.” I called a realtor the following morning. I said, “Hey, I was watching this program last night and I was thinking about how to become a realtor.” He said, “Well, who am I talking to?” I told him my name and he said, “My name is Mark Grossman. I’m with Iowa realty.” We talked for a little bit and I said, “Yeah. I really want to do this.” He said, “You sound like you’ve got the gift of gab. Why don’t you come down to the office?” I went down and there and he told me I was hired. He said, “I’ll put you through real estate school, you’ll get your license, and you can work for us. You will get this commission rate. Every time you sell a house for one hundred thousand dollars you get three percent of any home you sell.” I was like, “Three percent. Are you kidding me? Done! I’ll do that.” 
I studied hard and I really applied myself. This was the first time that I moderated my alcohol, I moderated my marijuana use to very low amounts. A little weed here or there, but nothing to where I am losing continuity. I am still plugged in. I am learning. I studied hard. I don’t know how many weeks this course was, but I had to take my boards and I got a ninety-eight. I got a ninety-eight. I knew this stuff by the back of my hand. I was going to become a millionaire. That’s what I was going to do. 
I started working for Iowa Realty and I slowly realized that it was not what I thought it was going to be. You sit in these open houses for a long time and you don’t have anyone that calls you and you have to make cold calls. I met some people that were selling conventionally listed properties on contract. Basically you take this conventionally listed property and you create a contract, sell it to a third party investor, give cash to the seller, enough to pay off the brokerage fees, and a contract to the buyer enough so that I get paid, the broker gets paid, the seller gets their money, but the people who buy get an inflated price with an inflated interest rate. I put adds in the paper saying: Bad credit? No problem. I can get you a house. Call Wade. The phone rang and rang and rang. 
In the first year I think I did forty-three thousand dollars in income because I was closing deal after deal. It was very shoddy because I was putting people into a fifty thousand dollar house, and they were signing notes for a seventy-five thousand dollar contract with a fourteen to eighteen percent interest rate. They were not getting anything that was going to end up being theirs for seven years and then going back to the owner. Or, in this case, back to the contract holder, which was the third party investor out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
AS: This is what happened with the housing market. 
WL: Yeah, it’s illegal now. [laughs] I am to thank for that. 
AS: You were just part of it. 
WL: The other part is that during the open house period I found that using open houses as meeting places to do dope deals was the most protective thing I could ever do. I had a key code for every listed property in the whole entire city of Des Moines. I ended up getting in contact with some people that were a part of certain organizations that I really don’t want to get into. We would move larger quantities through these residential homes because they were empty. I would let them know: don’t show up with shitty cars and thumping music. Show up in a suit and tie. Show up in your grandmother’s Ford Tempo, and you walk in as though you are interested in buying my house. 
AS: Were these houses that were empty as in completely empty? No one was living in them?
WL: Correct. They were prospective homes. 
AS: Oh, okay for builders. 
WL: Some vacant properties because they have been gone for awhile and they are looking to sell them. I would pick the ones that I knew nobody was coming around to. We wouldn’t stay long, but it was an easy spot to do a switch of money and dope and not have problems. I was the go-to person. I was the one to facilitate the transaction more than anything else, but I took my part, which was money and dope at the time. 
AS: What was it at that time that you were using?
WL: Crank. It was all crank back then. It was pure and clean. It was biker crank. 
AS: It was cocaine?
WL: It was methamphetamine. Very much methamphetamine. Not coke. 
All of a sudden we have this situation where there is an investigation. The investigation was getting bigger and bigger and the name RICO came out. I said we are leaving. We are done, we are out, and we are moving. At the time I had a friend moving to Kentucky with his wife who was a postmaster. We asked if we could go with and said we were sick of Des Moines. Maybe we can crash with you guys for a couple of weeks so we can find a place? They said yes. 
AS: What is RICO?
WL: RICO: Investigation Racketeering [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations].
AS: Oh, with the business?
WL: It wasn’t the realty business. It was the dope deal and everyone that was involved with what we were moving. To be implicated in something like that meant I could do some real time and I don’t do time. That’s just not me. I did one day in jail my whole entire life and that was enough for me. 
AS: You were deciding to clean up your act at this point?
WL: Well, no. [laughs] We are just out, we are just leaving. We sold as much as we could and left what we couldn’t sell and we went. We started over. I took a job as a bartender and my wife took a job as the steady-Eddy she is as a nurse. She got a transfer with the company that she was with in Iowa, so that worked to our advantage. We just tried to settle into our new lives living in this foreign land called Kentucky. I took a job with a country club. It was the oldest most prestigious: Harmony Landing Country Club. It was just old money. A lot of old money. I learned how to serve and how to be a good servant. I put the fork and the knife in the right spot, how to pour mint juleps, how to accept hundred dollar bills as tips. How to drink vodka and Diet Coke so that I don’t gain weight and they don’t smell it. A year after that, of course, I got fired for being drunk on the job. Whoops. I knew I shouldn’t have drank that gin that night. 
So, I stole alcohol from them for quite awhile. There is this underculture of drugs. Just to ask somebody in a mixed grouping if they partake is just code enough. “So, do you partake?” You don’t even have to say the word. It doesn’t even have to be what you do. Do you do this or this? It is “Do you partake.” “Yeah.” 
AS: If you say partake to someone who doesn’t they will know. 
WL: They will go, “What?” And you go, “Oh, nevermind. I thought you were somebody else.” [laughs] There is this underculture where you kind of take care of each other. When you are out you ask somebody else and they will cover you and back and forth and that is how it all works. I soon became a part of that culture again in Kentucky. I battled it. The crank followed us down there. I ended up having my first psychotic break and it was after a nine-day stint where I was awake for nine days and I had been playing around with the shotgun for however many days. I tried to commit suicide by sticking the shotgun in my mouth that night. 
Obviously I didn’t pull the trigger, but the following day I woke up and I was broken. I just needed to get this fixed. Again, I don’t know what to do. I go and asked my wife and I said, “Hey, when someone is this fucked up what do they do?” She said, “I don’t know either. I will talk to my medical director and find out.” I said, “Don’t use my name!” she said, “Of course I’m not going to use your name.” She finds out there is a place you can go for treatment and you get treatment and there it is. I’m like, “Okay, that’s what we’ll do. I’ll get treatment and I’ll be good.” I went to a center and I’m sitting around in this group of people who are all probably almost twice my age at least. 
AS: How old were you at this point?
WL: First time I went into treatment I was probably twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two. I was probably twenty-three.
AS: This is the late nineties?
WL: Yeah. Colleen is so much better with dates. I was probably twenty-three years old and everyone was twice my age. The counselor is wearing a plaid shirt and has a pen protector and I’m thinking, What the fuck am I doing here? He comes around to me and says, “Wade, how about you? How are you? What is going on with you?” “I’m fine.” “Really?” “Yeah. I’m fine. I’ve been listening to all you old people sitting here talking about how fucked up your lives are. You should all do what I did: quit!” I had just quit like three days before. “Quit! I did.” You could hear the snickers. Everybody is breaking. I was like, “What?” I didn’t even know. I got through their program. I went every time. 
AS: Was it outpatient?
WL: Yeah. It was so many weeks. I was working construction at the time framing houses. I came home one night and I told Colleen, “I know I can’t have meth. I know that. But, a beer is not going to kill me.” I went and got a six pack of beer and we both had beer. I drank the rest of it that night. The following day I got some meth. The very following day. But now she doesn’t know I’m doing it because I’m not sharing. I had to fake sleep. 
AS: Was she using?
WL: Nope, she was not. 
AS: In the beginning she did a little bit?
WL: She did it in the beginning. Just a little bit, and it scared the hell out of her. Demons and these shadow people and all these drug induced paranoid schizophrenic delusions that you have. I will leave the neurobiology out of it because it doesn’t pertain to the story, but that’s what happens. I’m back on meth again and I can’t not do it because it is so alluring, but I have to pretend like I’m sleeping. At ten o’clock I go lay down with her until I hear her fall asleep. I sneak out of bed and commence to smoking meth all night long until my alarm goes off at about ten to five and I slip back into bed and close my eyes. When her alarm goes off I open my eyes as if I slept all night long. “Morning. I’m going to go take a shower.” That was day three, day four, day five. I would do four or five days in a row like that until it all fell apart, obviously. 
I think it was in ‘97 that I fell off the cable end of a roof nineteen feet. This was October. There was dew on the roof. I was up there to take off some pump jacks and my tennis shoes started to slip and I turned over crab-style and I jumped off the roof because I tried to correct the trajectory of my fall. I thought if I jumped maybe I would just break both of my legs, but I’d still be alive. The trajectory took me forward. One arm went underneath me and I peppered my left wrist, punctured my lung, concussion. I’m whispering my dying wishes to a buddy named Gary in this indentation of dirt where I landed. The next thing I heard was choppers in the background. They called the ambulance and they had to lifeflight me because we were about five miles out of town. That was the last I remember until I woke up in the emergency room. 
Colleen tells me there was a chaplain that met her at Mercy Hospital and said, “There’s a good chance that he may not be okay.” That was the next stopping point, which was usually some physiological, some accident, something that brings me to this point where I’m like, I can’t do this anymore. I thought at that point that I needed a safe job. I needed something that doesn’t have a risk of falling fifty feet to my death. I saw this add for carpet cleaner and I thought that it was a technical job, I would get paid fifteen bucks an hour. I’ll take that. 
I go interview and the guy looks at me from across the table and says, “You’ve got the gift of gab.” I thought, “Shit, I’ve heard this before.” He said, “I’ll tell you what. This is a commission job, but we send you out with a certain amount of money. It is about fifty bucks on the ticket. All you’ve got to do is sell more rooms.” “All I have to do is sell more rooms? Really? For cleaning?” “Yeah, all you have to do is sell more rooms. Add them on. If you get it up to one hundred bucks you will get thirty.” That couldn’t be that hard. I would do four of those in a day, that’s one hundred and twenty dollars a day. I could live on that. “Done. You’ve got a deal.” 
I come to find out that I’m really good at that. I would take tickets from forty-five dollars to one hundred dollars really fast. I wasn’t a bad looking young man. Plus, I had this gift of gab. I did really good work. When I’m working I work hard. I would clean the carpets and I would show the lady in the house the carpets. I would say, “I’ve got a quote for you in the other room.”
AS: She’s got one clean room and four dirty rooms! Because it was only forty-four dollars. 
WL: That’s right. By the time I’m leaving I’m collecting a check for three hundred and fifty buck and I’m making one hundred and something per house. I’m making three to four hundred dollars per house. I was thinking, I’m really good at this and I really like this, too. One day Jimmy comes up to me, the guy I was working with, and he says, “Here, take a couple of these.” He hands me a couple Vicodin. I said, “What the hell do I want them for?” He said, “Fine.” I was like, God, this reminds me of something. Then I was like, “Yeah, I want those. Let me try those.” “Oh, you can’t have two of them.” “Give me two! I could probably do three. Give me two.” I fell in love. Vicodin was it for me. 
AS: Every time you get a new drug you’re like, Oh, that’s the one. 
WL: Yeah. I went to Jimmy and asked if I could get five or six more of those for the weekend. He said, “I don’t have anymore.” I asked him where he got them and if he could hook me up. “ I can’t tell you where I got them.” I was like, “Come on dude. All of a sudden now you’re Mr. Secret.” “If I tell you you can’t tell anyone.” “Of course.” “You get them from the bathrooms.” “What are you talking about?” “When you go to your customer’s house you ask them if you can use the restroom. They are in there.” “In every house?” “Not in every house, but most of them.” “Really?” 
I couldn’t wait until that following Monday. I had my eight a.m. appointment. The first thing I do after I get going was to ask if I could use the restroom. I opened up the medicine cabinet and it was almost like hearing angel’s sing. There were like three bottles of Vicodin in there. They were Vicodin tens—blues. I was like you have to be shitting me. This is awesome. I just took them all. 
AS: You took them all?
WL: I took them all. I had no couth. I didn’t care. My addiction overrode any common sense that might come into play. I looked at the dates and they had expired. I didn’t think they were going to be digging around in there. They were expired. 
AS: They were so old that nobody was using them.
WL: Well, they were like a year old. They weren’t nineteen years old and rancid. [laughs] 
AS: Well, we know they couldn’t have gotten them that long ago. 
WL: They were expired and I knew she wasn’t using them currently. It seemed like every house I went to had them. If it wasn’t Vicodin it was Percocet. Big, orange, Percocet tens.
AS: If this ‘98, ‘99?
WL: Oh yeah. 
AS: We are right in the deluge. 
WL: I was there when Oxycontin hit the street. I remember finding the big yellow oxy eighties. I found a whole pack of them in this guy’s safe. It wasn’t locked. I am digging around everywhere to find dope I don’t care. If the lady is downstairs I will go through her underwear drawer, through her jewelry drawer, I will go through everything to get these oxys.
AS: With the machine on so it sounds like you are working. 
WL: I can run the machine with one hand and dig around with the other hand to find them. Exactly. I started collecting them in a Ball jar. We would exchange those and it became a currency in our company. “I’ll give you ten fives for two tens” because it had less acetaminophen in it. My wife being a nurse was teaching me that I could only take so many of these in a day before my liver would give out. I bought a PDR—a physician desk reference. I could cross reference medications to their size and type to know what they were just in case I found a bottle that was unmarked. 
AS: Pretty resourceful. [laughs]
WL: Thank you! Thank you! [laughs] I knew you’d see the value in that. Every once in a while that would catch me though. There were times when I ended up taking a barbituate that I didn’t know was a barbituate. Luckily by this time I’m doing so well in my carpet cleaning that I have an assistant or two. Within the first year and a half the first franchise owner sold the franchise to me and one other employee. The other employee was the telemarketing side that would call and set up the jobs and I was the field side. I did all the carpet cleaning and took care of all the guys. 
All the guys used. Every one of them. I would use that as pay and bonus at times. If they would run a job at five o’clock that needed to be ran and no one else would run I would say, “Listen, you run this and I’ll throw five oxys in for you.” I used it as currency and it was very effective. They would do things for oxys that they wouldn’t do for cash. I would tell them I would give them two hundred dollars to run the job and they wouldn’t do it. Then I would say I would give them three oxys and it was done. 
That whole time we were stealing pills. There were times where we could find someone who really liked Darvocet—I don’t know why—but they would like Darvocet. I would collect up all the Darvocet and I would sell it for one chunk of money or exchange it for what I liked. We had guys that really liked benzodiazepines. I would take them not because I like benzos, but because I could exchange them. It was a currency. It has a value system. One orange football Xanax is worth a specific dollar amount. Very little, but very specific. This continued until I lost my franchise in 2002. 
I went to treatment a couple more times in between there. Always for someone else, never for me. Colleen caught on that I was using again when things had gotten desperate and I went again when I was twenty six. One more time again when I was twenty-eight or twenty-nine. It was always these outpatients that weren’t very effective. 
AS: Did you have kids by this point?
WL: The twins were born in 2000. This was 2002 so they were two at this point. At the point they were born I was sober for a very short period of time. The one thing that I’m not proud of, and I will share this, is that when the twins were born my wife almost died on the table because she was preaclapsic. She had Josie and then she fell asleep and was bleeding internally. Jake was still in there. 
AS: She had a natural birth?
WL: The medication infiltrated. The spinal tap didn’t work, it came out. It created this huge pustule in her back of medication that never got to her. I convinced her that it was working because the doctor didn’t tell her it was working. They only told me and I said, “Don’t tell her.” I looked at her and I grabbed her by the collar as she is in excruciating pain and dying because of blood loss. She said, “It hurts so bad.” And I said, “Can you imagine how bad it would hurt if you didn’t have the pain medication? Now push!” She pushed and Jake was born. He was born not breathing so they had to intubate him and he began to breath immediately. Now she was the problem. She was dying. I am sober through this whole time. I am seeing all the things I have done and I’m like, Holy shit, I’m going to be here with the twins and she is going to die and I’m not going to know what to do. I can’t hold it together. The first thing I thought of was, There is no way I am going to be able to stay sober and take care of these babies. That is not going to happen. That all went through my mind immediately. 
They stabilize her. They get her breathing and she is fine. They take her to the room and a few hours after, maybe five or six, some people come and visit and it is towards the evening. There was a movie store—this is back when there were movie stores—and she said, “Why don’t you go grab a movie and we can watch a movie and you can lay by me here in bed.” I went and used. I came back and she was crashing again. She was dying. Now I smell like weed and beer and even today I’m just mortified by it because it is so reminiscent of what the addict does. You use no matter what. 
Her oxygen drops into the seventies. They are about ready to intubate but she bounces back one more time. I get this look from this nurse. I will never forget this look. She was like you piece of shit because she knew. I had no rebuttal I was just thinking I know I am. That was that. 
As the twins got a little bigger and were moving around and Colleen was doing better life on the outside seemed really good. My addiction was starting to really flare again. The opiates were the reason. I can’t not take them because then I get sick. I take them even at night. If I wake up in the middle of the night I will take them. I was taking Xanax at night so I could sleep because I was taking all these opiates during the day which would just crank me up. The opiates gave me the talkies—I couldn’t stop talking. Great for sales! On my thirtieth birthday I had decided I was going to stop. I wasn’t going to do this anymore. I think that Josie was three at the time. She was so young. I swore to myself that night before my thirtieth birthday that I was not going to use. At ten thirty in the morning I realized that I was already high on my birthday. I had forgotten about staying sober. 
AS: You mean in the middle of the night?
WL: The night before I made the affirmation by the time the morning came I had already used. I had forgotten I had made the affirmation. I literally did not remember that I had used, but at ten thirty when I did remember I was so mortified with myself. I was self-loathing. I hated me. I was like, You know you’re going to die you fucking junkie. You are just going to die you piece of shit. So I used a lot. I have no idea how much I used that day. 
I ended up going to the pool hall. I maybe went down to the office for a little bit. I don’t think I did any work. I just used. I took a Xanax in the evening. When I came it was eight o’clock at night and there balloons throughout the house. My wife made chicken primavera for me—my favorite. The twins were there for the birthday party. I came in and yelled and screamed at all of them and was like, “Fuck you.” I walked down the hallway, I fell on the bed, I overdosed and I died. Josie came into the bedroom, my wife is in the kitchen crying. Josie went out and got my wife and said, “Call 911. Daddy is dead.” At two years old. 
Colleen came into the bedroom and I am gray. I am not breathing. She gives me a few short rescue breaths and I start to shallow breath. She gets out the stethoscope and starts to monitor my heart. It isn’t normal it is very weak. She breaths for me and she doesn’t call nine one one because there is dope in the house. There is cocaine in the house, there are stolen pills in the house, there are scales in the house, marijuana, baggies. There is a whole shop set up downstairs. To call the ambulance means that DHS comes in and takes the kids. They take me to jail, they take the children away, they take everything. She is literally the person that saved my life that night. 
AS: She was able to stabilize you?
WL: She was able to stabilize me. She gave me mouth to mouth. She breathed for me and kept me alive. I fell asleep after I got to a point where I was stable and my breathing was normal. She let me sleep. I woke up at one thirty in the morning and I said, “Where the fuck is my chicken?” I have really very little emotional response because I don’t remember any of that. 
AS: But she told you.
WL: Yeah, several times in detail. [laughs] After that you think a person would stay sober and stay clean, but I kept thinking, I’ve got this. But I couldn’t because every time I would stop I would get sick. I would have to chew the pills in the morning to get them in my system faster. I would drink some kind of liquor with it because it would immediately hit my system and I would get in the hot shower all at the some time. I was in the shower, hanging my head, chewing Vicodin, with a shot of whiskey in me getting ready to start my day. I would brush my teeth and go clean the carpet again. 
At that time I was making probably two thousand to three thousand dollars a week and we needed the money. In some ways she kept me going that direction because she knew we were making good money. I kept promising her it would slow down and when it would slow down we would be okay. I told her I was not going to do it like I did before and I would stay away from the Xanax because that was the problem. 
Not long after that my business partner set me up. I had been stealing money from the business. The opiates were the problem. I tapered myself off of opiates, but I started doing cocaine really heavily. I started doing cocaine in late 2003. 2003 and 2004 was all cocaine and I started stealing from my business to support it. It was delivered at that time. Under thirty minutes or it was free. 
AS: Under thirty minutes?
WL: It was like a pizza. Under thirty minutes or it was free. It was nothing to go through three hundred to four hundred and fifty dollars of cocaine in a night. Between me and her because now I’ve got her back on it. I’m good at keeping people sick around me. I was good at that. 
My business partner had a hunch that I was stealing. A good hunch. They set me up so they had someone call and say, “I’ve got this huge house and it is empty. I just want you to go over the carpets because they need to be done. I don’t care if they are dirty or not I want you to charge me for every room because the last person who was there is going to pay the bill so it’s not that big of a deal. Whatever you come up with is fine with me just don’t make me have to remortgage the house.” I was like, “Okay, great.” “Listen, I’m just going to pay you. If you could keep it a little cheaper than going through the company that would be great.” 
At that time I had no reason to think that was unusual. I had been doing enough side work up until that point where the word had gotten around that if you needed something done and you wanted it a little cheaper and you want great work you call Wade and he will do it for cash. She called me and we set it up for me to do this job. I would say a month later I got served papers. They were suing me for breach. 
AS: Your business partner?
WL: That’s right. Because I am an addict, because I am full of self, because I have no real connection to anything that is reality I represented myself. I thought I didn’t need a lawyer. He took me to court and I ended up losing everything. Over 1.3 million dollars worth of assets and cash. Everything reverted back to the franchise owner. My identity was crushed because I had gone from being this nothing to being a local mogul. We would go to downtown Louisville and I would take all my employees and it would be nothing to pay two thousand dollars for a night’s worth of booze and food and walk away thinking I’m Johnny Big Shot. Get on my boat and ride the river all the way back to my dock in prospect. People thought I was cool. Here I am getting served and I was losing everything that I thought was me. Or so I thought at that time. 
I remembered one day I had stolen some needles from this old lady that was a diabetic. She had a brand new packet of BD thirty cc thirty one gauge needles. I thought, I’ll just throw these in my van. I was sitting in my house depressed and alone because I had lost everything. I remebered those needles and I thought I’m going to try that. I am going to see what that is like. I went out and got them. I mixed up some cocaine in the spoon and I didn’t even use a filter. I drew it all back into the chamber. Colleen’s a nurse. She has practiced putting in IVs with me over and over. I gave plasma when I was broke as a joke. I’ve got the perfect know how. I go ahead and I shoot up for the first time. I remember thinking to myself I will never come back from this. This will be the end of me. I loved it. I loved it more than life itself. The allure and the enamore—I can’t—it just is. That went on for two years. 
AS: How were you affording it?
WL: I stole some equipment and a list of patron customers and I started my own sideline gig even though it was forbidden. I had stopped cleaning myself. I hired my buddy Joe to come clean with me. Joe would go do the work and I would pay him half. 
AS: Because it wasn’t you doing it. 
WL: I didn’t have to work anymore. My dope dealer would front me and I would steal the money from Colleen when she would put money in the bank. It didn’t matter. I would sell stuff, sell other people’s stuff. It didn’t matter. Whatever I had to do in order to get it. 
Towards the end there all I did was shoot dope, drink Miller High Life, and eat Donettes. That was the only thing I could keep down. 
AS: What are those?
WL: Those little white powdered donuts in a bag. [laughs] I would wake up in the morning and eat a half a bag of those and then I would throw up, shoot dope, and drink beer the rest of the day. 
AS: You must have lost a lot of weight. 
WL: I was skin and bones. The reason my wife called my stepdad and my grandpa was because she knew I was going to die. It wouldn’t be long. I had a gangrenous sore on the inside of my left thigh because of all the dope I was doing and the dirty water. 
AS: You were shooting into yours legs at this point?
WL: Well, I was, but not solely. It was mostly my arms. I had abscesses on both my arms up and down. Sometimes I would use my calves at times to find spots. My neck at times. The abscess is from dope not being able to metabolize in my body. In animal studies we call it intraperitoneal. It is the blank cavity in the body, so the only place it would go was to settle in the groin area. You could literally brush a powder off of my leg like dried cocaine. I was losing that leg, I could tell. My toes were getting dark blue. My leg was getting black. I didn’t care. I thought if I lose this leg I can get on disability. If I get disability I will be able to do dope for the rest of my life until I am dead. 
A lot of paranoid schizophrenia stuff with the cocaine. I would hunker down in the basement. I almost shot my wife one night as she was walking downstairs. 
AS: You almost shot her?
WL: I had a shotgun pointed at her head. I used to rig stuff up at the top of the stairs. I would put a beer bottle on the door knob so that if someone would come in it would fall down the steps and I would hear it. I always had a loaded shot gun next to me because if the cops came I was not going to jail. 
AS: You were going to shoot yourself?
WL: Yes. Like I said, I don’t do time. I won’t do time. I can’t. I was locked inside my mind for a long time as a kid.
AS: You were locked in your room. 
WL: I never thought of that. That’s got some emotion there. 
AS: It is fresh in my head so it is easy for me to make those connections when I’m listening. 
WL: Goddamn, you’re right. 
AS: When somebody says, “I don’t do that,” well, what if someone told you you had to?
WL: I would kill myself. 
AS: Right. I couldn’t have asked you that thirty minutes ago. 
WL: Yeah. I ended up going to treatment. They called my stepdad and my grandpa, who was really cool about it. They kind of rigged it all. Colleen left for work and all of a sudden my buddy Joe comes up the driveway like he normally does to get the carpet cleaning equipment. The door slams and I say, “I’m in here.” I’m sitting in the chair with the guitar in my hand and sunglasses on in my house. I don’t want Joe to see my eyes and now how sick I am. Joe knows I’m sick. Joe talks about me in the third person already at this point. I will hear him and my wife talking in the kitchen about me: “I don’t know how far away he is from dying” and that would just infuriate me. Don’t talk to me like I’m not here. 
AS: Even though you weren’t. 
WL: That’s right. I thought I had it together. 
He comes up, door slams, I say I am in here, and all of a sudden there is my stepdad and grandpa. He puts his hand on my shoulder and he has this look on his face. 
AS: Joe does?
WL: My dad. He wasn’t okay. You could tell by the look in his eyes he was not okay with what he was seeing. I am one hundred and forty-five pounds. I have long sleeves on because if you see my arms they are abscessed and not okay. He said, “We are going to take you back to Minnesota to get some help. Why don’t you come with us.” I said, “I can’t do that. I can’t.” 
Then my grandpa walks around the corner. I’m like, “What did you bring him for?” He’s cool. He’s been through this. He is thirty-four years sober out of AA. He was the town drunk. He has been doing twelve step calls his whole life and he has seen people way worse. He looks at me and he says, “Well, you’ve got yourself into a real fix here, didn’t you? I’ll tell you what. You’re probably feeling pretty shitty right about now. Why don’t you go ahead and get your stuff together and we will go up and get you some help. It is going to suck, but you’ll be alright.” I said, “Okay.”
AS: Is this your stepdad’s dad?
WL: Yeah. I said, “Okay.” He said, “Really? Okay.” I took a teener of cocaine into my bathroom and my dad said, “Just keep the door open.” I said, “No, I’m taking a shower. I’m not keeping the door open. I’ve got nothing in here. We’re good.” I put the teener in the spoon, drew it back as much as I could, and I shot the whole thing into my arm hoping I would overdose. I didn’t. I got really, really sick to the point where I fell into the shower. They helped me up, got me dressed. On the way out the door I even asked if I could drink a few beers. My grandpa said, “Go ahead. It will be your last.” I must have hammered four or five beers and then got back in that truck and headed to Minnesota. 
On the way there my family tried to call and get a bed and there wasn’t a bed at [unclear], there wasn’t a bed at teen challenge. They finally said they had one over in South Dakota. Do you want to go to South Dakota? By this time I’m eating Trazadone because it is all I have left. I was like, “I don’t give a shit where we go. Let’s just go before I get sick again.” After two and a half days in the car—we slept in the vehicle, we kept in the vehicle. They would stop periodically to get me a little more booze here and there just to keep me level. 
We got to Canton and at Canton I had just come around and they introduced me to a nurse. I stuck my hand out and gave them the best smile I could do. They gave me a room and they said, “We understand that you have been doing some pretty heavy amounts. We would like to make you as comfortable as possible. Are you allergic to Xanax at all?” I said, “Why, no. I’m not.” “Okay, take this. This will really help you to be calm.” “I will, thank you.” 
AS: This is what treatment looks like. 
WL: I am allergic to Xanax because every time I take it the left side of my body goes numb; totally dead. I went back to my room and lay down. I woke up at about eight or nine at night and I left the treament center. I went to the bar and I had a few drinks. I tried to steal a car, and I couldn’t. There wasn’t anything pre-1985 that I could ‘Dukes of Hazzard’ this thing and leave. I stole a bicycle and I drove that back to the treatment center after falling on the lawn a few different times because I must have drank a fifth of whiskey sitting at that bar plus a Xanax. I found my way back there because I was going to bicycle all the way home but I asked someone where I was and they said, “You don’t know where you’re at?” I said, “Just tell me what town I’m in.” “Canton.” “Canton, Kentucky?” “No, Canton, South Dakota.” “How far is that from Kentucky?” I literally thought I was going to go home. I didn’t care. I was going to get home. 
I got to the edge of town and got tired. I figured I better go back to the treatment center and figure it out tomorrow. I went back to the treatment center and threw the bike down on the lawn like I was a nine year old kid. I walked into the treatment center and went under my bed. The nurse came in and tried to get me out of there and I guess I tried to hurt her. I used to hide underneath my bed when my stepdad used to hurt me. I don’t know what happened. I must have reverted to something. 
The following day it happened again. They gave me Xanax again and I ended up going to the bar again. This time they sent one of the counselors  named Bill. I think he is still there. He is a marine. I was at the gas station this time drinking a Deuce and he finds me sitting up next to the gas station drinking this beer. He takes the beer and says, “You’re not going to need this to get in the back of my truck.” I got in the back of the truck. I’m already drunk because I went to the bar first and then went to get more beer. Went back to the treatment center and they called this pastor Al Pratt. He is a six foot five two hundred and eighty pound biker who is a pastor but did a lot of time but now had turned his life over. He settled me down, but they had to shoot me full of thorazine to get me to stay. For the next three days I did the thorazine shuffle all around that treatment center. I woke up three days later on the men’s wing. 
AS: The men’s wing of what?
WL: Of the treatment center. This was in 2005. Three days later I wake up bald and I’ve got no facial hair. No nothing. I look in the mirror and go, “What the fuck.” Everybody is laughing and I don’t know why they are laughing. I thought it was really disturbing and not okay. You don’t do this to somebody. I don’t care how drunk they get. You don’t shave their head. I went to the director of the place and pitch a fit. I’m like, “Who shaved my head?” She was like, “Wade, Wade, Wade. You did. You were standing in the men’s bathroom stark naked, shaving your entire head. We weren’t going to stop you! We figure the worst that could happen is that it would grow back.” Okay. Shaved every ounce off. 
That began my forty-five day stay at that treatment center. My daughter still reminds me of the time she saw me with no hair or beard. 
AS: She does? She was like four?
WL: Yeah. It scarred her. We found a picture of it not long ago and she can’t look at it. She does not like it. It’s not the daddy she left in Kentucky. They had to go stay with parents because I went to treatment. My twins went to stay with my mother in Minnesota. Our one year old went to stay with my wife’s mom and dad in Iowa. My wife is still in Kentucky, and I’m in South Dakota. Split apart and I didn’t think we were ever getting back together again. 
AS: So pastor Al Pratt shows up. I want to hear about how you got into college, how you got here, and what you’re doing now. 
WL: I met pastor Al Pratt and was enamored by his coolness. He’s got tattoos up and down his arms, wearing a biker jacket, says ‘pastor’ on it. He’s got this story of drinking bleach to clean his system out prior to UA to such a degree that he has to have a steel lining in his gut because that is the degree that his addiction took him to. I’m thinking if that happened to you I am so much better than you. You make me feel really good about how it turned out for me. 
After going through that treatment and going home I got into an aftercare program. They had a counselor come to my house every week for a good eightteen months. 
AS: Were you back in Kentucky at this point?
WL: Sleepy Eye, Minnesota where I grew up.
AS: So the whole family moved?
WL: Yeah. My wonderful mom found a three bedroom branch home that was for sale and manipulated the sellers to rent it to us. My mom is a very dynamic person. She’s got us living in this 1974 home that is decorated in 1974. I went from living in Louisville, Kentucky in a very prestigious neighborhood—even though I was dying from addiction I was used to finer things—to a house with shag carpets, linoleum, smoke colored walls, dark chocolate cabinetry, orange countertops. I’m just flabbergasted at where I’m at in now in my life, but at the same time it’s like I know I need to redeem myself. We dig in the best we can.
My wife gets a job as a nurse in a geriatrics facility in a little town. My kids get enrolled in kindergarten. We’ve got baby Jane and she’s doing well. 
I started going to meetings. I went every day for a year. Sometimes I would go twice a day: an afternoon meeting and then a night meeting on top of that. I got to the point where all I would do eat, live, breath, and shit recovery. I’m chairing meetings now, I’m going to speak at treatment centers, and I go back to Canton every month to share my story about how I ran away from the treatment center and I ran down to the bar and got hammered. I had become this celebrity in recovery where people were recognizing me. They would say, “Hey, Wade. We have this date and can you come talk?” They would put stuff up with my name on it. It got to the degree where I was like, Is this what it is supposed to be like? But I was loving it. I was having a great time. 
My spiritual life started to increase and I started really wanting to know god more and what he had in store for me if anything at all. There was always the ‘why me’ every time I had that ontological argument of is there or isn’t there. If so he’s off his game because he could have saved me here and here and here and he never did. So why now? 
I reached out to pastor Al and went back to Sioux Falls. I went to his church a few times—it’s a biker church. There are tattoos and bikes and Jesus. I liked it. I liked being vulnerable. I liked saying I needed something more than me in my life. I need a higher power in my life. Pastor Al said the thing that I keep hearing: you’ve really got the gift of gab. I told him one thing that happened to me—I had mentioned to you at the restaurant that I had this fight with god. 
AS: Do you want to talk about that?
WL: Sure. At about day forty-four I was going to commit suicide. I was told by my wife that we weren’t going to be together right away and it may not happen for awhile because we didn’t have a house and this and that. She got on me about if I hadn’t done this it wouldn’t be my fault. She threw some blame at me, which is totally justifiable. Definitely. Tell that to a self centered, narcissistic, egotistical addict that’s got a wounded spirit. That doesn’t work really well and that’s not what I needed to hear at the time. I put a bag around my head and a belt around my neck and I went into my room and locked the door. I was bound and determined that asphyxiation was going to be the easiest way out because I would just simply pass out and die. 
As soon as I did start to black out a hole is torn in the bag and it is a nurse. She says, “Wade, what are you doing?” A nurse never came back to that room ever that whole time I was there, and now all of a sudden there is a nurse outside of this locked door and happens to have a key in her hand? And opens it up at that exact same time? That makes no sense to me. 
After that episode I went to the backyard where they have this dirt track and I just started to walk around the dirt track over and over. I got into this big fight with god of, “You did this and I hate you.” I was trying to induce the wrath of god. If you are real, zap me dead right here. Finally I screamed at him to either do something with me or kill me. I fell to the ground. I just collapsed. I don’t know if it was emotion or what it was. I just went down and cried. I remember just laying there crying for the longest time. That deep visceral kind of thing. You can’t catch your breath. 
After that I went and sat in this lecture hall and listened to this speaker talk about getting beaten. When the old man sends you to the closet to the get the belt that he is going to beat you with do you get the wide belt or the thin belt. I said, “The wide belt.”
AS: You said that out loud?
WL: Yeah. The speaker says to me, “There is a man that has been beaten.” It pierced me. It felt as if god was talking to me through this person. How did they know? Is that really reminiscent of a beaten person that they would go get the wide belt? Of course it is because it has greater surface tension and it’s not going to hurt as bad. I know that because it has happened. I am not going to give you the thin belt. 
It was all of those things in combination that made me go back to visit Al Pratt. He was the speaker who said that. I went back to him and shared with him that something had happened on that dirt track. There was a revelation that happened. I didn’t want to seem too weird, but god told me I was going to be a pastor. That was something that was almost a knowingness. I called my wife before I went into that lecture hall that night. I told her about that day and what happened. I told her I had this overwhelming knowingness that I’m supposed to be a pastor or something. She was at a hotel with my parents at the time, and she goes, “That’s great.” I could hear the patronizing tone. I said, “You don’t understand. This is real. I really feel like there was a spiritual entity there and I had there experience. I can’t even explain it.” “Honey. That’s great. We are behind you no matter what.” I just surrendered. She was not going to believe me. Not now; I’ve got to walk it out. 
As I am home doing outpatient I just have this feeling that I need to go back and see him. He puts it on my heart to read the Bible, and I did. I sat down at my kitchen table with a pot of coffee and a pack of cigarettes and my recovery bible. “In the beginning.” My mother in law called to check up and see how we were. I never liked her because she was a godly woman and I never was a godly man at all. This time I had a real hankering to ask her about god and what it means to her. I just talked to her for awhile. I said, “Mary Jane, I’m reading the Bible and I was interested in what your experience is.” She said, “What are you reading?” I said, “Genesis, you know, in the beginning.” She said, “You don’t want to start there!” I was like, “What are you talking about?”
AS: So you had no religious upbringing?
WL: I was the CEO of the church—Christmas and Easter Only. [laughs] My parents would drop us off and we would go to Sunday School and they would pick us up. 
AS: So, you have some—
WL: Not about the books. I know the characters of the Bible, but not the order that I am supposed to know to get confirmed. That never happened. I faked it. 
She says, “You need to start in the gospels. Start with John. From there,” she said, “Once you get to Revelation stop. Then go and read Genesis and read through that.” I did it and I read through it. I sat there day after day for hours and hours and read the Bible word for word. I did not miss one word. I figured at the very end there was going to be some kind of an epiphany or knowingness. A spell or a potion. I don’t know. I had this strong urge that I had to read every word. Even in books where all they did was recite the family lineage. I read every word to the best of my ability figuring there would something. “You faithful son! You’ve done it all. Here is your reward. 
There was a reward. My faith grew so that today I do believe there was a man that walked this planet and was God incarnate who had every attribute of the living God and took upon himself every single sin past, present, future, and died an innocent man. When I talk about it it does get me. I’m appreciative of that. I can’t think about how I could do that. If I was asked to do that—no. No! Of course not. I don’t even stop to give people on the side of the road money let alone die for them. It gave me a perspective. It opened my eyes and really got me to understand what it means to care for somebody other than myself. That was new for me up to that point. I was so busy trying to survive that I didn’t give a shit about anybody but me. Reading the scriptures made me go, “Here is this man who is God and could stop time altogether, but he didn’t. He took it all and never once complained. Here I am this little human complaining and whining: “Early recovery is hard.” I don’t know, it really helped. It made me want to share it and go give it to someone else. 
I contacted this pastor in Sleepy Eye and I said, “Would you mind if we gathered at your church on Saturday nights? It would be me, my wife, a couple of other people who are in recovery. We will bring our guitars down and we are just going to do some music, hang out, and talk about recovery and how God is a part of that. Is that okay?” “Yeah, sure.” We started with just that and it grew to one hundred and fifty people in just six months. Pastor Al recognized what was going on and took me under his wing. The Southern Baptist Convention through the Dakota Baptist Convention recognized me and sent their guy out to underwrite our ministry. They funded it. They gave us money every month to help us buy equipment and travel and train me. Within a short period of time, in 2007 I became ordained. 
AS: In the Baptist Church?
WL: Yeah. By this time we have our own church and congregation of about one hundred and nine people. We are doing youth group every week, clothing drives, food drives, and we are speaking on the behalf of people in recovery in the church community to let them know, as I learn more about what drugs and alcohol can do to a human being, how to be mindful. How to navigate this whole thing. We told them, “Throw your old medications away, take them down to the police station because I will come to your house and steal them. I will eat them all and I will die.” 
I would show up in the church with my vest and my tattoos and they would immediately be dumbfounded by the level of intelligence and then what I looked like. That’s the demon of meth. 
AS: You had the church for how long?
WL: Almost three years. It grew into this really cool thing. Towards the last eight to ten months we had ‘normies’ come in—people that were seeing—
AS: Before this had been pretty much people in recovery? It was one of these recovery churches?
WL: We called it a recovery bar. We got kicked out of that Lutheran Church on the 364th day. We were about to recognize one year and they came to me and said, “Wade” —and they wouldn’t call me pastor— “You guys are going to have to go. We found cigarette butts out front and that’s not going to be acceptable.” “Where are we supposed to go?” “That’s not our problem. I’m sorry, you just have to go.”
AS: Wow. Because you had a very large crowd?
WL: People from Sunday morning were coming on Saturday night.
AS: And then not coming on Sunday. 
WL: That’s right. 
AS: When did you get the tattoos?
WL: Not until I got sober. I didn’t get my first one until I was clean. I was arrested once. Remember I told you I went to jail one day? I went to jail one day and they took a mug shot. I watched them take everyone else’s that was in line with me, and they made them take off their shirts and they took pictures of their tattoos. I swore as a person dealing dope and running guns and doing stupid crap I was never going to get a mark on my body. Too easy to recognize. 
This solidifies my recovery. Now I am very recognizable; it is hard to forget me. Hard to forget. I want to mark myself. I am marked with the cross literally because now people go, “That guy is marked with the cross, marked with a Jesus on his arm, he’s got scripture, how he has battled sin and wants to do the right thing. If it’s not him that does it is the sin that does it.” I want to be recognized. I don’t want there to be a chance to ever go back to that life. I want to be marked. 
AS: Would you mind sharing the scripture?
WL: Corinthians five seventeen. Romans six and seven. Romans seven is Paul talking about his battle with sin. If you take it and replace the word sin with addiction it makes perfect sense. It is the addiction within me that does these evil things. “Oh what a wretched man that I am. Who will free me from this life that is dominated by addiction?” Thank God the answer is in Jesus. That is what Pastor Al showed me when I was in that treatment center that time. He challenged me. He said that addiction was in the Bible. I said, “Yeah, right. No it’s not.” He said, “Replace the word addiction with sin in that paragraph.” The more I read it the more I started to cry. I was like, “You mean Paul was an addict?” “I don’t know if Paul was an addict, but the battle is the same, isn’t it?” He’s doing something that he doesn’t want to do. Oh what a wretched man that I am. Who will free me from this life that is dominated by all of this? Everything fell in line. 
At the end of the three years in ministry, a lot of it had to do with normal, regular people that have great intentions, came in, and their traditions were not seen there because we didn’t do communion. 
AS: You didn’t do their Baptist traditions. 
WL: We didn’t do that. That’s not me. I don’t have a comfort in that. 
AS: So did the Baptist Church hear of you and then—
WL: Pastor Al took me under his wing and taught me all things. 
AS: Is he a Baptist minister?
WL: He is with the Dakota Baptist Convention. Part of the Southern Baptist Convention. I’m trying to think of the executive director’s name. He was told by Pastor Al that he had this young protege and his is just sharp. He is on fire for the Lord. He has this gift of gab. Man, he can preach up a storm. He just brings it and the emotion behind it. You’ve got to go see him. He comes to Sleepy Eye and he sits in the pews like a visitor. Afterwards he goes, “Wow.” I said, “What?” “You have a gift.” I said, “Thank you. Who are you?” He introduced himself and said he wanted to underwrite my ministry. I said, “I don’t know what that means.” “We will give you money.” “Okay.” [laughs] “We need that. What can we do with the money?” “Anything you need.” “We need a trailer so we can go to a different church once in awhile on Sunday mornings to bring the message.” It turned into a huge production. It turned into a five piece band and a ten thousand dollar PA system and soundboards and computers and a board of directors. “Normie” church. 
We just started this thing with guitarists hanging out talking about what recovery really means and why it is so important to—
AS: Have a spiritual life?
WL: Yeah. Then it turned into money. It turned into, “I want you to do a baptism for my grandson. I want you to marry so and so. I want you to do communion. I want you to do a mass.” Whoever came in with ten thousand dollars to donate wanted me to do something different for their family or their stuff. They thought themselves to be significant enough because they donated. Pastor Wade will just do it. 
AS: How long did it take you to figure out it wasn’t working?
WL: Three years. I told the congregation I was leaving. I told them we had lost our mission and it doesn’t look anything like Set Free anymore. 
AS: Set Free was the name of it?
WL: Yeah. I just said I was done. I’m going to go to graduate school now. I graduated with my four year degree. I didn’t start college until a year after I was sober. 
AS: How old were you?
WL: Thirty-four. I started my bachelor’s because my wife said, “You’re so smart. You should do this.” I said, “You’re wrong. I’m not as smart as you think I am. I’m a manipulator. I’m really good at getting what I want.” She said, “Do one class. It’s no big deal.” “Fine, I’ll do one class.” I did one class. 
AS: What was the class? Was it psychology?
WL: Well, my undergrad is in human services; management. It was probably literature or English or a writing course. 
AS: But you liked it?
WL: No. Well, I had to take the textbook and set it next to the dictionary because every other sentence I did not know any word. The first word I had to look up was efficacious. This is how far down the socioeconomic scale I came from. Efficacious is not a word that my people use. What are you talking about? Even to know the definition wasn’t enough because it didn’t settle with me. I didn’t get it. 
Today I think learning is so great. The first class I got an A. My excuse was that it was an easy class. The second one I got an A and I told my wife that everyone in that class got an A. It was an easy school. It was a crappy school. The third class I got an A in. The teacher was a pushover and she didn’t care. The fourth one I was sitting with peers and I was saying the same thing. This girl with tears in her eyes looks at me and said, “If you say one more fucking time that this is easy I’m going to slap you. I got a C last class.” That helped me. Immediately I was like maybe Colleen is right. Maybe I have some smarts. 
I got through the bachelor’s and graduated with honors. I went on to my master’s degree and took another master’s at night while I was going that. I got to meet Marv Seppala, the chief medical officer at Hazelden [Betty Ford Foundation]. We became weight room buddies and started talking about neurology. He told me about addiction neurology for free as I taught him how to lift weights. 
AS: You just happened to meet him?
WL: He is the chief medical officer at Hazelden. 
AS: Right, but how did you meet?
WL: I was a student there. As he walks in I was like, “Hey, Dr. Seppala. How are you?” “It looks like you lift weights! I could never gain weight.” “Well, you’re an ectomorph and this is why. You need to eat this way and lift like this and you will put on a few pounds but you are never going to get huge, but you can feel better about your body.” “I’ll tell you what I’m going to be in here every so and so. Do you want to come in and talk about addiction and you can show me how to do this.” Done. I got a free tutor. And so did he. 
That was the two years following ministry. I stayed up in Center City during the week and came home on the weekends. I became kind of an uncle to my kids. My wife started drinking to cope with being a single mom. My meeting structure shifted. I maybe went once a week. My eating disorder flared. I have been bulimic since I was twelve. I learned how to meet weight when I was wrestling. Having low self esteem from growing up how I did was a way to keep my body composition in check. I could binge purge and I wouldn’t drink or use when I was doing that. I did that pretty badly during graduate school. I got really thin and exercised twice a day. I was feeling shitty about being a dad that’s not there, but trying to get to the next level of my life because I have to do this. It wasn’t something I felt like I could do—I had to do it. I felt compelled to do it. Got to graduation day and got it done. The only people there for graduation was my wife and my inlaws because five years prior to this I cut my mom, dad, brother, and sister out of my life for six years. I couldn’t have their chaos in my life anymore. 
AS: Which had continued?
WL: Just because I quit drinking doesn’t mean that that stopped. Her gambling and her lying and manipulating. My brother’s meth use and my sister’s—I don’t know. She had several children with different men who were addicts. It was just never a healthy scenario. There were six years where there was no contact whatsoever. Not even a phone call. We lived in the same town, so we would see each other and not say hi. 
Two years at grad school and then for the three years following that I was at Project Turnabout in an intensive inpatient treatment center there working with gamblers for the first two years and with chemically dependent for a year after that. Nine months after that I was in public mental health at Sioux Trails in New Ulm. Just this last October I gave notice and said I was going to start a treatment center. I had no idea how to do that or if that could ever happen. I prayed about it and quit. I had the gift of gab and we could make this happen. I’ve been talking to people, our policies and procedures have been submitted, the building has been bought, the outpatient building has been bought, furniture has been bought, and the employees have been hired. We are just waiting for two licenses and we are ready to go. 
AS: In Montevideo?
WL: Yeah. 
AS: What kind of a treatment center? Then can you talk about your work with trauma?
WL: Yeah. This is going to be a mixed cohort of men and women. There will be ten in the inpatient center. 
AS: There is inpatient and outpatient?
WL: We have an inpatient and an outpatient, two sober homes, and a gambling unit all at the same time. All or none! Here we go. 
The inpatient treatment center is a six bedroom, four bath home. It is forty-six hundred square feet. This is in a residential setting. It is a beautiful, big house. Ten folks in that place. We are going to focus on trauma using excelleration therapy. We are going to treat trauma first, and then we are going to treat chemical dependency second. I am very much in belief that chemical dependency is a coping strategy for whatever got you there. Very seldom do you see the organic alcoholic where they take that first drink and say, I love that and I have a supportive enviornment. My parents loved me, I had everything that I needed—well, that can be a problem too. I firmly belive that trauma is the nucleus of compensatory behavior such as drinking, over eating, shopping, gambling, relationship addictions. In some way I am getting out of dealing with the original issue, which could be in my case the childhood sexual and physical trauma. 
AS: What do you mean in some way you are getting out of it?
WL: You don’t have to deal with it. I don’t have to deal with the somatic responses that are procured from my amygdala from the trauma. 
AS: What does ART stand for again?
WL: Accelerated Resolution Therapy. The God of my understanding works like this: he always shows me things that I need to know first hand. The veteran that I worked with almost a year ago now that was committing an act of suicide caused in me PTSD. My symptoms were—
AS: This was a man you were treating?
WL: I was called to an emergeny situation. I was not treating him. He had put on social media that he was taking the coward’s way out. He was done. He was not happy. “I will be by the lone tree” was the word we got. I and another therapist and my wife raced across two counties to get to this place. 
AS: You knew where it was?
WL: My colleauge did. He had a recollection as to where this was. We raced to get there at ninety miles an hour to get there. Behind me is a state trooper with his lights on. He zooms past, so I get right behind him. Another five miles goes by and he pulls over. I pull over in front of him and he says to me, “What are you doing?” I said, “I’m going to the same place you’re going. I’m going to find so-and-so.” “Who are you?” “I’m a mental health professional. I’m going to the scene.” “Alright, but you can’t go faster than me.” I said, “Okay.” [laughs] 
We got up to the spot. He went past the turn off and I took a right and there were squad cars and an ambulance. I thought, Shit, he already did it. We got behind the ambulance and my phone rang. It was him and he was asking me where the fuck I was. I said I’m behind the ambulance and he told me to go up there. I’ve got to talk to these guys and see if they can let me through the blockade. I went up to the sergeant and said, “Here are my credentials. I’m a veteran. Let me talk to him.” “He has a weapon.” “I understand. I just need to go up there.” 
They let me through and I spent three hours at his window. It got to be nighttime. 
AS: What window? Was he in a car?
WL: Sorry, he was in a car. Yeah. He had a gun. Three hours of trying to negotiate with him. I shared with him my military experience and his and how can I do this and then live. How can I take that many lives and not be affected. I was like, “Listen. You haven’t had the kind of therapy that I do. I want to work with you and help you to get better.” I’m telling him about Accelerated Resolution Therapy which at the time I had only heard of. I hadn’t done it. I hadn’t needed to. I had heard of other veterans who have. I was just telling him to work with me. Anything just to get him. 
Finally, we get down to that last minute and he looks at me and says, “I can’t. I’m going home.” He grabs the trigger and I screamed as loud as I could. I said, “By the blood of Christ I bind you.” And he stopped. He cried. He said, “If I get out of this car they will put me in jail.” I said, “If I go and get a letter that says no charges pending will you get out?” He said, “Yeah, I’ll get out.” 
By this time the lieutenant is on the scene. He said, “You’re not going back out there.” I said, “Just give me the damn letter. He is willing to come out.” I had to negotiate with him and send him a picture to his phone. Finally he did get out. I get in the ambulance with him. I fill in the social workers. I told them he was a vet and these were his experiences. This is what is going on. Be cautious. Just trying to give them some insight. We go home. 
I’m fired up. My adrenaline is off the charts. I don’t go to bed that night until four in the morning. Three weeks go by and I start to not feel okay. I don’t know what is going on with my. My motivation is low, I don’t want to do much. I come home at night and I just lay around. Pretty soon I had stopped shaving, I called in sick a few days, and I start to get very angry at the drop of a hat. I was suicidal and I’m not telling anybody that I am and I am. By this time my wife started to notice. She said we needed to call somebody. I started my own process of Accelerated Resolution Therapy. I went and got one session and my PTSD was gone. It was lifted. I walked out of there like I was pre-episode. I’m crying at my wife saying how sorry I was and that I didn’t even know. I tried to explain myself as to why I was being such an asshole before. She is such a sweetheart she just said, “It’s okay; you’re better now.” I don’t deserve you.
I go back and do five more sessions. We work on things like an old man that used to beat me with a stick and punch me and kick me. I babysitter that used to stick things in me and have sex with me when I’m little. All of the bullshit I did when I left my son. I worked through that with Accelerated Resolution and I rewrote every one. I went and rewrote my first drink, my first cocaine experience, my first marijuana experience. I don’t remember it anymore. 
AS: Can you give me a quick description of what that means?
WL: The reference on this is that this would be Dr. Candell and his work around dendritic spines and the protein synthesis that happens. Images sit on the dendritic spines. It takes protein synthesis to activate the image in the brain. When you recall a traumatic image it renders it unstable. At that point it is maleable and can be manipulated. When we use bilateral stimulation in the way of horizontal eye movements that mimic REM sleep we know that it reduces brain waves from a sedentary eight to thirty hertz to one to four. My theory is that that’s what peels away the emotional response from the traumatic issue because it is like throwing icy cold water on hot trauma. Just like that. 
Immediately I went from being unable to talk about the experience to calm. I went through the image in my mind as I was looking at the bilateral stimuation of the eye movements. The first time I went through it I emoted. I emoted around the fact that I saw his chest being blown open. I emoted around I couldn’t save him. I emoted around I’m standing here and nobody is helping me. This colleague that I brought with me went up to the window with me and fell apart. He didn’t make it. He saw that man and he was drunk and had a gun and my colleague couldn’t handle that. He starts to weep. I was like, “Dude, go tell those police officers to go tell those ones over there to shut their fucking lights off. Go do that.” I sent him away. Abandonment has always been an issue for me. Now my best friend abandoned me to stand at this window by myself to save this guy’s life. All that tied together I worked through with the eye movements for me because it was very much connected to past stuff. 
As we rewrite it we use imagination. Positive images. We rewrite it using the same bilateral stimiulation because it is maleable and we can write new images. All we have to do is imagine it. It is voluntary image replacement. The therapist I’m working with said, “You could replace this now. The first time through the scene is emotion. The second time through is no emotion. The third time through you’re the director. You can make it better. How would you make it better? You can bring angels or a higher power.” My imagination was when I pulled up on the scene I walked around the corner of the ambulance and someone came and walked right in between me and my colleague. He’s got a big right hand. He walks up to the window and the guy that is in the car that sees me there with none other than Jesus looks at him, starts to cry, gives Jesus a big hug, and we walk away and get him treatment. That’s it. 
When I think about that story I think about how real it is to see Christ standing there between me and my colleague at the time. It is a new, better image that prevents new triggers and new things. When I say I rewrote my first drink, instead of Derek handing me that Tab I slapped it out of his hand and I watch it roll across the street going all the way down. I never drank. 
AS: Why would you say that? Why does that make you feel better?
WL: Why does that make me feel better? Why does making the right choice make you feel better?
AS: Are you saying that is replacing a painful memory in your brain? That you have pushed it away?
WL: I’m saying that I’m no longer an addict or an alcoholic. 
AS: You know your history, clearly. Retelling it doesn’t affect you in the same way anymore because—
WL: No. I’m not ever going to use drugs again because I know today as a professional what drugs do to the body. Since I’ve had ART I’ve had a drink. I don’t drink to get drunk. I don’t drink everyday. I don’t steal from garages. I don’t—right? I say that not to prove a point but because I’m using myself as an experiment. 
AS: I think there are a growing number of professionals in the field that are thinking the abstinence only and abstinence always attitude towards substances—
WL: When I went back and ARTed myself for every first that I had, I then felt comfortable enough to have a glass of wine with my food. I still felt guilty the first time. It’s been eleven years. This is okay. 
AS: Right. What will I do the next day?
WL: I didn’t do anything. This was October. The first drink I had was in Tampa. It was with my wife in a beautiful restaurant and we had a beautiful night. I drank two glasses of wine and I didn’t think, “We should get a ball of cocaine!” [laughs] I’m not going to advertise what you should do after having ART therapy. What I am going to do is give people the knowledge that the traumatic event and the compensatory behavior to eliminate the somatic response induced by that original trauma—when that trauma goes away you aren’t going to have the need to use. You’re just not. 
I’m not recommending that someone do that in the first twelve months. I think there is a period of acclimation that needs to happen in the endocrine system because we have acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate and our transmitters that are very important in regulating my central nervous system. Just making sure that those things return to equilibrium and homeostasis. We know homeostasis can take eighteen months for some people who have used exponentially. Give yourself that time. It has been eleven years for me and I’m not going to revert back to the town drunk in a week. I am being very scientific about this. I am journaling when I drink and how much I drink and what the effects are. In four or five years, or less than that, when ART becomes the go-to modality for the world I’m the first. I am the first addict or alcoholic that has some kind of documentation that says this works. What does that mean for AA and NA? I don’t care. I don’t think those fellowships will ever go away because it is great to come together beneath one—
AS: Yeah. It is the support. Can you talk about the ear thing? I looked it up but I would like to have you describe it. 
WL: The bridge is a device that was created for the sole purpose of pain relief. It was originally created for people dying of cancer. They had dire pain. A doctor recognized this opiate addict that was having this pain and utilized this machine on the opioid addict. He found out that it attenuated his opioid withdrawal symptomatology. He took it off of him and the symptoms came back. They created this device called the Bridge. I wish we knew we were going to talk about this because it is such a new science and it isn’t my specialty. I don’t have all of the details. 
AS: That’s okay. Just that you are considering using it. 
WL: Yes, we are going to use this. It has been FDA approved, not that that says a lot. 
AS: Same with Oxy!
WL: Yeah. [laughs] It does attenuate the withdrawal effects up to 62.8 percent in twenty minutes. 
AS: It is a medical device?
WL: Right. No drugs are used. It is an electronic device. It sends an electric signal through the cranium into the amygdad reducing the amygdala’s response by fifty-two percent. The amygdala is the fight or flight, freeze or faint. It is also affecting other areas of the brain such as the hypocampus to reduce symtomology. Imagine if you would jsut for a second offereing to an opiate addict like myslef, “Okay, listen. You can be clean and it won’t cause any pain. Are you interested? Yes or no.” I would have said yes. No pain whatsoever? Well, you might get the shits. Other than that, no pain. On day five they are boasting ninety five percent. 
AS: That is phenomenal. 
WL: There are videos. I will forward you the videos so you can watch these patients prior to and after having this device put in. they wear the device for five days and in that five day period they become biologically clean. At the end of the fifth day we transfer immediately into medication assisted therapy [MAT]. Our treatment center is going to specialize in MAT. We are working with an addiction psychiatrist for prescriptions. We will be doing a lot of telemedicine because of our location. 
AS: Are you going to do Suboxone?
WL: Suboxone, right. Suboxone is the only thing I am comfortable with. I am not as comfortable with methadone. It just has too long of a half life and has no naloxone in it. I don’t want to take the risk of someone being on that and then using because they will die. It has happened so many times. 
That is our focus. The ten inpatient group will come in as a cohort: they will get there together and leave together. It is not going to be the same—
AS: You gain a person, you lose a person. 
WL: Nope. You come in together and you leave together. 
AS: What if someone leaves? 
WL: We aren’t going to fill another bed. Tough. 
AS: If it is down to three people—
WL: Then it is the three survivors. That’s right. It is like a platoon. 
AS: You will also be using a different financial model, as well. 
WL: We are using funding from the state. We are going to refund money when it comes down to—
AS: You might be using money from the state but if people leave you won’t be getting money anymore. 
WL: No. 
AS: You’re taking a new approach. 
WL: God is our financer. Do you think I’m kidding? I’m not kidding at all. Watch him do it. I want to share something with your listeners. Probably a couple of graduate students that are writing this up for you—
AS: Undergrad. 
WL: Undergrad. Oh my gosh you are getting them young. 
AS: They are very smart. Great typers.
WL: Smarter than most. Great typers. Very educated. Here is something you will be entertained by. I left the public mental health clinic in October. My mantra was: I am going to outgive God. I am going to work until God is made to look a little foolish for not giving. Yeah. 
AS: Are you challenging God? [laughs]
WL: A little bit. 
AS: What does that do for you? What is the impact on you?
WL: Here is what happens. He’s already blazed away. He introduced us to a donor; the patriarch of this family. He owned a goldmine. When I say goldmine he literally owned a goldmine. He left for the wife, the children, and the grandchildren a trust. They decided to spend all the amounts of money they have to spend in order to reduce their taxable responsibilities on recovery in Montevideo. I don’t know how much that is yet because we haven’t been given the check, but she asked us what we needed and we rattled off, “We need a van for this, we need a sprinkler system in the homes, medical devices.”
AS: Did they buy the house, too?
WL: No, we bought the house. This is what I mean by God has bypassed anything I could do. The house was already zone R4 when we bought it. We didn’t know that.
AS: What is R4?
WL: Residential Four mean that it is ready for occupancy for the levels we want it to be. Otherwise we would have needed a conditional use permit from the city. I even went to a city planning zoning meeting and one of the people there said, “I’m sure there will be a public hearing on this.” The city manager said, “No, there won’t because it is already zoned R4. We wish Recovery 101 all the best.” [laughs] I was like you’ve got to be kidding me. I walked out of there in five minutes and it was done. There is nothing they can do to stop us. 
We have people coming out of the woodwork to help. There has not been one bump. It has everything to do with the opiate issue that is going on. 
AS: The people in the area. 
WL: Yeah. We’ve got Dr. Willenbring that is doing all of our scripts. Shelley Alkington is our board president who lost her daughter at age twenty-six to opiate overdose just last year. She has a bill at the House right now that would add a certain percentage to—don’t quote me here—but I think every microgram of opiate that is prescribed. She came up with that. 
AS: A tax?
WL: It’s a tax. If that happens that will mean literally millions of dollars, if not close to a billion dollars, in relief for treatment in Minnesota. 
AS: That’s like cigarettes and the tobacco companies. 
WL: How many therapy facilities do we have? Less than a handful. 
AS: We don’t even have enough treatment beds. We don’t have enough sober houses and we don’t have enough—people should not have to wait a second when they say they are willing to go in. 
WL: Yeah. Now that we have this bridge device, now that we have medication assisted therapy, now we have all these little things together. We just need these great marketing tools to say, “Here we are! If you need us here we are! No pressure; no rush.” 
I used to be an interventionist where I would go stiffarm people to go and leave no matter what. Then there is this blow back of the addict that doesn’t want to go, or they fail and the family comes back and says, “We want our money back because our person didn’t get fixed!” I’ve so walked away from that. It’s just not a model I’m interested in anymore. There were so many times along my own process where I was willing. Balling, willing, wanting out, but not knowing how to get out. If I knew there was a way, a number—we’ve got the new law too where if you call—
AS: Steve’s law? The Good Samaritan law. 
WL: Yeah. And that came out of a non-profit organization that Shelley is on as well. 
AS: The Steve Rummler Hope Foundation. 
WL: Yeah. We see all these great things happening. 
AS: Your wife might have been able to call for help without anyone seaerching the house. 
WL: That’s right. 
AS: If your wife hadn’t been a nurse you would have died. 
WL: I wouldn’t be doing this interview right now. Not at all. 
AS: How is she?
WL: We’ve been married twenty-four years. She’s very healthy. 
AS: And your kids are seventeen—
WL: Seventeen, twelve, and seven. My kids think I’m a hero today. They really do. My youngest, seven, who thinks dad is going to be some kind of celebrity. 
AS: How have you dealt with the issues of drugs and alcohol with your teenagers?
WL: I’m open. I said, “If you are going to use please just let me know.”
AS: Do they know your story?
WL: Not the details, but enough to know. I don’t harp on things. 
AS: Do you tell them they are likely—do you use the genes thing?
WL: No, but I let them know that it is very easy to use as a coping mechanism for things. To use for coping. You can get caught up in that. I try to have an open and communicative platform to say how we feel. Being a psychotherapist I am attuned to eyes and facial expressions. 
AS: Are you kind of driving them crazy?
WL: No, I give them their privacy. I am a little less direct with them. I give them a little space. I let them fall. When there are obvious things going on I have no problem saying that we need to wrestle with this a little bit. Let’s talk about this. They are great kids. I know they haven’t used. I just know they haven’t. I think they really want to make the best of their lives. They have seen me struggle. Even in early recovery it was so hard to go from living in that old house. I have remodeled every room in that house. 
AS: Are you still there?
WL: Yeah. I took pine palettes and broke them apart a month into my recovery. I stored them in my garage for like five months. They were enough to create wood floors for my kitchen, dining room, hallway, and living room all down to one and three eighths inch butt jointed together and laid them all myself. Sanded them, stained them, polyurethaned them, put in carpet. I have a lot of energy coming in. [laughs]
AS: Went to college, redid your house, ran a church. 
WL: Yeah. That’s it. 
AS: Thank you.

Robbinsdale, Minnesota
Robert Levy-RL
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: Tell me anything about your upbringing, your childhood, your parents, or your siblings. 
RL: I am an only child. I was born in Manhattan, but I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. My parents were older when they had me. My mother had had several miscarriages before she had me and she desperately wanted to be pregnant. By the time she gave up, of course, was when she got pregnant with me. 
My dad had three children from a previous marriage. His wife had died tragically when she was very young from a very aggressive form of breast cancer. They were much older --  it took my father some time to remarry and it took some time to have children. When I was born, the youngest of my half sisters was eighteen and the oldest had graduated from college already. They were all much older than me and really did not have a lot of impact on my upbringing.
I grew up alone as the child of two psychiatrists in New York -- both my parents are psychiatrists. My childhood was great. My parents both loved me a lot. They both have their own intricacies and quirks, but really, they were great parents. They gave me too much, but not way too much, let’s be honest. [laughs] I went to a private school growing up and I had great friends. It was a happy childhood. 
My mom did get sick when I was fourteen years old. She had always had trouble walking. We always thought it was a bum knee but she ended up getting diagnosed with a mass, and then that progressed. By the time I was an early teen she had a lot of trouble walking and had a lot of pain from muscle spasms. As I got older, the disease continued to progress until the point when she became quadriplegic. She actually died in March of last year and eventually succumbed to her MS. [multiple sclerosis] My dad is still alive and well. He is eighty-five and lives in Los Angeles with his third wife now. They are doing great.
AS: Is she in her eighties?
RL: He married a younger woman, she is in her seventies. [laughs]
AS: Besides being raised by doctors, what motivated you to go into medicine?
RL: That’s a great question. I don’t have a single memory of ever thinking I want to be doctor, but I always wanted to be a doctor. When I was a little kid, my mom tells a story about telling some friend of mine to take two cookies and call me in the morning, or something like that. Always, as a little kid I wanted to be a doctor. 
Both my parents, to a lesser extent my father, really my mother, persuaded me not to become a doctor. They were both psychiatrists that changed a lot and were some what disillusioned with the way modern medicine was dealing with psychiatry. They really did not want me to be a physician. I really always have wanted to be one. It was one of the great desires of my whole life. I have a very vivid memory of being in seventh grade taking biology class in school and thinking, This is the first step. I have to do well in biology so I can do well in high school so I can do well to get into college so I can do well to get into medical school. I remember thinking that. 
AS: You’ve always wanted to be a doctor, but you’ve wanted it for so long you’ve forgotten what it was.
RL: There was no one moment. Ever since I can remember I wanted to be a doctor. If you ask me why it is because I’ve always liked talking to people, hearing their stories, and helping them. As germane as that sounds, which is what everyone says when they want to be a doctor, that’s why I wanted to be a doctor. 
AS: Well, those are the types of people we want to be doctors. Can you talk a little bit about how you got into addiction medicine as a specialty, and if you want to precede that with your own experience with addiction?
RL: Sure. I am pulling this number out of thin air, but I would approximate that close to the majority or a large minority of addiction doctors have some sort of personal experience with addiction; either with family or friends or themselves. I am one of the ones that has that experience of addiction. That is why I talk about how great my childhood was because when people hear you have an addiction they assume your childhood was terrible. I can say that I was never really bullied. A little bit, but never badly. My parents never abused me. I had a great childhood. I also cannot blame my parents. My parents also got concerned. They said, How did we screw up? And I said, You know, not everything is about you guys!
AS: That’s hard to remember sometimes. 
RL: It’s true though. I am an addict for my own reasons. I can believe the genetics, potentially, and it is a little sketchy because we don’t have a complete family history. In high school, my friends and I drank and experimented with marijuana. It was excessive sometimes, but we never got in trouble with the law, we never missed school, and we never cut class. It was pretty controlled. We were in New York City in the early nineties to mid-nineties and the laws around alcohol consumption were not very strict. If you had some sort of photo ID that you were over the age of twenty-one you didn’t have to be legit; they would sell you alcohol, and they didn’t particularly care. It was easy to get and we fooled around with it. 
When I went to college I actually cut out a lot of drinking; I really didn’t drink much because I was always focused on my studies. I really wanted to be a doctor and so I was focusing on my studies. I did go through a period when I smoked marijuana pretty regularly for about a semester. I almost failed a class -- I got a B minus, not that I almost failed a class. That was the worst grade I ever got and I was like, No more marijuana. I stopped. I think I smoked once after that. 
What did happen was during the last semester of my senior year, I fell and broke my ankle very badly. I was living with a group of guys and dating this girl at the time. It was a very bad fracture and I remember getting my first dose of morphine at the ER [emergency room]. All this anxiety and this tension and this stress in my life all evaporated. It was really miraculous.
AS: What was bad, the pain you were in?
RL: It wasn’t just the physical pain. It was bad but what was worse was the fear, the anxiety. I have always had anxiety, but the anxiety went away. Growing up I was always anxious too, but I dealt with it. It was an intramuscular injection of morphine. I remember that very, very clearly. And that, in addiction medicine, is called salience. We can talk about that, but that is a bad sign when someone remembers it very well like that, it is memory salience. I remembered it very clearly. All of that anxiety disappeared for a short amount of time, and it was really wonderful. 
I was also in a lot of pain and the pain went away too, which was really nice. Anyone who has been in bad pain knows that. It didn’t go away completely, but it got much better. My ankle was dislocated and had multiple fractures so I had a lot of pain. What I remember was not as much the pain as the anxiety and being free from it. It was miraculous. 
I was in Northfield, Minnesota and I was still living in New York at the time so I had to fly back to New York the next day. They relocated my dislocated ankle in the ER and gave me a splint and some crutches and told me to go see an orthopedic surgeon because I was going to need surgery to repair my ankle. This is over spring break. I remember flying home and I actually screwed up the prescription. I had a prescription for Vicodin and Ibuprofen. I meant to put the Vicodin in my carry-on bag and my Ibuprofen in my checked bag and I flipped them. I put the Ibuprofen in my carry-on bag and that was a very tough flight because I was in a lot of pain. When I got home I took a Vicodin and I remember thinking, Ah, that’s much better. 
AS: What year was this?
RL: March 15, 2001 was when I had the fracture. 
AS: You’re a senior in college, so you’re twenty-two?
RL: Twenty-two, yes. I was born in 1979. I was born February 5, 1979. After that traumatic experience I was at home and I actually didn’t take much pain medication after that. Then I had surgery, and my parents being doctors and knowing how terrible hospitals are elected to have outpatient surgery, and it was pretty extensive surgery. I trusted my parents when it came to medical procedures and I still do, my dad at least. I had an anesthetic block on my leg. When I woke up I remember there was no pain. It was fantastic. I didn’t take any medication, went home, and went to bed. 
I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like they were still operating on that leg. What they did not tell me was when that block wears off all the pain relief goes away very quickly. You go from having total pain relief to having no pain relief. I was in some serious pain. I remember taking oxycodone and not getting much relief and not sleeping well. I was scared after that, of the pain. I took a lot of oxycodone during my recovery phase. At the same time, I didn’t notice any sort of euphoric effects, but I did notice I was more chatty and talkative when I was on it as opposed to when I was off it, but I didn’t think anything of that. 
I went back to college after two weeks. When I went back to college, basically everyone was graduating. All my friends and the people I lived with were graduating. My girlfriend broke up with me, I wasn’t particularly fun to be around because I couldn’t do much. My friends were like, well, he’s kind of lame, and can’t do much, and frankly, yes, I was feeling sorry for myself. I was ostracized and I was feeling sorry for myself. I felt like I had, as I call it now, a lot of life pain for the first time. I had had bad things happen, like when my mom got sick there was a period of time when we were worried my mom was going to die. I had had life pain, but nothing prolonged for so long. I still have intermittent, pretty bad pain. 
I was scared that the pain would come and get worse and come back to the pain it was after that first night I had been operated on. I would take some Percocet, and I noticed that when I took the Percocet the pain of my situation, which isn’t that bad, but hurt at the time, would also go away. The joke among medical professionals is that occasionally patients come in requesting Percocet for life pain. Most doctors say, Too bad, it doesn’t work. My point is that it does work. It actually works really well. Narcotics treat life pain for a short period of time very well. It treats all types of pain: existential pain, spiritual pain, physical pain, all pain because they work on the brain where pain is processed. I started taking it for my life pain, essentially. 
Another important factor for me was that I was only taking two classes at the time. When I take narcotics I am one of the relatively rare people where it has what we call a paradoxical reaction. It did not make me sleepy. It almost made me feel like I had drank a bunch of coffee. It made me more alert. I started to do better in school, actually. I started taking them to help me do better in school. I was taking them pretty regularly. Also, because a lot of my parents’ friends were doctors and they knew I had this terrible pain and this terrible surgery, they would keep prescribing me narcotics. I took narcotics pretty regularly my last semester of college. I took the MCATs [medical college admission test], I remember I had taken a bunch of Vicodin for worried about being in pain during the MCATs and for thinking I would do better on the MCATs. Lord knows if I did or not, I did well enough to get into medical school. 
AS: It was covering two different parts of your life: your fear of pain, and your desire to succeed. 
RL: Yes, and the anxiety of taking the tests, right. My anxiety got much better, and that’s probably why I was doing better in school. 
I took a year off because I had to rehab my ankle; I couldn’t go directly to medical school. I still had to learn how to walk again. The first half of that year I stayed in New York and mostly rehabbed my ankle and lived with my parents. I didn’t take that much pain medication because I wasn’t in pain. All of my high school friends were still around. They had gone off to college but they had come back and were all doing things. They had internships and stuff like that; all the things children of upper-middle class people do in New York. They were all around, I had a great physical therapist, and I had a trainer at the gym. I was getting into great physical shape and I was on a diet. 
I was feeling pretty good, and I would only very rarely take a Percocet. Then it was more so because I had been too long on the elliptical, I couldn’t run yet, then did an intense physical therapy session, and then on the subway ride home it hurt pretty badly and I would take a Percocet. That was probably like once a week.
AS: You were able to stop whenever?
RL: The point is that I really never stopped. I still would take it weekly.
AS: But you could take it a whole week and you wouldn’t get sick? You wouldn’t get withdrawal symptoms?
RL: No. That fun didn’t come until later. [laughs]
AS: Is that possible for people? To keep using them intermittently and not experience any withdrawal symptoms?
RL: Yes. It is possible. Most people who get surgery and have intermittent severe pain can take narcotics intermittently and have no problem with them.
At that point, in my professional opinion, although it is always hard to be your own doctor, I was abusing narcotics but not addicted to them yet. Or, in the DSM-V [diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition], for those listening and judging me I would have opioid use disorder - mild at this point. That would be the diagnosis. 
The second half of my year off I spent hanging out in Aspen [Colorado] with a buddy of mine who was a snowboard instructor. I did odds and end jobs, snowmaking, I worked at a gym for a while, and hung out. It was pretty lonely out there and I would take a Vicodin or two every couple of days because I was bored. I thought it would make things more interesting. Again, I always had plenty. My surgeon and other doctors would write prescriptions for huge amounts of it because I would tell them I take it rarely and I didn’t want to bother them and I was going to Colorado. They would give me one hundred and fifty of them just to make sure I had enough, but I did it from a couple of doctors so I was progressing at this point. They were all good friends of my family and things like that. “We don’t want Bob to suffer! It sounds reasonable” and stuff like that.
AS: You had some good, legitimate excuses. 
RL: I went out to Colorado and started dating my girlfriend who would become my wife. I was also going to medical school interviews. I would take a Vicodin before all of my interviews because it would help with my anxiety and I wanted to do better at them. I would take it for that. We are talking once, twice, maybe three times a week. 
Then there was a time when medical school interviews were over. I was accepted to a few and the one that I eventually went to. I had this period of time where I didn’t really have anything to do and I was hanging out in Colorado and I stopped taking them again for a couple of months. 
The first year of medical school I almost never took them. Occasionally on the weekends to have a good time I would take them. The interesting thing was that living with my fiance at the time, the same person, and I never told her that I was doing this. I never told anybody; I was hiding this. I think I did at one point tell one of my high school friends. I was like, Hey, have you ever taken pills to have fun? He said, No, and I said, Do you want to try it? He said, Not particularly, so I thought, Okay, I get it. I was taking it once a month on Saturdays. 
Second year comes around and my fiance starts at NYU [New York University] and is commuting. I was living on Long Island at the time and I would come home and be totally alone for a percentage of the night. I would start taking them after school to help with the anxiety of being alone, but in my mind it was to have a good time. I did that for a while too and the use escalated. 
Third year was a very intense year and I cut way back. The other really interesting thing was that the medical licensing exams have various steps and you take your first step of that exam after the second year of med school. I got married between the second and third year. I remember taking a couple of Vicodin before my wedding, but I did not do it before taking step one. I can’t tell you why that is. I can tell when I was high and when I wasn’t now because my memory was different. My memory is much clearer when I wasn’t taking the drug. The wedding is a little fuzzy but I clearly remember taking step two. The MCATs were fuzzy, I have very little memory of taking the MCATs now. It is directly correlated to how much opioid I had taken. I remember the subway ride, I remember things around taking step one and I don’t remember taking drugs for that. I did okay on step one, but not as well as the other one I had taken. [laughs]
I get married, third year comes around, and I use it very rarely again. Part of me knows it’s not a great idea to take drugs then see patients in a clinical setting. The fourth year comes around and you have to start picking what sort of specialty you want to do. You have to start making life plans. My mom is getting sicker and my parents are starting to have marital discord. It was a stressful time and I found myself taking more, again, because of the stress. That was what I told myself. I find myself taking it after rotations. 
Fourth year was the time, I don’t remember why, where you could argue that I go from mild to moderate opiate use disorder and from moderate to severe opioid use disorder because I started taking it every day. It was sometime in my fourth year right as I was making the decision about what to do. I distinctly remember sitting in a hotel room with my wife, I still have the paper, and doing a pro and con list of doing family medicine or anesthesia. I chose to do anesthesia, I took my anesthesia sub-bi and I was so nervous that I took a Vicodin everyday before the rotation because I could do better. At this point it is actually clear that I’m not doing better on it, but I still am under the impression that I am. My dose has gone up a little bit, I’m not taking the one Vicodin, I’m taking one or two or a Percocet. I would break them in half and eat half of one and now I’m eating a whole one and I’m doing it every day. 
AS: Is one stronger than the other?
RL: Not really. People believe that hydrocodone is weaker than oxycodone but it’s really not, they are all the same. I go to taking it daily at some point at the end of my fourth year of med school. It’s strange to me because I was really using it infrequently the third year and my fourth year it really escalated quite quickly and I can’t place my hand on it. Hearing stories from other addicts, some people can and some people can’t place it. I am one of those people that just can’t. There isn’t just one moment. 
What I do know is that I matched at a very good anesthesia program and my first year of anesthesia was a rotating schedule and you aren’t in the operating room much. You are doing a lot of other things: medicine, cardiology, the ICU [intensive care unit], pediatrics, emergency room, and a bunch of other rotations. It is called a transitional year, but I went to a program where everything is integrated together. 
I reverted back to only using it occasionally again that year. I experienced withdrawal, but I didn’t know it at the time. The interesting thing too, I forgot about this, I had to take a drug test before my job. I knew I had prescriptions but I didn’t want to throw any of these doctors under the bus. They prescribed them over the phone or I would go pick them up at their house, this is not super legit, it is some kind of sketchy stuff. I stopped and I had withdrawal. I thought I had the flu and I was super sick, but I remember I thought it had to be a week before I peed in the cup. That isn’t true, you don’t need that much time, but I didn’t know. I peed in the cup, passed the test, and didn’t return to regular use right away. 
Eventually, towards the end of that last year, I started using it to have fun on the weekends or for anxiety and it very quickly went back to daily. Also, when I was on-call I would get nervous and I thought I was a better doctor when I was on them and I would take them while I was on-call. I practiced medicine while I was under the influence of these opioids. I didn’t get caught, and the fortunate thing is that as a resident you always have supervision. I can’t comment because I really don’t know what my practice of medicine was really like, but I do know that someone was always watching over me. And I was never under any academic problems when I was under residency. 
Second year of residency starts and I do a lot more anesthesia and I find anesthesia a lot less fulfilling than I thought I would. I have a lot of respect for people who do it but it was not my calling. I’m more of a people person, I wanted to listen to the stories and meet the people. Anesthesia is really cool in medical school because you get to do procedures and give out drugs and see things happen. Once you start to do that regularly it becomes, at least for me, routine and then boring. I would sit in the OR [operating room] bored all the time. 
At the same time I am running out of pills. Most of my doctors, or suppliers, frankly, are in New York. I am not. I am far away from New York. I would go back to New York for vacations and hit these people up for more drugs and they would give them to me because I am so-and-so’s son. 
AS: Now it has been a few years. It has been four or more years since your surgery. 
RL: It has been five years.
AS: Five years and they are still willing with no questions asked?
RL: Yes. Well, I was starting to get questions. I don’t think ‘no questions’ is fair. I was starting to get questions. I was starting to get heat. Some people stopped. Some people started really questioning me and my supply was dwindling and my needs were increasing. I needed more and more and my supply was dwindling and I couldn’t go back as much. In the place I was living my doctor, I got the impression, was not going to be willing to prescribe for me. I never asked him, for whatever reason. 
One day it happens I was basically out. Like most drug addicts, I was hyper careful about my supply and I was down to my emergency supply. I went to work and I went into withdrawal for the first time at the hospital and that was really terrible. Having to do rounds and have withdrawal is no fun. Then I had to go to work and do the anesthesia.
AS: When you were in withdrawal and doing your rounds you were sweating, shaking, and feeling sick?
RL: Sweating, shaking not so much, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, not looking healthy, having a runny nose, yawning, tearing. It is full on withdrawal.
AS: And you are managing to do your rounds?
RL: Yeah, I mean I am taking Ibuprofen. Every addict has their ways of dealing. I am doing what I can and managing as best I can. I know I wasn’t because my attending was kind of like, What is going on? Get your shit together. I got nervous. I remember the first time thinking, Well, fentanyl is a narcotic. It’s right there and I know how to use it. At the time I thought of it as borrowing, but it was really stealing. I stole fentanyl for the first time. 
Like a good anesthesiologist I injected it because that’s how you use fentanyl as an anesthesiologist. The one thing I am grateful for is that I had a family friend who was in a position of leadership at a medical institution where they had an addicted anesthesiologist who contaminated a bunch of fentanyl with Hepatitis C. It gave a bunch of patients Hepatitis C and I knew that story, so the one thing I am grateful for was that I was very, very careful to never cross contaminate anything. At the same time I was dividing fentanyl for me and my patients, and really it’s all for your patients. I’m not trying to defend that. 
I started using fentanyl and it is not long after that that things really started to fall apart. My appearance started to fall apart. My personal life started to fall apart. My wife was just saying, You’re always so distant. My friends were like, What is going on? Once you really start using intravenous fentanyl it is a big jump. The withdrawals are a million times worse. The cravings start and they are really bad. They had started before that but they got really bad. 
I had a three month run. It was only three months before one of my attendings noticed that I had essentially -- anesthesia has actually done a really great job in trying to discover when anesthesiologists or nurse anesthetists start using, because they have the highest rate among medical practitioners. I was the poster child. I was taking more bathroom breaks, I was volunteering for call, I was wearing long sleeves -- I had to wear long sleeves because I had track marks at this point. I normally do not wear long sleeves and I was doing it all the time now at this point, and it wasn’t because I was cold! 
AS: They have known things to watch for. People are aware of this?
RL: These are known things, yes. People are aware of it. At this program there was a person that was supposed to be watching it. He did the best he could, but these people have a lot of residents and I wasn’t working with him at the time. 
At the time the person I was working with and I had a good relationship, frankly. She was someone I really respected and she knew more about my personal life. My parents had also divorced at this point. My dad had gone off to live with someone else and my mom had moved away to live closer to me and help care for me, so I had a lot of stress with that. My aunt had also died. There were a lot of things that had happened that had escalated it. I didn’t go into any of that and I’m sorry. 
AS: That’s okay. This is all during this three month period?
RL: Preceding it. That leads to the build up. It sounds very sudden, but there actually is a boiling point of things in my life. I had no other way of dealing with my anxiety. Actually, I was seeing a therapist. I was always seeing a therapist. I was lying to him and or her, there were two I saw, about what I was using. I didn’t tell them I was taking pills all the time. I didn’t tell them I was taking fentanyl. I was just trying to deal with my anxiety. 
AS: Did they ever suggest medication for your anxiety?
RL: I honestly cannot remember. They must have. At some point before all of this I had started on Zoloft. Someone started me on Zoloft but I don’t remember when. But, of course, it didn’t help because I was taking opiates. I knew anxiety was a problem so I took it. At this point most of my anxiety is of opioid withdrawal. When you take fentanyl you withdrawal all the time. And, of course, the only way to not withdrawal is to go into treatment or take more opiates. 
Eventually I get intervened on on May 3, 2008. 
AS: By colleagues?
RL: By my attending. She said, Can you come talk to me in my office? I knew something was up. I was on-call, and it was a Saturday. Salience; I remember this very well. I was really bad at that point. I had just finished my cardiac rotation which is where you have a lot of access to narcotics and I was going to outpatient where you have very little access to narcotics and I was hoarding a bunch at that call. 
It was the first time, she later told me this, but it was the first time that a patient of mine was under anesthesia at that time and woke up and was in a lot of pain, which is the last sign that someone is using. Even though I had charted and gave him a bunch of narcotics he still woke up in a lot of pain. She said that that was when she knew. There were all the other signs, but that is when she knew. It had never happened before. 
She called the program director and she agreed that that was what she should do. She did it alone but she didn’t do it alone. She did all the right things, she got everyone involved, and everyone knew. They had their protocol and they did it. She said, I think you use anesthetic drugs. I didn’t hide it, I started crying and telling her how I had desperately -- and I had -- tried to stop so many times in the past. 
AS: But first you denied it?
RL: Yeah, of course. I sat down and she was like, Are you using anesthesia? And I was like, No, no, and she didn’t say anything. If anybody is listening to this or reading this that is a great way -- to just not say anything. It is really effective. She just didn’t say anything and I started to sob and sob. 
It was true, I had tried to quit so many times. I knew I had a problem. A couple weeks before that I had started Googling ‘how do you stop injecting drugs?’ and I got all this stuff on detox and was like, okay, no. Seriously. I desperately tried to stop. I had tried tapering, substituting, I had stolen Naloxone and induced my own withdrawal. I tried a lot of things. 
AS: So you were ready to be discovered?
RL: Super ready. I was ready before I stole the fentanyl. Maybe I didn’t do a great job through this whole story because it is kind of stream of consciousness but --
AS: It’s been fine. Yeah. 
RL: I was really done pretty much when I entered med school. I had thought, I don’t want to do this anymore. Sorry, when I entered residency. I didn’t want to do it anymore and I still felt compelled to because the withdrawal and the anxiety. And I didn’t want to lie to these people; my friends, my family friends. I don’t want to fill these prescriptions under false pretenses. It was against every ethical and moral thing I stood for. And it still took me like fifteen months to come to the point where I was like, Okay, it’s time. 
AS: When people say addiction hijacks someone’s brain and their core self, that would also be your experience?
RL: Absolutely.
AS: It is a matter of privilege and circumstance that you were allowed to do those things without being caught. Someone with lesser resources would be shoplifting or robbing people or accessing the street corner. 
RL: Clearly, yes. Absolutely. I have never done heroin, but I describe myself as a heroin addict sometimes. When I am at AA [alcoholics anonymous] meetings I don’t say I’m a fentanyl addict -- well, actually these days people do know what that is, but before they did not. And to say that is to imply that there is something different between me and them, and there’s not. There is not. I want to make that very clear. For all intensive purposes I am a heroin addict, I just never did heroin. I did morphine, which is essentially the same thing. Fentanyl was the opioid I liked the most, but I took all of them if I had the access. I took morphine and pills. They are all the same. 
In street and AA meetings I identify as a heroin addict and I did it intravenously. There were times when I came close to overdosing. I remember in the bathroom of the hospital a couple of times. There were ultra potent derivatives of fentanyl and remifentanil. Super potent fentanyl derivatives. It is super terrible, really terrible. 
AS: Let’s go back to that day. She intervenes on you. What else does she say?
RL: She says I know you are using drugs. I break down. She says it’s okay, I’m going to drive you home. I have someone else to come in and cover for you. The other resident is going to deal with the pager. I had this pain pager that dealt with the acute pain. She said, I’m going to give someone else the pager, there are no cases right now. I am going to take you home in your car. I gave her the keys to my car. She made me change so I couldn’t bring drugs home from the hospital. 
She drove me home and my wife was there, she told my wife what happened. She made my wife look after me. She called someone else and someone else picked her up. My wife was great and she looked after me. I remember waking up in the morning and having my eyes closed and thinking, Please, god, let me wake up in the call room. If I wake up in the call room this is all a dream. A terrible, terrible dream. I opened my eyes and for the first and only time in my life I supremely disappointed to find myself in my own bed. I was like, Shit. I knew it was coming so I went through withdrawals and it was terrible. I also had this sense of peace because I was like, Okay, now everyone knows. Excuse my language, but fuck it, everyone knows at this point. Whatever is going to happen, all the fear and anxiety about what is going to happen when I run out, I am going to find out. 
The other thing I did that night, I forgot to mention, the night I was intervened on, the attending and my wife were like, Do you have any drugs in the house? For whatever reason I was completely honest. I showed them where all of them were and they threw away all of them. That doesn’t mean there were any in the house. I actually found a couple of pills in the house that I didn’t know where they were. They had fallen behind the dresser or something like that. So, I had no access from the first time, which was the day that I broke my ankle. From March 15, 2001 until May 3, 2008 I was always in reach of a narcotic. And that was the first day that I was not. It was scary. 
At the same time it was liberating. That withdrawal, although it was really bad, in my mind was not nearly as bad as the other ones because I was never thinking about how I was going to get more, what I was going to do, how I was going to hide it. I was like fuck it, it’s out. I do remember distinctly thinking how I was never going to be happy again. I do remember that. The only thing that made me happy was drugs. I was going to have to learn how to live life with never being happy. It was about the closest I got to being suicidal. I was actually never suicidal, I just knew I was going to have to live without ever being happy again, which is not true. 
AS: No, but it’s what you thought at the time.
RL: It is what I thought at the time. I remember distinctly thinking that I would never be happy again. 
The chair of the department comes and talks to me on that Monday. He let me alone on that Sunday.
AS: At your home?
RL: At home. He told me he was going to put me on medical leave and have the addiction point person come talk to me, and he offered support. The addiction point person came and said, I want you to meet with this addiction doctor. I got you an appointment and it’s on Wednesday. It was Monday at this point. I was like, Okay. I continued withdrawal and spent a lot of time in bed, watching T.V. and drinking soup or whatever else I could get down. 
By Wednesday it was getting better. This is the longest I have been without narcotics for like a year and some. It was getting better, still not super happy and some underlying anxiety. I talked to this guy and he was great. He did the whole intake. I was going through withdrawals and he was like, You know, it looks like you’re still in mild to moderate withdrawal. I thought it was the worst thing ever. He was right. He said, I’m not even going to give you any buprenorphine, I don’t think you need it at this point. You’re past the worst of it. He was right. I didn’t like that statement, but he was right. 
He got me started in intensive outpatient therapy. According to ASAM [American Society of Addiction Medicine] criteria, it was technically partial hospitalization treatment and I had to go into that. It is the highest level that is not inpatient treatment or the lowest level that is inpatient treatment. It is kind of in that gray area. I would go everyday from eight until one Monday through Friday. Then we would have a group meeting on Sunday. 
I did that and met with a bunch of other people in the community. They got me hooked up with doctors in recovery very early. I was interviewed on Monday and the meeting which was the AA meeting for doctors in that town was Monday night. They were like, You should go! And I was like, No, I’m not going to go. The addiction point person was super persistent and he called someone else who was a medical student in recovery and he said you should go to this meeting. Leah, my wife, told me she would drive me. So she drove me to this, what I now know is an Alano Club, but it was a clubhouse. I went into the wrong damn meeting. I did not go to the doctor’s meeting, I went to a different meeting. The Thursday meeting became my home group because it was a great meeting. I remember my first AA meeting. Everyone was telling my story. 
AS: The wrong meeting became your home group.
RL: It was the wrong meeting. I was like, These people are doctors? Then as they were telling their stories I learned that they weren’t doctors. I’m at the wrong meeting. They all look great and a lot of them look very professional, but the dude sitting next to me was clearly a mechanic that had just come from work. He was working a shirt that said like Rusty’s Auto Repair with some grease and a little rag.
AS: Right. You know your people.
RL: I think he said something about a transmission and I was just like there is no way that guy is a doctor. [laughs] The point was that they were fantastic and that’s actually where my love of non-medical AA came from. It was my first meeting and these people’s stories were all the same. Yes, they didn’t work in hospitals, but this guy was fixing cars and he was intoxicated. The other guy was a salesman and he couldn’t sign his signature because he was shaking so bad from his alcoholism. This is the same as my story, just twenty times over. It was great. I felt at home. I felt at peace. I felt like, Oh my god these people all did it. Some were worse off than I was and they were doing okay. Maybe I could do this too.
I started IOP [intensive outpatient program], I eventually got hooked up with the Kaduceus group, they were very important, I’m not going to lie. There are certain things that are unique physicians and other healthcare providers and professionals. One of them was like, You have to tell the state. You have to tell the state what is going on because if you don’t they are going to find out anyway and it is worse if they find out and you don’t tell them. Lots of fun!
At the same time the hospital doesn’t officially agree. The department did everything by the book and so they alerted the hospital administration. They do their own official inquiry. I am new in AA and all of that. Yes, I was deposed.
AS: You had your own deposition.
RL: Kind of. In rigorous honesty I tell them everything, which my sponsor later was like, You know, that’s good when you are in the room, but maybe not with the opposing side’s lawyers. [laughs] Long story short is that they put me on FMLA [family and medical leave] and paid me salary and benefits for six months. When that ran out they ‘allowed’ me to quit. They were not going to take me back. I was hoping I could just switch and do family medicine there, and the family medicine program was all set to take me and the hospital was like no, you’re fired. I was like, Oh right, I did all that stuff.
Initially I was super pissed at the hospital but they did what they had to. I had admitted to them that I showed up intoxicated, stole from them, and practiced under the influence. They terminated me. Actually, they didn't terminate me. They said they would give me a week to resign and if you don’t we’ll terminate you. The distinction is important because in medicine on your credentials it asks if you have ever been terminated and I can honestly say, No, I’ve resigned, I was never terminated. I have enough things to say to on those credential application things. One of which is why did you ever have a break in your training, which I’ll talk about.
I alert the state and I’m five days away from graduating from this partial hospitalization. The state comes back and says, You’ve got to go to inpatient treatment and you’ve got to go to one of these places that deals with physicians. I said, But my addiction doctor said I have to do outpatient and my insurance is not going to cover this. They said, Medically you don’t have to. If you want to keep your medical license you have to. 
I had a long and difficult conversation with my parents because it was expensive, I was in residence, and I had no coverage. Also, under the influence I had bought this really big house that was way too much house for me because I thought it was very important. We were never super broke because my parents were always able to help us out, but we were way over extended and I didn’t have thirty thousand dollars laying around. My mom footed the entire bill. I am really lucky. 
I went to the Hazelden Center in Springbrook, Oregon which is where they housed all the physicians. I went there because over the phone they said it would be a twenty-eight day program. Every other place I went to said for physicians it is ninety days. I get there and on the third day they said, For physicians it is ninety days also. It is funny because the doc, the treating physician at the time, who is a wonderful guy, was used to people just blowing up. You could see him preparing himself. At that point I was like, Whatever, I don’t care. He was like, Really? I am in a very privileged position because my mom was paying for all of this. Instead of thirty thousand it was going to be forty-five thousand. I have to get the fifteen grand and she is going to pay for it, but she is going to pay for it so that doesn’t matter. Leah, my wife, is pissed that I’m not going to be home, but she said it’s better than using drugs. I was like, Whatever. Plus, it was a really beautiful time to be in Oregon. I went in early April. Even though I was only three days there I knew it was more intense. Nothing against the treatment center I had in my hometown, but this was clearly better treatment. I knew I didn’t want to go back; I didn’t want to use again. I thought if it takes more time it takes more time. 
I had met some good friends. Some of them I’m still friends with. Some of them are physicians and some are not. I was where the physicians were housed but my best friend in treatment was younger than me, I think I was twenty-nine at the time and I think he was twenty-two or twenty-three. We became best friends. We are still friends. He ended up dying in a car accident sober, just tragically. He grew up in Alaska and he moved to Minnesota to be in aftercare and I ended up getting a job in Minnesota, so we were close to each other and hung out and saw each other. He was doing great. He was driving to work on an icy road and the car slipped off and flipped and he was killed. They did test him because his family wanted to know and he was sober when he died. It was just an accident. Bad things happen even when you’re in sobriety. 
Anyway, I met some great people. I did my ninety days of treatment. You have to go back home and get plugged into AA and get a sponsor and stuff but I actually already had all that stuff. I had done that partial hospitalization program and almost completed it. I had already done aftercare through the same program and I already had a sponsor and I already knew all the AA meeting that I was going to. I had all this time during the IOP to go to AA meetings everyday. 
I’m done with treatment, I go home, and I step back into all this. The state grants me back my medical license and I do get terminated from this hospital, so now I’m in this limbo. It is August or September and now the process to get another residency spot is passed. I can’t get my stuff together in time anyways. The one thing I really wish the hospital would have done would have been to just fire me in September, but they didn’t. They kept me in limbo and didn’t announce they were terminating me until the day before Christmas. I think administratively they just had to get all their ducks in a row and it took them that long, but at the time I thought they did it because they were being punitive. I don’t think that anymore. 
AS: I thought you quit?
RL: Okay, they sent the letter saying you have to quit or we are going to fire you. So, yes. Technically I quit. They sent the letter saying you have to quit or we are going to terminate you the day before Christmas. In that time between September and December I met with the family medicine department and the medicine department. I had already made the decision in treatment that I was not going to go back to anesthesia. It was a bad idea because there was too much fentanyl lying around, and it wasn’t really my passion. Looking back I had that piece of paper and I should have done family medicine anyways because it was more in line with what my goals were. Again, nothing against anesthesia. 
I met with the addiction point person in the department of anesthesia. We had a couple of conversations on the phone and then met in person when I got back. Everyone was okay with this and on board with this. Then I met with the department of family medicine and I was like, I’m going to start family medicine and I’ve been accepted and it is going to be great. They had a position for me, and they had actually just lost one of their residents for a drug related problem also. They said, Perfect you will fit right in. Then the hospital sends the letter and I had to inform them that I could not join them. 
I was really devastated because I was unsure if I was ever going to be a doctor again. It is hard, there is all this stigma. Now I am an addict. I’m an intravenous drug using addict who resigned from their anesthesia job, has a gap in their training of at least six months and will be even longer because I can’t get a job. The earliest I can get a job as a resident now is in June of the following year, 2009. What am I going to do? 
To make matters worse, my wife is a very tolerant and loving person, and she put up with a lot. At some point she was like, Look, I’m okay not making anesthesia money anymore. One of the main reasons I was an anesthesiologist was because you make a lot more money than family medicine. Not to say that my wife is monetarily driven, but of course it is part of it. She said, I’m fine with that, I’m fine with us moving, I’m fine with us selling this house, I’m fine with you being a drug addict, I’m fine with you going away, but if you are going to do all of this we are going to move closer to my family so we wanted to move to Minnesota.  
I can’t do the match process which usually happens in residency. I had to scramble which means I had to find a program with an open spot that is not through the match process. And now we were limiting it to Minnesota. I was going to have to do pediatrics or something. Nothing against pediatrics but I didn’t want to do pediatrics. I was stuck with family medicine or I was willing to do internal medicine in Minnesota. I said, Leah, the odds of me getting a position are really small. She was like, I’m going to move to Minnesota. If you have to do residency somewhere else we will try to make it work but I’m moving to Minnesota. I was like, Well, shit. I’m moving to Minnesota, too. 
Part of my disease -- my pathology, not my disease -- was that too much of my identity was tied up in being a doctor anyway. I thought this might be the universe’s way of telling me I shouldn’t be a doctor for a little while. I thought, If I can’t get a spot in Minnesota I will find something else to fill my time, but I’ll be in Minnesota. 
I get the scramble list from a friend of mine in treatment actually because I hadn’t even signed up in time to get the scramble list. There are two open family medicine spots and one open internal medicine spot. I called the internal medicine spot place actually second and no one answered. The first place I called was the residency spot in North Memorial, the family medicine residency at the University of Minnesota. I didn’t get a voicemail, I got the program coordinator. I just blurted out my history to her. And she was like, Oh, okay. Can you fax over your stuff? [laughs] I said, Sure. 
So I did, and then I got a phone call a half an hour later from the program director. I tell him my whole story and he goes, Okay. Then we did a little interview and he asked me about my interest in family medicine, he asked me about Minnesota, about treatment, what I thought of it, and if I viewed myself as an addict, which I did at the time. Then I got another phone call from the associate program director and another from the head of behavioral medicine at the program. Then I got an offer faxed to me and I took it. 
AS: Did the behavioral medicine have anything to do with addiction medicine?
RL: No, it was just the behaviorist. Most family medicine programs have some sort of behavioral health component. Most of them have a behavioral health lead. I think it is required. North certainly does. They have a long history of integration with behavioral health in their primary care training. It was just part of the interview process for every applicant. It was pretty clear they didn’t know anything about addiction. But they knew enough that they thought, Well, this guy seems pretty smart, pretty motivated, and he says he’s sober. 
AS: And they had an opening.
RL: They had an opening. One thing I did not know was that they had an opening in the first year position and in the second year position. Given my standing they could move me to the second year open position and take someone else they really wanted for the first year position, too. It worked out very well for them. 
AS: You already had a year?
RL: According to the American Board of National Medicine I had something like twenty months of actual training. You also have to do twenty-four consecutive months at one training center so you had to do that. I had to do my second and third year here at North. So, I did. That’s how I wound up in Minnesota.
AS: How did you get into addiction medicine? When did you get into it?
RL: That’s a great question. It was 2009. One of the things I loved about my treatment and about my treatment provider at Hazelden was that he, and my addiction doctor at the other treatment place was great, but the addiction doc at Hazelden really loved addiction and loved teaching it to other physicians. It was part of his spiel. 
When I first got intervened on, I initially thought that addicts are bad people. I’m sorry, I did think that. Through treatment I thought, Well, other addicts aren’t bad people, but I’m a bad person. That took a long time. Part of Dr. Williams’ approach was teaching us about the disease. He said, You’re not a bad person. I know you did some bad things, I’m not going to lie. But this is why. This is what is happening in your brain. I found that fascinating.
My parents are both psychiatrists. I knew I didn’t want to do psychiatry. I wanted to do something that was more medical and this seemed like a great intersection. I was just utterly fascinated about it and I started reading about it in treatment. I had a ton of time, it was actually great. There was a ton of structure, I actually didn’t have that much free time in treatment. But, with my free time I did a lot of reading on it. Also, I still loved medicine. I thought, I may not be able to be a doctor, but that doesn’t mean I can’t learn about it. I read about it, and I learned a fair amount even before I ever set foot in a family medicine residency. 
I set foot in a family medicine residency, I started seeing patients, and I loved it. I loved it from the very start. I also remember being super grateful that I had a job. By the way, that persists. I still, to this day, am super grateful that I am a physician. It is a really wonderful way to fight burnout. People talk a lot about burnout physicians. I know how close I came to not being able to be a doctor and I am still to this day infinitely grateful that I was given that chance. And how privileged that position is, and it is. 
I realized that no one knows the first thing about addiction. They will go, This guy is an alcoholic. He’s in bad pain we should just give him Percocet. I’m like, That’s a bad idea. They are like, Why? I go, What do you mean, why? They would say, He’s addicted to alcohol he’s not going to get addicted to Percocet. I’m like, That’s not how it goes. I was printing articles and showing them to my attendings. They were saying, Oh, that’s interesting I didn’t know that. What? How do you not know this. 
AS: Because there is no training. 
RL: Because there is no training on addiction, especially back even in 2009. There was none. And this is a very good and progressive group of doctors at North. They said, We need to learn more. Even as a second year resident, they started asking me to help develop a chronic pain program and develop screening tools and help us develop this because I already knew stuff. They forced me further to do more research and to do more stuff and I got super into it. I also was like, No one knows what they are doing. I was like, Why am I a second year and a third year resident telling attendings how to do this stuff? The answer was because I knew more than they did. 
That’s okay, but that’s when I started to develop my passion. I was like, Look, addiction treatment belongs in primary care. Not all of it, there is a time and a place for an addiction specialist, but like diabetes, the vast majority of addiction treatment I feel should occur in primary care settings. Only when they are too complicated should they be referred to an addiction specialist. There is no way we are going to have enough addiction specialists to treat everyone who has an addiction. Just like we are never going to have enough renologists to treat everyone with renal problems. We are never going to have enough endocrinologists to treat everyone with diabetes. Family medicine has to do the bulk of this, but the bulk of the simple stuff. 
Frankly, the majority of addiction cases are relatively straightforward. The ones that we hear about are very complicated and do belong probably to a specialist. I can tell you the mundane are mundane. “You’re just a normal alcoholic, man!” [laughs] That’s the most common visit I have. They tell you this whole story and it is my story, it is me again, and I’m like, You’re an alcoholic. They think it’s the end of the world, and I’m just like, No, you’re just one of the thousands of people I’ve treated. It’s not exciting to me. They are like expecting me to be really upset and I’m like, No, seriously, I do this all the time. This is super common. 
I started and then I really wanted to work in integration of addiction medicine into primary care. I had a meeting with one of my mentors at North Memorial when I was a third year resident. I said, I want to do faculty, I want to do this. And he said, If you want to do this you need to do fellowship. You need the credentials. We would take you, but to make policy change and to take to systems and things like that. You need -- even though at the time it wasn’t Board of American Medical Association recognized -- you need a fellowship and the letters after your name.
At the time I was also going to a meeting of drug doctors and I’m not going to talk about it because it violates on the rules of AA too much, but there was a large meeting where a bunch of doctors in recovery meet regularly. I had become friends with a bunch of the doctors that meet regularly and one of the people there happened to work at the Hazelden location in Minnesota. They said, Look, we can create a fellowship for you and someone else. They had two people in line. They said, Why don’t you drop by when you are back in Minnesota? So I did and we met a couple of times. He was a friend of a friend and we became very friendly and he eventually became my mentor in addiction medicine and I did the fellowship. I continued to work with Hazelden part time and at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis/St. Paul] part time. 
In 2015 I left Hazelden to work at the University full time. Since then I have, through a lot of luck and hard work, I have been sober since May 3, 2008. I didn’t talk about this, but of course I had to be monitored by the state. They knew and I had a medical license from my hometown and I had a medical license from Minnesota so I told them and had to be monitored. For three and a half years everyday I would have to call and leave a random urine drug screen. Sometimes I would have to wake up very early before rotation or after I was on call I would have to drive to a collection point and leave urine. I had regular quarterly reports from work and from my sponsor. I needed to have meeting attendance, I had to see a psychiatrist, I had to do aftercare again. I don’t know why the state had me do that again because I had been sober for two years. They suddenly mandated that I had to do another aftercare program. I don’t understand that fully. But I was still at the stage where I was like, Okay, whatever. I did twenty-five two hour meetings with this group. It was great actually.
AS: You have remained open and cooperative in your own recovery because it’s humbling. Would you say you are a more humble person now? More grateful?
RL: Infinitely so. I had strengths growing up but humility was not one of them. I’m not sure you could call humility one of my strengths now, but I certainly have a lot more of it than I did. I wouldn’t call it one of my weaknesses anymore.
AS: But you aren’t using your authority as a physician to bulk at or refuse to go to these things. Or is it that you aren’t allowed to do that anyway?
RL: Good, good point. I wasn’t able to because the state could always take my medical licence away. That was always the threat. I was always compliant because I knew how good recovery was. 
I had learned, frankly, when I was a patient at Hazelden, that I didn’t have all the answers. Sometimes you have to listen to other people. Still, to this day, I trust those people. That they know more about what is best for my disease than I do. When I start to take control of my disease is when I start to run into trouble. When my sponsor says, You need to go to a meeting, I go to a meeting. My new sponsor in Minnesota is not a physician. My first sponsor was. He doesn’t know anything about medicine. I prefer it that way. If he tells me I need to go to a meeting, I go to a meeting. If I say, I’m an addiction medicine doctor, what do you mean I need to go to a meeting? I just go to a meeting. I trust him. 
AS: You say something or he hears something and he knows you need to go to a meeting?
RL: If I’m getting petty, or too anxious, or irritated while driving. That’s a big one for me. He’ll be like, How was the drive home? And I’ll tell him, Not great. He says, You’ve got to go to a meeting. And he’s almost always right. Sometimes he’s not but I still go to a meeting and it’s good. Yes, AA is very important to my recovery. I acknowledge that. I know that it’s not for everyone. I feel sorry for those people because it has been integral to my recovery and my social group. 
I don’t hide my addiction either. I hid it long enough. I was always open with the people at the University and at North Memorial. I was very fortunate in that they did not judge me because I know stories of people that have been judged. Now that I have a track record of successful employment it is harder to stigmatize and not hire me for things. They have no basis to not hire me. I was successfully hired before. I know I am lucky. 
I also teach residents now and I tell them in orientation about my own story as a part of wellness. I say, Look, there are fourteen people in this room between the staff and the residents. Statistically two of us are going to develop a problem with substance use disorder. Fortunately for you guys I have already taken one of the spots. That’s how I usually start. Only one of you now can take the other spot. I tell them my story and, like the person that was there for me at my other job, I say, I am always here for you guys. 
It has come up. We have had residents in this program that have developed addiction and we have gotten them help. They have gotten their medical licenses and are successfully practicing. Not all those stories go that way, it just happens to be at this program I sponsored someone in medical school who did not graduate medical school. He relapsed and said he was done. 
It is not always rosy, I’m not going to argue that. I have been very blessed and very fortunate in my life in many ways. 
AS: How has the integration of addiction treatment in primary care been working for you here?
RL: That is a great question. It totally depends on what you define as success. If you set the bar at better than when I got here, it has succeeded very well. I go to a lot of opioid and addiction forums in the state and I hear what doctors that practice are doing and I maybe have an ego moment that I have a lot of pride that none of my residents are going to do any of those things. I will say that with certainty every year we graduate ten family medicine doctors and none of them will do these things. None of them are going to blindly going to prescribe benzos or narcotics to anyone with an opioid use disorder. They will at least have a conversation about risks and benefits and monitor them with drug screening. They will at least do that at a very minimum.
AS: That adds up to a lot of patients every year who those people will be seeing. 
RL: Yes, it does. It is not because of me. It is because of what the faculty and I have built here. I guess it did start with me. 
AS: What does it involve? What are they required to do as a part of it?
RL: That is a very long and complicated answer.
AS: How many hours of training do they get?
RL: That is a little like asking a family medicine doctor, How many hours on diabetes and hypertension do you have? The answer is like, I don’t know, it comes up when it comes up.
AS: Okay. What you’re doing is creating a space where this is considered part of your normal training. Patients will come to you and some of them --
RL: Right. And we do have formal didactics. I just had a formal didactics with the residents on congestive heart failure. We also have one on alcoholism and opioid use disorder and chronic pain.
AS: The fact is is that it is integrated into the program whereas there are many programs where it is not discussed at all. 
RL: Right. When I discuss a case with the resident, when a twenty-six year old male comes in for a physical, which happens, they say, His blood pressure is fine, his cholesterol is okay, he needs more sleep, his single partner and sex stuff is okay. I will say, Have you asked him about his alcohol use? Initially it was ‘no’ but now he would say, I screened him for alcohol use and yes, he’s drinking too much and we talked about that. I asked if he has a family history of alcohol use, and actually, yes, he meets the criteria for alcoholism. We talked about that and we talked about next steps. 
AS: So it is just integrated into it.
RL: It is integrated into it, yeah. You have patients that you know are alcoholics. When he comes back and his blood pressure is high and I tell him he needs to quit drinking and he comes back and he actually looks like he is in alcohol withdrawal and we talked about that. It changes the trajectory of the treating. It just becomes something that you are used to talking about doing, and it therefore becomes part of it. 
AS: And not one of these uncomfortable, hidden things. The patient can still hide it, but if the doctor is willing to talk about it --
RL: I don’t want to say that it never happens because it does. Because these things are still difficult to talk about. The thing that it does mostly is in established patients in our clinics that have chronic pain, that are on narcotics, that we start to suspect have narcotic depends, residents will shy away from that conversation because it is a very difficult conversation. I am working on it. That is something a primary care doctor has to do. That is not something an addiction doctor has to do. Something that the person prescribing the opioids needs to do. 
But, we look for it now. We didn’t even look for it. We have prescribed you a bunch of oxycodone, why is there all this morphine in your urine? We test it further and it comes back, Well, it looks like you did some heroin. I never did heroin, doc. No, you did. It’s in your urine. Okay, I’ve been doing heroin for three years. You’re like, Okay, now we need to have a separate conversation. It happens all the time. 
AS: Right. What about best practices for the future of addiction medicine and for primary care doctors dealing with addiction? 
RL: I would say that a lot of the recommendations are already out there. If you look at the American Academy of Family Physicians there are different classes of recommendations for screening. Class A is the highest. At least to my knowledge at this date and time, there is only one Class A recommendation for screening and that is for drug and alcohol use. Everything we do is Class B, which is still very good. You should still do it, there is still good evidence, but it’s not as good. 
When you get screened for depression, cholesterol, high blood pressure, sexually transmitted diseases, Hepatitis C, or pap smears that’s actually all Class B. The only thing that is A is substance use disorder. Everyone does is with the same rigor that they do all the B stuff. When they think about why, it just becomes part of what they do. When they find a positive they know what the next steps are. 
Part of the reason doctors don’t screen for addiction is because you will never convince a physician to screen for something where they say, Yeah, I got that. They have no idea how to treat it. They would just prefer to not ask the question. No one wants to feel like an idiot. If I asked you the question as a physician and they say, Yeah, I have that. What do I do, doc? And I’m like, I don’t know. You would never ask that question. I hope that they know at least enough to do it.
There is a whole system called ESPRIT out there that is supposed to teach primary care doctors how to do that. I would like to see that very tightly integrated with primary care. I would like to see a better understanding of medication assisted treatment; I would like to see more primary care doctors doing buprenorphine treatment and other things like Naloxone, Vivitrol, and Capral. Plus, better behavioral therapy and understanding of addiction as a chronic, relapsing disease of the entire family, and more help with the biologic, psychologic, housing, financial stressors that come with this disease like we do for a lot of other chronic diseases. We do this for diabetes. We really do, especially inner-city clinics. We just don’t with addiction. That’s all I’m asking is to pair it with these other diseases. 
AS: Cancer, too. There are mothers of addicts that have written about having breast cancer and being so supported and cared for, so much follow through that their addict children never get. 
RL: That’s what I would like to see. A good idea about where to refer one to treatment. An easier, immediate availability of treatment. That is a key piece that we really lack. Even with all the resources we have here in Minneapolis. If I see someone that really needs to go to treatment I cannot get them in. Many studies have shown that that is frankly very tragic because you will never get better results than immediately. Right now when you are ready you need to go directly to treatment. 
AS: The waiting of ten days, two days --
RL: Yeah. Forget it. Even a day is too much. Sometimes even twelve hours is too much. If you have ever watched the show Intervention, which I am not going to comment on, the one thing they do really well is if you say yes, you are on a plane. You don’t get time to pack even. They pack you a bag. You are on that plane and that is the way they do it. That is actually the way to do it. No time to think about it, just do it. I would like to see that. I want to see a primary care doctor that says, This guy needs help right now, like you would if someone was having a heart attack. You would get them a bed at the hospital immediately. You are not going to wait two days on a heart attack. 
There needs to be enough knowledge in the primary care system so that every doctor isn’t like, Oh, you drank too much alcohol? You need a good -- It’s not like everyone with chest pain needs to come to the hospital for cardiac care. There needs to be enough knowledge in the primary care setting to when the one needs to go, but these thousands of others just need to be seen again in a few days when we will talk more about your drinking. 
AS: How far are we from that?
RL: Far. We are not there. Not even close. 
AS: Besides someone like you happening upon this program, are there more people like you?
RL: It is starting. Medical schools -- yes. I am infinitely replaceable. There are lots of people like me. 
AS: Are there people like this across the country?
RL: Absolutely. The American of Board of Medicine has many people like this. Some people way more than I am, even. There are people that are trying to develop whole health care systems like this. My former colleagues at Hazelden, everyone who is really committed to recovery is working on this problem. 
AS: In primary care?
RL: In primary care. Particularly in primary care because they acknowledge that you need that basis. You need to have the same understanding of addiction that they do of heart disease. They need to know enough to know when this person needs help and this person needs something else. 
AS: Right. When to refer you and stuff. 
RL: There is not a ton of availability of people that can train other people. Time is tight and time is precious. What are you going to sub out for addiction care? Then you start getting into political issues. It’s not like medical students sit around not doing stuff for periods of weeks. Everyday is busy in medical school. You have to remove something if you are going to put something in. The issue is what are you going to remove? You’re not going to remove my thing. Everyone thinks their thing is the most important, including me! I’m addiction doctor and I think addiction is the most important. 
If you have a heart disease, you do you need to know. 
AS: Did we make room for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]?
RL: Yes, but I would argue that the training for HIV in medical school is not sufficient. 
AS: Still?
RL: Still. 
AS: What about mental health?
RL: It is definitely not sufficient. I can make the argument that all training in medical school is not sufficient and that is why we do a residency. That is why you aren’t ready to practice once you graduate medical school. 
We need to build a foundation. Is there enough of a foundation in HIV? Probably. Mental health? Probably not. We still have work to do. 
AS: It seems to me there is so much that goes hand in hand with mental health and addiction.
RL: Right. Stigma, too. The thing that we do really well that have foundations are that I have taken all the CPR classes, pulmonary, and renal. That we have down. That we have a good basis in medical school. And that is really important as a doctor. I am not trying to minimize that. If one of those fails you are going to have big problems. You need to know that stuff.
AS: Of course. But you as a doctor are going to encounter people with addiction. Very severe and very mild. All of it. 
RL: Especially once you start looking. Some people will go, Oh, addiction isn’t that common. Then once you start looking and a student comes to a residency and they go, Oh my god, once you start looking for it it’s everywhere. I’m like, Yeah, I know. 
Most of it is this guy who drinks too much and has uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes because he drinks too much. That is the most common form of addiction that we see. Guy or woman. Addiction is blind to sex and race and everything. You can treat the hypertension and diabetes as much as you want but until you treat their addiction you’re not going to make any headway. That is the most common case I see. 
AS: Two last things. What is an ordinary day like? And then kind of an extraordinary day?
RL: It is interesting because I have so many hats as faculty that I use in an ordinary day of practicing addiction medicine. At a normal clinic I will see anywhere from six patients in a half day to twenty patients in a half day. My clinic is integrated so not all of my patients are addiction patients. Even on a twenty person day it is still at most sixteen addiction patients and four will be hypertension and diabetes. Even though I have time set aside I still get general primary care, which is great. I like it that way. 
Most of the preponderance of my patients that I see because of the way the clinic is set up are more severe. They are almost all opioid addicts. Most of the run of the mill alcoholics get treated by my colleagues because it is more straightforward. If they get more severe then I will see them. The ones in liver failure or the ones that are coming out of treatment and have bad neuropathy, I will see them. 
We will have discussions ranging from how their life is falling apart now because they relapsed to how great things are because they are finally sober again and their kids are talking to them again. Little victories and little defeats. People getting better and people getting worse. People requesting medication that is not appropriate. People telling me this other doctor that wanted to give them medication that was inappropriate and they said no and are really proud of it or things like that. There is always some confrontation like, I looked in your urine and it’s in there. They say, No, I didn’t do it. There’s always some of that and some talk about what we are going to do moving forward and what the next step of treatment is. 
Almost every day has some sort of discussion of someone that needs to step up treatment and needs to see me more frequently or they need to go to an even higher level of care, meaning inpatient treatment or more intensive outpatient treatment or something like that. I’ve mentioned that AA isn’t for everyone, and that’s true. I can’t get everyone to go to AA. We then discuss, for lack of a better term, what sort of spiritual recovery are you having? By that I mean what part of your recovery are you not focusing on yourself but you’re focusing on others. How is that integrated into your recovery? If the answer is no I have the whole spiel about, You need that to really have a happy life. If I had stayed focused on myself my entire life, my entire recover, I would have used again I’m pretty sure. 
I have had some really bad things happen to me when I was in recovery. It is by pulling upon my resources of friends and family that really helps me through that. And by getting out of myself. Going and doing stuff that is not for me. Even when I am in a lot of turmoil it is important. 
That’s a pretty typical day. 
AS: And an extraordinary day? Whether that is good or bad.
RL: Addiction does make chaos. Even in an ordinary day there is a fair amount of chaos in it. I have patients show up hours early, hours late. I have double bookings, and then I have patients showing up twelve at a time within twenty minutes. I have to scramble. People in early recovery --
AS: But you work with them and you’re flexible?
RL: Oh, yeah. There are some patients that I set boundaries with. I am not going to say it for everybody, but yeah, for the vast majority of patients I will work with them. They are here to see me and I will see if it is physically possible, and it is for the vast majority. It can be stressful. 
What makes an extraordinary day for me is a therapeutic breakthrough or a therapeutic collapse. The thing that makes an extraordinary day is when I have a patient of mine that has not been doing well and we have a really difficult conversation where I say, I think you need to go to inpatient treatment. Then they say, What about my kids? I say, You are going to lose them. I am going to have to report you to CPS [child protective services] or I already have reported you to CPS. You have to go. 
When they come back from treatment and they are sober, which happens, the change in them is remarkable and will make my entire week or month. It is wonderful to see. Sometimes I don’t recognize them. Patients that cursed me and told me how much they hated me. They curse at me and yell at me and tell me some very, very hurtful things. [laughs] Seriously! 
I just had this one patient three months ago tell me I was a terrible doctor and that she hates me and she can’t imagine that all my patients don’t hate me and she can’t imagine any reason why anyone doesn’t hate me. The only reason anyone is nice to me is because they are afraid of me. It was actually really hurtful and I had to destress and debrief with another colleague afterwards. It really hurt especially because I had treated her for a while and she was not doing well. 
She came back to see me just a couple of days ago and she told me she needed to talk to me. I asked her why and she said it was because her case with CPS was ending and they were going to stop monitoring her. She was taking narcotics from a pain clinic and I told her it was a bad idea for her. They were monitoring her usage and she said, I know that as soon as they stopped monitoring me I was going to relapse, you were right. There is no way I’m going to stay sober. She asked me to help her not do that. The amount of courage it took her to do that really moved me. 
AS: To come back to you.
RL: She never actually apologized, but coming back she didn’t have to apologize. 
AS: The act of it. 
RL: It was really an extraordinary day. 
AS: And you understand how remarkable that is, really, only because you have been in her shoes. Would you say that is true?
RL: I think you can develop that working with addicts long enough. I would not say you need a personal experience. Maybe it is easier if you have had one. I am not one of those doctors that thinks that. I think you can just have someone who is intellectually curious about addiction, as good of an addiction doctor as me. Without any personal or family history with the stuff. You could still understand. But yes, it helps. 
AS: It helps. The other thing I was thinking about was what if a doctor didn’t have an understanding of a patient’s addiction and they went off on them like that, they might be barred from coming back to the clinic or something.
RL: They would certainly be hesitant to see that patient again. They probably couldn’t see me again. 
AS: Once you start to understand addiction and what people will say and do in the throws of it you can treat them differently and by treat, I mean both ways. 
RL: Yes, you can.
AS: That goes back to what we were talking about about integrating it into primary care because you can lose so many people who need help with addiction and primary care if you don’t know how to deal with their responses. 
RL: Yeah. The other thing is I have had patients that literally have threatened to stab me if I didn’t give them a drug. I have zero tolerance for that. They will be disbarred from the clinic and they cannot come back. There is one patient in particular who straight out showed me a knife and said, I’m going to stab you if you don’t give me benzos. I told him I would go get the prescription pad right away and so security came and escorted him out. That has happened. He was barred from coming back to the clinic. I’m sure he didn’t do well. I was prescribing him suboxone and he called and said he needed his suboxone. I said, Not from me you don’t. You threatened to stab me. I’m sorry, but you can’t come back here. 
AS: Unbelievable. 
RL: I don’t know what happened to him. That kind of stuff does happen. It has happened once since 2009. That’s a remarkable day. 
AS: Is there anything else that you want to say?
RL: A lot of people have this misconception that addiction is exhausting and people must burn out. Most people have this impression that in addiction medicine everyone knows the nature of their disease. ER doctors that I have a tremendous amount of respect for look at me like I am crazy for doing this because every single addiction patient they see is in the ER. They aren’t in recovery.
Take me for example. I am a perfect example. I was working here at North and I am still klutzy. That has not gotten better with my recovery. I tripped and fell down the stairs and I very badly sprained one of my toes. I hobbled myself into the ER and said I needed an x-ray because I couldn’t walk. I got an x-ray and the whole visit was an hour. They told me to take Ibuprofen and go back to work. They gave me a little walking shoe to walk in that helped the pain a lot. 
That ER doctor had no idea -- even though I know it is in my chart -- that I was an addict. He had no idea. None. I did not appear to be an addict. I did not request narcotics and I would have turned them down if he had offered them to me. There is nothing about that visit. I was in scrubs for christ’s sake. There was nothing about that visit that made it look like I was an addict. In his mind I wasn’t an addict. 
Then the person coming in demanding drugs for vague symptoms and screams at you and calls you all sorts of names, because they are in the throws of craving or in withdrawal or they are desperate, that is every addict for him. His denominator for every addict is all those people that bother him. But I am not in that denominator because in his mind I’m not an addict. 
That is a part of the problem with addiction. Once you recover from it no one knows unless you tell them. That is part of the reason I tell people. Because you would never know. I am a bigger person and so you might know that I struggle with some eating issues, and I do, but you would never know that I was an IV drug addict by looking at me. Because I used pharmaceutical grade fentanyl I don’t actually have track marks. I have a scar, but it is very hard to see. 
AS: You’re point is that addiction medicine isn’t as terrible as some people think.
RL: Patients do not do that because by the time they come to see us they know that they have a problem and they are there to work with us to get better. They are not the patients in the ER screaming for meds. They are not that pain patient that every doctor hates to see.
By the way, on that note, that pain patient that you hate to see, you hate to see because he or she has an addiction problem. If you confront it then you have one painful visit and you can help them get over it. If you don’t help confront them, every time you see them it is a painful visit. Just get it over with, confront them, or discuss it with them. Just get it on the table and then it is done. That is the crux of recovery in a lot of ways. Just talk about it. Once it is out in the open they can yell at you and scream at you. It can be a tough visit. I do this a lot and my heartrate still goes up when I go into the room. Then we get to move on.
That’s all I’ve got. 
AS: Thank you, that was really generous."

Amy Sullivan-AS
LL: This is Lori Lewis and I give Amy permission to record this.
AS: Thank you. Could we start off by talking about your own childhood? Where were you born? What was your family life like? Where did you go to school?
LL: I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. I had a great childhood. We had a lot of fun. My dad is an alcoholic. I am the oldest of five. I was raised in an alcoholic situation. I think I was nine or ten when they separated. We didn’t lack anything as far as love—my mom was always there for us, always providing what she could with what she had. From what I remember I was always loved and it was fun and even though I was the oldest of five and had a lot of responsibilities after my dad moved out. I can honestly say I had a good childhood. 
Went to school in White Bear, graduated in 1983 from Mariner the last year before they split schools. Anyways, great area to grow up in. We had fourteen kids we were always playing kick the can or something. Really fun. It was good outside of—I saw a lot of things that in an alcoholic family that you probably shouldn’t. You know, it helped develop me who I am as a person now. 
AS: Was your mother a single mom for very long?
LL: She got remarried when I was probably twenty I think, which unfortunately was to another alcoholic. That marriage did not last very long. Maybe a couple of years. Then she swore she would never get married again and she hasn’t. She is just this wonderful lady. Positive attitude. Very, very strong, but I think that’s where I get my optimism from and my positive attitude. I try and look for the good in things because I could very easily spiral down.
AS: She provided that example for you?
LL: Yes. She’s seventy-four going strong. Doing good. Independent in her own home. 
AS: After high school what did you do?
LL: After high school I tried college a couple times and wasn’t ready. [laughs] I wound up just working. I worked in a couple of different restaurants bartending and waitressing. Honestly, I made so much money back then. My mom kept saying you got to go to college! 
AS: Why?
LL: I know! So that’s what I did for a while and went out and had fun with my friends. We did the bar scene back then, too. Just had fun. I was working at a bar called Hog’s Breath up on Rice Street, do you know where that is? It was packed every Saturday and anyway that’s where I met my husband. But, it wasn’t until I had my second child that I really took a look at my life and said, “Okay, I have two young children here. What am I going to do?” He was bartending too and doing construction. I started going to school for nursing. 
AS: Had that been something you had thought of doing?
LL: It is interesting because no, I had no idea I would be interested in the healthcare field. After I had Ryan—would work different shifts. I just wanted to be home. I love being a mom. I just wanted to be home with my kids. I didn’t want to miss anything. I opened up a home daycare. I did that until Ryan was in first grade, Jenna was in kindergarten. 
While I was doing home daycare was when I went through school. I would get up before the kids would come in the morning. I would study. I would study during their naptime, and I would study at night. I would lock myself downstairs and tell Keith, “You have to watch the kids.” I was very driven and I wanted to get A’s and do my very best. 
AS: When did you go to classes?
LL: I went in the evenings and he was home with the kids. It was very tough because I went part-time until I went to St. Kate’s and was in the nursing program. You have to go full-time evenings. I think just being with the kids—there are always sick kids, and nurturing them, and figuring out what they had. That led me to nursing. 
AS: Are you currently working as a nurse? What is your specialty?
LL: I started out, once I graduated back then, you could only work in nursing homes. I started in a nursing home but quickly moved to—they call it a sub acute unit. Patients from the hospital not quite ready to go home. I think now they call it transitional care. I just loved that. I remember one guy with an open chest wound, that’s why he was there because his wound wouldn’t heal. He had open heart surgery. It was open and we had to clean it with triple antibiotics and pack it and I just loved it. There are some people who just couldn’t do it. I knew I wanted to go into med surge. I quickly transitioned and went to Hudson Hospital at that time and worked on the med surg unit.
AS: And that means surgery?
LL: Yeah, post surgery. Anything really can come into a med surg unit. That hospital was really small so they cross trained you in every area. I wound up working in the emergency room, which was funny because I ended up working with an ER doctor that I went to school with. I remember looking at each other and I’m like, “Are you Butch?” And he’s like, “Are you Lori?” It was really funny. From there I went to Regions Hospital because I was really interested in working in a bigger hospital. Started working in the ER there. That was after I had had my third child. Worked in the urgent care for our clinics and then the hospital and I was working like the 5:00 pm to 1:00 pm shift. Then transitioned to OB, which I worked up until three years ago. Because I had a back surgery so I can’t go back to nursing. I could, but not on the floor. Which really bums me out because I love patient care. 
AS: What do you do now?
LL: I work at the ISNT department with computer programs for, I don’t know if you have heard of EPIC, but it’s electronic healthcare. Everything is electronic. And anaesthesia for the surgery. It is still really fun and allows me to apply my nursing because they need nurses and physicians—all kinds of people to take the clinical piece and bridge a gap between technical people who are just focused on computers. It is nice because it gives me another avenue to apply my skills and still have that connection with healthcare. I would love to go back to nursing. I miss OB nursing. 
AS: But you hurt your back on the job?
LL: No, they don’t know what I did. I mean one of my kids was eleven pounds twelve ounces.
AS: But nursing is pretty physically—
LL: Yeah. I’ve ended up having another surgery since then. I have had two within the last four years. They said you probably shouldn’t go back. Some of these women who have c-sections and they are three hundred pounds and you have to lift them and help them. But, you know what, I love my job that I’m doing and someday—even if it is phone triage—I love the education piece of the nursing, and that is why I loved OB I think. 
AS: So much talking to patients.
LL: And new moms, yeah. 
AS: And new babies. 
LL: Oh yeah! And who doesn’t love that?
AS: So, talk about your children and how you approached mothering. You were clearly very busy. You talked about the daycare part. But, as they got older, what kind of a mother were you?
LL: Well we were—I say ‘we’ as in me and my husband—we were very invovled with our kids. That was our focus. I come from a family of five and I wanted to have a big family because I just loved it. It was so much fun and that’s what I wanted my kids to experience. That was our focus. If someone wanted us to go out to dinner or do something, which was it good or bad? Probably not—we needed our time alone, too, but if there was something going on with the kids we did that. Whether it was sports or swimming or Girl Scouts, whatever. Plus, it was fun. I’m a really outgoing person and I like to sit with the other moms and chat. You know? So, it was, that was our time too.
AS: Being with other parents?
LL: Yeah, yeah. So, we always were very involved with them. Always very honest with the kids. Very open. There were some times when you are too open: “Quit being a nurse.” We would talk openly—
AS: Yeah give me an example.
LL: Ryan and Jenna are a year apart. Ryan and Jenna were in the kitchen and we were making something to eat and Ryan’s friend Zach who lived right up the street was sitting here. We had started talking about, oh, in class they were learning about health and sex education and they were in high school and talking about diseases and all this stuff. I said, “That’s very important. You need to wear condoms. You want to make sure you are ready. You don’t know what is going to happen in the heat of the moment,” and Zach is beet red. Just beet red. Tall and skinny and curly, curly hair and he is laughing hysterically. I’m like, “What is so funny? Do you guys not talk about this at your house?” He is like, “No, that is why I love being over here!”
So, we were always open and we still are. We always told the kids, “Don’t worry about the consequences about something. If you are somewhere and you are drinking and you don’t feel safe—I don’t care if you are in Duluth, I don’t care—we will get you a ride home. Always reach out to us.” But kids, they don’t. And we always told them there will be consequences based on what the action was and the outcome, but know that you can always call us and we will be there for you. 
But even as the kids got older—the kids when they were younger, Ryan was just going on nine and I had Wilson our last son. For years there were—it was funny because when I told the kids we were pregnant again Ryan said, “Oh, that’s it. I’m never getting to Disneyland.” So, when Wilson was a year and a half and Ryan was nine and a half we took all the kids. When they were younger we did so much as a family. When they got older into junior high and then high school that’s where you could see the definite separation between the older two and the younger two. 
AS: You have four children?
LL: Four, yeah. Jenna is my only daughter. She is twenty-four. Cal is twenty. Wilson, our youngest, is sixteen. Ryan would have been twenty-five. You could definitely see the separation. Then it was harder because they are teenagers and they wanted to go off with their friends. The younger two, we were still all involved in sports and clubs and groups. You know what? I was the mom, too, who I always knew—I thought I knew—where my kids were. What they were doing. Who they were with. I was always the parent that as they got older I would call and find out, talk to the parent where they were going if they were invited to a party or a pool party or whatever. “Who is going to be there? How many chaperones?” All of Ryan’s friends knew, his friend’s moms would call me because they knew I would do it. Even Wilson now, he’s like, “Mom, you do not have to do this!” I’m like “Wilson, I will do this up until you are eighteen! I want to know where you are!” 
I’m probably a little bit overprotective. Controlling, yeah, which I have learned I have no control over anything. Except for what I eat and what I wear. [laughs] We just were involved with our kids. 
AS: That’s good. Can you talk about when you started being aware that your son Ryan started having problems? How did that appear and when? Did your daughter have any troubles? Was it with the two of them being so close?
LL: Ryan was in his junior year at Tartan. Jenna was a sophomore. We suspected he was smoking pot, but we never had any proof or anything. One night I came home from work and I was nursing so I was working the evening shift. It was like midnight and I heard something downstairs, so I thought, “Oh I’m just going to go check.” He was smoking pot downstairs. That told me if he is comfortable enough doing it in the house, he has been smoking for a while. At that point I went and got my husband up and we dealt with everything. I wasn’t naive enough to think that was it and he was going to stop. 
After the third time of him getting caught downstairs we got him into an outpatient treatment at New Connections in St. Paul. It was a thirty-day treatment where he actually went to school there, too. It was all day long. After the thirty days he went back to school and finished out his year as a junior. The whole senior year was really uneventful. 
At that time Jenna wasn’t doing anything. In fact, Jenna was dating this big jock in high school. She was a volleyball player. They would go to parties and they would come home and I’m like, “You guys just left an hour ago.” “Well, there was drinking there so we left.” And I was like “Good job.” Anyways, it was really uneventful. He was about twenty when he moved out with his girlfriend Camille. Yeah, I think he was twenty. Anyways, everything was fine.
AS: Did he go to college?
LL: He tried college a couple of times. Actually, just wound up stopping going, which frustrated me. If you didn’t want to go you should have just come and told us. Now we are $4,000 now are considered F’s because you didn’t go. We did some kind of petition thing because he was really depressed at that time, too. All this was happening at the same time. We got him on antidepressants, which he refused to take. He didn’t like putting pills in his body, which is interesting in the way things panned out. 
He went back, tried again, and just didn’t like it. He actually job hopped from then on quite a bit. He, though, is very talented. He taught himself how to play the drums, the guitar, the keyboards. He did photography, painting, drawing. That was when he was the most content. That is what he wanted to go to school for. We said, “Well, let’s try that.” And he just never went back. When he was living with his girlfriend we suspected that there was some pot smoking and possibly other stuff. We confronted him and he’s like, “You know, don’t worry about it. I’m on my own.” 
We never really thought anything. No legal troubles, he’s working. Then we started to see it decline in his girlfriend. He would ask us for money for rent because he couldn’t hold a job. In hindsight now, looking back, you can see the progression. One day she called me up and she just said, “You know I just got off the phone with Ryan. He’s at the apartment. I’m really worried about him. He’s saying that nothing matters anymore. He doesn’t want to live.” 
So I call him up and he sounded really bad. I must have been off that day. I don’t even remember. I went over to his apartment and noticed that he had some cuts. To me, that was just a cry for help. Whether he was really trying. We are not going to ignore this. I convinced him to go into Regions ER. It was during that visit that they found benzos in his system and narcotics. 
We would find out that he took from me after my back surgery.
AS: So pain meds
LL: Pain meds. So, Oxycontin. No, oxycodone. I went to look for him and sure enough they are gone, and I don’t know how many were in there. I had it after back surgery and only needed so much andn I didn’t lock them up. I didn’t think we had to. So, whether he had been using them before and realized I had some or realized that’s what started it. I don’t know. He went back home because that was at the end of November, and I think it was the end of December, January, he was like, “You know what? Things are very stressful. I haven’t found a steady job.”
AS: This must be right around the crash in 2009? 2008?
LL: Nope, this would have been—because he graduated in 2009—must have been around 2012. So, he was fine for a long time after that. After he graduated from high school. Went on a long time. A couple years. But, so anyways, he said, “Can Camille and I and the dog,” which is a 120 pound sheep dog, “move in until we can get caught up on stuff?” I said, “Sure, as long as you are doing it for the right reasons. You will get a job.” And, his girlfriend, I always loved her. She comes over every once in a while. And the dog, everybody loved the dog.
At the end of that time—they moved out in the end of January—I noticed that you couldn’t even have a conversation with Ryan. He was so, he was moody since he has been out of the womb. That’s just the type of kid he is. But really, really moody with John. Lost a lot of weight, looked pale, was sick a lot. I never expected, you know—we question, are you using anything? Never thinking heroin, but you know, are you using narcotics again, or what is going on here? So this went on for a while.
AS: What would he say?
LL: No, don’t bother me about it. He would get really irritated. He would leave. So, he would get sick of it and he’s like, “I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to move out.” He moves out with his buddies. We don’t want—we want to make sure. “I know you are in a bind, too,” and I said, “You’re welcome to stay here until you can find a place.” 
So, we loved her. She was just a really good gal. But, so shortly after that, he had brought laundry over for me. We dropped him off and some of his buddies picked him up and I thought I would do the laundry, and that’s when I found the needle. I was like, “What the hell was going on?”
So, I call Camille and she’s like, “You know what, I can’t get a hold of him either,” because she was trying to get to him through a friend of his. Through that phone call they suspected he had been using as well, which I found out from him later as well. They actually knew he was using. And you know what? They didn’t know what to do. They are twenty-two. They flat out said, “We’re coming up with a plan. There were three of us that were going to take him against his will and take him up to Duluth for a week.” 
AS: They were going to deal with it on their own?
LL: Their brains aren’t developed. They don’t know. One of his friends really had a hard time, Brent. He has been over here a couple times. The more he comes over the more he divulges. He feels tremendous guilt, and I understand. Two of his other friends were just over here two weekends ago and they sat here for four hours talking. These are twenty-four year old men that wanted to talk to, you know, it was so much fun. Tears and stuff, too. I think it’s good for them to talk, too because it helps them work through their guilt. 
At that point, when we found the needle—I don’t remember all the details because you are just in crisis mode. We took him into the ER. We took him into St. John’s at that time. I know he had to be going through withdrawls at that time. He was still actively using. An ER doctor was going to discharge him. I went to go to the bathroom and told the ER doc, “How can you discharge him? He’s going through withdrawls. You did testing. You know he is using something. You can’t detect heroin. It comes up as a narcotic. If you discharge my son here, he will probably die and I will hold you responsible. I don’t care what you have to do.” They went in and talked to Ryan and put him on a seventy-two hour hold. I had left because he was so irate and upset. I figured the best thing to do was just leave for a while. I get a call from my husband. They are discharging him, and I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it. 
I wound up going there before they discharged him. We came up with a plan, talked to a social worker. The social worker, after talking to him, she said, “He needs inpatient treatment.” I’m like, “Yeah, and the ER doctor was going to discharge him.” They tried to look for a bed. As you probably know there is nothing. I think Hibbing was the closest one, and we couldn’t get him in for three weeks. We took him home, helped him go through withdrawls. Watched him the whole weekend. Then they called up and said, “We can get him in. We have an opening in outpatient treatment at St. John’s. Would you like to do that?” Well, “Sure,” while we continued to look for a bed. Well after about two weeks, we wound up getting a call. He was going to outpatient treatment. He seemed to be doing okay, very emotional though, crying a lot, which I thought, “Okay, he is working through things,” but he was still using. So, he wound up in the ER so sick from withdrawals. So, they said we need to kick him out of teatment because he has been using.
AS: He was using erratically enough that he would go into withdrawls, then use again. 
LL: Yes. When all that stuff happened when we found out he was using it around June. It must have been 2013 now, yeah. Again, there are no beds open anywhere. So, we wind up going to, what is it up the road here? I can’t remember what it is called. Canvas Health. So, he’s in an intense inpatient treatment in the evenings so he can continue to work his day job, which he did have a really good job at Target. And AA meetings. 
So, that went okay for a while. Then, in October he relapsed. Not relapsed, he was continuing his using. At that point I called up St. John’s again and I said, “This is ridiculous. We need to find a bed for my son. I don’t care what I have to do.” I sat at this counter and called every ficken inpatient facility. I mean even outside of Minnesota. Trying to find, and there are no beds. 
So, anyways I was just frustrated. I wound up getting ahold—at this point I didn’t even care if our insurance covered it. I wound up getting a hold of Hazelden. They actually had somebody leaving and they did have a bed. They didn’t have anybody on the waiting list, which I found was odd. It is me sitting here. Everything happens on a Friday where you are like, “I need to get through the weekend with my son.” You are so anxious as a parent. They did a phone interview with him. Did a phone interview with me. We got him in on Monday for a chem dep [chemical dependency assessment] because nobody would take anybody without a chem dep assessment. Trying to find someone to do a chem dep. Quite frankly, HeathPartners, we have good insurance. I know the ins and outs, and still it was a battle. 
AS: You still struggled even though you work in health care and you know who to call.
LL: I knew who to call. I knew the back door numbers. Like you say, you are in crisis. I feel so bad for parents who don’t have the resources or the knowledge because I felt like I was on my own trying to deal with this. 
Anyways, we wound up getting him into Hazelden. By this time it is like mid-October. He was in, of course, only twenty-one days. Quite frankly at that time I didn’t understand heroin. I didn’t understand the disease of addiction. I didn’t realize how severe this was. I wish to God somebody would have said to me honestly, all these counselors—and he’s at Hazelde! The best place. One of the best places. I wish they would have said, “If your son does not find recovery it’s not a matter of if he’ll die, it is when.” That’s harsh, but—and quite frankly it’s all in hindsight. Would I have been more frantic and anxious? I don’t know back then—
AS: If someone had said that to you?
LL: I don’t feel like we were given enough resources. I was Googling stuff.
AS: Did you go to the parent program at Hazelden?
LL: We did. We went to the parents and siblings. It was a four day—I asked all the kids to go. Jenna was furious at the time. She didn’t want to go. I didn’t find out until later, the first day she didn’t go. Then I just begged her to go. She said, “Do you know why I don’t want to go?” I said, “Of course not.” She said, “He had dealers calling my phone to get through to him. I have had enough, Mom.” She was upset with him, too. I said, “You know what, Jenna? This is a reason you have to go.” We all went, and it was very beneficial. We all learned a lot during that four day time. Just even talking to other parents. It was very good. 
But I remember sitting down, too, in that group where we had to introduce ourselves and I couldn't even speak. It was just a flood. I was crying so hard I was heaving. But I wasn’t the only one. It was very good. It was beneficial for the kids, but looking back now they were just so angry at Ryan because of what the disease was putting everyone through. Our focus was on Ryan for a year and a half. This is the time where Jenna was out looking for places to live. We should have been giving her some of our time. Cal was graduating from high school. We should have been looking at colleges. Wilson wanted to go to Creighton, a different high school because he hated Tartan. It was unfair to them, too. They didn’t have any of our time or attention. If they did we were so stressed out. We couldn’t focus.
He was there for twenty-eight days. Then they discharged him to home. During this time we went up to visit him, too.
AS: Was he at Plymouth?
LL: He was at Plymouth the first time, yes. They thought at his age he would be better with teens and young adults. You could tell every time you went back to see him he looked healthier. His sense of humor was back. He was laughing. He was interacting with us. He was having fun. He gained twenty-five pounds I think when he was there. Twenty-five pounds in a month. He just looked really good. 
He was discharged. It must have been early October when he went in and it was early November now. Within three days I noticed again what was going on. Confronted him about it. 
AS: Is he at home or in an apartment?
LL: He’s at home. Later, we would find out that he used the same night he came home. He had it stashed somewhere in the house. We called up. He went back into Hazelden for a two-week time frame. This time he went to Center City. We got discharged from there and—
AS: Were they offering any medication-assisted treatment?
LL: At that time they had put it on the one that starts with a B—
AS: Buprenorphine?
LL: Yes. He was on that while he was there. He was discharged with Vivitrol. They gave him the Vivitral shot before he left there. We were responsible for finding a place. He did go to IOP, intensive outpatient program, but because he wasn’t going consistantly, he ended up getting kicked out of there, too. They give me the Vivitrol. They are like, “You are a nurse. You can administer it.” I asked the counselor, and I said, “Do you know anything about Vivitrol? If I give this to my son while he is actively using he could overdose and die.” I’m like, “You have to do a urine test first. I don’t have a urine test at my home.” Again, here I am in crisis mode. 
AS: So now they are using you.
LL: It’s on me. Yes. It is ridiculous. I called up our clinic in Woodbury. He went in with the Vivitrol. They sent him back home. He was super pissed off: “They can’t do Vivitrol there they don’t even know what it is.” So, I called up a nurse there who wound up being very helpful. I used to work up there at that clinic. She said, “Let me know what I can do to help.” I’m just balling. I don’t know what to do and I don’t have any resources. It’s ridiculous. She wound up getting us a number for Valhalla Place in Woodbury. Ryan did go there. They did the urine test. He must not have had anything in his system because they gave him the injection. He was going there for a while. 
AS: For outpaitent?
LL: No, just to get his Vivitrol shots.
AS: Once a month?
LL: Yes. He was doing good again for a while. Again, we are talking five or six weeks because then it was January 3rd or 4th. I was at work and got a call from my daughter. She said, “My car won’t start.” I said, “Is Ryan home?” She said, “Yeah, he must be. The Jeep is here.” I said, “Go downstairs and see if he can give you a ride.” Within minutes and she was calling me, frantic, and had 911 on the other line. He was blue and his eyes were bugging and his tongue was sticking out and she was terrified. I just said, “Hang up with me. I am on my way home. Stay with 911. I will call Eileen,” she’s our next door neighbor. She’s a nurse. She came over and the paramedics were here within minutes. I met them at Regions.
AS: Did they have naloxone?
LL: I do not believe he was given naloxone. By the time we got to the ER he was on the monitors and everything and I had to constantly remind him to breath because his respirations would go down to ten… six. The alarm is going off, beeping, and no one is coming in. So I know how to work the freaking alarm so I’m silencing it. Finally, I go out and I’m like, “Do you know his alarm is going off constantly because his respirations are six? I have been silencing the alarm.” She said, “Don’t do that.” I said, “Well no one is coming in.” Just the whole experience. 
We wound up leaving him there that night on the advice of doctors and counselors. They said, “You guys are enabling him,” which is hard for a parent to hear. But it was true. They are like, “Leave him here. This is probably not the first time he has overdosed. He needs to figure this out and you need to leave him here. He needs to figure out his own ride home.” My husband and I left. That was when we were in January when it was twenty below. It was terrible. 
AS: Who told you to leave him?
LL: The ER providers. Not a counselor. An ER provider and the nurse. This nurse was wonderful. We had been in the ER before. They find out it's addiction and they treat you like crap. I don’t care. This one was really was empathetic. She was just like, “I’m sorry. We see this a lot. The best thing you can do right now is leave him here.” It was heartfelt. Monty and I came home and he showed up when he got discharged. I found out when his friends came over two weeks ago. That it was Mike was the one that gave him a ride home. I had no idea.
AS: Because it was so cold? They dropped him here?
LL: Yes. I had packed a suitcase and left it by the door. He thought he was going to stay here. I said, “Ryan, you can’t. I have everything in this suitcase. I don’t know where you are going to go.” Monty and I were up all night. We were sick to our stomach. It was frigid. People die in that! He wound up staying with a friend that lived over there and after two days he called and said, “Can I please come home?” I said, “Under the conditions that you go back into treatment.” And he did at Hazelden. 
Here is the other thing, too. I didn’t know that we had other options at the time. You are in crisis mode and you go to whoever has a bed open. I don’t feel Hazelden was the right place for him. One reason was because they follow the twelve-step, but they are very faith-based. We’re spiritual, Ryan was spiritual but—we went to church when the kids were little, but cramming that down his throat. But I didn’t know. I just didn’t know. He got discharged from that one. I said to the counselors, “I don’t know where he should go. I feel like he is using at home. He shouldn’t be coming home.” My husband and I were not on the same page through this whole thing.
AS: You were not?
LL: No. He didn’t want him to go to inpatient treatment. He thought Ryan and him could do it through AA meetings. 
AS: That he would go with him to AA meetings?
LL: No, that Ryan would go. But I started going to Al-Anon after the first time Ryan was in. The first four or five meetings, I would go for Ryan. Then at the sixth meeting I was like, “Oh my god I’m here for me.” I learned a lot about myself. A lot of good skills to use on Ryan. 
In fact, Ryan had said one time, we were in the kitchen, you know how they tell you to talk about the: “I feel, I think, I need.” I started doing that with him. He knew exactly what I was doing because that’s what they learn. He said, “I don’t like how you have been changing.” I would not argue with him. I would give him a reason, which is really hard. You have to practice this. 
AS: It is very hard.
LL: I tried to get my husband to go. I said, “The skills I’m learning are working on him. I’m not going around and around in these argumentative circles like you are.”
AS: Your husband and Ryan were arguing, but you were working to pull yourself out of it?
LL: Yes. It was just funny though because we both stood there and laughed, Ryan and I, when he said that to me. I knew it was working and I needed to keep going. We would go on Saturdays. He would go to AA and I would go to Al-Anon. 
End of January until around May—he was sober for a long stretch of time. Him and his girlfriend had come back together. He said, “I want to make dinner for someone tonight.” And I said, “Oh, okay.” Because she cut all ties, even with us. She changed her phone number. She wanted to have nothing to do with it. I give her credit. She needs to be strong. I said, “Okay.” And he said, “I don’t have any money.” I’m like, “Oh, shit.” I go, “I’m not going to give you cash but here’s where my credit card is. You can take it and go to the store, but I need a receipt.” He did. He went, and here I walk in and it’s Camille. My heart was just—I was so happy. They got back together during this time. He was really trying. He loved her so much. I kept telling him I said, “I know you do but you need to do this for yourself. I am worried that you are back in a relationship and with her. Not that we don’t love her, but because you’ve got a relationship with her and you know her you could get right back there faster. You know what I mean?
AS: You mean get back to drugs?
LL: Using. Yes. Because she just loved him, too. I can’t believe she did not see what was going on.
AS: She didn’t see what was going on?
LL: No. I found out later again that yeah, they would have friends over, they would smoke pot, they would take pills. Ryan wound up getting way out of hand. She didn’t tell me. It was around May I think that we started noticing again. We had sat Ryan down after they got back together and I was like, “Here is the deal. Here are all our concerns. If Camille suspects anything she will confront you. She will tell me. I will confront you. We want to support you in your recovery.” He was all for it and everything, but it was around the middle of May that we suspected he was using again. I found out later that his friends, I don’t know what friends, dropped him off in the ER. Outside of Regions Hospital because he had overdosed. 
AS: Put his body out?
LL: I don’t know the details. Left him there. The reason I found out was because I got an ambulance bill because even at Regions the ER cannot go outside of the building and pick up the patient. You have to call 911, which I have been in that situation before. Where there is a guy outside Regions having a heart attack and we had to call 911. Something about legal—that was May 15th. 
We had suspected again so got him back into Hazelden again in June. This time there was a big change in him. He did not want to be there. He was not getting anything out of treatment. He was so depressed. It was terrible going up there. He was angry. It was over Fourth of July weekend that Camille and I went up there to see him. I talked to his counselor and said, “He’s different. What is the plan for him?” He’s like, “He’s got to want to do this for himself.” I’m like, “I’m sick of hearing this. I’m telling you my son is going to die. You’re telling me that my son needs rock bottom.” I was “Like rock bottom is death.” I couldn’t. 
As a parent that is the one time I did lose all hope. I was hopeless. I was sick to my stomach. He was mad at me. We got into an argument. I started crying. I left. Finally he came with Camille and I was crying and I just told him, “Ryan, this is hard for me, too. I am sick to my stomach. I am worried. I am scared to death of you.” He even said too, “I am sorry. I am too. I am scared too. They are weaning me off of Suboxone.” He was going to go to a sober house because we told him for sure he couldn’t come here. 
AS: He couldn’t go to a sober house on Suboxone?
LL: Yeah. Because of that we are trying to sneak around and find a doctor that gives Suboxone and I said, “Ryan they will test you positive for Suboxone and kick you out of the sober house.” It is maddening. That is a risk we were willing to take until we had time to find somewhere else. Monty went and picked him up on Monday when he was discharged from Hazelden. He brought him over to the sober house. He was so pissed off at us, he didn’t want to talk or anything. Monty went to help move him in. That was just how Ryan was. He would get really pissed about something and after a day or two he would come back and talk rationally about stuff. That’s just the way he was, so we didn’t bug him and Tuesday night he did call me. We talked through things and he was like, “Will you bring me my blanket and pillow and some differnt things from home?” His favorite licorice. “I will come over after work,” because I was working in St. Paul then and the sober house was very close. 
I went and picked him up and we went grocery shopping and talked about things. He pointed out over there in St. Paul, I don’t know if you know where it is, it is an old brewery they were converting into artist’s studios. We would talk about the future and he did seem a little bit agitated. I asked him if it had something to do with his girlfriend. She was in Wisconsin Dells with some friend and it was the first vacation she had ever taken in her life. He was jealous because there were guys there, too. I know. I’m like, “She needs to go have fun, too. She is working through this. She is sticking by you. She loves you. You have to understand that. You have to let go. She needs to have fun.”
We went back, dropped them off. He took his stuff. I just remember, this is just hilarious, I just gave her a super huge hug and he just looked so good. I tell him I loved him and how good he looked and he was like, “Shh, the windows are open the guys will hear you!” I was like, “I don’t care!” I pulled away and part of me wanted to just take him out for dinner or something. I knew he was agitated. I know Ryan, and he just needed time. I called him up and I’m like, “Oh, I left the licorice in the car,” and he was like, “Oh, I’ll get it tomorrow,” and I was like, “I’ll stop by after work tomorrow.” 
That Thursday I had a lunch in Mears Park with two of my colleagues and we were walking back and I got a phone call from a St. Paul police officer. He said, “Can I come to your work?” And I’m like, “Why?” All this stuff going through my head. He said, “Well, your son Ryan overdosed.” I said, “Okay, he has overdosed before. Where is he? What does this mean?” He said, “Can we just come to your work and talk?” I said, “Okay if this has anything to do with my husband or kids you have to tell me right now.” That’s when he told me.
AS: He did tell you on the phone?
LL: Yes, they actually came to Mears Park and met me and drove me to my car. Part of me so still—July 10th it will be two years. I am angry at Hazelden for discharging him to a sober house where 1) they won’t let them have medication, and 2) the sober house was going through a transition of house leaders. Yeah, which did worry me. They told me at that sober house, we talked to the guy, the lead that was leaving, and for an hour on the phone. Every kind of detail he could think of. He had told me that during the week the guys have to be out of the house from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. They need to be looking for jobs. Whatever. Which I thought, “That’s weird. How do you hold them accountable? Are you doing drug tests when they get back?”
AS: He overdosed at the house?
LL: He overdosed at the house on Thursday at 11:30 am they figure. My questions is—
AS: He was alone?
LL: His roommate who had also been in Hazelden—Ryan was breathing really heavy at around 10:30 am. He was probably in the process of dying at that point. He was snoring and so he left to go out in the commons area because Ryan was so loud. When he came back up around 11:30 am that’s where he noticed Ryan wasn’t breathing and called 911. 
Again, why weren’t they checked on? Him and his roommate, they were supposed to be out of the house. Why weren’t they? I’m just pisssed because if anyone would have checked on him they would have been able to arouse him at 8:00 am when he was supposed to be out of the house. And the stupid roommate. Why didn’t he try to arouse him? 
AS: Had he used heroin?
LL: Yes. Someone in the house had given him $20, which they are not supposed to do. He had a bus pass. We had gotten him a bus pass. So what they think was he took the bus, made the connection, came back to the house, and used. It shows that the heroin addiction was way bigger than he was. He did want to get sober. He even said to Monty one night, “Dad, am I ever going to get better?” When I would talk to him, too, I was like, “Please help me understand. Help me help you because I don’t understand.” He just said, “Mom, it’s not just the physical craving when I’m in withdrawals. It is psychological. That is all I can think about.” I said—he was so worried when they were weaning him off of Suboxone. Because the Vivitrol didn’t work for him
AS: I have heard that.
LL: He’s like, “The Suboxone is so helpful for me. It helps with so much of the cravings.” He was worried, too. Part of my frustration too is, I think him name is Marv Seppala. One of the directors at Hazelden. I did get a hold of him and talk to him. I had requested all of Ryan’s progress notes and read through everything. 
AS: Ryan releassed them to you?
LL: This is after Ryan died. I got all the progress notes. Every single progress note was from a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor: “Is at high risk for relapse if discharged.” 
What is interesting is the way we got in contact with him was I went to an all-day seminar. It was on heroin in the community. It was so good. But there were people there I knew, too. Another director from Hazelden, a lady—I can’t remember her name—stood up there and said, which just pissed me off, she’s like, “We cannot be telling people that they need to hit rock bottom. Their rock bottom is death. We are now starting to use Suboxone,” which they did start using with Ryan when he was there. “We believe in Medicaid.” 
When she was done and the group got to ask questions I asked three really direct questions to them. After I went up and talked to her and said, “I have to tell you I am so pissed off right now.” I sat there and talked to her and she was wonderful, she was listening and here she has a son in active addiction right now. She said, “I want you to talk to Marv Seppala and share your story with him.” He called me and was very gracious and very nice. We talked through everything. He said, “Would you be willing to talk to these counselors?” I said, “Yeah, but I want you to read through all the progress notes I read through. You can contact me and you can point out the errors. And you can understand why I’m so frustrated. Why there has to be change.”
AS: Right. It is not my job to be educating you people after my son has died in your care.
LL: I know. Now I am at the point where I’m really frustrated. I want that sober house investigated. I want to hold Hazelden responsible for not helping us get him into the right place. When I told them that I don’t feel that they know about the sober houses that they are sending people to. I’m at the point now where my grief is turning into frustration. 
I’ve had two years now to attend all these different things. Learn about the disease of addiction itself. All these different resources, talking to other parents. A lot of this was preventable. It was Ryan who needed to get sober himself. I don’t think he had enough support and tools in the places that are supposed to be—Hazelden is—there are so many errors. I think with me being in the medical field and being a nurse and able to identify those—I feel that Ryan was failed by the healthcare system as well. There are a lot of things that I think we can change. When I share my story I am so involved in getting change to happen.
AS: Can you talk about that experience from the moment of losing your son to what made you want to keep talking about it? As a mom, was it grief that motivated you? Was it anger that motivated you? How did it play out?
LL: It is a combination. I had my second back surgery a month after Ryan died. I was off—because this time I had effusions—I was off for three months. I had a lot of time to process; to educate. People gave me so many different books, which were very helpful. 
A month before Ryan died another young man in the area had died that Ryan knew. You would think that that would scare him. His mom was actually a St. Paul police officer. I have since been in contact with her. Another boy died. A good friend who lived in the area said, “I’m really sorry. I don’t want you to—but have you heard about so and so?” “No, I haven’t heard anything. I haven’t been on social media. I have just been isolated.” Here it was a friend of Wilson’s, our youngest. He played baseball with him. His older brother died of heroin overdose. They weren’t releasing what it was, but we knew what it was. She was a concerned parent, too. She was like, “Something has to be done.” I’m like, “I know. I have been trying to look into this.” I had been contacting the St. Paul Pioneer Press. The Washington County sheriff, the Hennepin County sheriff—anybody I could to figure out how we could get a forum. I had already been working on this. 
AS: This is while you are recovering from the surgery?
LL: Yeah. I saved all the e-mails and contacts and everything, too. That just fueled me. I’m like we have to do something. I just couldn’t sit there. Part of it was grief. Part of it was anger. So, that continued to get me to move and as a result, got me connected with the right people. Pete Orput the District Attorney. His two boys are actually in recovery. He fights like… I love him. He got me in touch with Cheif Mueller and Sheriff Hutton and Know the Truth program. That is when we stared doing the forums around here. They were only gong to do one forum, and I said, “One forum is not enough. You need to do a forum for each city.” The good thing is Chief Mueller has five kids that go to Stillwater, and he is right in that. He knows the statistics. So he helped fight for more forums. We had one at Tartan, one at Woodbury—
AS: You are having them in the schools?
LL: One at North. In the schools, yeah. I had been working with the schools, too. Directly with Tartan, and the head lady at the district—she was like, “I don’t know if we can have something like that in our school. We have to pay for it.” Because we are in Washington County she found Mueller, who said, “They don’t have a choice, Lori. This is my county, this is my jurisdiction. They will be holding one. We just need to work on dates.”
I finally wound up getting in connection with all the right people. At that time too, we were working with the St. Paul officer because we were trying to figure out, okay, what all did Ryan pawn? We didn’t know we were missing it until we went to go get it. We got connected with a St. Paul officer, Sandra Kennedy, who happens to live out here. It is just weird the way it all—she was very helpful because we were fighting with the pawn shop because they were telling us we had to file charges—
AS: Charges against who?
LL: Charges against Ryan.
AS: You’re deceased son?
LL: Yes. I’m like, “My son is dead.” I finally called her up, just was balling. She was like, “Okay, I am on vacation now. I’ll be back. You are off on medical leave right now, right?” “Yeah.” She said, “Does it matter what time I stop by?” “No.” She came over and returned some of the things because she searched the whole area and returned some of the things. Some of the things must have been sold. I can’t find my laptop, his laptop, which makes me sick because there are pictures on there that I’ll never retrieve. She was really helpful. She told me, “You need to come to a group called Survivor Resources in St. Paul.” It is right in the police department. There are other officers there that lost kids to heroin. One of them was Ryan’s friend that had died the month before he died. That is his mom who is a St. Paul officer. Thank God for that group. It is other parents that have lost their kids. They know exactly what you’re going through. I feel fortunate. I’ve got very good friends, supportive work environment. We are a very close family. I have so many people to lean on. There is no way of knowing—nobody can know. These people knew and it was a group of parents who had lost their kids to either drugs or accidents. Some people were twenty years out. We had more coming that were new. It helped me to know that—honestly Monty and I walked around for six months in a fog. Even still now I don’t remember things. I could be in midsentence and I don’t even know what I’m talking about. It is because I am still preoccupied with saving my son. It’s all that would’ve, should’ve, could’ve. Just some of the things that you’re feeling that you can’t even tell anybody else because they think you are crazy. They know. They get it. They helped us get through first holidays, birthday, all that stuff and what to expect and that it is okay. It was so helpful. 
I haven’t been there for a while now because I feel like I am in an okay place right now. My husband needs to go somewhere because he is still a mess. Every year they do what is called Walk for Hope, Walk for Remembrance at Como Park. Last Monday night we went there and did that. My husband still can’t do it, but there is a big group of us and that is put on by Survivor Resources. I saw all the people and I went with—and all the people who lead it and I say, “I’m sorry I haven’t been there. I have been doing okay.” But I will come back and see and everything. I honestly could not have gotten through without… No.
We both went to psychologists that Hazelden, actually, recommended. But after four or five times it’s just like I am not gaining anything anymore. She is very good. We actually tried a spiritual healer, too. We went as a group because I wanted the kids to go, too, and just know there are resources out there. Because Monty and I were just a mess. We are just now within the last few months are able to help our kids because we were so lost. Not only did they have that year and a half that we dealt with Ryan, but now they had a whole other year and a half where we were absent and that’s not fair to them. 
Each one of them has gone through trying to deal with it. We talk about Ryan all the time. It is hard. Sometimes we get choked up and cry but we keep him present. On his birthday they made burritos because that was his favorite thing. I told all the kids, “I don’t care what you have to do, but be here.” I just wanted everyone to say what you miss about Ryan because I think it is important for them, too. It was fine—we did laugh a little bit. We were teary. We actually signed—have you ever seen those floating lanterns? We all signed it and said ‘Ryan’ and it started raining and we still have it, we haven’t done it. 
The kids are all struggling in their own way. Our twenty-three year old started drinking heavily. Wound up getting a DUI last June. They were always good about calling Uber. We recognized that she was drinking and, “No, Mom I’m not,” and so thank God she got the DUI. She has been going to class. In fact last Thursday she graduated. We’ve seen such a change in her. I think part of it, too, it’s just the age she is at where she’s getting old enough and she is getting more responsible. They just bought a house. She understands. Her brain has developed to where she understands the consequences that it caused for everybody. She doesn’t want to go back there again. She’s been doing great. 
Unfortunately Cal, the nineteen year old, well he’s twenty now, never grieved Ryan, which we knew. It breaks my heart because he’s my—Cal is really quiet, but, very attuned to your feelings. He has been ever since he was little. Just so loving. I remember one time I was pregnant with Wilson and Cal was like three. I was just huge, fat, I had been tired of being pregnant, and I almost started crying. I thought, “I can’t cry with him here,” and I was trying on maternity clothes. He looks up at me—and his little cheeks—and he goes, “Mom, you are so beautiful.” And I thought, “You are going to make some woman the happiest.” He is one of those kids that is really quiet and he takes everything and he started drinking more and more and more. And this girlfriend he was with, she had heroin issues. Psychological and chemical issues. Actually, her mother it turns out, graduated a year after me and my sister. 
Cal recieved a DUI back in October. He has all those court issues then. On Easter he just never comes home, which is unlike him. For consumption. Call the jail: “Cal’s in here. We haven’t posted anything yet because he was booked a few hours ago.” Anyways, he gets a second DUI. Shortly after that he is up at the park at 7:00 o’clock at night with his girlfriend. She calls, she is hammered. I said to Monty, “I can’t deal with this. Cal is so drunk.” I had to go out in the car to get him in. Monty drives his girlfriend home, and during this time Cal wakes up a little bit and just unloads. We had suspected. He just looks at us with hate in his eyes. This is this kid who had—it is just pure hate. I suspected. I said to my mom, “I think he blames us for Ryan’s death.” She said, “No he doesn’t.” I said, “Mom, you don’t know the way he looks at me. Yes, he does.” He was drunk and everything came out: “I blame you and dad for Ryan’s death. If you would have let him come home this wouldn’t have happened. You don’t understand. I lost my friend. I looked up to him. I lost my big brother.” And my heart just broke. He went on and you know, “He came to me in a dream the other night. Told me how much he liked my art and that I was doing a good job.” And just, God, my heart. 
Anyways, later that night, I had him lay on the couch. I was in here doing something and Monty finally came home from dropping his girlfriend off and Monty yells at me” “Lori, get in here.” Cal is unresponsive. I did the sternal rub and he was just flopping and I’m like, “Call 911,” and Monty is like, “I can’t.” Just mental block from stuff with Ryan. He is like, “Lori, I can’t.” I’m like, “We need to get into the car now and get to the ER.” Brought him to the ER and even as a parent I’m like this is more than alcohol. I begged the ER doctor to do a drug test and he wouldn’t. And later, now we found out, now that Cal is in treatment, he had done Xanax that night and alcohol. Had we not found him he would have died. I have yet to write a letter to the ER doctor that treated him that night but—
AS: Why wouldn't they run a drug test?
LL: Because Cal is eighteen and he can, “Well, let’s wait for him to sober up and sign a consent to do it.” Again, these ER doctors need to listen to the parents. You don’t know my son. I know my son. I know this is not just alcohol. Part of Cal’s legal stuff is he had to get a chem dep. He started going to outpatient treatment. He told them he was drinking with his girlfriend the night before. He had snuck over there to see her to bring her a little turtle that he found here in our yard. [laughs]
AS: He tattled on himself about drinking? So he would be kicked out of the program?
LL: No he didn’t know he would be kicked out. We had to go there and get everything and they told us. And Cal is like, “I didn’t know, I was just being honest.” I’m like—
AS: It’s so ridiculous.
LL: I know. They recommended inpatient treatment. Again, three week wait for a bed. I told Monty I said, “I cannot watch him for twenty-four hours. I don’t have the energy to do that nor do I want to do that. I don’t want to worry.” We called his sister-in-law. She lives up in Nekoosa, Wisconsin out on some land up there in the middle of nowhere. That is where he went until his bed was ready. He has two cousins: one six months older and one six months younger. His cousins would come down here and stuff. They haven’t seen each other for a while, but that’s where they went. Someone called us and said, “We are able to get him here earlier.” I said, “Okay he is up in Nekoosa. We need three and a half hours, more than that, a day to go get him.” And yeah, so that’s where he stayed. I can’t lose another son and go through this again. 
AS: How long has he been in treatment? 
LL: I pick him up on Wednesday, it will be twenty-five days. They would only do twenty-one days. I know. That’s another thing—
AS: And he’s twenty?
LL: He’s Twenty. He turned twenty in April. Again, I have huge concerns. When I was talking to him on the phone, I’m like, “They are discharging you on Wednesday? That’s not even…” He thought it was twenty-eight days. I’m like, “That’s not twenty-eight days.” I go, “Cal, I’m really worried about you,” I said, “I’m really worried about you coming home.” He wasn’t getting liquor here at all. He would get somebody to buy it for him. His counselor said, “I’m not worried about him coming home because that’s not where he got it.” He said, “You guys don’t want to have liqour at home.” I said, “You can’t hang around your friends. They all drink. Not to the extent that you do. Casual drinking, on the weekends. You can’t be around that. I don’t think you are strong enough. I think eventually you will get there.” His response was, “Mom, you don’t worry about it. You don’t have anything to worry about.” 
AS: Oh, really? I don’t have anything to worry about?
LL: I told his counselor. I said, “That’s a red flag to me, and it should be for you, too.” If he was ready to come home he would have said, “Mom, don’t worry about it. This is my plan. I don’t plan on hanging out with those guys for a while.” Whatever. Here I am frustrated. Right now I could see Cal going either way. I don’t think he’s an alcoholic. I think after Ryan’s death that caused it to get worse. I think he’s at a point right now where he could go really either way. As a parent I can’t. We told him too, we’ll support you in recovery. My husband and I are consequences—
AS: Will he come back here and live? Is that the plan?
LL: We talked to the counselor: “You have a very supportive environment. He understands this is an addiction and it was more powerful than Ryan. Alcohol is more powerful than him right now. They had him write a letter to Ryan, which he read in front of the whole group. It was very—he just let loose and was very emotional. They’ve already gotten set up to go to intensive outpatient treatment. I guess we will just support him into his recovery. It is really hard for us because I know the outcome. Some people say, “Oh, alcohol is not as bad.” Yes it is. Yes it is. 
Here we are. 
My poor sixteen year old. He has been through so much and seen all this. Now he is sixteen and he’s going places. I’m like, you know, I go through the same things. Call parents and everything and he is like, “Mom, I’m not going to do drugs.” “That’s what Ryan said, that’s what Jenna said, that’s what Cal said.” Three of my four, you know? He goes, “Mom, I’ve already been to parties where they have offered me that and I just say no.” I’m like, “Oh my God, Wilson, I’m so proud of you for doing that.” 
But, quite frankly I think for myself when I was a teenager and that’s a thing you try and get across. I had a picture of an addict—this woman wearing a bomber or whatever. That is not it. These kids come from really good families. They are with these friends and their friends have done it. They feel safe, they feel comfortable. Goes out the window, you know? I was that age, too. Thank God that that didn’t come because if my friends were doing it and those were my good friends and I trusted them and was with them all the time.
AS: You probably would have. 
LL: Yes. It is so scary, you know? It’s not just our kids. It’s grandma who went in for knee surgery and got hooked on Vicodin and didn’t wean her off of it and now she’s buying it from—it is anyone. I have hope and I’m optimistic. I’m trying to raise awareness and help change some of these things within our own healthcare organization, at Hazelden, at these sober houses. Especially for medication assisted treatment. If there is something out there that will help them. We both thought that would’ve helped my son. We weren’t given the chance. Whatever we can do to try and prevent it and bring awareness. Even the symptoms for other parents—
AS: I didn’t know my daughter was nodding off because of heroin. 
LL: I know!
AS: I thought she was over tired because she was a night owl and she would stay up too late. So by the next night at dinner when she is like nodding I would just tell her to get up and go to bed. You’re frustrating me sitting here in front of this dinner that I made. Just go to bed! Of course she would get up and go to bed. [laughs]
LL: For a parent to know all of those signs. The flu type symptom, the nodding off, long sleeve shirts, spoons missing. I couldn’t figure out where the frick—I would go to Target and buy spoons because… 
That is another thing about Cal because that night when he was drunk—he has talked about it in counseling. He feels tremendous guilt. Looking back he knows he drove Ryan to dealers’ houses. Because Ryan said, “Stay in the car I’m just going to run in and get my phone charger that I left here,” or whatever. He also saw Ryan taking spoons and knew what he was using them for and didn’t tell us. He feels a tremendous amount of guilt, too. I want him to understand that even if he had told us that wouldn’t have changed the outcomes. The disease was bigger than Ryan. 
AS: How do you deal with that as a mom? As a parent? Do you still feel like you could have done something more?
LL: Oh yeah. I think for me—the avenues I have taken of speaking out, being involved, and trying to make change happen helps me. It’s my therapy because it helps me continue to fight for my son even though he’s gone. I look back now and Monty and I always—God if we would have—we were ready to mortgage the house to put him in the Hazelden fellowship inpatient program for three months. But then we are like, “Okay, we spent $40,000. Is that really going to help him? And what is that taking away from the rest of the kids?” It is such a dilemma. We think about that, too. If we had gone and went to a different sober house. If we had identified the symptoms sooner. If we—again it is so out of our control. 
AS: But yet as a parent—
LL: You still feel that way.
AS: You still think you can do something to help your child. 
LL: If I had stayed and taken him out to dinner that night because I recognized that he was agitated. Would that have prevented him from getting the money, going on the bus? It is all that stuff. You drive yourself absolutely crazy. 
I never used to have anxiety. I have tremendous anxiety now. I am still thinking about ways that—what could I have done? It is frustrating. Your emotions are all over the place. There are times where I feel Ryan now. I used to hate it when people would tell me that because I’m like, “I don’t.” 
I dream about him, I feel him now. I can feel happiness. There are days, too, where I see Cal’s pain and I think God dang it this disease is still affecting our family. I am angry at Ryan for dying. We were supposed to work through this together. I never know where I’m going to be when I am going to break down next. If I smell him or hear a song I completely lose it. It is just—our lives still seem unmanageable. Not to the extent that it was when he was using, but we isolated ourselves back then because we didn’t want anyone to know, or we were exhausted, or we never knew what was going on with Ryan. We still do that now. We don’t care about the same things. The things that mattered before don’t. 
AS: Those outgoing parents that you were around with everybody else’s children, you’re not that anymore?
LL: Nope. Don’t have the energy. It’s not that we don’t care. It’s just that it’s not what matters anymore. I don’t know. It is weird. It is hard to explain. Some of the times even going to family functions shortly after Ryan died. I’m like, “You guys we are going to go. We are going to cry. It is our first holiday without him. Let’s time box it. If we stay for an hour and we just really need to get out of there, that’s fine.” My family understands. That is kind of how we are now, too. We go out and do stuff but you will be sitting having dinner at a restaurant and someone will start crying. That’s okay. Let’s just go to the bathroom. We will finish our meal and leave. 
AS: You said people were very supportive of you. Do you feel like your speaking out has helped other people? You are saying you are still fighting for your son. Have there been any rewards for the kind of mothering you’re doing for other people?
LL: Yeah. Whenever I speak at those forums there are always parents that come up after and they are like, “Thank you. This is what I’m seeing and at least now that I know I’m not alone and there are other resources.” I’ve had other parents contact me and say, “You know what? My friend so and so—this is what they are dealing with.” 
AS: Can they contact you? Are you open to that?
LL: Yes, absolutely. At Health Partners they did a story in our newsletter and it goes out and it hits 25,000 employees. Just the comments that I got on there, through social media. They said typically they get like five hundred to nine hundred hits. They had over 20,000 hits. That tells us. I’m like that is what I’m trying to tell people. People know that people are suffering but then people may not know that their neighbor is going through this. A big part of it is the stigma and people won’t talk. 
I mean that is another thing. We hid it from our family for six months. I have a very close knit family. The first time we would make excuses and the second time he went in and I was like, “Ryan, I need support, too. I told grandma and my siblings.” He almost went white. You could just tell, even for him, it was such a relief to not have to hide this. Everyone sent him letters. I think the way he thought people would react to him was just not. 
That was good, too, and that showed me that quite frankly the people that are going to support you are going to support you through anything. It doesn’t matter what it is. The people that don’t and are uncomfortable. Some people at work. I recognize they can’t deal with it. They avoid me and that’s okay. I’m fine with that. There are people that come up and say, “I don’t know what to say. I just want to say I’m sorry.” It is odd. Death is odd. Especially for a young child. 
So yeah, it has helped me. It has really helped me with my other children, too. In fact, the other things that don’t matter to me—I sepnd more time, not that I didn’t before. We were so busy running running running. The counselor. When I went up to Cal, when I went out to family, I could only go a day, not the four days. I had to write a letter to him and he had to write a letter to me, and he hadn’t told anyone that his brother had died. After I read the letter, everybody was crying. The counselor came up, and I said, “I know you are struggling with your brother’s death. This has a lot to do with it. I know you hate me and blame me and that breaks my heart. If you can deal with that the rest of your life and you are sober and can deal with your emotions I will take that.” The counselor came up and said, “Cal, I didn’t know your brother died. You didn’t share that with any of us.”
There were eight of these guys and he said, “How many of you are in here for heroin addiction? Cal, I want you to talk to these guys. I want you to try and understand for your brother.” He said to him, which shocked me, “Your brother did not die in vain.” It caught me off guard, too. He goes, “Lori I’m going to tell you something.” Because Cal had to read his letter to me, too. It was very apparent that he looked up to Ryan a lot. I didn’t realize they were as close as they were. He said, “If he looked up to Ryan as much as he did it was just a matter of time before he would follow in Ryan’s footsteps and eventually tried it. He may have saved your life, Cal.” And all this time I had never, ever, ever thought about having another child at—it didn’t even cross my mind. 
AS: Have another child what?
LL: Use. Because they looked up—I don’t know if that would happen, but it scares the hell out of me. It was interesting. Every time I attend anything I learn something more. I attend whenever I can. 
AS: Do you still go to Al-Anon?
LL: No. In fact, I went back—for me it is probably just some mental thing but I can’t go. I went back once by myself and hated being there because when I had been there Ryan was in the ambulance. And my two friends that I had met through Hazelden wanted to go there, too. They were like, “Will you go with us?” and I was like, “Sure,” and I can’t go back. 
AS: Not to that same group you mean?
LL: No, because it is a different group—but anywhere. Survivor Resources is good for me, which I should go back to. I can’t go back to Al-Anon. I know it is probably a mental block. I really do, but I can’t. I learned good tools there but it’s just too painful for me. Because Ryan and I would laugh after at Al-Anon. Do you go to Al-Anon?
AS: I go to Nar-Anon.
LL: I don’t know if Nar-Anon does it, but you would put a little saying out and they would pull it out and it was just funny because Ryan was telling me on the way there that I was such a perfectionist. I said, “Maybe I am but I have to be in control of things because otherwise, for me, I feel like things aren’t getting done.” There are certain things. That thing I had read that morning was something about you can’t control—something about perfectionists. I go here and I handed it to him and we both started laughing. He was always telling me, “You work on your program, I’ll work on mine.” It’s just that. It is too heartbreaking. You know we should have still been doing that. No, life had a different course. I can’t go back, but I did learn a lot.
AS: That makes sense. Anything else you want to say? How do you think about yourself as a mom through this disaster? You just talked about perfection and trying to fix things. How do you relate to yourself as a mother?
LL: I still feel that I am a terrible mom because I couldn’t save my son. That is a thing I have to work through. I’m like, “Did I do something wrong? Is there something  I could have done better? Am I a terrible mom?” My poor daughter she is like, “Stop, Mom.” I just will always doubt myself. That there could have been something I could have done for him more. I could have understood him more. I could have spent more time or spent more time with him in his art stuff. There is always going to be that. 
As far as the other kids I pick my battles more. I realize that some of these little things truly do not matter. But the things that do I am going to confront you on it. There are going to be consequences. I just told them, “You have to understand that I can’t. This is the way I have to deal with things now. Because of what is happening. I can’t help it.” I said, “Call me on it.” In fact Jenna, Monty, and I were sitting in the kitchen just last week and we were talking something about Cal and I was talking a mile a minute and Jenna was like, “Good God, Mom. Settle down. You are so hyper,” and I was like, “Am I? I don’t…” So you know that is fair. Call me on it because I don’t understand. 
AS: You’ve kept, even through this tragedy of ongoing problems, that openness with your family?
LL: I’ve tried to, yeah. I think it is important. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve let go of some control because I know… part of it is I’ve let go of control, but I’ve set expectations and I’m trying to follow through now. We lacked that I think with Ryan, which is unfortunate for the other kids too because it is like, you know—
AS: An expectation for sobriety?
LL: For sobriety, for honesty, if I am asking you to do something I want it completed. I am holding you accountable. It is hard because one day Cal was standing in the kitchen and he came home sometime after his second DUI. I checked his eyes, I checked everything: “Where were you?” Everything. He even started crying. He’s like, “Mom, please don’t do this to me. I’m not Ryan.” It just broke my heart. I realized that I am interrogating him. I’m not coming from a loving mother it’s coming from fear. It is hard to keep in check. You know, I do my best. That’s all I can do. I have slowed down a great deal since. I was that mom who was involved with everything with their kids. Doing all the right things 
AS: Yet you still think you are a terrible mom.
LL: Yeah, yeah. 
AS: What does that say to you? Do you have to think about mothers—
LL: I know. It is interesting that you even say that because even just now sitting here talking with you I have these other mothers that come to me and they are exactly like I am. They have done all the same things. Yet I tell them, “You know what? You are a good mom. It’s not your fault. It’s out of your control.” Isn’t that funny? But it is hard. I will always feel that there is more we could have, should have done. 
AS: Because we are held to some standard that isn’t possible to achieve? 
LL: Yes. That is our job as parents: to love, support, protect. That is the thing. 
AS: But when you do all of that and you still lose a child and you know you’ve done those things and you still blame yourself as if we were super human. 
LL: Exactly. It is played out multiple times a day in my head. I imagine always will be. I don’t think I can go to therapy or anything for help. It just is. 
AS: Anything else that you want to say?
LL: I can’t think of anything. I mean we just miss him dearly. There is a huge, huge, huge, huge void. It is weird because you want to say you feel that presence that he once had here is completely gone. You knew when he was here. He was harassing his siblings, he was loud, he was obnoxious, he was funny, he would always try to get a rise out of you. He was always playing his guitar. There is just this silence. It’s just hard. I feel bad for any parent who has to go through this. Not even any parent. Any family. And the friends. When his friends were over here the other day I get it that they are struggling, too. Thank you for taking this on, too. I had a really nice time sitting here chatting with you.
AS: Thank you, Lori."

Narrator
Amy Sullivan
Interviewer
April 14, 2017
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Mary McCarthy-MM
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. We are at Cafe Southside in Minneapolis. It is April 14th. I am with Mary McCarthy. Mary, do you give me permission to record this interview?
MM: Yes. 
AS: Can you start with where you grew up and your childhood, early adulthood, your life?
MM: Sure. I was born in Washington, D.C. It was kind of a crazy story so I won’t go into a lot of detail on that, but there was a lot of conflict in their relationship when I was little. They were breaking up and getting back together a lot. In about second grade my mom got a job offer in Colorado Springs. She worked for HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development], so we moved to Colorado. He ultimately ended up leaving her at that point in time and she lost her job. A whole bunch of things happened, which brought us to Minnesota. 
The next year we ended up living in Minnesota. It was third grade spent until sixth grade here. Then we moved up north. She was in a series of not great relationship with, ironically, people who were addicted primarily to alcohol. At least that’s what I knew at that time, which was forty years ago. My sister is forty-two now, and she was born during that period of time. 
My parental family background is two families of raving alcoholics. My paternal grandmother started off the day every morning with a screwdriver or a Bloody Mary and ended the day with gimlets and martinis. She was kind of buzzed perpetually. My mom’s side of the family had a lot of alcoholics, primarily the men in the family who were also abusive at times. My grandmother had grown up in Chicago and left an abusive husband. She moved to Iowa. There are a lot of family secrets. My mom kind of reinvented herself around the time I was born and continually thereafter. That is a whole other story that we won’t record! From an anthropological standpoint it is kind of an interesting story. There has been a lot of abuse in them. 
As I mentioned those two relationships after I was born that produced my sisters were both with people who were struggling with alcohol and maybe other substances too. One of those individuals I don’t have contact with deliberately. At the last count he had twenty-three children. I’m not lying. One story is there were a couple of families with multiple kids, like four or five, and at one point he had beaten them so severely that another mom had to take care of the kids while the other mom was in the hospital. A lot of that kind of behavior. 
When I was younger there was a lot of violence because of the drinking. When I was thirteen I ran away from home and went to live with my dad. At that point we were living up north on the reservation. I went to live with my birth father and stayed with him for a year and a half. 
AS: Your birth father is from the reservation?
MM: No. My stepfather is. My birth father was out on the East Coast. I moved back to Maryland and was in Maryland for a year and a half and then I came back to Minnesota and that’s where I finished high school and did all of that. Ironically, after I ran away a lot of stuff changed. The use didn’t change, but the abuse that I experienced changed. There were benefits to it I guess. If you are familiar with the ACE Study [Adverse Childhood Experience] I score an eight, roughly. That kind of gives you a sense. The fact that I operate and function is probably a pretty good thing. I smoke cigarettes, but that’s it. Sometimes I think that is part of the reason it is so hard for me to quit. Looking at trauma as we have in the last few years has brought that to the forefront for me. 
Continued through high school a couple of episodes of drunken fights and things like that in my home. I started to get to a point where I could stand up to it to some degree. I had two smaller sisters that I was protecting. In the meantime both of my grandmothers had died in that period of time, which was really traumatic as well. One of them I think was driving, or had only ever been the partner of someone who was drinking. She had kind of grown up with that as an adult woman, but I had never experienced something like that. The grandmothers even though they had their issues didn’t seem to transfer that a whole lot. 
AS: And they were important to your growing up.
MM: Yes, but they both died when I was ten. They died four months apart and it was traumatic. I am actually the namesake of one of them. The drunk one, I hate to say it, I was her namesake and was her only grandchild. It was devastating for me. Both of them at the same time. I still mourn them to this day. 
Ironically my stepmother, or my stepfather’s mother, within that same eighteen-month period of time was killed in a car accident on New Year’s Eve and everybody in the car was drunk. My whole extended family, all of the adults, were in the car when the accident happened. It was a lot of trauma around use and drinking. I’ve gone through my stages of drinking too, but have never had an issue with it other than throwing up when I drink too much. I saw a lot of those patterns, whether it be of the abuse or anything, so I kind of tried to stop some of those. 
Interestingly enough we also are a very marijuana cultured family. Something I grew up with. It was never, “Oh let me see if I can get my hands on it!” It was never any kind of ideation like that. I just had access to it and had a really clear understanding of it. As an adult I adopted it as an episodic habit and now actually use it medically, not legally medically, but for medical purposes and will probably smoke pot until the day I die. Being totally frank with you. I think that that is a harm reduction technique. When I am working with clients I have especially those addicted to methamphetamine or other things I counsel them, and this is partly based on direction from our medical director and partly based on my own knowledge, that “smoke a joint instead and see if that gets you to the place you need to be rather than doing something different.” 
I had two marriages. My second marriage ultimately was with somebody addicted to methamphetamine. I did try that a couple of times. I don’t know why. It was the stupidest thing in the world because I can’t take Sudafed, so why would I ever think I could do something like that? Growing up on the reservation you get to that place where, “you’re not going to tell me I can’t do something.” There is, for lack of a better word, a machismo that goes along with that regardless of your gender identity. Where we grew up was pretty notoriously known for being—they call it ‘little Chicago.’
AS: Where is that?
MM: On Leech Lake. It is pretty well known in certain instances for the kind of activity that goes on. There are stories of Al Capone being there and having a cabin. My grandfather apparently toured him around and guided him and went hunting and fishing with him. There are a lot of different elements and people are kind of in survival mode. That mentality and of course being in a very, very sick relationship. “You can’t tell me I’m not going to do it!” Hated it with a passion. What I appreciate about that experience is I’m not talking out of both sides of my mouth. I haven’t done a dance or had an issue, but I’ve had the experience. I can honestly say I know what I’m talking about from that standpoint. 
A huge majority of my extended family is dealing with addiction of methamphetamine. With my stepfather—that’s the father of my youngest sister—there are twelve children. Out of the twelve of us two are now gone, have passed away for different reasons. Two are incarcerated in federal prison and both had raving addictions prior to that. Two others had addiction and are in various stages of recovery. When it came down to it out of the twelve of us there were only two that could really claim sobriety out of twelve kids. One of the two of us drinks and I smoke pot, so some would question whether that’s true sobriety. My point is that over half of us have gotten to the point where it has had a true impact on life overall. Children have been lost when elements of addiction have come into play. 
When I see that impacted in my nuclear family—extended or otherwise—that’s a real frustration for me. Fortunately my birth children are pretty good for the most part. They grew up with the same thing as I did as far as their understanding of marijuana and knowing it was around and not having a push one way or another. I certainly did not ever sit down and smoke with my kids until they were adults. Once they were adults and were making their own decisions—that was a different situation. My oldest daughter is going to be thirty. I’m not going to dictate what she does or does not do. She’s a big girl now. One of my children is completely sober, one hundred percent, and has no desire to ever use. It is just a spectrum of things. I go from a standpoint of transparency and honesty and I’m not going to bullshit around. I may not be willing to admit some of the things I’ve done, but I’m not going to deny them or lie about it. 
I have been an only child for the first ten years of my life and I was very secluded. My mother would go party and do things like that so I would spend a lot of time alone. Then I got these two sisters I ended up taking care of. Not long after that I started having my own children. My youngest is now twenty and in the last year or so I have gotten to a place for the first time in my life when I have actually been able to worry about me, outside of the normal mom and kid stuff. I’m fully responsible for myself and it is incredibly liberating. Now if I could just get the rest of them to stop taking my money, time, and energy I’d be in good shape. 
Overall I’ve come out relatively unscathed and have learned a hell of a lot. It has been quite the experience. Now I’m working with my children. A great example was my daughter was going to go pick up my alcoholic stepdad last night from the rez and bring him down. She looked at my Wednesday night and said, “I can’t do it. I talked to him and he is buzzed up and I just can’t deal with it.” She loves her grandfather to death. They are very connected, but she has now been able to establish that pattern and see that she can just go with him and have fun, but she sees the consequences and understands the impact of it. We talk about it. We have talked about it with him now because part of it is unlearning our enabling behaviors of the past. 
The interesting thing for me was when I was in my second marriage and working at DIS [Department of Information Services] in the HIV field part of my responsibility was doing training around HIV systems and we incorporated methamphetamine because it was such a big deal. We had expertise from Mia Weber who was at the Methamphetamine Resource Center, and she came to do the trainings with us. As I was dealing with all this stuff personally I was also getting education professionally, so what is interesting to me is that my two lives have taught me —my personal life and my professional life—in this role have collided unbelievably over the last ten years or so. That’s kind of a benefit when we are talking about the opioid issue because I already have experience with the other epidemic crises in my opinion and have had those conversations and dealt with personal things that you have to reconcile. I think it takes a lot of strength to do this work. If you have any of your own internal baggage it hampers that. I’m grateful that I’ve gotten to do some of that and can be more clear headed. 
I also understand that the Native American community is overrepresented in this issue and because of my connections and my family I have a personal interest as well and desire to help the entire community. Not only that, but I grew up in that environment and I understand how you move forward in that community trying to assist. 
So many people try to silence the issue, for example the opioid response. Everybody is talking about the opioid response. To my point exactly, “Fine. Get somebody sober. Then what the fuck are they going to do?” Especially if they are dealing with issues of sexual orientation or identity or any number of things. How do you talk to them in a way that says sobriety is the way to go? And these are the reasons why. All on top of the physiological effects it has on your brain. So you already feel like shit and then you want to say, “Oh there is a better life” and I am realizing that as I talk to my younger children that are millennials. 
In addition to the whole epidemic of abuse there is also this whole thing understanding that this ‘adulting’ thing sucks and what is the benefit? Why do I have to work my ass off to pay bills and accomplish nothing? There is a whole different ideology going on with this group of people that are younger. If they get hooked into that messaging about using and it makes them ‘feel better’ I believe we are going to have an even harder argument because they are already saying, “This grown-up thing is fucked up. Why am I working my ass off to not accomplish anything or not have the things I want? You have raised me in a society where I am going to get everything I want at least information wise and all of these things are right at the tip of my fingers, but this work thing means you don’t see progress all the time.” If I hear one more person say, “I don’t like doing that.” When did we ever get to say we don’t like doing something? Are you kidding me right now? 
AS: You see the generational difference as contributing towards the current epidemic particularly with opioids?
MM: Absolutely. Across the board. I think everybody is looking for their buzz of choice. Part of it is about access and part of it is about history. With the extended family my stepsiblings grew up with my alcoholic stepfather, who I love to death, and their mother who would take anything. She liked to inject anything. We found a needle in their couch fifteen years ago before this was even on the radar. That whole community of folks—there are a lot of people who are episodic users. I carried that woman, not literally, but in her wheelchair, to treatment, three different programs. I remember specifically being at the ER at HCMC [Hennepin County Medical Center] and saying, “What is your drug of choice?” Because I let her get shit faced before I took her in. That was the only way they were going to take her. She didn’t answer the question so I answered for her and said that she was an opportunistic user. Vodka is her drug of choice, but she will take anything. She said, “That’s right!” 
My point is that when you get to that level where you just need to be inebriated it’s not going to matter what it is. She was doing pills. One of her best buddies that was using at that point in time was a woman my age that I went to school with and she's actually a couple years older than me. She was on the verge of dying. She is on an oxygen tank and has been for years. My stepsister a year ago had heart valve replacement surgery and now has a pig valve in her heart. She’s forty-two years old and has no teeth. No one in that part of the family has teeth. My twenty-two year old nephew is waiting to get dentures and is so emaciated and so out of it. Not only that but he can’t maintain sobriety. He was in a halfway house here and got caught using K2. It’s not about making good choices, it’s not about going back to that to get the buzz, it is “this is what I have access to and what is available.” 
AS: What did he try to do after the halfway house? Right?
MM: He tried to come to my house. Right.
AS: Going back to what you were saying about having support systems.
MM: Right. I had a conversation with him and I said, “Why were you successful at treatment?” “Because I was at Moorhead in the middle of nowhere and I didn’t know anybody and I couldn’t get anywhere. We could go to the Y [MCA]. So I’d go there and work out wherever I wanted to.” That’s not a realistic idea of what life is going to be. I believe that that program is setting him up for failure because they were giving him access to things that he wasn’t going to be able to touch. Not only that, and here is a very key piece that I have been coming to, but he’s now sitting in jail. He blew a court date. They had a warrant and he turned himself in. My daughter used these words exactly, “He’s just going to stay there and bounce through all of his charges because it is housing.” I think that is a key aspect of all of this. People end up seeing these things as housing. 
There are many people I know who have HIV who have gone to treatment to attain sobriety and they get released and are homeless. If you are going to release someone and they are homeless how do you expect them to not get triggered? DHS has changed Rule 31 a few years ago to include HIV training and education. We had a conversation with them a few years after that and I talked to Rick Moldenhauer and I said, “Do they talk about sexual health in groups or any treatment?” “The programs might or might not.” “When you get out of treatment one of the first things you probably want to do is get laid. If you’ve never gotten laid without being high then that is a trigger for relapse. Is it not?” A light bulb went off in his head and he went, “Oh my God.” 
We started doing HIV and chemical health systems trainings based on that. The training that was developed went along with the matrix model that the state uses in doing assessments and things like that so that people could understand the correlations between different levels of use and their sexual risk. That has not necessarily been successful in the long run because it is a whole other area of expertise that the counselors need to have around HIV and sexual health. And there is the reluctance to have those conversations, yet it has been identified. All of those corollaries and those triggering factors relate back to it which is why I think there is such a deep connection in those two fields of work that go very hand in hand. 
My background, interestingly enough years ago, was in the legal field. I worked for a trial-consulting firm. Prior to that it was with a computer consulting firm. I have had a variety of administrative jobs more in business management. 
AS: Did you go to college?
MM: I did go to college. I crashed and burned my first year, so then I supplemented and took classes here and there. I was lucky because when I turned nineteen that was the legal drinking age, so after my first year of college—it had been recommended that I take a break after my first year to go and find myself because BSU [Bemidji State University] wasn’t letting me come back for a year. I was working full-time and going to be the next rock star at Pizza Hut and loving life. I was legal at the same time so I was partying like a rock star and it was fun. It was a blast. Then I transferred to Brainerd and hated it. I spent as much time as I could going back to Bemidji, and ultimately got frustrated and went back to Maryland to visit a friend. She said, “You should move back here!” 
So six months later I did. I went back to Maryland and we engaged with all of my friends that I had lived with there before and connected with my first husband and started having kids. That little, brief period of time. 
AS: That was where you met your husband?
MM: I met my husband when I was thirteen and then we reconnected when I was twenty. Then we started having kids. I stayed there for about four or five years. By that time we had gotten married and we had two children. The relationship completely fell apart. It was the end of the eighties and the early nineties, so being out East when the job market collapsed. I don’t know if you remember Reaganomics—it pales in comparison to the nightmare we are living in now—but at that time we thought that was the worst thing. When George W. Bush starts looking good and even he’s saying it—fuck my life. 
Anyways, I made a decision at that point that I knew I could come back to Minnesota and raise my two children, I was by myself, and I had family support and friends and other things. We moved back here and moved to the cities because I knew it was going to be more marketable for me to get a job. From there we just rebuilt our lives. My first husband subsequently followed us here and we ended up having our third child together, and then finally called it quits. After that we tried and tried, but he had a hard time not having more than one relationship at a time. It doesn’t work when you have three kids. 
Ironically, I had planned to be a stay at home mom, and when I found out about his shenanigans—I actually had been offered a position and I called them back and thankfully it was still open. I had this amazing experience of working with a child-consulting firm that was very socially progressive. They only worked with personal injury plaintiffs and criminal defendants. Basically whomever the underdog or one that was least advantaged in the situation was—doing things like jury selection, helping attorney’s prepare for trial, mock juries and things like that. I learned a ton of information and made a lot of connections. I also worked in a small non-profit in the same organization. In small organizations people tend to go a little batshit crazy. When you’ve been doing the same thing—they were stuck in founder mode. They didn’t know how they were going to move forward. After a period of eight years I got totally frustrated and had to leave. It was really fun, but then these crazy women that I was working with that don’t think about five years from now—there was no business planning or anything like that. 
I finally got frustrated and interesting enough heard about a position in Hennepin County and HIV from two different people that I had a lot of respect for and both recommended me for the position. I applied for it and ended up getting it, which is what got me into HIV. This will be my sixteenth year working in HIV. I started in 2001. I have been here for sixteen years. I spent my first four or five years working for the planning body, so I learned all about the federal funding and evaluations and things like that. Then I moved to DHS where I was a training coordinator and a contract manager. I started to see the program side of it and the government administration side and then was more familiar with that. 
Three years ago I think it will be now my mom passed away. Some things happened over the course of that period of time that was just like the straw that broke the camel’s back. Interestingly enough this position I’m in right now had previously been posted, but they hadn’t found someone, so they reopened it and I was at that place where I knew I needed to start applying even though I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. I have to start applying. Completely impetuous. It was week one of grieving after my mom died. Complete bullshit wrong timing, but it was the motivation I needed. I submitted my application. 
AS: It is still called RAAN, right? Rural AIDS Action Network?
MM: Right. I submitted my application and ended up getting a phone interview and one thing led to another and the next thing I knew they were offering me the position. It was just one of those wow kind of things. I was so desperate for change that I just jumped on it, not fully thinking through it. It’s a really different thing because you have the livelihoods of eighteen people in your hands. 
AS: Like their salaries and careers?
MM: Yeah. The biggest stressor I have is ensuring that these folks get to continue to keep working. The good thing is they are an amazing team of people and if something ever happened I know they would be fine and continue on.
AS: Could you describe the network?
MM: We are actually celebrating our twenty-fifth anniversary this year. I am super excited. The organization was started by a woman named Linda Brandt who saw a need for services for people living with HIV in greater Minnesota. She actively worked to start building these networks. The network model, while it may still not be exactly as she envisioned, I think we have retained it in spirit. What I love about it is we are regional. All of our staff with few exceptions live in the communities they work in. They understand what is available and how to access programs there. They also, for the most part case managers in particular, already know resources and services available. They have a broad array of experience that they brought with them. Some of them were working in mental health in the past doing case management, some are experienced in the [Wyvern] system. They all have this different breadth and experience that they bring with them. 
I just recently wrote a proposal where I figured out that even though we have some fairly new staff to the agency collectively we have over seventy years of experience working in HIV and providing services. I probably am a little bit off in that estimate, but that’s what I can safely say and that makes me really proud to understand that we have the breadth of experience that spans twice what the epidemic has been around for, which I think adds value. It makes us able to be scalable in our responses that are related to the same group of people. I challenge that a lot of the clients that we work with are folks that other systems are connecting with on a regular basis; people that are dealing with substance use, people that are dealing with mental health issues, people that are homeless and experiencing a whole lot of other health related disparities. 
Part of our HIV work has included Hepatitis C, primarily testings, but we took it to another level because that was highly unsatisfying for staff. We are really more actively working to connect people who test positive to care and follow them for a little longer, even though that falls outside of our grant parameters, because that is how we do business. We are about relationship building and meeting the needs of the individual. There’s nothing worse than giving someone a diagnosis that they are unfamiliar with and then just walking away. I don’t know if it is statewide, but I believe it is, our positivity rate for Hepatitis C is thirty-nine percent, which is kind of off the charts. We are one of the highest in a community based setting that there can be. We are getting results. We know we are working with the folks that are impacted. The wonderful thing is we are not testing people positive for HIV at that same rate. In fact our HIV rate is incredibly low, including the population of people that chooses to inject. Our syringe program we are not identifying people that are HIV positive, but we are identifying Hepatitis C. We know that our HIV prevention efforts are being successful. 
I don’t know if you are aware of this, and Maggie can confirm my statistics, but approximately fifty percent of people who inject acquire Hep C within six months of beginning to inject. My mother in law, or stepmother that I mentioned earlier that I took to treatment was Hep C positive. Not a big surprise. She got tested in a methadone clinic, so it wasn’t great, but it was just another little extra-added layer because she chose to keep using, so of course her health wasn’t what it could have been. I’m pretty sure she never got treatment for it. I am digressing and going back. 
AS: Where are the communities that you have offices?
MM: Right now we have offices in Mankato, St. Cloud, which is our central office and main location, Moorhead, Grand Rapids, and Duluth. All of those locations for the most part we offer prevention and care services. They usually have a prevention worker and a case manager so we can represent both sides of the HIV spectrum. Duluth and Grand Rapids are split where care is in Grand Rapids and Duluth is prevention. We are probably going to be adding some more here and there. 
AS: How are you funded?
MM: We are funded primarily through federal and state grants. A lot of it is federal pass-through money. All of our case management programs are funded in white funds. We get state money from MDH for prevention related work, which includes a small carve out for some syringe supplies. That is the one contract where our syringe program is specifically listed under. As long as we are using state funds they can pay for the supplies. As you know there is a ban on federal money being used for syringe supplies. It is ludicrous. They loosened it up a year ago where we can actually buy staff time with federal money for the syringe program, but we can’t buy supplies. It is just goofy. 
This DHS proposal that is out right now and due for submission next week is a grant that is based on the Cures Act [21st Century Cures Act, 2015] money that was released last fall. It is an attempt to really respond to the opioid crisis. The interesting thing, like I was saying before, was that group that we work with that is pretty much reflective of a bunch of different areas, and because of that a couple of years ago we were asked to start distributing Narcan, some people call it Naloxone, for opioid reversal. When we got that grand we started diving into that area a little bit more. They already have that exchange so it made sense and was a great fit for there. 
The next year we added on statewide distribution, so now we have Narcan in all of our offices and all of our staff have been trained to distribute it and train others in its administration. Now we have been able to take that statewide and because of that DHS has recognized us as an entity to work with moving forward with the Cures grant money. They have applied for over five million dollars a year and we have been targeted to receive a big chunk of that. The intent of that would be to expand our intent services because my goal since I walked in the door has been to have services all over the state. Basically replicating the program we have in Duluth, which I think I am going to say publically is the gold standard. I believe it is. We have more hours than any other program that I am aware of. We are open thirty hours a week on average. We create an environment where people can come in. I provide socks, mittens, gloves, and blankets for everyone because staff will meet these clients where their needs are. Some of them don’t have access to water because they are homeless, so when that happens we get them water. 
AS: It is responsive to the particular needs of the clients in those areas of the state. 
MM: Yes. And Maggie and James are really great. They just started it as an after school program, and it really does make sense. In the middle of winter there is a pot of water going for people to have hot tea. Sometimes folks have been roaming around all night, or whatever the case it. It is one place in their lives they can interact and not have any judgment passed on them. They can come in and have their needs met, sit down for a minute if they need to, get a cup of coffee, sometimes there are other treats. The staff have collected and they have boxes of all the little shampoos and personal care items. We collect those from hotels when we stay and donate them back to the program because sometimes—you wouldn’t believe what a little bottle of shampoo or conditioner can do to somebody. We go to the dollar store and pick up little bottles of nail polish and stuff like that because sometimes that’s the most interaction where somebody has had where they are treated like they are any normal person. It is amazing. 
What I love about it is when I go up there and work, whether I am covering or just hanging around, I am almost invisible. They don’t recognize me as somebody that’s not there everyday because they get the same level of treatment and that is what they have been acculturated to. They are just as open and offer sharing with me than they are with any of the other staff. It’s really interesting to see that dynamic at play because it proves to me that we have garnered a lot of trust. 
AS: Do you know how many people you serve?
MM: Not deliberately—I walk around with this because I was so impressed. This is a survey that I just completed a few months ago. Apparently it is done pretty regularly, but they had missed it in ‘14. This page is talking about syringe distribution specifically in ‘14, but it was very limited questions. That was page one. It was just our basic detail and information. This is just some demographics. There is a specific page I am—right here it starts into distribution.
AS: 254,610 syringes out—
MM: In one location in one year. That’s Duluth. 
AS: 1,584 participants. That’s just Duluth?
MM: Yeah. 
AS: Twenty syringes per person average. 
MM: That is a total estimate based on nothing other than a rough estimate. 
AS: 204,000 [syringes] were returned.
MM: I’m really impressed with our numbers. We average three thousand dollars a month just in syringe supplies alone at that location. We know we are being affective. 
AS: Of the people that come in, do you know how many go into treatment?
MM: I don’t. We track it anecdotally, and Maggie and James track it in their heads, but we don’t track it deliberately because it is not a principle of harm reduction. It is understood, and this is where Maggie may be contrary to me, and I would go with what she says, it is understood that treatment for harm reduction participants is generally more effective and more successful with them because they’ve already gone through all the precontemplation and when they get to that stage of going into treatment they generally are more ready for that stage. Part of it is that prep work that goes into that. Tracking it can’t tell you one hundred percent. 
What I can tell you is that I have a picture on my phone that I can’t share of a mom and her baby. The mom was driven to treatment by Maggie, when she found out she was pregnant, the baby and her are both fine. They are together. The baby is thriving. They came in on her first birthday to play with Steph. I am getting goose bumps. Maggie didn’t know who it was until she heard her voice. When she heard her voice and when she recognized her and knew who it was because she had changed so much and mom and baby were doing amazing. We know of two moms and babies that have successfully been dropped off at treatment and are still together. We hear outcomes here and there. Steph stopped tracking the number of reversals that they were getting from Narcan because it was so depressing. In the first roughly three months that we were doing Narcan distribution there were seventy-five reversals. That means that seventy-five people that might have died that we had a hand in reversing—those numbers were too staggering to keep track of. I think they had program fatigue. Understand these folks—Maggie’s background is an artist. 
AS: What do you think for the future? Is there a point where you would consider tracking those numbers?
MM: We absolutely need to. It is not acceptable. 
AS: Right. It’s not that you don’t want to, it’s that you have limited staff.
MM: Absolutely not. Part of it is that and part of it is as a staff we can’t physically track anymore of these. It is too painful. We hear these stories all the time. 
AS: You need another person or two. 
MM: You may have heard this before, but there are some fabulous program staff that are not necessarily the strongest people on the admin side, and that’s kind of how you want them. In fact that was part of my conversation with Maggie this morning, “You guys need to shore up your admin stuff because you’re not reflecting what you’re doing.” They had just found a stack of papers that had never gotten entered. I had said, “Your numbers are not accurate because we have been on an upward trajectory the whole program and we are down. Your numbers are wrong.” It’s that mom with the eyes in the back of your head thing. I tell them all the time, “You guys! I know, see, and hear everything. If you think you are getting away with something I find out about it!” So the same with the numbers and then poof, two months later guess what? “Oh, we found the papers!”
AS: Can you talk about the current political situation and tell us what you are going to focus on?
MM: In light of the current political situation, particularly with so many people in power that do not necessarily believe in sexual health education and the importance of that, I have started thinking strategically that because the opioid response was one of those things that is so neutral and truly bipartisan because so many aspects of society have been impacted that we might have to step back our really visible HIV and Hep C work approach and really focus more on our opioid work from a political stand point moving forward. 
So far what I have realized is our composition did not change a lot with respect to the actual state of Minnesota. We did not get much shift in the folks that were elected, so we have been in these environments for a long time. Federally, I think we are going to have a much different impact because we don’t know what is going to happen and it’s just a crapshoot. 
AS: What about the Cures money?
MM: The Cures money is going to explode and really help up approach the whole opioid epidemic. With that we will bring our HIV and Hep C work along with us because in my estimation they go hand in hand. If I am trying to encourage people to keep medication on hand so they don’t overdose or someone they love doesn’t overdose then why don’t you get tested at the same time so we can see what other stuff is going on. Part of that is being actively a part of a community and engaged in the response. Again, that’s where the benefit of my staff being in these communities brings their own passion into their work in that community. 
To be honest some of them are reluctant with the Narcan stuff. I think they feel uncertain about it and we have that same dynamic. Our staff is very reflective. I have people that are very progressive and really have a good handle on things in a larger sense and how those things interact with each other. I have some folks that are from a small community and have the intent to keep doing that work in that community and don’t always have a broad view of the world for lack of a better way to put it. That’s a very small portion; my point is we are very reflective and represent that breadth as well. I think that is important because it is a challenge if you have someone that is not capable of doing the work at a certain level, but there is also a time when those individuals are appropriate for a different aspect. You know what I mean? It is that give and take. 
AS: Also for example if you know don’t someone who has been saved by Narcan you don’t understand. You almost have to be in direct contact with it to understand why that would be important to keep that person alive. 
MM: Yes. I think a lot of the people I am referring to who have that resistance are because they haven’t had that experience. 
AS: Exactly. It’s not because of a lack of desire or of humanity or care for other people, it is just not understanding. Like many people don’t understand harm reduction and needle exchanges as a link to health.
MM: I also think that you can’t challenge everyone’s personal biases and I do believe that some of it is “I don’t know if I want to work with those people.” Not understanding that we work with everybody. I think there is a fear. I don’t know what it is about folks who chose to inject, I really don’t know. I am confused as to why that is a different dynamic of use than other substances. Some of these same people with consume shit tons of alcohol, and in my estimation that is just as bad if not worse because alcohol has killed billions of people in a variety of ways. 
AS: I see it as a hierarchy of stigma. I’ve been thinking about how there is a hierarchy of stigmatizing because even addicts stigmatize others. Alcoholics stigmatize addicts.
MM: In sexual health the gay community totally stigmatizes the bi community. From gender and orientation. If you think about it, you’ve learned this since grade school, you always want to pick on somebody that’s lesser perceived than you. It’s a pecking order that we have learned very early on. I was guilty of it myself. I was always the fat girl. I remember in high school there was one girl that was fatter than me and I was fucking grateful. I was like, “Thank God for this chick because otherwise I would be the biggest one.” You know what I mean? I was guilty of it myself. I’m just saying. I think being fat is still one of the most stigmatized things period, across the board. 
AS: One more thing. Would you describe your typical day as the director of Rural Aids Action Network?
MM: Holy buckets. Well here is the interesting thing. We were on lean. We run really lean and that is because I am all about not doing anything that we can’t sustain, whether it be for staff or client. Even though I’m willing to take risks I’m very practical when it comes to making decisions. We clearly could use a whole other level, like a middle management type of person. There are just a lot of things we don’t get done. I’ve used this analogy before with one of the counterparts of this HIV agency. I was talking to a program manager and I said, “It’s an imbalanced conversation because generally it would be ED to program director talking but I don’t have a ‘you’ so you get me.” 
My week or time frame could consist of anything. I spend a lot of time in meetings, whether it be about HIV planning or other aspects of the HIV world—grant management, things like that. I’m involved in a lot of meetings and committees about that. The opioid response—I participate in a couple of harm reduction groups with chemical health professionals about our response. I spend a lot of time doing overall administrative functions, dealing with HR things. 
I have a leadership team that involves three other people. We just had a retreat this week and went to the financial sustainability conference yesterday. Part of it is developing a team at the same time who are all coming along together because we are also de facto doing a succession plan. Who is going to be the next person to take over, and I have already identified that person. I am doing development because I value development across the board and the staff. We are always looking for opportunities that people can get involved in. 
I am very much into relationship building so a lot of times it is projects like yours where we can be of some kind of assistance. Part of our mission is to educate and advocate for people living with HIV and I don’t feel like I can do that unless I am talking about that very actively with everybody. It relates to all aspects of life. I just participated in an AIDS Action Day. 
Some of it is reconnecting with other people in the community. It is interesting because I am very connected to the Metro community of providers and other folks, so I have the benefit of getting to work with them. I get to work with clients because of other work I have done in the past. I don’t get the benefit of being able to be in one of those communities all the time, so I’m not super visible to everyone we are working with, but I hope to be approachable. It’s kind of like the best of both worlds. I can literally be running from one end of the state to the other and meeting with people about various things and program stuff, or covering for them even sometimes. Then at home a good chunk of the day can be spent on the phone. I don’t talk to family on the phone anymore. The last thing I want to do is make a phone call. 
AS: Because you are checking in with six different offices. 
MM: Right, or we are strategizing issues that are client related issues that come up. There are programmatic related issues. We have reporting, so I oversee and am responsible for all the staff too. I’m not responsible for all of them directly, but I supervise all the program folks and the Narcan stuff because so much of that is legislation related right now and it’s beneficial that I’m in the Cities because then I can just go to the meetings and do what I need to do. Plus, I have my previous connections to other aspects of the world. DHS was a phone call to me saying, “Do you want to distribute Narcan?” because I have this longstanding relationship with chemical health area. 
Part of it is who I have been and what I can bring to it and I have this amazing team of people. The case management coordinator for example has been with us for ten years. We have two case managers that have been with the organization for ten years. They can give me the perspective and historical standpoint. Then the leadership team helps guide my decision making on some of the bigger, problematic stuff. This expansion of the opioid project was my dream child when I started working for the organization. I said I wanted to be able to expand the work that we were doing and put some syringe exchanges in all of the offices. We methodically started doing that. Our Mankato location is primed and ready to go and all we need are the funds. We have the physical space; we have the go ahead from our landlord. That is the other thing—
AS: The newest one is in Mankato?
MM: It will be once we get everything going and get some funding that is tagged to be the next one. We learned that diabetics are selling their syringes to folks that are using. When you talk about the public health implication of it, it is staggering. When you have nurses coming to you and saying, “Will you please open a syringe exchange?” it illustrates the need. 
That is one of the places I have had staff for ten years, so she’s got a long-standing history and is very approachable and that is one of the things that is beneficial about our regional model. We connect with folks. It is really popular because people like to do the work in other areas and they want to partner with us all the time and one of the things I am very clear with is I can do a one-time event or something, but I don’t want you tip-toeing in our areas and then leaving because you don’t come back. 
AS: What do you mean a one-time event?
MM: Well, like Minnesota AIDS Project will say things like, “Let’s do this, let’s do that.” 
A great example is there’s a syphilis outbreak right now in Mille Lacs, I think I told you about that, and so we have been doing these weekly events on each of the districts on the reservation. Minnesota AIDS Project was involved as well and one of the proposals someone had was they do two events and we do two events to mitigate staff time and I said, “Absolutely not. We are going to be at every one of those events because they are never going to come back out here and interact with this community whereas we are. We will be at every one of them because that is an investment that we will make.” That is about relationship building. 
I went and did Narcan distribution at two of the events and I’m going to the fourth one next week. At the two events I gave out seventy kits. One of them was to a person that took twenty kits. The interesting thing was I was connecting with the actual people who are using and are connected to the using community. The Health Department has been talking to tribal folks and so the Health Department is a little removed and the tribal folks are very much removed, so they are having all these conversations that are going to result in nothing. What we are doing is building the relationships at the ground level and getting our name out there so that people know. It is preemptive for the Cures money, so it is a colossal tax on my schedule right now, but I think it is a good investment in that relationship building and continuing to do that work, because we are going to continue giving out Narcan no matter what. 
We are also working with the drug courts on the SAMHSA [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] grant where they are doing care fares and testing with drug court participants, so that’s going to be super exciting to see how that comes out too. 
AS: You will have entry with all those people who have been—
MM: For testing. It is kind of a backwards way of doing it with the response. With the drug court they are supposed to be on contract. We are supposed to distribute Narcan, so I was on a call with the administrator of the program on Tuesday. I was like, “Okay, so this whole Narcan thing—we are kind of confused.” 
AS: They don’t want needles?
MM: No, they don’t want needles, but the fact that they were even willing to give it out to the participants—that program is running more on a harm reduction model. They aren’t automatically kicking people out. It is a different approach. 
AS: What did you do when they started doing that?
MM: This is very recent. Our contract isn’t even signed yet and there have been three fares already. 
AS: So it is recent that they are changing their tune.
MM: I’m not sure they are changing their tune, but it’s what their tune is now. I thought it was interesting. I hope this has been helpful.
AS: It has been great. Thank you."

RM: Yes, my name is Rose McKinney and I give Amy permission for this interview.
AS: Thank you. Rose, could you start by talking a little bit about what your childhood was like, where you grew up, your education, and your career. What you do today.
RM: I am the youngest of three daughters. There is a fair amount of gap in between, which makes things interesting. I have one sister that is seven years older and a sister that is twelve years older. So my parents had me a little bit later in their life. Before 1966 it was kind of a rare thing. My mom was almost forty-one when I was born. Had a great childhood. Growing up my parents owned a business. Prior to that they had moved around a fair amount with my dad’s jobs. Before that he had been in the army. My sisters had transplanted childhoods. My childhood was pretty much all in one place. I grew up in Des Moines, Iowa. Close with my sisters. Close with my parents. 
A couple of interesting things about my background. I went to boarding school at age fourteen. I went back out East. I spent my high school years away from home. In some regards, that may have been the sanest thing that could have happened. I was a good kid, but I didn’t take things for granted. I would push my dad’s buttons and we would get into round and round discussions. I think that it was probably a good thing that allowed me to begin to see those ideas and opinions and independence which probably brought us closer when we did get together at holidays and summer were really enjoyable times. They liked to hear about what I was thinking versus the day to day stuff. 
I went to college. I originally thought that I would like to be a broadcast journalist. I thought I wanted to be the next Jane Polly on the Today Show. Interview interesting people. Hear their stories. I quickly learned that the route to become that was not something I was interested in. I didn’t want to—by who, what, when, and where. The kind of life of a reporter. I found that I was really interested in telling deeper stories. I wanted to know why organizations weren’t talking about all these other things. They said, “Oh you need to be in public relations.” I had no idea what that was. I took a PR class and the very first day of class we talked about the definition and building mutually beneficial relationships and helping organizations create understanding. And that’s it! That’s pretty much what I focused on in college and started my career in public relations. Met my husband while I was still in college and we got engaged and got married right after I graduated. 
That takes me into my motherhood piece. I had been working for about nine months and I got pregnant. In 1988, ‘89, there was not job sharing. There was not flexible hours. We didn’t have email! 
AS: You couldn’t really work from home.
RM: There really weren’t any of these things. I remember going to my boss and saying, “You know, I’m not sure that I can come back full time after this baby comes.” They said, “Well, put together some sort of proposal.” “What do you think?” And my daughter ended up being born three weeks early and I never got my proposal put together. They started calling me and saying, “Hey do you think you could at least finish the newsletter project? Do you think you could work on the publicity for this client?” I was able to freelance and be a mom. It was pretty incredible. Baby one: ‘89. I was freelancing a little bit part time. Mothering, young mother at age 23. Three years later baby two came along in 1992. 
At that point I was still doing some freelance work and a lot more volunteering like in a Montessori school and these kinds of things. I had an opportunity through a freelance project to go back to work full time in 1996. I did. I loved that opportunity. Working full time. We were lucky to have some nannies that worked out really well for our family. And then we got pregnant with baby number three. And we said, “Oh my gosh. I loved my job. Let’s just see what happens with trying it this way.” So I had been the stay at home mom with the freelancing and I had been the full time mom and it worked out really well with baby number three to continue working full time and not freelance. That was in 2000. That’s kind of the motherhood journey.
AS: As your kids got older, can you talk about your son, was he the middle child? Can you talk about what he was like? What your other kids were like? How you navigated the difficulties? Were there any?
RM: Great relationship. In fact, because of the three year difference between Julia and Ryan, Ryan and I were really close. She was in Montessori school. In the mornings, drop her off for a couple of hours and then Ryan and I had a lot of one on one time together. Which was really special. I think to this day we have a close relationship. We enjoy spending time together one on one. I credit it back to those early years. We would have those mornings together. Then, pick Julie up from preschool, go home, have lunch, naps. I would work on projects. Life was pretty good. 
Ryan always had a good sense of humor. He was always a very mature kid. He would hang out with his older sister and her friends. He was kind of the tag along in the neighborhood. He was the youngest in the group of six or seven kids that all hung out together. The interesting thing with Ryan is he was always so good natured and happy and everything. Every once in awhile if he would get out of sorts or fussy or irritable, backtalking, what not. I would get frustrated and send him to his room or something like that. The interesting thing is that generally within a matter of minutes he would be asleep. Or he would be getting sick. 
I came to recognize when he was out of sorts he was either exhausted and needed a nap, or was, you know, an ear infection was coming on or a cold. The getting sick would maybe show up the next day or something. It was intersesting because at the time you don’t realize it. This kid is being crazy, or separation. Then you would go, “Oh, now I get it.”
Like anything you would recognize, “Oh, I need to pay more attention. Just because he isn’t taking naps anymore regularily I need to see if he is tired.” And say, “Don’t react to the behavior.” So fast forward, I wish that had been in my mind. Hindsight. I can say, “Oh, we missed some things. But they were there.” 
AS: Can you give any examples?
RM: I think when he would, he got into high school we started to notice he was struggling around junior year. Didn’t want to participate in a lot of family things. Back talking, argumentative, keeping to himself, breaking the rules. Not anything bad. Just little stuff. Didn’t seem interested in anything. He has always been such a smart kid that school was always kind of boring. We got concerned about that and went to the doctor to rule out if it was depression or who knows what was going on. Even at that point my husband and I said, “Do you think he could be using drugs?” We didn’t have any real, hard reason to believe it. But we weren’t naive enough to think that his behavior and his mood couldn’t be related to that. That is one example of the differences in how he is behaving. He is not the same person right now. What else could be going on in his life? He will tell us now that he didn’t feel like he fit in. And yet, he had tons of friends. 
He would say he didn’t feel comfortable in all these social situations and yet he was always mister center of attention. I think there are a lot of times where your perception of yourself is not necessarily what other people are seeing and experiencing. My thought now is when there is this big gap between what one person perceives and what the self perceives, you need to stop and figure out why and what. 
So, we noticed it. We tried to stop it. Couldn’t get at anything. At that point he couldn’t articulate what was going on. No. There is nothing. You couldn’t even have the deep conversation to get at it!
AS: Did you bring him to a doctor around that time? Or did you just go yourselves?
RM: We took him to a doctor. That was actually very disappointing. My husband took him. They had been very close throughout childhood. You know, Boundary Water trips, coaching sports, watching movies. Just really lots of good, active father son time. It was my husband that actually identified it. Said, “I think something is off.” I was a little more like, “Yeah, you know, teenager.”
They went and that ended up being somewhat dissapointing because the doctor ruled out anything physical. “Maybe some family counciling would help. It’s tough being a kid these days.” My husband asked the doctor, “Did you do a drug test?” and the doctor said, “I don’t think that’s what’s going on. I just think its really tough being a kid these days. He’s a good kid. Just some counseling.” I don’t know if anything would have shown up at that point or not, but I am apalled that as long as they were doing blood and urine tests anyway that they wouldn’t at least check. And again, it might have come and said no, there is nothing in the system.
AS: But if you don’t check, you don’t know.
RM: Exactly. That was one of the first frustrating things. From there we did go to see a counselor. Both independently and together. The counselor would talk to us and say, “Yeah, it sure sounds like maybe that’s what’s going on.” And then he would talk to our son and he couldn’t get anything concrete. So, there are these two different things going on. I believe the counselor knew there was drug use, but because my son wouldn’t come right out and say it, or he always had some kind of excuse, he could snow ball or tip toe around. We had group sessions and it just didn’t work. 
When we started finding marijuana and that kind of stuff then it would just get into the arguments over, “Well it’s good for you, or everybody does it, or get off my back, or it should be legal.” Again, it just went round and round and round. We did find evidence senior year of high school that it was more than pot. We kept saying, “This just doesn’t seem like it could only be pot.” You know? Yet we didn’t—
AS: What was the evidence?
RM: We found strips of aluminum foil with burn marks in the car. Took it to the police who said, “Yeah, it’s likely heroin. Could be meth or something. Likely heroin.” 
AS: This is his senior year?
RM: This is his senior year at this point. And yeah, ask him about it. “I’ve never seen it. I don’t know what that is.” And we said, “You know what, you are responsible for other people in your car.” He would just come up with all kinds of wild things. “Well, maybe someone was in my car when I was at class.” [laughs] I mean this is the type of thing. We would get into these logical things that were, you know, if someone was watching us they would be like why? There was just all these circular arguments. You would just get lost in it. So, whether it was him or someone he was with, clearly someone was using heroin. 
Fast forward a couple years after that when he was in inpatient treatment. He comes forward in our first family meeting and says, “I want to tell you I’ve been using opiates and heroin.” And we just looked at him and said, “Yeah. We know this.” And he thought it was some big confession and he still made it sounds like it had only been a few months. 
AS: How long was it?
RM: At least a couple of years. If he had been using full time, or regularly, it was there. I thought back to all the times that I had found a roll of tin foil in his backpack or a roll of tin foil in the car. All those things and you are like, “It’s been there.”
AS: Right in front of you. 
RM: Yeah. Right in front. And we knew it. But you can’t—what can you do? I mean you can do plenty. You can talk about it, you can encourage conversation. We went and got smart, we went and got knowledgeable, we found out about it. But when I say, “What can you do?” The cliche that always comes to mind is you can always lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink. And the adage that you can salt the oats. I feel like that was kind of—
AS: That made his life more difficult towards recovery?
RM: Yeah. And not even necessarily more difficult, but you can make more encouragement. You can say, “Hey, we can help. College is possible when you go to treatment. We might be able to help you out with the car. We can do things.” Because the drugs have hijacked his brain, even if those offers sounded good he couldn’t give up. It takes a long time for parents to, or anybody that loves somebody that is using, to come to understand that there is really nothing you can say or do that is going to be compelling enough for them to go, “This thing that I survive on, that I enjoy, or that maybe I don’t enjoy it anymore but I survive on it, I can’t give that up.” They can’t see that road forward.
AS: What was your relationship with him like at this time?
RM: We maintained regular contact. Call, text, have him come over for dinner. We probably did see him at least once a week. Sometimes maybe it was— 
AS: While he was using?
RM: Yeah, while he was using. Most of the time it was pleasant enough. As long as we avoided talking about use. Or talking about going to treatment or something. We would have this back and forth between should we continue to try and talk it through and get him to see what is going on and get some help? Which would usually escalate and not go anywhere. Or, should we just let him know that the family is here and the home is here and that we love him, and that he is welcome, and let him know too that guess what? While he is choosing these other things right now, our life is going on. Guess what, we are going on vacation? Guess what, we are going to a movie. Our life is still going on and you could be part of that. 
AS: Did you just kind of naturally have that response? Did you get help from other people that were familiar with addiction or teenagers?
RM: Some of both. Early on, right at the start of 2011, things had really gotten out of control. I will back up a little of the history. He had graduated in June 2010. He had a scholarship to go to college and then decided not to do that, and he was using. We had a horrible summer of running away, and being out at all hours, and sleeping all day. He was living the addiction lifestyle. We were still figuring out what was—I mean we knew he was using pot. We had found the strips of tin foil. We knew things weren’t right. We were in that sorting out period, and seeing a counselor off and on.
He decided at the end of the summer that he was not going to go to college. Which on the one hand was disappointing because a) he had this scholarship and b) we were excited for him to be out of the house. [laughs] He announces that he is going to go to community college and keep working his job. We are like, “Then the ground rules are,” and that ended up being a horrific semester. We could tell that his… he wasn’t happy. He was always angry. He was always tired. 
AS: Was he living at home?
RM: He was living at home. I would check the mileage on the car. He would say he was going to be one place and not. During this, the counselor we were working with, our son was a tennis player, Ryan did decide that he might go to school that second semester. We jointly decided that it would be good if he stayed in tennis. So, we paid for him to stay in tennis at the health club and continue working with the team. It was a very talented team and in fact was a team that qualified for nationals. Some of these kids played at state and went on and did phenomenal things. He would go to practice, but somehow the miles between home and practice were a lot more than they should be in the car. We know in hindsight he was making his rounds. He would say, “Oh, after practice I’m going to such and such with so and so.” Of course, that wasn’t what he was doing. 
We just kept catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie, catching him in a lie. For a while, it was data finding. Like being a detective. Then after a while you keep finding the same things and it still doesn’t make any sense. All you can say is this is addiction. This is bad.
Anyways, at the last minute, he did decide he would go second semester and the school said they would honor his scholarship. A spot on the men’s tennis team was still open. This is when things really—this is the turning point. We took him up on Sunday and said goodbye and that week didn’t hear from him. I texted him a couple of times. I thought, you know, part of it is he needs that space. 
AS: Was college far away?
RM: Up in Duluth. St. Scholastica. Not that far, a couple of hours. I was headed out of town for a business trip and my husband and younger son were going to come with me and spend a weekend. That morning I tried to contact him again. Didn’t hear from him. The whole weekend we were in New York didn’t hear from him. Didn’t hear from him. We both said you know, if something was wrong I’m sure we would have heard. 
So, that Sunday when my husband got home, he checked the phone records and there had been no activity on the phone. This is not good. Not good. We could see some calls coming in. That night, at the hotel, I got a phone call from Ryan and—let me back up. When we dropped him off for school that Sunday I’m giving him a hug and I’m saying, “Clean slate,” and he said, “I know mom.” He said, “I won’t fuck up again.” So that Sunday when he called me he said, “Mom, I fucked up again.” And I said, “What happened?” 
The way it went down is that that Friday night, he and the college kids had been partying. Drinking and what not. Drinking, marijuana, and some pills and I’m not sure what. He passed out in the snow. This is January in Duluth, subzero temperatures. He was taken by ambulance to the ER and then put into detox. At that point the school was trying to work with him and the coach was trying to work with him. The coach, when we had been talking before, and I had said, “You really need to keep him on a short leash. School and tennis.” We talked a little bit. I didn’t ever tell the coach what had been going on those six months, but I just said it has been a really rough six months and senior year was rough. I said, “You don’t know how much he needs to be on this team and in classes. If he’s got structure maybe he’ll find a path forward.” The coach said, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” After this had happened the coach said, “I didn’t realize. Now I know what you mean by a short leash.” And again, we couldn’t control it. He couldn’t control it. But, maybe he would have gotten more than a week, I don’t know. 
So, fast forward again a couple weeks later. I get a phone call, I get home from teaching. It is about ten o’clock at night. This time it is the Dean of Students: “Mrs. McKinney, don’t worry, Ryan is okay, but I need to inform you that we have just sent him in a taxi to a hotel and we are going to put him up for a week. He has been using drugs in the dormitory. He has been talked to. He has ignored our conversations. Therefore, we are revoking his housing privileges.” He wasn’t kicked out of school because he wasn’t failing his classes. Talk about a rock and a hard space. You can go to school here but you can’t live on campus and eat in the dining hall. Where does he live? What does he do? We’ll put him up for a week in a hotel. Oh my gosh. 
Well, he just plummeted. At this point he is using all the time, he is not making friends, well, not those friends. Depression is sinking in. He doesn’t have anywhere to go. We are trying to—is there an apartment, is there someone you can room with? He isn’t a problem solving—at all. He doesn't actually want to solve this problem at all. And then he does. He stays on the sofa at somebody else's place for a while. Then, of course, he gets sick. It is difficult to get transportation to class so then he’s not going to class. By the middle of February, he’s not going to class, he doesn’t have a place to live, he has no income. It’s a disaster. 
At that point, this is a long answer to your questions, I had sought out a therapist because this was a lot to deal with. I had had one appointment and was kind of describing what was going on. It was on a Thursday. Saturday my husband and I were going to go up and see my son and sit down and have a face to face with him. Try to figure things out. So, we go up there, we pick up his stuff at his friend’s place, we have that in the car. We go and have lunch. Overall, it was a friendly conversation. One of the things he had been interested in was the military. Even at the end of high school when he wasn’t sure he wanted to go to college, he thought maybe he would go into the air force or do something like that. He went down for his meeting and he admitted that he smoked marijuana. They said, “Okay, you have to wait for thirty days. Don’t smoke for thirty days and you will be fine.” Of course he couldn’t do it. He kept postponing that. Another thing that had come up in high school was he looked into the naval academy. He had started the application process. He did not finish it, but he started the process. He was in the top twenty candidates. He had a high likelihood of getting accepting. This shows how smart he is.
So we are at lunch and we said, you know, you could always reopen your application and try that direction for next year. There is still time. Just trying to get him to think about options. My husband had gone to the bathroom. I said get your laptop and we can pull stuff up and see what we could do. He looks at me and he goes, “Mom, dad’s going to kill me. I don’t have my laptop.” And I said, “What do you mean you don’t have your laptop?” “I sold my laptop.” And then, “I sold my laptop because I had to pay some rent to the people I was staying with.” Well we know it wasn’t for paying rent. 
That was the, “Oh my gosh.” At that point we said, “You know what? We are going to get into the car and go home. You are welcome to get into the car with us and head down 35 back to Minneapolis. And that will give you a couple of hours to figure out what you are going to do. Because you know what? You are not bringing this chaos back into the house.” That was crazy talk.
AS: Had you offered him treatment along the way at this point?
RM: Well, counseling.
AS: But not treatment.
RM: Right, because at that point we didn’t really know that that was what he needed. We didn’t quite have the handle on what he was using, how he was using, and any of that. At that point then he came back. He lived with some family friends that would benefit from some rent. We paid for him to be able to stay there. We thought close with trusted people but not in the same house where things will turn into these round and round discussions. 
We would see him on a regular basis, several days a week, talk to him on the phone. He was still thinking of the military at this point, but the reserves were—work together could never make that appointment. We know why he couldn’t make that appointment. It was just kind of like this pretend effort toward things. Finally, things were getting worse and worse. He was becoming quite depressed. The lies were out of control. Delusional lies. The family that he was living with one day the son called me and he said, “I don’t think he is going to work. He is telling me this thing about how his bike got stolen and all of this.” Then he goes, “I went with him. Things just don’t add up to me.” And I said, “Well let me tell you what has been going on.” He goes, “Yeah I think this is what is going on. This is what I’m observing.” 
One particular day Ryan couldn’t get out of bed. The friend called and said, “He hasn’t left the house, he hasn’t gotten up, he’s just…” My husband and I come, and he was in a deep depression. Just feeling terrible and rotten. At that point I just asked him, “Do you think that the drugs are making you feel better, worse, or the same?” And he said, “Well, I don’t think they are making me feel better.” We thought that was a huge insight. We said, “We really think that you need to go into a treatment program.” The counselor at this point finally recommended he should go to counseling and get some psychological testing. They said, “Until you are sober we can’t address the mental if there is in fact mental. So, you need to get sober.” 
He wouldn’t go. He wouldn’t go and he was supposed to try and find a place on his own because he didn’t like what we were recommending. That didn’t come up with anything. We found this place out in Montana called the Wilderness Treatment Center. We thought he would really like it because it was for boys fourteen to twenty-four, nice age range. Hiking, backpacking, and he likes—that kind of stuff. He halfheartedly—I wouldn’t say halfheartedly—he agreed to go. He was going to go the next day. We were getting packed and filling everything out and that afternoon he wanted to call his grandpa to say happy birthday and he said he was going to tell his grandpa but he didn’t. That that was what he was going to do. He also wanted to go see his girlfriend. They were kind of on the odds at the time and he wanted to go see one of his best friends from kindergarten to tell him what was going on. He didn’t come home that night. Which we could have—
The next morning he showed up and my husband was there when he came home and he didn’t know where he slept. He said, “It doesn’t look like he slept anywhere. He didn’t sleep at somebody’s house.” We found out later he never did go to the friend’s. Who knows? He came in and he fell asleep on the sofa in our home downstairs. This is late morning. He stayed asleep until ten o’clock at night. Meanwhile, I’m getting his bag packed, finishing all the paperwork, got the plane tickets, they are supposed to leave the next morning. He wakes up at ten o’clock at night and it was the worst night of my life because my husband and I decided that my husband would go to bed since they had to get up early and I would stay up with Ryan and hopefully he would go back to sleep. Of course we ended up staying up for hours talking about, I wrote a blog about this, how did we get here? He says to me, “I just don’t understand how we got here?” [laughs]
AS: Your son said this?
RM: Because of this, this, this. And he’s like, “I don’t think this is the right thing for me. I don’t think I need this.” At first it’s, “I don’t think this is the right thing. I don’t think I need this.” And then it got ugly. Because of dad. Because of you. Because of this. All this stuff. And I’m not going to go. And I was just adament, “Nope, tomorrow you and dad are getting on a plane. At the end of sixty days we’ll talk.” I tried to put it in the positive: “You know what? You will feel better. You deserve to feel better. All these great things.”
So, the next morning of course, he is refusing to go. And my husband is like, “Get in the car.” We were adament. “You get in the car and you go.” The frist leg of the flight was fine. And they had to stopover in Salt Lake City and he was refusing to get on the plane and my husband was like, “You have to get on the plane.” But, I don’t know if this is true but it is a federal offense if you don’t get on the plane. [laughs]
AS: You told him it was a federal offense! [laughs]
RM: Because he had a ticket! And you are on the jetway, you can’t go back! Once you’ve given them your ticket which you have just done. It was one of those puddle jumper planes from that point. Unfortunately they weren’t seated next to each other on that flight [laughter]. He did. They got to the airport. The counsellor was there to pick him up. They hugged each other and said they loved each other. That was a positive goodbye. My husband got on a plane and flew back home. 
A couple days in, we got the call that he was okay, not talking to him, the counselor. He was okay, he hadn’t quite gotten into the groove. He was being polite, participating, and everything. We would have a chance to talk to him the next week. Couple days after that get the phone call from the counselor: “Is there more information you can give us, things you can share? He has got the guys here convinced that he doesn’t belong here. The guys are convinced he doesn’t belong here. He is insisting. You don’t have on here that he uses opiates. Are you sure that he’s not using opiates?” I said, “Well, we found the foil and I have a picture. We can send you the picture.” He said, “Because he is behaving like somebody who is withdrawing from opiates. He said he insists that he doesn’t. He insists it’s just marijuana.” We are like,”Yeah, see, this is what we have been up against. He doesn’t behave like someone who just uses marijuana. We found the foil but we don’t know for sure. And he never injected so there were never marks.” 
He ran away from that program a week in. Runs away; no phone, no wallet. Crazy stuff that happened from there. We hired a private investigator to find him. Got him back to the Twin Cities because we thought he should at least be close to home. That was another one. We couldn’t pick him up at the airport. Some neighbors picked him up for us. With the idea to find out where he wants to go. The options were go to treatment somewhere else. Go somewhere. 
AS: How long did it take the investigator to find him?
RM: Not long. Maybe a day or two. You’re in the middle of nowhere and, yeah. 
AS: How was that time for you? Did you sleep? What did you do?
RM: Adrenaline. Problem solving mode. Trying to keep things calm. We didn’t share a lot with family at that point. 
AS: Had you shared anything up to that point?
RM: Yeah. Yeah. We did the need to know basis. We didn’t know what was happening. We didn’t want to have a gazillion people throwing their ideas, or trying to help. We are trying to be pretty stealth in what we are doing. 
AS: Were you and your husband always on the same page about what to do in this situation?
RM: Mostly. We were mostly on the same page. We realized very early on, and we have a strong marriage, that we needed to be unified. We would make decisions together. We would talk things through. A little bit of that balancing each other out. I think some of it is probably gender. I was more of the let’s find out what is going on, let’s talk about it. My husband is more “I’m going to sit him down and he’s going to…” [shouting] I’m exaggerating, but it was really helpful that we would talk things through and support each other’s decision. 
It was also important because there were also times that we weren’t both available to make decisions. For example, when he had told his counselor that he wasn’t staying at treatment. Between the time he said that and the time he actually took off, there were lots of phone calls back and forth. When he finally did leave that morning, the counsellor called and said, “He left. We’ll let you know if he shows back up.” I had a major client presentation I had to go on. I could have said something, but I thought, “You know what? There is nothing I can do. My husband is on it as well. We just made that decision right then and there. In the next two or three hours if you have to make a decision, you make that decision and I’ll support you and I won’t second guess it.” 
That was also a really good turning point in our marriage as parents because we continued then for several years to have those points where ideally we would both make a decision, but sometimes we had to let the other one do it. Sometimes it just didn’t make sense because you’ve got other kids, other responsibilities. We couldn’t put our lives on hold every time that something crept up. Which happened a lot. 
By that point I had been going to Nar-Anon which I found helpful. I did a—called Serenity Summer. I did a blog post about that. I started taking Friday afternoons off and I blocked the time out on my calendar and I would sit outside every Friday afternoon from Memorial Day to Labor Day with a pad of paper and a stack of books. And these were things like the Four Agreements and Buddha. I had an abbreviated version of the Tallmud and I’m not Jewish. And poetry books and I had been learning to meditate at that point, too. So, a lot came to me during those periods of meditation, which I never realized. That brought me a lot of serenity and peace. Being able to weather what was—during that first chaos. Well, it wasn’t the first chaos. During that first chapter I really did find that Serenity Prayer helped, being able to stop. 
It was also during that period of time that being a writer professionally, or at least that is part of my job in public relations, that a paragraph came to my mind. That paragraph began the start of Our Young Addicts and some of that writing. I think it was because in my mind I would always frame things like worst case scenarios: what would happen if I had to announce that he had overdosed and died? What would happen if we had to share things with the family? What would happen if—? I know that is a sad thing, but when you work in my field we deal a lot with crisis and being prepared with those statements. Same kind of thing. I framed things in my mind in terms of how would I—
AS: Convey this message?
RM: Convey this message. So, this kind of paragraph came to mind for me around what was happening. At the time I didn’t really know that I was being told by whatever that I was getting a message to write and do this. Interestingly, shortly thereafter, that’s when I ended up sending emails to the Pioneer Press and to Renew magazine and basically saying, hey, nobody is telling the story of what it is like to be stuck in the muck.
AS: As a parent. 
RM: As a parent. From this perspective. They said, “Write about it.” And I started writing about it. Nobody ever wants to be on this path. I wouldn’t wish it for anybody. I think only if you have been on this path can you appreciate what I’m about to say now. Only if you are on this path can you appreciate the gifts you have gotten in any other way. The relationships that I have made, the self awareness and understanding, the life lessons, sense of gratitude, sense of—lots of things like that. I have looked back and I feel like I am richer because of it. I’m sure that is true of all kinds of scenarios with other diseases and other things. I feel like I grew through this process. I don’t look at anybody the same anymore. I teach downtown.
AS: What do you teach?
RM: I teach public relations and communications. When I get to campus early, sometimes I will see homeless people. Maybe they have stopped in the student center and they are sitting at the table, or I see somebody at the bus stop or I see a kid. I now think about them differently. Where are they from? What was their childhood? What is happening in their life? What kind of help do they need? Or maybe I run into a frazzled parent and I don’t know what is going on. I don’t judge them anymore because I’m like I wonder—something is happening. It is probably not about the interaction that we are having. 
There’s also—I’ve noticed, and I’ve blogged about this one too—there is a silent language. I wish, and maybe through this project it will happen, more people will talk about what is going on. We were always pretty open. I wouldn’t just start telling the details. But if people asked me I didn’t shy away from what was going on. There is kinda this silent language and you will be at lunch with somebody and you will ask about their kids and you will get this, “Yeah…” And they don’t answer the question. And you can let it pass, but now I’ll start being like “There was a time I used to answer that question in that way. It was because, and I’ll tell why,” and oh my gosh will they open up. They gave me a clue, I gave them a clue, and then they made a decision to either share or not share. Like, “Oh my gosh, that is happening in our family, or that happened in my family or that happened in my neighbor’s family. 
Overall—let's get to the stigma word. Overall, we did not experience a lot of negativity in that realm. There were certainly some families that we would talk to that didn’t want to believe it kind of thing. Or minimize it or change the subject. But, not any like, “Oh, that’s the McKinney family,” or, “We don’t want to associate.” None of that. 
There were people that, they would ask how are things going and they wanted to hear the “Great!” or “Guess what! Things turned around! He’s better!” I think they would get tired of they are even shittier than the last time, and I would tell them and they would be sorry they had asked. I would get some of that. But not really any of the negative stigma persists. 
AS: Why do you think that? Have you thought about why that would be for your family in particular? 
RM: I think two things. With people that were in our lives at the time during Ryan’s high school years, they witnessed how hard we were trying to get him help. How hard we were trying to figure out what was going on. I think they had more of a sense of appreciation. That didn’t seem to enter into it from people that didn’t know us. As I said, I think we are at a changing point now. Maybe it is just the time that we came into this where there is a lot more of the, “Yeah, I’ve been through it, I know someone’s been through it.” There is just a lot more, I think, acceptance. That doesn’t mean that it is better yet. It is no longer a surprise anymore for somebody to say they are dealing with addiction in their family. A few years ago I think that was still the thing. 
Again, I think how we talk about it matters, too. I think if we talk about our experience in honest terms then we send a really positive message and allow people to respond. If we use stigmatizing language, if we use stigmatizing negativity other people come back to that as well. Or, if we don’t and they use that “they are just a useless junkie” I think we can role model or counter that. We may not be able to change them or their language or perceptions, but I think we are finding, maybe it is just a Minnesota thing, we are finding that people here are embracing and being a community and talking about things. It is a much more open conversation today. 
AS: I want to talk more about that but I also want to back up to talk about your experience as parents in the treatment world. In family programs, how you as a mom became engaged in your son’s recovery process. Not just you personally, but how did professionals engage you and what was that experience like?
RM: Overall, we worked with some really good professionals. They cared; they were good at what they did. They were what you would hope. I feel like there were enough unique things in our situation in terms of just how much in denial our son was, how much he could convince people that nothing was going on. Sometimes we would get to a point with a particular professional where, “I don’t know what to do!” because he wasn’t following the model. 
AS: He didn’t fit the mold of the addict.
RM: So that would be difficult. Again, one of the challenges, because he was over eighteen at this point, before we got him into any programs is that he wasn’t signing release forms. Therefore there wasn’t a lot of access—that frustrated me as a parent to no end. A) we had information, B) we had insights, C) we needed to be part of the success; part of the process. Sometimes I felt very shut out by that. They would say, “Seems like things are going really well now.” And I would go, “Really? Because that’s not what I am experiencing!” It is a challenge of the system because when they are working one on one with a client they are that client’s advocate. They are not the parents’ advocate. 
Sometimes there is a divide between what is going on, and I felt like a lot of times they wanted to change us or make us change or have us accommodate things. It’s like, you know what? Truly we’re not perfect, but up until that point of junior and senior high school there had been a good relationship and things had been going well. Really where the communication disfunction happened was in the drug induced state. So, no, we were not at our best at all. That was not our main operating style. That would get kind of frustrating. 
Even in the Al-Anon world, many positive things to say about that but, okay, work on yourself. Okay, cool. But I have a crisis or a chaos thing here. I have someone who needs help, I have someone that doesn’t realize they need help. They could die. Cool, but I should make my list of amends and take care of my things so I can take care of myself, but what I really need is someone to get my kid in treatment and help my kid stay in treatment and help him be successful.
AS: While you felt supported in some ways as a parent or mother you weren’t supported in the ways that you really needed to be. Did this lead you to creating Our Young Addicts?
RM: I felt like I wanted to share this experience because I knew we weren’t the only ones going through it. I have really found a lot of things elusive in terms of information. You Google something and you get something that was completely irrelevant. All these places had bought up all the search terms and you look up ‘Minnesota this’ and you get some place in California and you Google non twelve-step and you get some place in Florida that is a twelve-step. I did feel like I wanted to try to create something where people could find information and share perspectives. I don’t think there is one right way. I think that we need to know what our options are so that we can try different things. If this doesn’t work try this. If this doesn’t work try that. Certainly for my son, it took different tries to find something for him. Then there is the readiness side, too. It wasn’t that the approaches were bad, he just wasn’t ready.
Let me go back to professionals. There were two that stick out to me that were just kind of terrible. One, we had been talking with an intervention group and thinking that that might be a way to get my son to go to treatment. At the end of the day, in our gut we didn’t feel like that was going to be the right approach. In fact we thought that might create a greater wedge. We were getting hesitant about moving forward. At that point, the professional that we were talking with started attacking me and saying that I was in denial about my kid’s problem and that I was preventing him from getting better. It was—we walked out of that meeting and never looked back. I was irate. What they were trying to do, because then it was if you don’t want our intervention services then we need to get you into our family program because you need help. You need to heal your family. I said, “You know what? I’m going to Al-Anon, I’m seeing a therapist, and I’m really happy. And I’m doing my Serenity Summer, I’m really happy!” [laughs]
We had another one where, again, Ryan didn’t want these traditional methods, he wasn’t interested in twelve-step. We thought you can’t force somebody into something. He had gone into this outpatient program which had a harm reduction philosophy. I didn’t entirely understand it and I think harm reduction is a tough concept for parents because we think and know they need to quit. At this point medication assisted [treatment] was not being introduced as a part of this harm reduction. It was more we will meet you where you are at. If you are using you can use and we won’t kick you out. He was taking advantage of this program. 
We had had a ton of psychological evaluation that really gave a pretty clear picture of what we thought was going on in our son’s life. We gave it to the treatment program and they said they wouldn’t even read it or consider it. They said, “He doesn’t have any of those psychological problems.” And we said, “We think he might be having a dual occurring—and here’s why,” and she said, “I don’t put a lot of credit in that stuff.” I was irate that she would not even consider another professional. She said, “I can do my own evaluations.” You don’t have to agree with it, but why wouldn’t you at least acknowledge the work of a colleague? Just to get another perspective on things. At that point it became a wedge between family and my son where I felt like it was them again us. That’s just not—I’m saying we want to work together. And crazy stuff too: “He doesn’t feel like you are supporting him. You should let him come back home.” We never said he couldn't come home but these are the conditions. “He says he wants to go back to school.” No shit he doesn’t want to go back to school! I finally said, “You pay his tuition? Because we’re going to be flushing money down the toilet to pay tuition. He won’t go to class. You want him to go live at your house? Okay fine, live at your house. You leave your wallet and purse out. You leave your son’s birthday money within grasp and you see what happens. Leave your car keys out and see if the car is there.” Those are terrible things to say about your own kid. 
AS: That’s where you were.
RM: That’s the craziness. You are asking us to bring chaos back into our home. We have a younger kid. We can’t do this. There are some times—I understand the restraints of eighteen plus and privacy and releases, and part of Our Young Addicts is that we are a community. We need to surround this young person with all kinds of things. It is not just treatment and recovery and relapse prevention. We need to surround them with love and we need to surround them with nutrition and we need to surround them with living and we need to surround them with lots of things. 
AS: When did you start Our Young Addicts, and why do you keep doing it? Then maybe you can tell me about your son’s recovery? 
RM: Informally, it started with some writing that I did in 2011 for the Pioneer Press. That was a biweekly column. At that point I was posting as RM: Real Mom. I wanted to be completely honest, but at the same time protect identity. That was the best way to do it. Not use any names but be completely open about everything else that was happening. 
At that same time I was interacting in an online parenting forum. There were several moms and dads and we were posting and supporting each other. The person who facilitated the forum was moving out of the country and she was going to shut it down. She said, “I’m shutting this down. I encourage you to exchange your contact information if you are comfortable.” A few of us did and one other mom and I in particular said, “We should start blogging or tweeting or doing something.” We started with a little bit of blogging and we came up with okay, these are our kids, these are our addicts. Shortly thereafter she decided it wasn’t quite for her, and so I kept it up and started the tweeting and started doing more. It started out as an opportunity to take that Pioneer Press column and get it to a bigger audience. 
Over the past two years, really, as Ryan has been in recovery, I started to formalize it a little bit more in terms of, okay, I write about our experience. I have guest bloggers. Started doing things in schools—conference, building resources, being more of a hub. 
The reason that I continue to do it is A) our journey is not over. I think there will always be something there. More importantly, it’s about experience and letting people share their experience so others can take something from that. It’s about sharing resources. “Hey here is something that worked for me.” Or, “Hey here is something I heard about. I never used it but maybe check it out.” And hope. I use that phrase a lot. When you are stuck in the muck you have hope, but you really have to continue to keep the hope alive. 
I was talking to another mother yesterday. Have you talked to Gloria Englund? I was talking to her yesterday and one of the things she said about grief was there are two places for it in this scenario. There is the grief when you realize your kid is going down this path and that the dreams and hopes that you had for this kid, that they had for themself, are no longer possible or are not current. And then of course there is the tragic grief when that kid passes away. I think I experienced a lot of that first grief. Our whole familiy did. When the kid that we knew and loved was unhappy and in dire straits and struggling and not behaving. The behavior is a symptom.
AS: And unable to help himself.
RM: And unable to help himself. Unable to see the problem. There is a grief there. It was during that point of grief that I was finding sources online, or not finding sources online. Going to Al-Anon meetings and talking to people and writing. To me, I think that the feedback that I’ve gotten is that it is very approachable. It is not pushing one particular perspective. It’s also showing people through our experience that it is possible to continue your life and to not get gobbled up by this. Keep that possibility alive that recovery is possible. No matter what happens you can make it through. You can keep on. I realized that two years in July is a huge milestone. I have every confidence that this is going to continue. Yet, I also rationally know that addiction, and particularly the opiate addiction, is fragile.
AS: The recovery is fragile?
RM: Yeah. Or you hear about people decades later having a relapse. There is always, I wouldn’t call it fear, but there is always that little possibility that this path might detour. 
AS: Right. It is having fought cancer or being diabetic, that you are always aware it could come back if you don’t do certain things. With cancer you can’t know. It really does help to think of it long term. This is my journey as a mother with this child. This is what it is. This is how it’s played out. And you have to figure out a way to move forward in grace with that.
RM: Our Young Addicts are a community of—and professionals. That is really important to me. It’s not just parents and it’s not just professionals. So, to the conversation we were having a few minutes ago, sometimes because of the constraints you can’t have that open conversation with the professional because they are working with your kid. But, you could have a conversation with another professional and get their weigh on it.
AS: Who is not working with your kid.
RM: And you might go, “Oh, now I understand what they might be thinking, or here is something else that I could try.” I think it’s really important to foster that parent professional relationship. 
AS: Outside of the context of services rendered.
RM: Bingo! That’s it. So this community of parents and professionals is concerned about the number of young people using drugs and alcohol. Depending on the statistic the number is going up, the number is going down, the number is stable. Doesn’t matter. One is too many. No matter where that person may be on that spectrum: I just found out my kid used marijuana for the first time. Is it a problem? Maybe not. Maybe it is. He seems to be using it a lot. It’s recreational. Ok. Here is what you keep an eye out for. Oh, it has turned into use. Oh, it has turned into abuse. Oh, it might be addiction. We want to get into treatment. Oh, they’ve relapsed. Oh, they’re in recovery. 
I wouldn’t call it a continuum. There is a spectrum of different times and different ways that people are using drugs and alcohol. Again, trying just to give people a place that they can get information and share information. We’re not a support group. We’re not set up to be a support group. More of a sharing community. Online gives people a lot of access. Started locally here just doing some more programming type things. Face to face is also important. You can’t do it all online. 
AS: The parallels in our journeys are very interesting to me. A few years ago I was looking for something like this and thought there was nothing, and started thinking about how could I create something like this. A place where information could be shared and stories could be shared. It’s very serendipitous and wonderful to meet you and see another person with that same desire to share information. Yet, I think about our backgrounds and your PR background actually gives you a whole set of tools and you already have all these tools—
RM: It’s this intersection of personal and professional.
AS: And that is exactly what I’m striving towards. Using my skills as a historian to try and bring some kind of awareness to a situation and document what is happening. 
RM: It’s amazing what families have done. We hear a lot about the mom projects and I know that is where you are focusing. It is absolutely amazing. I think we can and should coexist because each one is a little different in terms of what they are doing, what they are offering, and what they are all about. I do hope somehow someway we can develop a collective parent’s voice. I’m not sure that that collective voice is getting heard yet from a policy standpoint. From a clinical standpoint. That might be a future orientation or iteration of this. How can we take this project and this project and this project and this project? So many of these unfortunately have come through somebody’s loss. They are memorializing their loved one with the creation of something. Yet, unfortunately, if everybody does that, then we have a gazillion of these. 
AS: Which is kind of where we are right now. When you look, when you start digging around online.
RM: Not to minimize—
AS: Shatterproof is scaling buildings with people. I don’t know where to start documenting some of this stuff. It is clearly—there is a need among parents. The collectivism is really interesting. 
RM: I am hoping there is maybe some way to build a coallition of these things. We are each doing something that is different and needed. We are each trying to fill in a piece that didn’t exist before. I think the other thing is that sometimes it is hard for people to find these things. Just like it was for us. Hard to find…
AS: You and I were having a parallel experience in 2011 even. 
RM: I do hear that one specialist that we didn’t work with, I got to know him after the fact. We were talking about support groups and what not and he said, “There is a need for a parent support group that essentially does what Our Young Addicts is doing but in a face to face model. I’m sure I could fill a room for you week after week.” He said, “When you go to Al-Anon its about working on yourself, not trying to solve your loved one’s situations.” And he said, “Parents in particular, they need someone to say, ‘Have you heard about Tapestry? Do you know about this? Have you done this, do you know about this. Not to say, “Here is what you need to do.” Or be able to go in and say, “You know what? My son’s place is suggesting that he do this. What do you guys think?” Because in most of those support groups they discourage any cross talk. And I understand that and there is a reason for that and it is a good reason. But, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a reason for interaction and sharing. 
AS: Especially when your child is under thirty.
RM: I agree!
AS: I notice the benefits of Nar-Anon to some parents whose children are in their thirties and forties and they’re still navigating addiction and there is really truly nothing they can do about their child at this point. Their influence is nill. 
RM: Very true. 
AS: And yet, the parents of younger people don’t—didn’t you also find some kind of relief in those meetings to just feel like I am among people who understand me, who are living in this crazy world, this crazy life. But, yet, when you are in crisis you don’t want to be working on yourself. 
RM: No. Not in crisis. That brings us to another point that might be interesting for your history. The distinction of being a young person with addiction versus an older person. To me, as a mom, as a parent, we have a very different relationship with that person that is using. A lot of the protocols and the practices are really geared toward, I think, adults. Either spouse relationships, or adult relationships.
AS: For best practices?
RM: Yeah. Even for things like detachment and letting go and even setting those boundaries. At eighteen while your kid is legally an adult, if they don’t have the skills and the mental capacity because of the drugs to be doing these things then your job as a parent is not yet done. You have not transitioned them, or they have not let you transition them to independence. So, at a time that your kid should naturally be making that transition to independence and adulthood, they are hijacked by this brain disease that isn’t allowing them to make these smart decisions.
AS: And yet, the law won’t let us override those because of their condition.
RM: I think the same thing is true in a lot of the treatment programs. What happens when you put an eighteen year old, or even a twenty-four year old, in a treatment program with someone who has had decades of challenges with this? Who also has some different things at stake. Their relationship, maybe children, jobs, financial at stake. 
I was leaving a meeting the other day at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge to wrap up some conference things. There were a couple of men and I am going to say they were probably thirties or forties. They were discharging, they were finished, and they were leaving and moving onto whatever was next. They had their duffle bags and one was waiting for a ride and they were saying goodbyes and wishing each other luck. I was thinking about it and I was just in the waiting room and it wasn’t a private conversation. There were somethings I could definitely tell. There were some relationship things someone needed to work with with their spouse. I was like man, they were graduated, I know they are going to have some after care stuff, but they are going back into a situation where they have been absent now for an x period of time. What a challenge. 
Think about it even for our young kids. For Ryan, he’s taking classes at MCTC [Minneapolis Community and Technical College] right now. Doing great. But, the traditional college experience won’t be his. What are you going to do at twenty-four years old? You aren’t going to go be with the eighteen and nineteen year olds in a dormitory. No. That experience is gone. 
I think that in the treatment programs those young people haven’t fully grown up. Their brains aren’t fully developed. They don’t have the perspective on life that somebody older has. We need to see more things that begin to look at how do we help this person at this phase in their life and not throw them in with everybody else? You know what? While there are commonalities in addiction, they are not all the same. Even differences in economic and cultural upbringing. I even remember Ryan saying sometimes, he was staying in a homeless shelter and we would go pick him up and he would get angry because, “People give me such shit that you pick me up in this nice car and…”
AS: Why are you taking a bed? Why are you taking a bed?
RM: Exactly. Or, how do you—you’re sitting in group and you’re listening. Again, some of the research you look at, the adverse childhood effects. 
AS: ACE? A test and also—
RM: Absolutely. But, you know what? Not every kid, and certainly not my kid, experienced those things. How, in a group setting, do you have somebody that is talking about the abuse situation or growing up with the alcoholic parent or these things. Sexual abuse. You’re sitting there going the worst thing that ever happened to me was they took my Nintendo for a week…
AS: Anecdotally, do you think that might—a person from a more affluent background dismissing their drug use? Are you thinking more that young people need to be more placed together with more similar circumstances?
RM: I’m thinking maybe some of the similar circumstance piece, maybe not even similar circumstances, but keeping in mind it’s not one lifestyle. It’s not one experience. You’re going to have a more honest contribution and group conversation if you feel like there is some compatibility in your experiences. You know, I don’t know if I have an opinion on the rest of the question. I think the young versus the old is probably the most important factor to keep in mind. 
AS: For long enough they do end up experiencing some of those adverse childhood, or maybe we can make it average teenage effects because they enter into a very dangerous world. Where many bad things happen to them because of their need for the drugs. The law, sexual assault, selling themselves.
RM: Violence.
AS: Violence, being beat up, being abandoned. There is just so much that the drug experience of being an active addict creates adversity.
RM: Absolutely. They get in this survival mode. This is the other thing about being a mom and being a parent. We realize, maybe not fully, but we have seen enough on the news and TV to know that they’re entering a very dangerous environment. You don’t want them to. I think that is another reason why we tend to do what the experts call enabling. Because oh my God I can’t let him sleep on the street.
AS: We are so afraid because of the stigma of the people sleeping on the street.
RM: Not even the stigma, but just the fear of what he would become. That he would do that. Ryan has talked about—well when you are walking around and you have no place to stay, you might as well do it high. Because you are feeling so bad. You don’t feel like there is anywhere for you to go or call. The places you can go you don’t have transportation to. I do think about, and I feel terrible, I feel terrible about how terrible he felt a lot of times. The first time he didn’t have a place to stay. The first time—you know? A lot of those things. And, certainly, maybe not the safest to be around. Again, no stigma toward those people or judgement. They landed where they are for whatever reasons too. But it doesn’t change the fact that they are not a good influence, or that they are not safe.  
AS: Is there anything else you want to talk about?
RM: We covered a lot. 
AS: I just wanted to ask a final question. What impact did you have on Ryan ultimately getting into what is now almost his two years in recovery? Did you have any? Going back to leading the horse.
RM: The story there was he had gone to a residential program, inpatient. It was the first time he had made all the arrangements and he had recognized that he needed to change and that kind of stuff. Then it didn’t fully work. We knew that when he was discharged that he wasn’t fully engaged and that he wanted to get back to at least smoking pot. No. That’s not going to work. The halfway program he was in had a lot of, not a lot of supervision but a lot of rules. Talk about the dichotomy. Things didn’t work out so well for him and he relapsed. Pretty hard and pretty fast. We were getting worried. At this point we did a family intervention. He said, “Thanks, but no thanks. Not today. I know I need to do something but this isn’t it.” 
At that point he was so fragile and we were so concerned and the interventionist said you ought to set up the boundaries. We went the opposite direction and started saying, “Do you want to stay here tonight? Do you need a shower? What do you want for dinner?” He was staying home more and more often. It was a revolving door. Things got to be pretty bad with the revolving door because we were back where we were in chaos. Some money went missing again. It was, I think it was July 9th, he had come home, we were out, and our younger son texted us that he just came home and what should I do? We said, “Let him in,” and he said, “I did and I don’t think anything is going to happen. He’ll probably shower and eat something and fall asleep.” 
We are driving home and thinking about what we are going to say. We are kind of going through what we are going to do, and we get home and we start having this conversation with him and it’s clear in the middle of this conversation that he is nodding off. He’s not really participating coherently in the conversation anymore. I’m not sure if he was technically overdosing or close to overdosing or what. We just looked at each other and we were like, “He’s not even here.” We decided it was time to go to bed. We said goodnight and he said, “Yeah, goodnight.” We went upstairs and then I heard him come upstairs a minute later and go into his room and close his door. 
The next morning he said, “What is it you want me to do?” I said, “It’s not what I want you to do. Here’s what you need to do. I said you need to call a place by the end of today and you need to start a program. He went to the office with me that day and slept on the floor under a desk. Typical thing that he had been doing. It got to late in the day and I said, “Have you called any places?” And he said, “Oh no, now probably nobody’s going to answer.” I handed him a sheet of paper. He had been really adament about the three things he wanted. He wanted outpatient, he didn’t want twelve-step, and he wanted Suboxone. I had done a lot of research and it was really hard to find that trifecta. I handed him a sheet of paper with three places and I said, “You need to call these places before we get home, which is in like one hour.” He called one and talked to them for a little bit and said, “No, I don’t think that’s the right one.” I heard him say, “Yeah I guess I could probably get a ride there tomorrow.” I’m like yes you could. The next day was July 11th and we went to Valhalla Place. I think at that point—
AS: Was it Valhalla that he went to?
RM: Yeah, Brooklyn Park. I went with him. I didn’t go with him—he started their outpatient program. He started on the Suboxone. I asked him a couple months later, right before he was wraping up the outpatient program, I said, “What is it about this program that is working for you? And that the other programs didn’t?” He said something along the lines of, “Well, I really like the way they treat me. They are respectful.” Then he kind of quickly goes, “You know it’s not that the other things weren’t. But this was the first time that I didn’t want to go back to using and I didn’t want to go back to the life that I had.”Interestingly, he went to treatment sometimes because he had to. He went to treatment because he needed to once. But the time that worked was when he had to, he needed to, and he wanted to. 
I think that in part, the foundation that we kept throughout this journey of being in contact with him and continuing to tell him that he deserved a better life and that we wanted to help him get help and that we would be there for him. Keeping those boundaries of what we could and couldn’t have in the home. We never wavered from our feelings on it. Knowing that we made the right decision at the right time. The professionals sometimes say this is what you have to do. Well, it depends on the situation. I think we read in his situation at this point two and a half years ago that he needed us to provide him a foundation. If he wasn’t getting sleep and he didn’t have a place to shower and he didn’t have access to food, there was no way that he was ever going to be able to see the way to get better. So he did. So he is. 
AS: That’s great. I’m happy for him
RM: I am too.
AS: Happy for you.
RM: The last thing I’ll say in closing is recovery is not easy either. I’d much rather be dealing with recovery than not. We’ve had to do a lot of, well, the same things you learn during the addiction. Being able to let go, make their decisions, live with the consequences, be there to support but not to enable, and continue to tell them you are proud of them and you love them. Give them the hugs, the encouragement. It didn’t happen overnight. They aren’t going to get better overnight, but the best thing has been the trust returning, the relationship returning. Seeing not one hundred percent the same person that he was, but a lot of the same. Good sense of humor, engaging conversation, the personality. It’s possible. Again, is it possible for everybody? No. But you can’t stop trying. All you can do is keep trying. 
AS: Thanks Rose. 
RM: Thank you. "

St. Paul, Minnesota
Ian McLoone-IM
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I am here in St. Paul with Ian McLoone at Alltyr Clinic. Can you state your name and say you give me permission?
IM: Ian McLoone, I give you permission. 
AS: Thank you. Do you want to start with your childhood?
IM: Sure. 
AS: Where did you grow up?
IM: I grew up here in Minnesota. St. Louis Park mostly. I was the eldest of four kids. I was an overachiever throughout grade school and high school. I was a big athlete and loved playing baseball. 
AS: Can you give an example of being an overachiever?
IM: I always got really good grades, was in the gifted program, was held up as an example in each class. I always had a lot of feedback like that. Positive feedback. I didn’t really get in trouble. I hated getting in trouble. The first ten years of my life my family was really close and loving and secure dynamics at home. I really would describe the first ten or eleven years of my life as idyllic. 
My dad was a professional musician for most of his young adult life. When he met my mother he was going back to school and worked in the field of nutrition and wellness and eventually got an MBA selling weight loss programs to doctors and clinics throughout the country. He was a representative for Optifast or Nutrisystem or one of those things. Novartis was bought by Nestle. 
My mother stayed at home with us. She was almost ten years younger than my dad. When they met he was thirty and she was twenty-one. She had us: me, my sister two years later, my brother after that, and then four years later my youngest brother. 
AS: When were you born?
IM: 1982. Right around eleven or twelve my mom started getting sick mentally. She started having more symptoms of depression and bipolar disorder and got into some drugs: cocaine, meth, heroin, and prescription drugs. My dad was travelling at the time a lot. He would be home every weekend, but he would be gone for a couple days at a time. It must have been when my youngest brother was maybe four or five—I was thirteen or so—and she was spending longer and longer periods of time downstairs in the basement on the computer behind a locked door. I didn’t really think anything of it. 
AS: Were you in charge?
IM: A little bit, yeah. One day she was obviously very emotional and all of us kids were at home. She said, “Stay here, don’t go anywhere. I have to step out, but I’ll be back.” We didn’t see her the rest of the night and my dad was out of town I’m pretty sure. At one point one of our cousins must have come over and hung out. I came to find out later that she was really depressed and in a bad spot and she went to Methodist hospital in the parking lot, slit her wrists—did it the right way so they would take her seriously—and went in for the first of what would be countless hospitalizations and rehabs and stuff. She was sick for several years off and on in rehab, half-way house, stable, fall off, rehab, halfway house. They kind of started to split. Something else happened and they broke up. She stabilized for a while. 
AS: Did you live with your dad?
IM: Yeah. Soon after that she came out as bisexual or gay and was dating women. Again, she got several years of stability. She met this woman and they had a child together. She went back to school and was working on her Master’s and was teaching. I’m in high school and continued to play baseball. I dabbled in drugs and partied and loved partying and having fun, but wasn’t enough to get me in trouble or negatively impact my life. 
My senior year I was the ace of the pitching staff. I had been on varsity for at least two years at that point. We went down to Florida for spring training and it went really well and I played really well. We came back and were playing the season opener against Hopkins at home and I started the first inning and I couldn’t get out of the inning. I was walking people and they were hitting runs off of me and my shoulder was aching. It hurt like hell. I had to leave the game and sat out. I saw a doctor and got an MRI done and learned I had tore the cartilage in my shoulder. That ended my season.
So, I didn’t really think anything of it and I finished school. I had decided to go to University of Oregon. I took a year off and lived in Portland to establish residency so that I could go to the U of O as an in-state student. That was all fine. Meanwhile, my mom and her partner started to fight and not get along. At one point she had a recurence to addictive substance use. Her partner withdrew and took the child with her. At that time gay marriage wasn’t legal and she hadn’t yet adopted the baby. She had no parental rights, period. That just spun her off into a bad place. She ended up getting really sick. Crack and heroin and stuff like that. That was going on throughout my whole college experience. 
My sophomore year of college I came back to get the shoulder surgery done. I was told that if I ever wanted to play catch with my kids when I grew up I would need this surgery to fully heal. I came back for my sophomore year and had the surgery. Up until that point I loved drugs. They were great, but I didn’t do them all the time. I didn’t do them during the day or the week necessarily. It wasn’t getting in my way. I remember doing the surgery and getting out and going to my dad’s house and sitting in the basement and taking an extra dose of Vicoprofen and just loving it. I had one of those moments when the clouds parted and the angels sang and I was home literally and figuratively. After that it was pretty much off to the races. 
AS: What year is this?
IM: ‘03. I was about twenty. From that point on I would buy pills off the street from whoever I could get it from. It wasn’t quite full on dependence, but I had a love of opiates. That continued throughout my junior year. My senior year I did an internship in Costa Rica, so I didn’t really use opiates while I was there. When I moved home I had one semester left. I moved into a house where the guy who owned the house and was going to be my roommate did oxycontin together. I just fell way into it right away. Oxycontin continued throughout the school year. In order to pay for it I had started shipping mushrooms from Oregon to Minnesota because you could get four hundred percent profit. 
AS: What kind of mushrooms?
IM: Psilocybin mushrooms. Magic mushrooms. That wasn’t too much of an issue because my buddies here could get rid of them like that. It was so much easy access there. I would just overnight them in a FedEx box. I hadn’t even learned what the laws were or what was protected. I figured it was mail and people can’t go through your mail. I just figured you could ship it out and no big deal. 
It was fine for a while, but one day I needed cash and I had been doing a bunch of opiates and was not in a good place. The overnight shipping in the box I had packed was going to cost eighty-five dollars. If I could get it into the smaller box it would only cost twenty-five dollars. Being the fucking privileged idiot I was I was just like, “What could even happen to me?” I switched the packaging in the shipping store. Obviously the dude behind the counter saw I was being weird and looking shady and he called the Eugene police department and they came to my house and arrested me. My poor roommate was coming home as they arrived and they asked him if they could search his room—because they only had permission to search my room, and they didn’t find anything. They asked him if they could search his room and he had a big stash. We both got into a lot of trouble. 
That was going on right as I was finishing school. I graduated and a week later that happened. I was out in Eugene with no reason to be there, no family, no job or anything and was just miserable. My opioid use was spiking. Eventually I went back home to Minnesota. My mom had been out of rehab for a while and was dating this guy who had offered to put us up in an apartment in St. Louis Park totally paid for a year. It had two bedrooms and we would each have our own space if I would come home and move in with my mother. I figured it was my turn because my siblings had been doing all this shit the whole time dealing with all of it. It was my turn to come help. 
I did and the best thing to come out of it was that my first week I was there I was out at the Cabooze seeing a show and happened to meet this girl there. She was also into that scene of jam bands and hippies and fun. I was standing along the bar and she thought I was with her friends or knew her guy friends that were there. We started talking, but I wasn’t. We exchanged phone numbers and I called her the next day and we went on a date. Ten years later we are married and have three kids. It turned out well. 
AS: Can you back up to when you got into a lot of trouble? What happened in Oregon?
IM: They let us go that day because we told them that we would find a way to snitch on some people for them. I really didn’t have a dealer to snitch on and the people that I did know I had no interest in doing that to. My roommate though knew a dude who was responsible for more drugs than my roommate was, and he ended up being a confidential informant. In return we both got light sentences. We were charged together and we both negotiated this similar light sentence. It still was a Class C felony, which can be expunged. I had to do three years of probation here in Minnesota. I had to go back out there and serve a week in jail and do work release and community service stuff. That was a full year later I want to say. Felony on my record really made life uncomfortable and was a big pain in the ass. I had to go meet with the probation officer every month. It was not good. 
AS: How long did you continue using when you moved back to Minnesota?
IM: I moved back home and I continued using oxycontin for several months. The guy I got it from one day told me he didn’t have any more oxys but he did have black tar heroin. I smoked it and it did the same thing that oxycontin did. None of the horror stories came true. I didn’t die. It was identical almost except that it was a fraction of the price and way easier to get. From that point on I switched to heroin and smoked heroin for the next couple of years. Then I shifted over to intravenous use for the next while. 
Things got really bad. My wife didn’t know I was doing it for a long time. I would just lie to her about it. When she finally find some tin foil with the big black lines on it I told her it was opium. That worked until she found needles and then I had to tell her I was doing heroin. We would have a big fight and tell her I would swear it off and that I was going to change and I wasn’t going to do it anymore. The next week she would find more needles. We got married and then bought a house and then had our first child and the whole time I was lying and trying to hide it. 
It all came to a head in 2010. I had been going to the methadone clinic, which was helpful, but then I just started getting heroin and mixing cocaine with it and doing speed balls and fell in love with that. 
AS: But you were on methadone?
IM: I was on methadone, yeah. The methadone would dull the heroin high, but if I mixed cocaine with it it was awesome. I did that for several months and then I lost my job. 
AS: What were you doing?
IM: I was running a food shelf for a non-profit because I was fluent in Spanish. I was the language guy of the agency. 
AS: You managed to hold a job, be married, have a house, have a baby?
IM: Yeah, like I said I was kind of the overachiever. It was really easy, but a big pain in the ass too. It would have been a hell of a lot easier if I wasn’t putting a needle in my vein three times a day. My employer had gotten suspicious and I was taking long lunch breaks and spending a lot of time in the bathroom. I got a new job at another non-profit and within the first week they knew something wasn’t right with me. They let me go and I was on unemployment for the summer. My son had been born in January and we had moved into the house earlier in November and I was on unemployment and my wife was working. She had to go back to work sooner than she had planned because I wasn’t working. I was taking care of my son half of the time because we had this other half time daycare that was essentially free. I got so sick. I spiraled. 
It all came to a head one afternoon in the summer when we had some family friends over for a barbecue. I still needed to make another purchase of heroin for a buddy of mine that night. My friends were over and the guy I was getting heroin for was in another part of the city, but my dealer came through. My big plan was that I was going to pretend that I was cleaning off the grill out in the alley and my friends were in the backyard so I would just go around the garage and hop in the car, buy the heroin, and hop out, come back out, and have the clean grill and everything would be fine. We are sitting there and I didn’t think anything of it. All of a sudden one of my neighbors walks by down the alley. Right across from us this big conversion van is there and the door slides open and this whole swat team comes out and arrests my neighbor. They subdue him and then one of the sargeants comes over and says, “You! What are you doing? What were you doing in that car? You come over here. Get on your knees.” There is a shotgun in my face and my friends are all like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Did you know he was doing this? Did you know?” They patted me down, found the drugs, and arrested me in front of my wife’s really good friends. 
I went to jail and spent a couple of nights in there. My wife, bless her heart, she worked her ass off and got me an attorney and the attorney got me out. She had even put money on my commissary so they gave me this check for forty bucks on my way out and I was like, “Cool.” I cashed it at the bank, met up with my drug dealer, came home, and I wasn’t welcome at home. I had to leave. For the next three months I spent it worming my way back into my house with my wife and then getting caught using and then having to go to my dad’s house and worming my way back in. She kicked me out one night and my dad wouldn’t let me come home. That was the moment when I had to make a choice. He was just like, “Dude, come on man. Stop what you are doing. You’ve got a kid and a wife and things you’ve got to do.” I said, “Okay. If I go to rehab will you let me stay at your house tonight so I don’t have to sleep on the street?” The next week I did a Rule 25 Assessment and I went to Eden House. Do you know about that?
AS: No. I have heard of RS Eden, but tell me more. 
IM: Have you heard of the Synanon group? They were the original therapeutic communities developed in the late fifties but mostly in the early sixties and seventies. They break you down and then build you back up. King baby, hot seat on the bench. 
AS: These are those people? What is king baby?
IM: Somebody who acts like a baby but thinks they are the king. It is really fucked up. Back in the day they would shave your head or put you in a diaper if you were king baby. At Eden House they would do that back until they got in trouble for it in the seventies. They had to tone down some of the blatantly abusive stuff, but everything else horribly abusive. From day one they were pressuring me to come off methadone. They really wanted me to stop the methadone. I wasn’t really sober and it was Hitler’s drug, all that shit. They never explained to me what the research says or science or getting my consent. It was just old school nonsense SynAnon bullshit. 
AS: What year was this? 
IM: 2010. I bought into it. A lot of it was prison mentality. You have to go along to get along, but on the side people are doing drugs and smoking fake weed and doing shit like that. I worked my way up in the hierarchy of the clients and was the executive client or whatever. The main client. I would be the chaperone for things, or I would lead meetings. 
AS: You were on the good side.
IM: Yeah. I was the ideal client, but I was also smoking fake weed and acting a fool and playing along but acting both sides. One day one of the other clients had a pass and I was his chaperone. We went to his house and it was pretty uneventful. At the last minute he asked me to give him a ride back to rehab. We had to be back by seven. His dad said, “I’m not giving you a ride.” We took a bus and went back home and explained what happened. We were an hour late or something. We submitted a UA [urin test] and they were negative and everything was fine, or so I thought. 
The next day was my pass and it was my son’s first birthday party. I went home and we had a birthday party. Family and friends were there. It was a little odd because I was still in rehab, but everything was okay. I get this phone call midway through and the guy on the line said, “Hey, you’ve got to come home now. Your pass is revoked and you’re on ban. You come home right now.” I was like, “It’s my son’s first birthday party and I’ve got family and friends here. It’s kind of a big deal.” He said, “I don’t give a fuck. Come home now.” I excused myself, went home, and then I was put on the bench for the next three days. 
AS: What does that mean?
IM: That means you sit on a literal bench out in the hallway. You can’t participate in groups, you can’t visit with any of the other clients, you can’t attend lunch and talk to people. At the end of the day you have to go straight to your room. You can’t watch television. You’re on ban. You’re persona non grata. The only group that you can attend is your primary group, but all the other groups you are banned from. 
AS: This is because you came back an hour late because you couldn’t get a ride?
IM: Yeah. It didn’t make sense. When the program director came in that Monday she was like, “I can’t be co-dependent. I can’t let you let my feelings about your son’s first birthday dictate how I make a decision on this matter. You have to be on ban and on the bench until I say so.” I think that was the moment that I became utterly fed up with that model. It felt like in my heart that there had to be another way. 
AS: Had they managed to get you to get off of methadone?
IM: I was tapered way down. Usually what they do is you taper down to thirty miligrams and then you stop for a couple of days. Then you take suboxone for a couple of days, and then you’re done. I was down, down, down, down, and actually that weekend before I was supposed to make the transition off my mom came to visit. We sat down and she was like, “Ian, why are you so antsy to get off methadone?” “Everybody says I need to get off of it and that I’m not really sober if I do.” She said,  “Dude, do you know the science about it? It is incredibly effective. All the messages you’re hearing is stigma. It’s not grounded in truth.” She said, “Ian, you’ve got a baby. You’ve got a wife. You’ve got a life to take care of and a house and all these things. People are rooting for you. You have one chance to get this right and you should use every tool at your disposal and take advantage to make this most likely to be successful.” I was like, “Oh, yeah. I am happy when I’m on this stuff. It does make me feel normal and fine. I can sit and do things and be a human being. Why am I in such a rush?” I held off on that to their great displeasure, but I stuck to my guns.
AS: How long were you there?
IM: Four months. At the end of four months I moved into the sober housing that they had and would just come for groups all day. It was pretty much the same I was just living in a different location. One of the kids that was in the program got busted for drugs or something. They cornered him and made him write a list of all the people that he had ever heard of doing drugs or fucking around. My name came up as someone who had done the fake weed. They confronted me about it and thought I was injecting drugs while I was there. I hadn’t, not at all. I did cop to smoking K2. They kicked me out. 
I was going to go into longer-term sober housing, but because that was no longer an option I was able to go back home to my wife and our kid. It ended up being such a blessing in disguise. I just had to find another continuing care plan so that my probation officer didn’t kick my ass. I did and I did evening outpatient at Fairview and completed it and it was fine. Somewhere around there I decided I would go back to school and pursue a Master’s degree. Right around that time I found the University of Minnesota’s Addiction Studies program. I got into that and loved it. At the end of my second semester the program director announced that they were doing an Integrated Behavioral Health Master’s program. A full Master’s degree. I was admitted in the first cohort of student in the program, and she had gotten a grant from the state to develop a center of excellence for the study and dissemination of practice in cocurring disorders. She offered me a graduate research assistant position. That paid all my tuition, a good wage, and I had some incredible experiences. 
AS: What made you want to go into addiction medicine? I just want you to articulate that a little bit. I know it is implicit, but you talked about the Eden model and Synanon. 
IM: I had two felonies. First of all I thought there was no way I was getting a job doing anything else, but I could get a job being a counsellor. I think the experience at Eden House really made me question the conventional wisdom that was driving not just the program at Eden House, but everything that you would hear among people in recovery. How AA was the only way, it works if you work it, it is one hundred percent effective if you just do what you’re told. The whole time I am going to AA meetings, but I’m not able to disclose that I’m on a medication and I go to work with a sponsor and he tells me to get off of it, and it was all messed up. When I found the addiction studies program and got into my first couple semesters I realized, “Holy shit. None of that shit that people talk about in meetings and in rehab that I went to is grounded in science. It is all lore. It is all mythology and it doesn’t stand up to scientific scrutiny.” 
That was really motivating. As I was working in my graduate assistantship I started to become aware of some other folks in the field who were doing things. That’s when I met Paula DeSanto and was just floored by her approach and the way she looked at things. That was my favorite class that I took in my whole graduate program. She stopped teaching at the U, so they just asked me if I would teach that class. I will get to teach that, which is pretty cool. I read an article on thefix.com and this doctor was being interviewed about medications and why there is such stigma against medication. I was reading through and going, “Good point! Yeah! This guy knows what he’s talking about.” I scroll down and I click on his name and look at the link of his clinic and it turns out it was in St. Paul, Minnesota. I said, “What the hell. It wouldn’t hurt if I sent him an email to see if he would want to have coffee and I could pick his brain a bit.” 
I met Mark Willenbring in 2012. We had lunch together and I was just enthralled and fascinated by what he was talking about. I asked if I could shadow him and hang out and learn from him. He ended up overseeing my clinical internships and then once Alltyr Clinic got started I started very early on seeing his patients and doing therapy and counseling. After I got licensed I had a half a day here and the rest of time at traditional rehab. Over time I ended up working with Melanie Heu at Pangea Care. They do culturally specific programming and different language specific tracks. I helped to develop the Spanish language track there. While I was there I had maybe a day or two days a week and then over time built up my caseload here. I built up my caseload over there and two years ago this coming August I moved over full time here. I have been full time here ever since. 
AS: What is the model here?
IM: We are an addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. In the continuum of care there is a gap of services. If you go to your primary care doctor’s office and you screen as a heavy drinker and your primary care doctor wants to help you get some help historically they probably would just have a rebah that they could refer you to. The problem with rehab is that the educational and professional requirements of the staff of a rehab are notoriously very minimal. Very few doctors are going to want to refer their patient to a counselor who has got a GED and intrust their medical care to a doctor. Most patients don’t need or wouldn’t meet the criteria for long-term intensive rehab in a residential setting. If you have a sleep disorder your doctor is going to refer you to a sleep specialist or a neurologist or a neurology clinic or a sleep clinic. If you have schizophrenia your doctor is going to refer you to a first episode psychosis clinic or a mental health clinic. Up to this point there has not existed a medically anchored addiction psychiatry specialty clinic. We are trying to fill the gap on the continuum of services. 
We have psychiatrists on staff, we have a nurse, we have four Master’s level trained counselors, and we provide fully integrated treatment for substance use and all mental health disorders under the same roof with the same clinicians. Every patient that comes into our clinic gets assigned a primary therapist and primary physician. The first in-take evaluation you spend an hour with a therapist gathering history, finding out course, severity, symptoms, and past treatment. Then you spend an hour with the addiction psychiatrist where you really dig into the important stuff and develop that first initial treatment plan. If a patient needs a high level of care like a structured living setting and additional support than what we can offer in a patient clinic setting then we have partners that we can refer them to to get sober housing and LINE and IOP [intensive outpatient treatment] if necessary. 
We remain the constant in the patient’s team over time. We’ve got patients that work with us for a month and patients that work with us for five years. It all depends, but it’s not a set program. All patients’ treatment plans are individualized. As things come up or the facts on the ground change, we change our treatment plan using the latest, best science and research to form our approaches. 
AS: How many clients are you serving right now?
IM: I’m not sure. That’s a good question. I don’t know off-hand. We have a research assistant right now that is crunching numbers and things like that. Since we have opened it is over three hundred I would say.
AS: And that was just a few years ago?
IM: Yeah. A couple of summers ago Julie Rehovet who was the program director for the IBH [Integrated Behavioral Health] program until recently asked if I would be willing to teach a course with Dr. Willenbring. We taught psychopharmacology together. They had it the next semester but it didn’t really go well. The instructors didn’t really do a good job and she offered me the gig to teach that. I have been teaching psychopharmacology for a little while. Like I said just recently they wanted to start teaching the synthesis seminar in client centered care—Paula DeSanto’s class. I’m going to give that a go this summer and see how that goes. 
AS: How did things resolve with your wife? How did she deal with your addiction?
IM: It was so fucking hard. I was such an asshole to her. I really feel badly. 
AS: You still feel badly?
IM: I put her through the wringer. She did not sign up for that. All I could really do was work my ass off to try to repair things and make things better and be responsive. I’m madly in love with her and she is the love of my life. 
AS: There must be something more there on her part too because you don’t have to stay with someone through addiction. If it is your child it is one thing, but if it is your partner it is different. There is more to you than your addiction. 
IM: Thankfully. She certainly could have cut me loose on numerous occasions. 
AS: Did she find support where she needed it?
IM: No, not really. She went to some Al Anon meetings and some Nar Anon meetings, but it was either WASP-y parents of folks who would talk about spending the weekend on their boat in between meetings, or she was the token wife of an addict and everyone else was there for their kids. That was really tough. 
We have still gone back and forth on maintenance and stuff like that and it has always been an issue. I got off methadone a year and a half ago, but that is always a question. 
AS: Is there still a part of you that has cravings? Because they know now that it is really a brain thing. It’s not some sort of depraved part of you. It is an actual mechanism in your brain. 
IM: Yeah exactly. I switched to buprenorphine. That has been really nice. I got disillusioned going to a methadone clinic all the time. Not because I didn’t like methadone and it wasn’t incredibly helpful. It had really minor side effects. But the system is so over regulated. There are five regulatory entities that oversee methadone. It’s insanity. It is ghettoized. The treatment plans you have to do are junk. 
AS: You can only get it in certain places. 
IM: Yeah. You have to come every four week and you can’t go out of town. Going to my primary care doctor’s office every couple of months was huge. 
AS: Could you describe your typical work day here?
IM: My typical work day is just back to back individual therapy sessions. First of all we are an out of network private pay clinic. We don’t take insurance. We don’t see too many people who are on Medicaid or Medical Assistance. We also really don’t have too many patients that are really wealthy either. There are a couple that I can think of whose families are very affluent. Most of our patients are solidly middle-class working adults. We have some younger patients whose parents are helping them and maybe have come to Minnesota for rehab. Went through the wringer a dozen times and finally found us.  
AS: Do you have a lot of people who have been through multiple rehabs?
IM: I want to say that is probably the majority of our patients. We do have a niche among patients that are on more of the mild to moderate end of the spectrum of [unclear] disease disorders. They come home each night and have three or four glasses of wine and can’t stop. They feel like that is too much and they have tried to cut back and quit and have found that really difficult to do who would never in a million years leave their life for thirty days and go to an inpatient rehab program or spend five nights a week going to a three hour group or doing an IOP program. We have a really solid niche of patients that are working professionals, especially thirty to sixty year old women who work or have busy lives and have struggled with drinking for five, ten, or sometimes twenty years but never found a place that they felt could serve them well. They will initially come in and we will develop a treatment plan which is often some combination of anti relapse medications and behavioral therapy. As a team we will work together and find an approach that works. 
AS: Do people have different plans for how often they come in? 
IM: Yeah. 
AS: That too is very individualized. 
IM: Completely. Often times it is patient driven. If we think that they aren’t coming in enough and they are having symptoms and struggling then we will make recommendations, but it is very collaborative and patient driven. If something isn’t working or they aren’t getting the support they need or are in crisis then we will refer them to Paula or a sober house and get them stabilized. There’s noting magical about the treatment a person receives in in-patient rehab. It is just delivered on-site. Once people realize that it makes a lot of sense. 
AS: What do you see in the future for opioid treatment? What do you see as the best case scenario?
IM: Back in the seventies if you had depression you would go to your doctor and they would refer you to a psychiatrist and nobody wanted to prescribe antidepressants because they were dangerous and had a lot of side effects and there was a narrow therapeutic window. If you didn’t get help from you psychiatrist then you’d be committed for six months in the state hospital and treatment was essentially fresh air and sunshine. In the eighties and nineties there was the Prozac moment. Prozac hit the market and was the first to come of many low side-effects, well tolerated, effective antidepressant medicines. Nowadays, if you have depression the first person you go see if your primary care doctor. They try something and in one out of three people it works on the first try and then if it doesn’t work they try a second one and they refer you to therapy and then maybe a psychiatrist and then maybe if you’re circling the drain and doing really poorly then you’ll go to a hospital for inpatient treatment and ECT [electroconvulsive therapy] for treatment resistant depression. 
If you have addiction the first place you go is the hospital. You go to inpatient treatment for thirty days and then build out from that. All of our treatments were all devised using samples of convenience: those who were hospitalized in a setting who were really sick. All of our treatments were developed for the sickest of the sick. Then we say that is what addiction looks like for everybody. That’s like looking at an asthmatic on a ventilator in the ICU and saying that’s asthma, so we need to devise all our asthma treatments using that as the model for the illness. 
Most of us are hoping to see that the first line of treatment for alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder, and hopefully eventually stimulant use disorder, as being the primary care office or clinic. If the initial treatments don’t work then referring for specialists. What we need is a Prozac moment for alcohol and stimulants. We don’t have anything that is widely adopted, easy to use, and patented so there is a big push to promote it. We have it for opioids. Suboxone is it. If primary care doctors would adopt it it could be effectively treated and managed in a primary setting with little to no stress. For alcohol use disorders we have several effective medications, but they aren’t being widely adopted partially because of the fact that there’s not a big incentive to use them. A lot of doctors don’t know or want to find out about it. 
AS: They also don’t know how to deal with addiction. It will be education and training and getting new people. 
IM: That’s what we are trying to do here as we try to spread the word about this approach. Most of our patients have jobs and families. 
AS: Not to mention the cost of rehab. There’s not just the actual monetary cost, but the cost to the family, employer, spouse, and children. There are so many rings around that model that are disruptive. 
IM: Hugely disruptive. 
AS: Thank you. "

Plymouth, Minnesota 
Kirsten Milun-KM
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS - This is Amy Sullivan and I'm with Kirsten Milun in Plymouth at the Lunds & Byerlys at the second floor at the seating cafe area. It is June 20th, 2017. Thanks for coming Kirsten. 
KM - I'm Kirsten Milun and I give my permission for you to record me. 
AS - Can you start by talking about your childhood and where you grew up?
KM - Well let's see how far back I can go. I was born in Minneapolis at Swedish Hospital. I'm going to try to condense this and give a Cliffs Notes version. At eight years old my parents divorced and I lived with my dad for a long time. And then I went to live with my mom in Illinois then finally lived back with my dad in Sixth Grade. About at that time he married a woman eight years older than I was, and they are still married actually. So that was like four years older than my brother. So they've been married, what, forty years. 
AS - What year were you born?
KM - '63. So I have two younger brothers, Adam and Christopher. Christopher will be forty and Adam is somewhere in his upper thirties. I have older siblings Steve and Heidi. So I would say growing up that way, gave me a sense of wanting to have a real stable childhood for my kids. My parents are good people but things were complicated. You know, my mom, when I lived with my mom, my stepdad had abused her quite a bit and beat her. 
AS - Your dad did?
KM - My step dad. 
AS - Your stepdad. Oh. 
KM - Yeah, not my dad. She actually went from a gentle human being, my dad; an artist, a free spirit, to someone like that because of course that's what she grew up with. Her dad was that way. So all of us, three children, the oldest ones, we really wanted a stable childhood for our kids and we didn't want to show my mom, is an alcoholic. Mmm, I would call her more of a problem drinker. Her sister, my aunt, died of alcoholism. Literally her liver failed. And my cousin, Michael, thirty-six, who would be my age now otherwise, his liver actually split open. I mean everyone in our family dies of alcoholism and so we really wanted to keep things to be stable. I always wanted to show good like, you know, if you drink, you whisper it when they were young, and you didn't do it too excess. (4:10). And just, really I kind of wanted a father who knows best...well, not really, but you know what I mean, [Jokingly]
AS - [Laughs]
KM - because it was always mother knows best. I'm trying to skip ahead here because my kind of focus is I didn't have any dictionaries or anything like that because we had kind of a childhood that was mostly because of divorce and alcohol [sentence unclear]. Divorce isn't a problem it was how they handled the divorce. Mom and dad were really nice to each other but it was just weird. And then dad marrying someone. 
AS - So it got really complicated?
KM - It got really complicated. 
AS - How was it for you getting along with your new stepmother who could've been your big sister?
KM - I was kind of the head of the household because my older sister wasn't quite into that. I was more into care-taking because I was taking care of my dad and making sure the place was always nice. It's just complicated. So she [stepmother] comes in, she would have been twenty-one. 
AS - You were living with your dad before he had this relationship? You were kind of in charge of the house?
KM - Yes. You know our specialties of hamburger helper and tombstone pizza [Jokingly]
AS - Yes [Laughs]
KM - And then she came in and just as is her personality just blasted over everything. She really hasn't changed that personality at all. 
AS - So she was twenty one when you meet her.
KM - My gosh, I can't even believe that she was ever that young. I mean that's really young. I just think, my gosh, that's Noah's age, my youngest child. So dad was nineteen, twenty years older. I probably got along best with her. My brother, four years older, not so much, but we learned to live with it. Of course, now it's been many, many years. I mean now I don't even remember hardly my parents getting married. So then I got married in '86, I'm just going to jump ahead, and I'm still married. [Laughs]. And we've been married thirty years, thirty, thirty one years, so I've been married a long time. The kids had a very stable upbringing. I mean Dick is just like his side of the family, everything is very stable. 
AS - So you did get that? You did find that person?
KM - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I should have looked for other things too, but, just saying [Jokingly]
AS - [Laughs] But you found stability
KM - Yeah, he was stable, and I wanted to be stable, and he was just one of those guys. So the kids' upbringing was very... I mean we built a house in 1991 out in the country and everything was hunky-dory. So the kids were really raised, they were very lucky. 
AS - How many kids did you have?
KM - Three. Amanda will be twenty nine in October. Alex was twenty five last September if he was still alive. [Unclear]. Noah just turned twenty one in November. So I really kind of got a thrill out of being able to raise children. I mean, I didn't realize it would turn out to be really sucky, I mean, it does. It's not easy, you know. It started out and Halloween I would make this special meal for them and their milk was orange and I mean, I just tried to make everything perfect. I really did. 
[Long pause - silence]
KM - The silence means Kirsten's crying. I don't mean to just randomly, it seems they just, in waves of grief, they do this. 
AS - Yeah, well this is hard to tell this story so. 
KM - Usually I speak a lot in crisis too so I'm kind of used to speaking, you know, but, you know. So kids went to Wayzata schools. Everything went really well and you know the story of Alex. 
AS - Well I'd like for you to tell the story of Alex. How did that all start? What happened? What was it like when your kids started their teenage years? What were their personalities like?
KM - Alex, right out of the shoot, was inquisitive, constantly making waves, you know, pushing the envelope. 
AS - He's the middle?
KM - Yes, like he always used to tell me, ""I'm the middle child, I'm the middle child,"" and he was always, always had this shiny, like that top picture you see in the obituary.
AS - The letter. Yeah. 
KM - [Unclear] He was very forgetful all the time. Brilliant. Spoke early. Did everything early. He's just a brilliant young kid, but, man, was he a lot of work. He was a lot a lot of work. He never slept much, he never took naps, whereas his older sister, at noon, she was three hours with that. 
AS - [Laughs] 
KM - Everything was predictable and all that and then came Alex and he was so forgetful that at school I talked to his first grade teachers, team teaching, and I said, you know there has to be, please work with me, this child doesn't need to but he can't remember anything. You know, to bring home anything. And they said, well you know we think the problem is he's so cute. They said because he was adorable, he was gorgeous, and he just had these big long eyelashes and this big white mouth and this shock of white hair. He was so charming and he was never naughty, but man, he just. So I'd give him a ride to school in the morning and I'd take his backpack and I'd get it ready and I'd set it in the garage and I'd say, Alexander, honey, are you forgetting anything? He'd say, no, let's go mommy. I said, honey, think about it, look around you, what do you have everyday? 
AS - [Laughs]
KM - Sure enough I'd have to drive to school leave his backpack. Then I'd watch him run into school, because I knew, because I'd worked it up with his teachers that we'd have to have some consequence of action. Like, oh honey, I'm sorry you don't have your homework in your backpack, but now you're going to have to do it inside. We didn't really know what to do. It just broke my heart you know to see him running him with no fricken backpack
AS - [Laughs]
KM - See everyone else has a little backpack. But he was that way his whole life until the day he died. He was always like that. But he was very charming, entrepreneurial. He went to the, he said I want to sell [unclear]. How old are your children?
AS - Nineteen and twenty three. 
KM - Twenty three. Okay. Well at that time Shinders was a big deal for boys. They'd go to Shinders and get baseball cards or Pokemon cards or these weird little toys that had spikes all over them. So, Alex decided he could get them in bulk. I mean, this is a little kid, and Plymouth Creek, which is just this way a block, buy them in bulk and then sell them to kids for a profit. 
AS - Oh my gosh [Laughs]
KM - And to neighbors
AS - How old is he? 
KM - Grade school, so he was about third grade then, fourth grade. I said, you can't do that. So he asked the principal. The principal said I don't know, I think free market I would've allowed that. So he did it and he would do it to neighbors. He would buy baulk and he would say mommy, drive me to Shinders again. He was just a force of nature all the time. Just absolutely brilliant. [unclear - 13:13]. Sometimes kids like that are a challenge in a lot of ways. And he never stopped talking. He was a great communicator. In Junior High he became star student at West Junior High in Wayzata and then I don't know what happened. Something happened. At the time he got to high school, 4,000 kids, and I don't what that thing was. 
AS - 4,000 students?
KM - Well, in total. 
AS - Wow, wow. Yeah, yeah. 
KM - He changed and I'm not sure what changed him. He began instead of to always be, he was always so happy before that. Hard, hard work, taking care of that kid. But always just happy. I mean, they alway used to say from, if you read his obituary, that he shimmered and he sparkled. And he just did [crying]. He actually had a glow about him. And I'm not just saying that because my kid's dead. Everybody knew that. He still had that but he had a different type of intensity. So instead of getting up in the morning and watching Arthur or whatever, he was studying about what's going on in the world and, you know, what can we do, and I said, Alex, I don't know what we're going to do about _. And I didn't realize that plantation owners who now are, just, it's crazy. [Unclear - 14:30] Alex was pretty well read. And he goes, listen to this song mom, listen to this song, listen to this song, this is so interesting. It's a new rapper and he talks about the injustice of it's like [snores], I gotta go. You know? And so that intensity. So he was kind of losing touch with people in high school because he was so intense all the time. I thought he was being, now looking back, taken over by [unclear 15:02]. And he wasn't doing drugs. I know it sounds like he was but he wasn't, of any kind. In fact, he didn't believe in smoking, drinking, or anything that would ruin his body, almost to the extreme. And he was always very politically involved. 
15:34 (2 hours)
KM - And I'd say well honey why don't you (unclear) and he'd go oh I'm not doing things like that. So we really struggled with him and then he started to get angry. He seemed angry, like he just seemed overwhelmed by things he couldn't change, you know? 
And that was a marked difference. So his dad and I, Alex wanted to go off to college. I didn't want him to because he was so out there and he was so intense and I thought we needed to keep him around a little more even though he was way ahead academically 
and he could do anything. I don't care how smart he is, he, for one thing, couldn't ever find his license, he couldn't ever - I mean, could you imagine a kid like that in college because they're just like [squeals]. Well his aunt is kind of like that. She is, I don't know how she 
did it but she pulled it together man. He would too but his immaturity, his being a boy and they don't really, the frontal lobe isn't fully developed. Well, anyway, he went. 
AS - Where did he go?
KM - University of South Dakota Vermillion. Political Science. He started to get into drinking a little bit I noticed. In high school he didn't care. He didn't even want to go out with people, he would be home with his dad and I. We'd hear so much of ""people are idiots."" 
It's really not like Alex. He was also a very hard worker and all the kids have worked since they were like 14. So Alex, I know as much about what happened when he got there. I mean, lack of access to his grades, them being over 18, he seemed to become even more intense. 
AS - You had a lack of access. You didn't really know what was going on. 
KM - Well, I mean, he wasn't being very forward with us. 
AS - Yeah. 
KM - So he was screwing around a little bit in the beginning, how they do. Drinking and that kind of seemed to stop. But he was always entrepreneurial. He was always doing something to make money in addition to working a lot in school. Then on November 8th, 2000, um. Okay, let me back up a little bit. He was very stubborn. He's also very stubborn and so whenever he would get sick there I'd say, you need to go to the doctor. I'm not a big doctor person but he wouldn't go. I'd say well, Alex, you've had this sore throat forever and every time I talk to you your voice is getting more and more closed up. And he says, no I'm not going to them, they're just all, you know, I don't need them to give me drugs and I can handle this, I'll do the echinacea like we always did as kids and goldenseal and whatever. 
AS - [Laughing]
KM - [Laughs] Right, and you wonder why my kid won't go to the doctor. It ended up we got a call at about three in the morning. That was during the recession. So my husband had lost his job and insurance, so health insurance after all those years.
AS - Oh, yeah
KM - So Alex, they were gonna helicopter him to Yankton and he ended up in [unclear] so you know how sick he was, okay? So they yanked out his tonsils and he actually was very close to death because he was so sick because an antibiotic wouldn't take care of it.
And then he [unclear, 19:40]. So he was always very stubborn that way. He didn't want the doctors dealing him drugs like that. Then, he was an advocate for weed. We had always acted like it was no big deal, and I still think it's no big deal. I really don't. 
I think medicinally it can be really good and blah, blah, blah, blah. What we didn't know draconian (?), our kid was there. In South Dakota. It's like Mexico. You can see what happened to him. I had a hunch that he might've been selling and I just...
AS - When did you have the hunch?
KM - Well we were visiting his dad, see this is why marriages don't stay together after something like this. So his dad and I were with him in Vermillion and Alex goes we gotta make a stop here. So he makes a stop and he goes behind this gas station that's closed and I was like, ""what is he doing?"" and he goes, ""why don't you let up on that kid,"" because I'm very much helicopter. It was always in the kids' business. I tried to be. He was just, ""leave him alone."" I said, ""well, what's he doing back there?"" Well, sure, he was dropping off weed and whatever to a friend. I remember him coming home from a visit and I took him by the hands and I said, Alex, run away from weed. Just walk away, go the other way. He's just like, he always had the perfect smile, okay mom. I go I mean it Alex, I got a bad feeling. Boy, I didn't know how right I was because it was weed. So then I got a call November 8th, 2012. It was Alex. So often things were Alex. He goes ""mom, I'm in jail."" I just remember what I was cooking and I remember how I felt. I said, ""what do you mean? how are you calling me?"" We had a house phone and it was an odd number. He said ""well, it's no big deal."" It was just so awful. [makes a scream]. You know, what's going on. Then I called the bail bonds and I was going to get him out of there. I don't know why but I did. The bail bonds goes, they got your kid for drugs in the school zone and it's almost all school zone. It's almost all school zone. He goes, this happens all the time mam. I'm a bail bondsman, this is rigged. He's just like, wow, unbelievable. They had gotten his work from Belarus (?), and what they had been doing all that time is bugging kids. Micing (?) kids. 
AS - Kids who had other drug offenses?
KM - I mean, it was a huge thing around there. ALex would talk about it all the time. Kids were always going to the pen. 
AS - Like the penitentiary?
KM - That's where Alex was. He had a problem with the justice system and yet he's selling pot. He'd come home and he'd say, man, it is a dirty business, and these are privatized institutions. I'm just like, well, I guess you shouldn't go there, I mean, I don't know. 
I'd just get tired. 
AS - Did he stay in school?
KM - He was staying in school but I mean he would talk about...I was hardly listening in those days because he had so many issues that needed to be addressed; world hunger, I mean, pick a problem, Alex, and then let's focus. But he really had a problem with
the justice system because he saw so many kids going away and they were working for pennies that make Asaba Airlines (?) richer. 
AS - And at this point, how old is he when he calls you in jail?
KM - When he called me in jail he had just turned 21. Because they waited until he was 21 so they could get a bigger sentence. 
AS - To nab him?
KM - Oh yeah. They knew he was selling to friends, friends were selling to each other. They had been micing kids. 
AS - What do you ""they"" had been micing? The police?
KM -The police and the state, and even there it was going to be a grand jury.  The state commissioner, what do you call it?
AS - Like an investigation?
KM - State's attorney, thank you. I mean, but we're finding this out later. At first, I was like, what the heck, ridiculous, right? It turned out that as we get deeper into it, at first I call Alex's other aunt who is a judge under Dayton in St. Paul. She says to me, ""Kirsten, he's going to get a slap on the hand. I mean this is not good, this kid, what the hell is he doing?"" Then she and her husband who is also an attorney, they read through the statutes and how things work in South Dakota. They called and said you got to get him a lawyer and you got to get him a good one because they got him. It just snowballed. It turns out as they said, they had miced him up, and all the other kids that this had happened to. They caught a friend of his and they said if you turn somebody in, just as they asked Alex, well then we'll let you go. (26:02) So then Alex was a good friend and was buying weed from Alex. So they got him on that. They said to Alex too, if you want to turn someone in we'll let you go too. Of course Alex wouldn't do it. His aunt said, Alex there is no honor among thieves. He's like, Patty, these are just kids like me, people like me, and I'm not gonna do to them what they did to me. He said, besides that, if I did turn someone in, which I wouldn't, then when I got to some type of jail, I'd really be screwed for narcing on people. But I'm like, what are you doing? So this guy had to be convoluted when the discovery came out. See now all of this is sealed to him. When this discovery came out, 
AS - You can't access this?
KM - No that's all (unclear - 26:59)
AS - Okay, that's another story. 
KM - It turned out that they also tried to get him to sell narcotics. Alex was always anti-narcotics because they saw what it did to the kids in the town. See, I didn't know what was going on. I didn't even know about how heroin was everywhere. By the time Alex died, I had no idea that he knew. They have him on record, on mic saying, I don't do that. So they're really trying to set him up and trap him. Some kids might have said, I guess I could do that, because they're just stupid kids. But he wasn't that stupid and he just said no. Just weed. Anyway, they picked him up and hired an attorney, and a really good one. So he got picked up in November and then in April was the in front of Judge Eng. 
AS - That's Glen Eng. 
KM - Yes. Before that, we had really been doing our due diligence to have people, everybody that Alex knew, whether it was a professor, people he grew up with at church, all of his jobs, everyone. I mean no one could say a bad word about this guy. He never had a prior, it's in the article, in his life. So we got there and the attorney said, you know, I've worked with Eng a long time and he is a hard ass, but, you know, I think he'll be okay, you guys have written all the letters. My letter was just like [makes fake scribbles while making the sound of a smothered scream] - I had every picture. As a kid he never did anything to hurt, he only wanted to help people. Yeah, he was stupid to do what he did and arrogant. 
AS - He was selling pot. That's all they caught him with. 
KM - That's all. That's all he ever did. There's no question about that. So we got there and he goes, you know Alex, if I can get the transcript you'll be able to see that. He says, you know Alex, a lot of kids come here and they have nobody with them. You have everybody behind you and you come from a state where they think pot should be legalized. I don't think Minnesota ever said that. He goes, so I'm going to send a message, Alex's aunt grabbed my leg, back to Minnesota, and I'm going to put you in the state max security penitentiary and then people were sobbing because nothing good comes from that. For a period of whatever it was, three months, I think he got a month, and then move you to another place. One day in there is bad enough. He was a good looking kid, he wasn't a very big guy, and he wasn't as tough as he thought he was, and he never really thought he was tough but...And then he said you'll be on probation for five years after that. You can't be in a bar unless they're mostly selling food. I mean, nothing. He never had an alcohol problem except for when he had first gotten to drink, other than that he got home for Easter he'd have like a half of beer and it would sit there and get warm. That was my big thing is that my whole family - there are a lot of 
alcoholics - so I was just grateful that none of my children are alcoholics. That's what I was looking for. Alcoholism addiction. Not the other thing. I didn't even know about it. And so he said, if you're so much as even with somebody who has pot or has something (unclear 30:44)...He says we will pick you up wherever you are and send you to the state pen for 17 year, no questions asked. There's not going to be anything before. You'll go from that point to the pen. Alex developed, you know. You can't  live like that. Imagine getting out of there and then always worried that, you know. 
AS - Within those five years you mean?
KM - Yeah. So he developed shingles. Terribly difficult. It was so sad to see that little boy, he was a little boy to me, he was so bright, shiny, and loving. He was dressed real nice and he admitted it was wrong, it was stupid. If that's the law, whether you agree with it or not, you follow it. That's where we brought him up. He's sending a message back to Minnesota. So they took him away and I made a big scene because I wanted to see him. They said, well, you can't see him. He'll go to the pen. I went crazy so they let me see him, and he comes out and his eyes, 
AS - You went crazy like sobbing? Crying? Yelling? What were you doing?
KM - I just said I'm going to see my kid. I was crying, I'm going to see my kid. There was no way I wasn't going to see my kid. That was not going to happen. So I saw my kid. Not his dad. But anyway, Alex came out, his eyes were just red. He was so scared. I mean imagine, at 21, you're going to go to max security. He knew what happened there because he knew other people who had gone. Yet he continued to sell crack. That's that frontal lobe - I'm stupid and arrogant. 
AS - Or, I'm somehow untouchable. It won't happen to me. 
KM - It was crazy. The sentence was three months but they gave him one month.  
AS - So he got out after one month. 
KM - He got out in July actually. No, he had one month at the penn and then they moved him to a place out in Yankton.
AS - For how many more months? 
KM - Until July. So three months total. The problem is, where I met him where he was detained it was like a Barney Fife jail, you know, Andy Griffith. They tried to put him in there. 
AS - For three months!
KM - Right, which would've screwed up everything. It wouldn't have killed him but it would've messed school up, it would mess his job up, he could not pay his rent. I get it. Or they could put him in there and let him out. Or if they wanted to just put  him in that little jail cell and he could just read and do push ups. But no. Not a county thing but it has to be the pen. Then we had to drive home from Vermillion, South Dakota, and we were, all of us, with caravan cars. It's unspeakable, the fear and the anxiety that he must have felt. As a mom, that's what you're worried about. He knew what they could do to him. So then we're going to go to July of '13. That's when he gets out. He was happy to get out. In the meantime, we visited him. We 
couldn't visit him at the pen but we could at the other place. He was just decidedly different. He just [silent]... any life that he had was just gone. He stayed there, 
AS - He stayed in Vermillion?
KM - Yeah, and so all he could do then, was work. School was fucked, right? No school. So he worked, he worked 70 hours a week. He worked at Polaris (? 35:00), he worked at the lumber yard. 
AS - Did he want to come home? 
KM - Yeah. 
AS - Did he want to come back here? 
KM - Yes. They wouldn't let him. 
AS - Who wouldn't?
KM - South Dakota. 
AS - He couldn't come? Oh because he was on probation?
KM - They do what they want to do. He's going to live there otherwise they'd have to move the whole probation thing here. So Alex had a girlfriend who has never even smoked a cigarette in fact and she was going for juvenile justice. She now works here in the cities in Hopkins with Big Brothers Big Sisters as a counselor. Anyways, they were allowed to move back when she got out of school. Then May 29th, 2015 was when they moved back to Minnesota. Then we could get more of an eye on what was going on. Before that she would call us in December of say '14 and she'd say, gee, Alex had mono. Really, Alex had mono? I said, well go to the doctor because he is under our insurance. You don't know what happens when they go to the doctor. Then he'd just keep saying how tired he was all the time. I'm saying, not before that, but December of '14. No clue. I'd come home on (? 36:30), and I'd say, Alex, how can you still have mono? How can he still be tired? He'd say, mom, lots of people have mono for a long time. Yeah he falls asleep all the time and he's sitting. I'm like that's so weird, I wonder if he has narcolepsy. Remember he was having drug tests too all the time, right? 
AS - At Polaris? (?)
KM - No, it's part of his probation. So of course he had urine tests. So drugs weren't part of our thought process. Also, he didn't do drugs.
AS - According to your thought process. 
KM - Right. And not until prison where there's more drugs than he knew what to do with. We got a call one day saying you got to do something about your son. This is Hillary. I said, what's going on? She said, well, they sent him home from work because he was walking around with his eyes closed and drinking out of people's Coke cans and stuff. They said, Alex, there's something with you. There's something wrong with you. So I set up a doctor's appointment but he wouldn't go for that. He's like, mom, she's making a big deal out of it. It was just one ridiculous shit after another. We kinda got it down to PTSD. That was our focus. Get him home, get him home, get him home, get him home. He was so excited to come home. He had landed a job as the lumber yard  manager at the Home Depot in Maple Grove, because he had come down to interview for it and had permission to do that. That was a good paying job. He said, boy, and he had a suspended sentence. So in other words if anything happened, then the sentence would go on his record. If he stayed clean, then it would be suspended. Home Depot, they were glad to have him. He had a lot of experience. He was a brilliant kid. He could look at the plans to a house and figure out exactly almost to the penny. But then, so they get back and he's up and ready to go. I mean, they had rented a house in Medina and he's ready to go and he gets there at 6:30 in the morning or whatever time at the lumber yard in Maple Grove, and they said, well there's a problem with your background check. And Alex just ""hoingggggggggg"" (? 39:00). That really sent him I think into a tailspin. So, legally, they can't even do that but we didn't even pursue that because all these problems were popping up over the summer. So he got another job at Acme Tools, right away.
Everyone in the family and all parts of the family will say that he would be the one to become this and do that, and he here's like look at me, look at what I do, I'm working for some tool place. I said, Alex, all work is good work. You're only however old and you'll work your up and do everything fast and you can go to school. But he had this probation thing over him all the time and remember, we didn't know it, but he was doing drugs, and that would send him for 17 years. So he was always like this. 
AS - Right. Oh, we was doing them so it made him a nervous wreck. 
KM - He was doing them. That's why he was falling asleep. We just didn't know it. It's like Alex, you're good to go. It's just, you're in Minnesota now. 
AS - Yeah, everything's great honey. 
KM - Minnesota's great and they're not as weird as South Dakota. He said, yeah but... And I said, Alex, for God's sake, everything is going to be fine. Yeah, unless you're doing opioids and they catch you. It was the summer of just ups and downs and Hillary called me one day and said, Alex didn't go to work. That's unheard of. Alex never missed work. Ever. She said, I don't know, you better talk to him. He came over, and I said, what's going on? Why are you missing work? He said, mom, I just, I was just so tired. He said I'm really having trouble sleeping. And it's like, oh, well, we're already sending him to a psychologist who couldn't do anything for him. It's like, okay, but you miss work again...That guy, he's like, I know, he goes, I can't believe I didn't go to work. I said, you've never been tired. You wouldn't even sleep when you're alone. And he's just kind of looking at me like you know, I want to tell you but I can't. That kind of look. I know it now. Now I know. One day, I was home in the afternoon and he says, mom, I'm home early 
because they're re-doing the floors, can I come over? And I'm like, sure! Then he's just sitting there like this [makes slumping noise with body] [silence]. I'm like dude, do you want to talk to me or do you want to talk to mom? He's just looking at me for a long time and then he looks outside. He said nah, I gotta get going. He was going to tell me. He had a lot of time to work through what he was going to tell us. He asked his dad to go on a boating trip down the river. He couldn't go overnight. Probably because he couldn't do drugs, right? Dick said all day long Alex was just like he wanted to say something but he never did. We heard later from Hillary because Hillary knew before we did. So, anyway, it was just that kind of summer.  We tried to do fun family things - let's go to this winery in Delano. Yet then Alex would get going on this spiral of [silence] how bad the world is. Like he did when he was sober and not using, only now it was just really convoluted. We were all just like, oh my God, just want to go home. He gets out of the car and  he goes I'm sorry, I ruined everybody's night. We're like, dude, you didn't. I say dude because he did. You didn't ruin everyone's night. He's all teary-eyed, right? In a way I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy because I'm like, can you come on? What are you? You know? Can't you just find something good about the world? He wouldn't just feel this PTSD. We were just getting so...this is not our child.
AS - Was he diagnosed with PTSD that you know?
KM - No. I mean, we sent him to a psychologist but everything is secret. He was of age. We didn't go to the psychologist with him. But we assumed because Alex would say things like, I wonder if the guy in prison is the guy I am. I said, well what does that mean Alex? I said, did you have sex? Did you have to have sex? Because that's not uncommon. And he goes, no! No, no, no no. He goes, but a lot of people did. Now I don't know how to believe him because he was lying about other things. He goes it's just that I'm smarter than most. I was able to get out of things, but I don't like the way I had to do it. I'm just like, it's a month. A lot can happen in a month, in a day in there. You know what I mean? I mean he's spending one day there. Much less 30 days. It ruined him, of course. It ruined him. For whatever happened there, I don't know and we'll never know, because we never got it out. For as much as I speak in public and can write, for some reason, telling this story is so overwhelming that it's hard to string sentences together properly unless I have, you know, an agenda, notes, and an audience. His behavior would get more bazaar. We had planned a family camping trip in Taylors Falls September 17th through the 19th or something like that. We were all really worried, what's Alex going to be like?
AS - In 2015?
KM - Yeah. A month before he died. But he was great. I mean, he was great. I have pictures from that weekend. He was smiling. Well, smiley-er. We have a lot of great pictures. His sister has a picture from that weekend where Alex is standing on a cliff in Taylor Falls. He's just standing there like this [makes a pose], and he's looking up to the sky and the sun is on him and his shirt. I mean it was a good weekend. We all just went [must make a pose or maybe shrug] because two weeks prior to that was his 24th birthday, and he came to our house. I had all of his favorite foods. He used to be such a great guy but he [begins crying] showed up and he had really weird clothes on. It's like he had these long sleeves on, of course, you know? It was like this weird argyle sweater, these weird pajama pants. I mean this guy was kind of a styling kind of guy normally. He walked in and he just had this look on his face. He looked at me and I'm getting ribs out of the oven, and I said, hey, you didn't have to dress up for us! Then he got furious. He said I told you she'd say something like that. I said, Alex, I was just kidding. He was horrible. He didn't eat his food. He was rude. This is not my son. So we really thought this kid has gone off his....this kid needs Prozac or something, I don't know. It was just a horrible day. So a couple weeks later is when we went to Taylor Falls and that was fine. So, mmm, it turns out though, I will say after the fact that Hillary knew. No I better wait on that. I'm going to mess up my story. So there they are. They live in this house in Medina. He has got a good job and she has a good job but he's often calling us saying he always wants to be with us on the weekends. Probably so he won't use. It's probably mostly opiates at this point. I kept trying to tell his dad, you know, there's something wrong with your child. He only lives a mile and a half away in Medina. Why don't you go and build adirondack chairs for them? He's just like, I'm not doing that, I'm not going to babysit a 23, 23 at the time, 23 year old. He just couldn't understand it. I said clearly he's traumatized. Clearly, whatever happened to him there is ruining him, you know. I saw Alex all the time. I kept going over his finances with him and like he had this big calendar, which I still have at home put away. Look it Alex, by this date, this will be paid off,  because they were doing pretty good financially. By this date, and by November 2nd, you'll have no more, you'll have paid ahead on this. He would just look at me like [silent]. I said, well isn't that exciting? He would just shrug his shoulders. I'm like, listen piss ass [hits table] I'm doing your bills with you. Well what it was was he wanted to say I'm doing drugs and that's where my money is. I kept saying, well, I don't understand. So he's just looking at me. So I did actually have November 2nd circled as that will be the end for you, that will be it. You won't have any school this, school that. November 2nd is actually when his funeral was. 
AS - No way. 
KM - Yep, and yet I have that circled and written that, you know. That's unbelievable. I mean, it's incredible. That's an aside, but. 
AS - Had he asked for help with his bills?
KM - Um. Yeah, I was with them. Groceries and stuff. I was beside myself but it was always some weird story. Well, Donny was really helping us out when this happened. It was just always some weird story. 
AS - They were always asking for something until you finally got to the point where you were like, hey, well let's sit down and figure out your bills. I can help you. 
KM - Right, right. Yet somehow, things were still weird. I mean, they were coming up short. Yeah, but if you do this. I just couldn't figure out what was happening but it was always, well, you know, Donny... he was getting really good it. So and so, John wanted this. Then I helped him out but he was going to pay me back. He was like, I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today type of thing, you know? So then, [sighs] the final straw for me was October 22nd, I can't be sure of the date, where Alex called and he says, hey, I need to get for a part for work, can I get sixty bucks from you? I'm like, first of all, you should have sixty bucks. Secondly, they don't send a 23 year old or 24 year old out, they would have a company card. You're going to buy 
a part?
AS - For the company? 
KM - Yeah. 
AS - They don't have you ask your mom. 
KM - Ha no. Well he goes, they probably just forgot to give me a card. I was just like okay Alex, this money thing. He was adamant though. He goes, mom, are you gonna do this or not because I need to get over to Fleet Farm? I said, well how about this, I'm going to have your dad go with you and Dick's in the back going [gestures], I'm not going to Fleet Farm, I'm sick of this, sick of this crap all the time. He's like no, dad doesn't need to go. Just tell dad to meet me at the Wells Fargo atm. I'm like yeah that's going to happen, right? [Sarcastically] He's just like sixty bucks. I need sixty bucks. So, I hung up the phone and I said Dick, go over to Wells Fargo and get the money and say okay, we're going to go together. Dicks says okay. He's sick of me being paranoid. I'll never forgive Dick for this. So he comes back and I go, what? He goes well of course when I took the money out then he got a text on his phone that said nevermind they got someone else to get it. Alex is really quick, right? But his dad believed it and left. 
Well he didn't get the money for Alex. 
AS - Oh he didn't give it to him. 
KM - No he didn't. He went up there to get the money because I wanted, I said you follow him and you go where he's going. 
AS - That's what you wanted him to do is follow him, okay. 
KM - As soon as Dick told Alex that when they got there, Alex just oh, got a text, I don't need to go, because he knew the ruse. 
AS - Dick told him he was going to follow him?
KM - Well Dick said I'm going to go with you. Dick said if you're going to take my money I'm going to go with you. Then Alex realized he can't do it. All he wanted was sixty bucks to go buy. That's all he wanted and that wasn't  going to work. So Dick comes home and I said, well what happened? He said, oh well, he got a text from work, he didn't have to do it. I said, and you believed that? Why would I not believe that? I mean, what could be, remember he's not thinking drugs. I even took him down to the courthouse to get drug tested a lot. Not that the government (unclear 53:00). So, do you understand why we didn't think drugs though?
AS - Yeah, yeah, because they were clean. 
KM - Yes, he always passed his tests. Always. Always. Opiates wasn't on our radar. Then I call Alex and DIck's like fine, call him. I'm sick of this. So I get on the phone with Alex and I sit in the car that I have now, in the garage, so people in the house can't hear me and I said, well, what's going on? I said that's bullshit Alex. I pushed him, I pushed him, I pushed him. I had to push him a good twenty two minutes. I said, you know what, I'm going to go to Acme Tools to your boss, Scott, who really, hey everyone likes Alex, and I'm going to say, tell me about that part you needed from Alex. He just sat there and when he just sat there I knew something was coming. He could've said you go do that, everything is fine mom, but he didn't. I go, Alex, tell me. Tell me! He goes, I'm doing opioids. I was relieved because I didn't know. I just didn't want him to be bipolar. So I thought, well opioids... you're doing what? 
AS - You just didn't want him to be bipolar?
KM - Yeah. 
AS - Yeah you didn't want it to be a mental illness. When you heard that you were...
KM - Right, I'm like well that, now that we can deal with. I mean that's how I thought. I am not kidding. Now this is a person who grew up, I didn't have addiction issues, but I did mushrooms, I did acid, I did all the 1970s things and I lived to tell about it. The only people that did heroin was um, and not opiates, I didn't even think that would be fun, would be Janis Joplin. Remember she died from it and it was just kind of a thing, like ooh, weird, heroin, for street people. I watched the news and I'm an informed individual but I didn't know about that. So, I said, well what do you mean? He goes, you know, pain pills. I go, pain pills? Opiates. He goes well they had them a lot in prison. There's no better place for drugs like the prison. Then he didn't over elaborate because I was drilling him. I said, are you kidding me? I just let him have it that night. I wish have I wouldn't have except I was so mad. I said, Alex, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired. I was so mad at him. I said you risk seventeen years of your life for that? Now that should've told me right there that's a terrible addiction, right? But he's like, I'm so sorry mom, I'm so sorry. Then I calmed down and I said well. What I should've done was picked him up and brought him to my house. I said well right away in the morning we're going to go to the doctor. I said, well, opiates, how bad could it be? Right away we're going to go to the doctor. The doctor he had been going to through the summer that knew he was a heroin addict and never told us. 
AS - What doctor knew?
KM - Doctor Graus
AS - His physician knew?
KM - Well, the plot thickens. Remember he's over 18. He's like so we're going to see Doctor Graus in the morning? I said, yes! We're going to go sit out there and wait. We're not going to get an appointment. He calmed down, he said I feel so much better. I said you know it takes a village, you know the saying Alex, we're going to make this a village problem. We're going to tell your grandma and grandpa. I mean, it was so hard to tell his grandpa who was so proud of him that he went to prison. His grandpa just couldn't get his mind around it, you know? So proud. Now to tell him this, I said everyone. Aunt Heidi, Uncle Steve and Cathy. I said everyone. That's it. No secrets. Which is what I go on today. There's a no secret policy. That's what I'm trying to preach. He goes, yes. Yes. I really want help. By that time, Dick has sauntered out to the garage and heard me talking and he's like this [poses]. He goes I can't believe this. I mean, I was so mad. Then the next day, we got him into the doctor. Dick went first and stayed with him. Waited for hours. They did a whole thing, you know. What are you doing? This and that. 
AS - An evaluation. 
KM - Right, an evaluation. Dick said I'm going to work and then I could come and take over. I figured it was all out there so I didn't need to, I didn't know there were any secrets, so I didn't go in with him the second time. It was an all day thing. Now I know why it was an all day thing. He was trying to get not methadone but vivitrol. Alex tried to talk to me about vivitrol and now I know what it is. He goes, mom, on his own he's looking for vivitrol, vivitrol, whereas methadone of course is an opiate as well. I mean everyone has their opinions. Alex felt that vivitrol was a go. Whatever. 
AS - So the doctor's trying to find?
KM - Apparently the doctor is trying to find it and he couldn't. Now I know why. There was only ten doctors in Minnesota that could give it out. So he released Alex with Xanax, and Xanax it turns out exacerbates whatever drug you're on. He wasn't educated enough in the drug stuff, nice guy though, to know this. He didn't take the twelve, the fifteen hours certificate to give out methadone. They can push pills, um, vicodin stuff like crazy, but they can't give you methadone. So he didn't ever take us aside all summer long and say, because he also know Alex's grandparents. He could've slipped us a note that said, hey, look into something else than what you're looking into, it's not PTSD. But he kept it to himself. Alex came out of there. He was a little busy on his phone, obviously still looking for it. I just did not know what he wa talking about. So I said well let's get you something to eat. 
AS - Is he in withdrawals yet?
KM - Yes, he had withdrawals but he by that time was getting better. I got him a malt. Took him home, got him some epsom salts, for a nice epsom salts soak. 
AS - Yeah [laughs] that cures everything. 
KM - Yes, it cures everything. He seemed happy. Alex seemed happy. Maybe he thought he had gotten through the worst part of what this would be, this would be the heroin. So I said, Alex, we're going to get you in narcotics anonymous. He's like, no. Mom, there's nothing but druggies there. That'll get you in a worst place. I said, whatever. So the next day was Friday and he went to work. He almost never wanted to miss work. I still have his texts, you know. He said feeling much better. My legs feel stronger and the diarrhea is not so bad. He said I'm doing pretty good. I said, okay, do you want me to bring you lunch? Acme Tools is off of 494 in Rockford Road. He said, sureeeee. So it was raining that day, October 23rd, I mean pouring. So he was forced to run
out of work and get into my car. He looked good. He looked real good and plus he had the weight of the world off of him because no more secrets. Remember part of the secret is going to pen for 17 years because that's a violation of his parole. He knew he was going to get through it with us I thought. He bounded out and got into the car, and he gave me a hug, and he was a very loving person. He goes, thanks mom, I love you. He runs up, last time I ever see him alive, right? Runs up, turns around, you know, that kind of thing. So later that night Dick gave him a ride home because Alex had cracked up his car I forgot to say on October 8th. He died on the 24th. But on October 8th, on 116 in Corcoran, he had a telephone call and he said it because he was leaning down to get Gatorade, probably fell asleep. 
AS - Or was nodding off. 
KM - Right, right. So his dad picked him up Friday night, October 23rd, from work and they had talked about heroin. And oh oh oh, in my talk with Alex, I had asked him, when we had that big talk about him coming clean, I said have you ever tried heroin? I only say that because a teacher I know in Florida said heroin is really a big thing you might want to ask this kid. Alex was just like no [with emphasis]. I do not mess with that shit. He said that stuff will bring you down fast. I'm like oh okay. So x to heroin, no heroin right? I just believed it even though he lied for months about the other stuff. Then, so his dad said yeah they were talking about heroin and then Alex said, dad, people only die from heroin if they want to die from heroin. That's the only way you die from heroin. Alex was not familiar with fentanyl or (unclear 1:03) and all that. That was new in '15. So when he did die his dad lived with the fact that he...
AS - He had just told him that that day?
KM - That night. Then he died that night. He told him that at 5:30 on Friday night. Alex thought he knew everything in the world. They had talked about opiates and heroin. Dad, nobody dies if they want to die from heroin, that's what happens. He was so clueless because he had been doing pills and switched to heroin, well, when he moved here anyway. So then, I called him at 9 o'clock at night. I called all the family members, oh we are just so relieved it's just these opiates. God, I can't even believe it. So I called him and I was real chatty. His girlfriend was at work and he was distant, busy. He said mom, I got something cooking and I go well, you have a cellphone, they don't have words on them. I went on to say you know how lucky you are, you know what could have happened October 8th. Now you definitely got someone looking out for you. He's like yeah, yeah, yeah, mom, I have to go. So I hung up and then sometime we believe it was about 2 in the morning, because they had a four bedroom house in Medina, and he told Hillary, I'm going to sleep upstairs because I still have the leg shakes from the withdrawal. He didn't, she should know that, but she wasn't very tuned in. She remembers that at 2 o'clock she heard a big boom and she sat up. She heard a big thump upstairs and that's when he fell. So the next day his brother Noah who was nineteen at the time, my youngest, had to go. I was supposed to pick Alex up but I wasn't going to be home. I said you know what, you can pick your brother up. Here's a bunch of sweet rolls for him, and you take him to work. He was like, oh my God, he crashed up his car, what an idiot. You know that kind of thing. Oh I know why I couldn't. I was going to go out with a friend to the general store in Minnetonka and we were just going to have a chick thing you know. Just drink some coffee. So she picked me up at 9:20. Time matters. And Noah was going to pick him up right around that time. So we're driving and at about 9:30, my friend remembered this. I had a pain that felt like someone was cutting my head off with an axe. I'm like oh my God, oh my God. She said do you want to stop? I said, I don't know, something is just, I don't know if it's a blood clot. She's stopping the car, she pulled over, and then it just went away. She remembered that later. That's exactly the time that Noah called 911. Needless to say, I've gotten much more ethereal and it's actually pretty amazing. But I know now. But Noah, why Noah? So he drove up apparently now we find out, and he's waiting, and he goes Hillary is cooking. She's cooking Trader Joes crescents, Alex's favorite. She says, you know what, why hasn't he come down yet? So Noah sees her run up the stairs, it's like those farmhouse stairs, and she stops. She races back down and the dog's acting funny all morning. She said, I think he's dead. Noah's like, what? Noah runs up stairs. She says all she could hear is Noah say, and it's just the worst voice, oh Alex. Then she went up and she said she could tell the room was vacant. It was just vacant. Like his soul, she said she had never witnessed that. She's never a big believer in souls and she said he was just an empty shell. He had rigor mortis by then and he was curled up, and he had blood out of his nose, and he was purply because all the blood. You know what I mean? So she said that Noah, and I've told this story a lot, picked him up because he didn't move, he was just like a frozen thing and just rocked him and just said I'm so sorry Alex, I'm so sorry, you were a good big brother. I'm so sorry the last words I said to you were fuck you, because they were. Noah was angry at him. Alex had asked him to play video games and Noah just said fuck you. He just rocked him and rocked him. He said they called 911 and everything went to hell then. The drugs squad came. They tore everything apart. Everybody was hysterical. 
AS - They tore the whole house apart?
KM - Oh yeah. I mean because clearly he had needles and heroin. So they went all nutso about it and they're shaking her down. She's never, seriously she's like the Virgin fricken Mary, and she's about this tall. But Noah took totally over and and he said you are not to call my parents. I wasn't home. He said, until Alex is gone out of here because they'll run over. I couldn't have handled that. I don't know how Noah did. I don't know that he does. He said and I want a chaplain. 
AS - And I want what?
KM - A chaplain of some kind. 
AS - Where? When?
KM - When they went over to tell. He didn't know where I was but his dad was washing windows while I went out and had fun. 
AS - Because this is a Saturday morning?
KM - It's a Saturday morning, October 24th. Now there's Dick's point of view that he sees a big red truck, should have been the chaplain, pull up, and squad cars, and Noah. He says oh my God because Noah is just... 
AS - A square
KM - Oh my gosh. There's nobody squarer in the whole world. He said, what happened? Oh my gosh, what happened? Did he hit somebody? He said I was holding the stuff washing the windows and they all walk up and Dick goes, let's have it, and the police chief says you know, do you want to tell your dad something, Noah? And he told him, and apparently now, he said Dick just walked around like this, just all around the yard. Just all around the yard forever. Then he had to call me. They said you have to call your wife. Can you imagine having to call me? I had no idea. I thought I just saved my son. Oh I had taken care of that one, you know. So we're shopping around. I had a basket of early stocking stuffers. I just thought I would pick up some stuff, you know. Her phone rings and she says, oh, okay. No. My phone rings first and it was Dick. But he always butt dials, which is what he actually did. Then when Dave called, her husband, she says they screwed it up. The plan was that they were supposed to say Nick needs help you gotta come home right away. Nick being her son. Then I wouldn't panic. But she just said something bad happened to Alex. My mouth was dry like a desert. It just went [slurps]. 
AS - Immediately. 
KM - Mhmm. So I tried to call Dave and Dave answered, her husband. I go, what happened? He said I don't know but it's not good. I think at first I was thinking drug thing and then he's going away. Then I kept calling Dick and no one would answer which is very typical of him, and immediately, I had immediate diarrhea. So I don't know, somehow we got up to her jeep. I mean and everyone was still shopping. My basket dropped you know? So we're driving, and I'm [makes clicking noises] calling, and calling, and calling. I just wouldn't let up. So we get about to Carlson Parkway in 494 and I hear, hello Kirsten. I mean, that's how he said it, like, hello Newman, you know that kind of thing, you know? I start screaming at him into the phone. Tell me what happened! Tell me what happened! Tell me what happened! And he just says Noah found Alex and he has passed away. Of course by then, I knew, I knew. And so, I mean, but how?
AS - Was Dick waiting for you to get home? Do you think that's why he wasn't answering? 
KM - He was scared. 
AS - Yeah and he just wanted you to be there? 
KM - And the chaplain and everyone would be there. I remember looking up at her sunroof and just screaming a blood curdling. She grabbed me like this and she said, I remember, because she and I always thought what if one of our kids ever died, it's like our worst thing we talked about it all the time. I mean, oh my God, could you imagine? And then that was me. She says that's impossible it's only because we're always talking about it and they're just saying that! It wasn't 
rational at all. So we get there and there everybody it. Noah grabbed my hand and I don't even remember what Dick was doing. Everyone is outside. And all my neighbors knew before I did. Before Dick did. They knew in the morning. 
AS - How did they know?
KM - Because Hillary had two jobs. One of them was working with the kids. The other was at the Cove in Wayzata. And she called in in the morning and said my boyfriend died I can't come to work. Well, our neighbor's kid cousin worked there and they're like, Alex Milun died? So they called everyone on the block. 
AS - Oh my God. 
KM - So they see Dick out. 
AS - They see him out there washing windows and they already know?
KM - Mhmm. Hours before. They've known Alex since he was born. They were hysterical and yet they knew, they said, don't say anything. So can you imagine for their sake? It was just. So, Noah
AS - What is the Cove?
KM - It's a restaurant on Lake Minnetonka. So Noah grabs my hands and he holds on to them, I think it was like an hour, and he wouldn't let go. I mean, it was like, this is the guy who won't even touch me normally. He just said it's true mom. I said no it's not. I said that for a few days. Because if it was, I would've known it. Because if your kid dies, we've all heard about it, you know when your loved one dies they visit you. 
AS - Oh right, you wake up in the middle night. 
KM - Not me I was just [hums], getting ready, and all that time my kid's dead in a bed. A mile away and I had no idea. So I kept saying I believe that. The poor chaplain. I feel bad about it. I pushed him out of the way. I remember going like this, I said, excuse me. I know, I mean not pushed him, 
AS  - You just moved him out of the way 
KM - He looked like Father Mulcahey, that kind of chaplain. And then I said it all, and then when Noah said there was needles. It was just a horrible thing. We had to go find his sister Amanda. She wasn't talking to me. She was mad at me because we had gone to something, a night together, and I had fallen asleep. I was so exhausted from Alex. We had to go find her and she wouldn't answer. We had to finally have her work call and say there's an emergency, you need to call your mom back. So we're all driving to her apartment at the time and she's sounding like a kitten got hit, you know. We just can't believe it. 
AS - What do you mean she sounded like a kitten?
KM - [high pitched meow] She is after we told her because nobody had any idea. Except, I asked Hillary, I said, you know the conversation I had with Alex a couple nights before he died? Then I called her and I said, how long have you known? And she says, 
only a week. 
AS - No it wasn't a week. 
KM - Lover of my final child. It turns out now that she saw pills in his ashtray in Vermillion. She'd always say pills. She'd say, what do you have those pills for? What are those? He goes, oh a buddy of mine has a back ache. She would accept it. Yeah. She also found syringes once they moved here, next to the bed. And she goes, well somebody had diabetes or, I don't know. 
AS - Oh that's what he would say to her. 
KM - Syringes? Pills? I love her to death but I think we could have saved him had we known that she was finding pills. Then I would've stayed in Vermillion. I would've driven down there. Now that I know better, you never, never, let an addict...you bring him in and you take him home and you watch him like a hawk until you can get him help. Here he was feeling real good and the last text he sent on his phone which now, remember Alex's cases, the first case was tried federally for the dealer to go to jail. 
AS - No, I didn't know that. 
KM - The first case ever in the country  tried federally. So on December 21st they caught the guy because of Alex. You know Alex was very good at covering his tracks but for some reason, he left everything on his computer and on his phone, when he would normally erase things. It's like he maybe knew he was going to die and his higher self just said, hey you gotta catch this guy. I don't know. They were trying to identify this guy named Red and they were finally able to do it because of Alex. They even had Alex's name all over the TV December 21st, which was two months after Alex died. 
AS - Are we in 2015?
KM - Yep. They caught him right away because of Alex. So Alex would've been really proud of that I have to say. His name is Jamie McClellan and it was laced with fentanyl of course, that's why he died, it wasn't the heroin. He [sighs] that was on his grandma's birthday, December 21st. So a lot of things were missed. 
AS - Where was his dealer? Here in the Minneapolis area?
KM - Maple Grove, where they have no drug problem [sarcastic]. Try and speak at their high schools and they won't let you because they don't have a drug problem in Maple Grove. Neither does Minnetonka so don't even think about going there to speak. 
AS - Yeah, nobody from there has died.[sarcasm]
KM - No, no, nobody. And none of the kids there do drugs. 
AS - And none of their alumni have. Full of sarcasm. [laughs]
KM - Absolutely, I mean, I never thought you couldn't speak. I spoke at Wayzata and Eden Prairie but, and then they don't want they go, okay we'll let you do this but they don't want to advertise this very much. Then that's when I heard that the superintendent of Minnetonka said that's not gonna happen here, so we're gonna make it happen there. How dare he with kids dropping young people dropping like flies. It's all about money. Everything is about money. 
AS - How is it about money?
KM - Well, they can't recruit the kind of athletes they want and people don't maybe want to move into the district, right? So, that's Alex's story in a short version of it. 
AS - So is this guy, Jamie McClellan, he's arrested on December 21st?
KM - He was arrested on December 21st and had a hearing and all that. It was such a strange. They could have put him away forever, for life, but believe it or not, you wouldn't think that's possible but even though they couldn't introduce, what was it a trial with peers, and even in front of the judge they couldn't introduce fentanyl. 
AS - Why? 
KM - That wasn't this long ago! Because heroin is in and of itself deadly. Right? So if it was a trial you can't introduce it being fentanyl or carfentanil. But now you can because carfentanil, you're dead when you touch it. So these dealers are, you know, killing off their own because there's always another one around the corner. 
AS - Yeah and people who use opioids want stronger stuff. That's what I've heard. They kind of flock to it. 
KM - Well, but it almost always kills them now. You don't usually get a second chance with heroin. So like Philip Seymour Hoffman, it finally took fentanyl to kill him. His was fentanyl. So it hit other places before it hit here but Alex was a batch of like, a bad batch, that had come in that weekend. So they were dying [repeatedly hits the table to mimic people dying] they were just dropping all over that October weekend. He was one of them. Red warned him, he goes, be careful it's strong stuff, it's good stuff. Alex's text before he picked up his drugs were, everyone knows now. Even my girlfriend and parents. I got to have one last high and then I'm done, done. The guy wrote back and he said famous last words from a junky dude. All of that is on Alex's phone which the defendent see (?). The attorneys still have it so we had hearings and all of this stuff. It couldn't go to trial because, I won't name his name, but he didn't want to testify and when you're a junky and you don't want to testify, what do you do? You do heroin and revive with narcan because then you can't be a witness. 
AS - Oh the go between?
KM - The go between. He would've been the guy to absolutely without any doubt say I saw this transaction. Even though there isn't any doubt, you know what I mean? 
AS - But did this guy get convicted? 
KM - He did, but he got 15 years instead of life. Also, he wouldn't have. The boy's name is Mike Evgen and he lived near us. He wouldn't have lived on the street because they would have taken him out. This is a cartel thing this isn't like, you know. So he'd rather just go by and lethal injection of his own. 
AS - Is he still alive? 
KM - He is and it's amazing. I don't think he knows why. So Alex's attorney put him in prison so he could sober up and make him testify. Then, for October 8th. So he got out on the 6th and overdosed on the 7th. So I knew that wasn't going to work. I had told the federal prosecutor, I said I do not, because they say how do you feel about this and that? I said, I do not want him to be brought. They are going to do what they do but I don't want this kid, 23, I don't want him to be a witness. I just don't. I don't. He's an incredible junky and most all of his friends have died, and they think he just wants to die. His parents were junkies too. 
AS - You think he wants to die?
KM - Oh yeah. Everybody knows his dad. On the news they kept saying, Alex Milun's good friend and it's just like, uh-uh, this wasn't
AS - Wasn't his good friend
KM - It wasn't his good friend at all. It was just Mike. Yet Mike keeps just not dying but they have a ton of narcan, which I think another problem with this another pharmaceutical boom is narcan and they just keep reviving him and every other junky. It's a bandaid. It's another money maker. Now, he's appealed in that September. Mike's family doesn't know this because Mike had just, you know. I think they're going to call in. 
AS - Who has appealed? This Jamie?
KM - I didn't think he could when he plead. I did not think he could do that. I guess federally you can. So he'll do that. 
AS - He plead guilty?
KM - Plea deal. So he could have you know gotten 20, but he had a plea deal, 15. Now he is appealing it. I know they'll call in Mike because I was there in January when the judge was (unclear 1:26:48). 
AS - What's the county? Anoka?
KM - Hennepin. But he's also got charges in Anoka. Murder charges. I mean, this guy. 
AS - Is that because of the dealing?
KM - Mhmm. The thing is, an important thing to know is that now, the people that they're catching, Alex was the first person to be tried federally, but since then there has been others. These guys aren't addicts and that matters. McClullen isn't an addict and
neither was Colleen Ronnei. 
AS - Beverly Burrell, I went to one day of her trial. 
KM - Okay well Colleen's a friend of mine and she's lost Luke and she is the one that was at the Eden Prairie police. Saw that story? [grunts]
AS - You met her after Alex passed away?
KM - I think it's important to note these dealers are rich. They aren't addicts. I would have a different feeling about them. But they aren't. They're just rich. Otherwise McClullen wouldn't have $400,000 stashed away in Plymouth in a warehouse, in a storage facility. And Beverly she's not an addict. Whatever her name is. So the fact that they're doing this not to feed their... I mean Alex could have sold heroin but he didn't do it. But these people aren't addicts and that's why it makes them extra dangerous. They're doing it and they don't care who dies. Seeing McClullen stand up there and cry, and he's a big ass, tough guy. He actually said this, you know, my kids with food stamps, and we go to the gas station and buy candy there [mocks a crying voice], which I didn't even think you could do with food stamps, we had to get candy with food stamps. At the gas station. He actually said that. I wanted to be like, well how about taking some of your big stash at the time and giving them some lunch. This guy is just an idiot. Then of course
you get the mother in your face screaming at you. His mother. 
AS - That happened to you?
KM - In federal court. Mhmm. They allow it. They keep warning her. You're going to have to leave. It's like, no, you get one chance. Then outside the courtroom in my daughter's face, ""your son, your brother, nobody told him to put that in his arm,"" you know that usual stuff. It didn't bother me but it really bothered Amanda and she never went back. So that kind of clammed her up. 
AS - How is your family now? 
KM - Screwed up. Yeah. I'm constantly doing this. 
AS - You're talking about it. 
KM - Talking and writing and I even got, you know who Peter Yarrow is? Peter, Paul, and Mary. When Alex died, I put on one of my favorite songs of his is the Great Mandala. Alex also liked Peter, Paul, and Mary because he was like his mom. I've always really liked Peter Yarrow. So I reached out to him and he got back to me. He wrote me a beautiful, beautiful letter and also read about Judge Eng (drugs ruining? 1:28:00) and all that kind of stuff. So I want him to work with me on raising, my mom says he's an old man what's he going to do? I reached out to him because I admired him on so many levels. I grew up harmonizing with him and I just think this song, the Great Mandala, if you tweak the words a little bit. If you don't know the song, look it up with he and Richie Havens. [sings] ""take your place on the great mandala."" You got to listen to it. So he has been very gracious. Someone asked, well what do you want to happen? Well, what I'd really like to happen is the same thing that has been done with Stand Up to Cancer. I want it televised, not for money. I don't think Stand Up to Cancer is, I don't know. But Stand Up to Cancer, we all know that there's cancer and funding is pretty good for cancer. They might have a problem with doing it but what about this? Stand Up for Awareness. No more shame. So if you get people like Peter Yarrow because nobody knows who he is, but 
AS - He knows a lot of people
KM - Sure, and he's a master. His heart is so good. It's always in the right place. I just think if we could get a Katy Perry or Russell Brand. Somebody like that. He's a recovering heroin addict. Just say in the spotlight this is what I know and this is what I've been through. I lost a brother, I lost a friend. Just make it, I hate to say, hip. I'm sorry but that's what Hollywood does. They make it so it's cool to talk about things. No more shame. It's not to drum up money. That's what I want and that's what I'm going to materialize for myself. I mean, why isn't anyone really talking about it? I mean, you might say well I think they are because I just heard this on the Today Show. 
AS - Well and there are so many articles in the paper now about the opioid crisis, the opioid crisis. You know you're constantly hearing about it but we're not, nothing is happening around the shame and the stigma around it. We're just hearing about the terrible statistics. It's like HIV. There's really, really, really, incredible parallels around the gay community and the death and trauma that they were dealing with before anyone recognized it. 
KM - That's so funny. Exactly. It still has a certain amount, but at that time. I remember. 
AS - Yeah we've come so far with the gay community and education around HIV awareness. 
KM - Oh yeah. Yet, as I said last August at a talk, I said, you know, Vietnam, this is killing tenfold any of the people than what happened in Vietnam. I know that's not a very current reference but you know what I mean. I think the shame. Also there was shame in Vietnam. This country is founded on shame. I'm kind of I guess what really tuned me into the shame and the first time I realized it was shame was Channel 11, remember I did that piece on Channel 11? When Lindsey Seavert called me and I was happy to talk to her. First she messaged me. First I said, oh I'd be. She says oh well I just can't get anyone to talk because, well I assumed it was you know why, to be on tv, that's not easy to do. 
AS - No. This was in 2016?
KM - This aired May of '16. 
AS - And she said she couldn't get anyone to talk?
KM - Well here's why. If this doesn't break your heart, nothing will. Well we found a ton of people but they can't talk to us because we got their names from the coroner's reports on death, but they've told their families that the kid died of an aneurysm, a weird heart problem, the flu. Everything you can think of except for that. I said I will not let him be on the other side of the veil. I've seen that since now. People have died on the block that I live in. Someone's 49 year old friend died. 49. So that's older. Nobody knew he was an addict. He hit a tree out West here. He was a fireman. There was a ton of people at the funeral. Somebody confided in me, his other friend Paul, and said I've known his family my whole life, I feel like they should know. I said I do too. But they didn't do it at the funeral and I don't know. So hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people and they all said it was a freak accident. So talk about shame but to bury that many kids. I know I shouldn't judge on it but I'm going to. I can't imagine. It would have been easy for me to say except for if Noah hadn't found him dead. If most people, Colleen, Becky, find their kids themselves, or, they could have said, oh he had a heart problem we didn't know about. It would have been very easy to do. I can't believe that. That's heartbreaking. 
AS - Are you talking about their ability to speak out about it?
KM - Not their ability, their shame to speak up. Imagine lying. 
AS - Oh the other people versus the women that you've met, the moms you've met. 
KM - Right. That's changing. That is changing. That's because now they're incorporating it in the obituaries. 
AS - There are more people speaking up. And that's a personal choice. 
KM - We didn't think to put it in Alex's but we did make it part of the funeral. Addiction. I think that's about the saddest thing I've ever heard. So we continue to say that we're proud of Alex. That article that I wrote, somebody saw it in the East Coast who runs a federal opiate symposium, and they may want me to speak there in the fall. Any mom could do it. 
AS - So when you talked about the article are you talking about the article to Judge Eng? Or are you talking about something else?
KM - Yes. The article was the newsletter. I had to pay for that thing to be in the newspaper and I had to change the ending to make it nicer. 
AS - [laughs] You can send me your original. 
KM - Well, it was just something to the effect of if there is a judge then you're doing great. I'm sure the flames will be licking your ass. So this little South Dakota woman said, she goes, ""this is a family paper, could you say licking his behind or backside?"" I'm like no I'll just change it. It would ruin it if I said your backside. You need to go after awareness first. Awareness and stigma and shame. Then it is big pharma, because once that's talked about then the large, huge platform, then big pharma, it's so ridiculous. 
The common denominator between, oh kids have so many problems now, well they weren't dead in 1979. Now they're dead. And why? Well because it's all about money. Now we have opiate induced constipation pills. Narcan too, can't leave Narcan out.
AS - I have a different opinion about Narcan but we can talk about that more off. 
KM - How do you feel about that? Okay. Well, obviously we do need it and we do need it in our high schools and things like that. It can make a lot of people live. What I'm saying is we need it. We need it in gymnasiums, we need it in stores, but we don't need it pedalled. Their foundations, what their foundation is it's hard to say, but they raised like $333,000 for Narcan and I'm saying, this is a bandaid. This is what this country does. So we need Narcan but we don't need it to be a bandaid or an answer. We need reform. You can't legislate your way out of this you have to go to the people. Somewhere Alex got some of this, but they all have their hands and they're naming Amy Klobuchar. So it's like [sighs], why Amy Klobuchar? I mean, please. Wellstone, he wouldn't have. Sanders, you know, he wouldn't have. So you have to go to the people like with everything. You have to go to the people to effectively change. 
AS - From the ground up. 
KM - Yeah. Then, after that, prison systems. Just knocking them out one at a time. Would I have done this if my kid hadn't died? No. I got to be honest. I just wouldn't. I don't even know if you'd be writing this. 
AS - Right, you're right, I wouldn't. 
KM - But it's not like we're trying to be selfish because it's not like we got pancreatic cancer and I'm on a crusade to somehow, somebody, quickly, find pancreatic cancer pills for me. It's not like that. 
AS - Because it's a larger social crisis and problem. 
KM - Yes, of course. I can't stand it. Every time I see a little face. Or on Facebook the other day a grandmother posted a picture from Hibbing. Her 14 year old grandson that had died. He was in the hospital. She said, this is the last picture I'll have ever have. Rock on, grandma. 
AS - He died of?
KM - Opiates. 
AS - Opiates? 14? 
KM - It hit me. Oh yeah, yeah. 14. 
AS - Yeah, I've noticed that lately. 
KM - The grandma said that he had a small amount of opiates in his system. Okay, that's not going to kill you, but whatever. Without asking her son or anything she put it on Facebook, saying this kid was killed, you know. It was shared a billion times. But this is what we need. This is the face. If I could, when I went to go see Alex in the morgue, and that'll be in that piece. Did you see the piece on Channel 11 at all? 
AS - I might have a few years ago. 
KM - No this was just a year ago in May. Alex died in '15. 
AS - Was that when they did a whole series of stories? 
KM - Heroin. 
AS - Oh yeah, I did see it. I found you through other, through the letter. I saw the letter. 
KM - Okay. But I almost took a picture of him and everyone went, ""No!"" because obviously I was in shock. To see your child like that, and as I said in the piece, his little eyelashes were the same ones when he was a baby. And that haunts me, [cries], and I don't want that for anybody else because to me they're all Alex. I just, I can't take it anymore. That's why doing this thing is not an option. It often is for men, in a way. I'm sorry to say. There are few represented as [unclear 1:43:29] but most dads are absent. I don't know if it's denial. I don't know what it is. I admire women even more than I did before. They're amazing. It does something about our society. They step back, they step out, and we need more dads. Remember, he's a good dad. He's a decent person. 
AS - Right and think of their privilege in our culture, if they stepped forward. White men, middle class to affluent white men, stepping forward about this issue. They have a little more. They don't get accused of being overly emotional. Oh your kid passed away so therefore you're acting emotional. That's why she's on this new campaign. They don't get accused of that. 
KM - No. Or maybe it's menopause. It's not your period anymore. Do you still get your period? I'm just like mom. My mom's like I want my old Missy Kissy back because that's my old nickname and I'm just like, ""well she's gone, so get over it"" Many of our marriages (unclear 1:44:55) doesn't set too well when you're in the forefront. We all understand, us thinking women, that everybody has a different way of grief and not everybody is going to advocate. I understand that, but to be like, 
so how did the hearing go? 
AS - Oh to not even be supported in that way.
KM - Well, like my women friends are supportive. 
AS - But I mean in your marriage. 
KM - After Alex died, if there was any hope. Not it's just kind of disdain. I think a lot of women are feeling that when they try to get their boyfriends, husbands, ever involved. Sad commentary. I think, as I said, behind every movement that there has ever been, there has been masses of people behind it. It's not legislation. In this case the masses of people are dead ones. 
AS - Right. So who is going to advocate for them?
KM - So we are there for our children and our children's children. The madness of people not even realizing that this is all. You know who you should talk to is, you know who Chris Johnson is right? 
AS - Yeah, I've interviewed him. 
KM - I love him. He's different. I love his engineered epidemic because it's true whether you want to believe it or not, that's what is going on here. Even when Alex tried to tell me these things, it's like, how could he know more than I did? Maybe I was just too...
AS - Yeah but he wasn't telling you that he was using. 
KM - No
AS - He was talking around it. 
KM - Around it but also about that he was writing letters about the prisons way before that. Then when he was on probation he wanted to write more letters and I said no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Then he realized that would be dumb. So now I'm his voice. For those who can't speak anymore and yet he speaks. He does speak. So Alex has shown himself so many times. He's there. 
AS - That's powerful, Kirsten. That is really powerful. 
KM - It's funny how you can shake your religious dogma which is what Alex did before he died. He became more spiritual. I was always like, ""well, what do you mean you're not going to go to church on Christmas?"" because I just. But I realize now that he was right about all that, that kind of dogma. Who puts more shame? I mean, religion is man made obviously, and that's part of the shame of everything is coming behind these man made religions. That's where a lot of shame comes from. Whether it's gay rights, it's all judgement. So I'm way more spiritually connected to God than I ever was before. Oh yeah. I mean, I get it, you know. Thank you Alex! Although my step mom thinks I'm probably going to hell. Probably was anyway. So in a way that is something I feel on a larger scale here, not to get too esoteric, but a vibration, I'm just going to say it, raising the whole vibration of this country, this kind of thing, this kind of Trump. The Cheeto. He had to get in there, he did, to change, for people to go, ""oh my God! Look what happened!"" He had to get in there. I'm not going to freak out about that. We're going to make the changes and be the people we need to be to fight fights, this needs to happen because we always have another election. So this is what happens. So I think that the nation, on many, many levels in the next five years is going to wake up in a way we've never seen before. People are waking up. I mean, they're literally waking up to what's really going on. It's ugly, and it's horrible, and I won't
say that I don't wail, and lately, a lot, but when you look at the bigger picture, it's an amazing thing. It's almost beautiful. I mean, to be a part. That's really taking yourself out of the picture and trying to look at it. That's the only way you can really survive. Or, you can go into your little, sit around and watch tv, and drink at night, and go to the bar. You can do that, but I'm not doing that. That's the story in a nutshell. 
AS - Thank you. 
KM - You're welcome. Good luck editing that everyone. "

St. Paul, Minnesota
Richard Moldenhauer-RM
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan and I am with Rick Moldenhauer at the Department for Human Services in St. Paul at 540 Cedar Avenue. Can you state your name and give me permission to record this interview?
RM: Hi, my name is Richard Moldenhauer and I give permission to record this interview. 
AS: Could you start by talking about where you grew up and what your childhood was like, your schooling, and how you got into your career?
RM: I grew up in a little town called River Falls, Wisconsin. I was born and raised there. I had a public education kindergarted through twelfth grade. I also attended college—both graduate and undergraduate—at River Falls. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from River Falls and then a Master’s in Science and Education again from River Falls. I spent a large portion of my life there. I currently still reside in Wisconsin. I’ve worked in substance abuse treatment in both Wisconsin and Minnesota. I’ve worked at pretty much all levels there are for substance abuse treatment. I’ve done everything from [unclear] psych dual diagnosis to outpatient to halfway homes, adolescents, adults, pretty much a wide variety of everything like that. I did well in junior high and high school. I’m an only child. I’m married and have children. Kind of the American story I guess. 
AS: Do you still live in River Falls?
RM: I live outside of River Falls now out in the country. 
AS: Can you talk about your first jobs and how you got into addiction treatment?
RM: When I first started out in college I wanted to be a physician—an osteopath. I was originally pre-med. The way that River Falls at that time orchestrated college courses you could be pre-med but you still had to declare a major and minor and things like that. I chose psychology and my interest was really to be a doctor of osteopathic medicine and then focus on psychiatry. Psychology was the logical fit. I took all the biology and chemistry and stuff and gravitated more and more towards psychology. 
I finished undergraduate, but when I wasn’t all the way through undergraduate I started to lose a lot of the the biochemistry and doctor part of it and was more interested in the softer science or the behavioral aspects of it. As I maticulated and graduated I turned around and went to graduate school in River Falls with an MSC—Master’s in Science and Education with a focus on Community Counseling. 
My first job in human services started in the fall of ‘83 at a residential group foster home outside of River Falls that was all male, court ordered and almost all of them had substance use disorder problems and behavioral conduct problems. They were in court for stuff like that. 
AS: And they were under eighteen?
RM: Yes, all juvenile. In that piece of employment I had contact with in today’s world we call comorbid disorders—dual diagnosis or COD even though we had different terms for it then. 
AS: What did they call it then?
RM: It would depend on who you talked to. Dual diagnosis. At that time there was still a lot of what is primary? What is secondary? What is the initial etiology versus symptomatic outcropping?
AS: There was a ranking. 
RM: Yes, much more than there is today. Depending on who you would talk to a lot of the mental health folks would tell you that the substance use was a symptom of underlying mental health etiology. If you talked to the traditional substance abuse people they would tell you what appears to be mental health symptoms are just a roller coaster on the Jellinek Chart of Intoxication Withdrawal and things like that. 
I did that and at the same time I was going to school. When I graduated at that time I then went and enrolled in graduate school. I enrolled in a locked dual diagnosis program that was in Prescott, Wisconsin, which is closed now. That was locked adolescent and adult. It was technically a psychiatric facility all for dual disorder people. You had an increased level of acuity and impairment. This would have been in the mid and late eighties now. The primary substance you would see floating around this area was alcohol—always has been and always will be. A lot of marijuana. Then you saw a more increased smattering of some of the other substances that have now really proliferated. We saw some heroin, some pharmaceutical stuff, but not much. This was on the tail end of the powder cocaine and crack days. 
AS: Who were the heroin users at that point?
RM: Most of the folks that were coming into that facility at that time and the demographics of the time were older people. If you look at today’s numbers the primary demographic are in their early twenties. At that time the primary demographic were much older—in their forties or early fifties. 
AS: So these were long-time users.
RM: Yeah. More long-term users. Heroin at that time was not an initial drug or a gateway drug. Heroin was like the last rung on the ladder. People that were using heroin back in those days in the mid to late eighties were folks who had already gone through alcohol and cannabis and had done crack and everything else. Heroin was the last thing there was for them to move into. In today’s world you see heroin and other pharmaceutical opiates used maybe not as the original substance of introduction, but certainly much earlier in age with a faster onset and more pervasiveness and greater acuity. The heroin that is floating around today—the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension lab, when they do the heroin analysis, they’ll tell you that the purity of heroin today is vastly increased from what it was in the eighties and that timeframe. Heroin purity samples were twenty odd percent pure. Today the BCA does spectral analysis and finds stuff up from eighty percent purity. Today it is cut with things like fentanyl and carfentanil, which makes it multiple times stronger. 
AS: I do want to talk about that later when we get to it. Can you talk for a minute about the kids that you first worked with? As a freshman in college you weren’t that far from their age. What was it like to work with them? What do you remember of those young men and their stories?
RM: It was a little different because I was so much more closer to age in them. I was only three, four, five years older versus some of the other staff at the facility who could have easily been our collective parents’ age. I had advantages and disadvantages to that. You know when you were sitting around listening to the top forty stations? I knew the same music they knew versus some of the other staff who were still from the Buddy Holly to the Beatles timeframes. I was familiar with the terms, the lingo, the music, the culture of that early eighties timeframe versus some of the other staff who weren’t. There were some difficulties with it too in being seen as a staff person or as someone who had a degree of authority in decision making or trying to be involved in the therapeutic process with them because I was so close to their age at the time that the lines had the opportunity to blur. There was a lot of work and effort to delineate the line between Rick as a staff person and Rick that they might see walking down Main Street. 
AS: Where you could have been their friend.
RM: I was of the age where that certainly could have been a possibility. I was someone they could have ran with. 
AS: After the lockdown Prescott dual diagnosis where did you go from there?
RM: I had a number of jobs that overlapped with each other so there’s not a really clean A, B, C. I worked at Metropolitan Clinic of Counseling for a number of years and did EAP [Employee Assistance Program] work for them for GE [General Electric] a number of years out of Eden Prairie. Most of it was telephonic. GE is a huge multi-national, international organization, so a lot of the stuff I did was assessment referral, telephone types of things. I worked on Prairie Island on the reservation for a while doing adolescent youth substance abuse counseling. I worked at Hudson Memorial Hospital doing the same type of thing. I worked at Dakota County Detox. I would have to go back and look at my resume. There are so many to try and remember. I worked at the Veteran’s Home in Hastings for three years before I came here and I’ve been here since 2001. 
AS: Let’s start with the nineties and your familiarity with what was happening with opiates and heroin.
RM: I’ve got a chart going back to about 1995 right now, so I can give you the whole thing from ‘95 to 2016. In Minnesota the number one substance that people come to treatment for has been and forever will be alcohol. It’s a little over fifty percent. When we are talking about what the client themselves identifies as their primary substance as time of admission into the treatment center. The data collection methodology we use is called EAAENS. So, slightly over fifty percent identify their primary substance as alcohol. Over the span of time the second most common type of substance abuse was marijuana up until just a couple of years ago. That was overtaken by pharmaceutical opioids and now has been taken over by heroin and methamphetamine. Cannabis as a primary substance has actually become kind of a B-squad. It is not as prevalent as defined by primary substance at time of admission. Alcohol use is still king of the hill, if you would, but then you have heroin and methamphetamine. 
A couple of general trends, if you would, were people that were coming to treatment back in the early mid-nineties still were what were thought of as single substance or primary single substance: they would just drink. Or their primary thing was cannabis, or their primary thing was cocaine. Today, that mono-drug user just doesn’t seem to exist anymore. Today there will be a stated preference for something, but it’s not a drug of choice. It’s more of a preference on a continuum. They prefer A but they use B and or C and or D. It’s more of a question of what is available and what they can get. 
Speedballing is really popular in the mid to late eighties and then it kind of went away now, but it has come back again. Speedballing was heroin and cocaine back then but today speedballing is heroin and methamphetamine. 
One of the things you notice over time are trends and patterns that ebb and flow, come and go. Alcohol still wears the crown, but then underneath that you see a lot of changes. Where we see a lot of notable changes in particular is in age range. Each substance and each combination has a different demographic. With pharmaceuticals or with heroin what used to be a forty or fifty year old age range back in the eighties now is twenty to twenty-four years old. The age of first treatment episode where the individual identifies heroin or a pharmaceutical opioid is about half what it was twenty, twenty-five years ago. The primary presenting client is much younger. Depending on what part of the state you look at there are specific concentrations for heroin in particular. In and around reservations in particular. The disproportionality of American Indians as compared to prevalence by population is vastly greater than it is for the general population. 
AS: So even as usage by young, white people has increased it still hasn’t proportionally reached the Native American population?
RM: It has. If you look at pure, raw treatment numbers caucasian is the highest for just about everything because eighty-odd percent of Minnesotans identify as white. In the state demographer’s statistics you will see that people that self-identify as American Indian are 1.1 percent of the population in Minnesota, yet when you break it down by drug of choice pharmaceutical drugs versus heroin versus methamphetamine or even general treatment numbers generally speaking when you control for incidents by thousand—in research epidemiology one of the ways we try to demonstrate the prevalence of something in a given population is we make a level playing field. Incidents by hundred or incidents by thousand are just a general way of doing that. So for treatment admissions for all substance abuse American Indians are about eight per thousand versus all other races combined which is a little bit about one per thousand. As you go into heroin or methamphetamine or opiates that goes anywhere from eight to about fifteen per thousand versus other races combined. There is a hugely disproportionate overrepresentation for opiates and methamphetamine for people who self identify as American Indian versus other races in Minnesota. I can send you those slides. You see that played out both as population demographics self identified as American Indian and the geography of Minnesota. Some of those maps you see the darker areas are almost exlusively around reservations. The one exception being Hennepin County, which is not immediately contiguous to the reservation, however there is a very large percentage of American Indians in and around Phillips and Little Earth and that area. 
AS: Can you back up and say what you said about when you started here in 2001. Can you describe what your job is and what your work is? The word opioid is in your job title. 
RM: I kind of carry two job titles here. We are a public union, so I am a principal planner. That is my technical job classification according to the union. One of the insular duties I have carried since I started here is State Opioid Treatment Authority, which used to be called State Methadone Authority, and then they changed that title four years ago. 
AS: Why did they change that?
RM: What used to be methadone treatment programs now expanded to other medications besides just methadone. There is methadone, buprenorphine, what was called WAM which is an acronym, you see vivitrol. They wanted to expand the title to be more inclusive rather than just identifying a particular medication: methadone. 
AS: And to identify what the problem was and not the medication used. 
RM: It’s a better descriptor of both problem and solution—I don’t like the word solution—intervention instead of just targeting one particular thing. 
AS: Why don’t you like the word solution?
RM: Well, I view addiction of whatever substance it happens to be a multifactoral issue, whatever you want to call it: a disease, a disorder, a maladaptive coping skill. There are a lot of schools of thought and philosophies about that. I don’t think I as a professional or we as an agency have a solution. There is not a single solution. Science isn’t that good. We don’t have the addiction pill to solve or resolve everything. When you look in the DSM-5 addiction, or in today’s world when we talk about substance use disorder there has been a lot of changes in the DSM—the diagnostic and statistics manual. When you look in the current edition you have specified from moderate to severe, and then you have symptom constellations, and certain numbers of all of these mean mild, moderate, or severe. There is a degree of volition involved in that. Passive exposure to something does not qualify as addiction. If somebody who may have intoxication from an inhalant because they work in the industry, but there is not volitional effort on their part to concentrate it—it is passive exposure because they inhaled sewer gas and hallucinated—they are not an addict in the same sense as a fetus that was born with neonatal abstinence withdrawal syndrome because of gestational exposure that child, baby, fetus, will have a recognized withdrawal syndrome, but the baby is not an addict because they had no volitional choice. If mom used while baby was on board the baby got some of the parent compound and the metabolite, versus volitional choice and going out and purchasing and using and stuff like that. I think I am diagnosing. [laughs]
AS: It is interesting. What about your job here? What have you been doing and what you’ve seen?
RM: Each state has at least one opioid treatment program and it has a SOTA—State Opioid Treatment Authority. There are forty-eight of us right now scattered throughout the country. Part of the SOTA role is to work as a go-between between state and federal agencies that regulate opioid treatment programs. We are the folks that try to knit stuff together for them. In Minnesota right now we have seventeen opioid treatment programs. One of them residential sixteen of them outpatient. They are licensed and regulated by a variety of different agencies both state and federal. 
AS: When you say opioid treatment programs do you mean what we would call methadone treatment clinics?
RM: What used to be referred to as methadone programs. 
AS: You regulate them?
RM: I function as a go-between is one way to describe it. While I do not have actual regulatory authority over them I am the guy that goes around and tries to knit everything together. You will have state and federal level requirements and things and I’m the one that explains and knits everything together. They have a Rule 31 license. By division of licensing they enforce that. They are registered as a narcotics treatment program by the DEA and they enforce that. They have to have an accreditation body like [unclear]. I’m the guy who runs around and knits all of that together. To keep the whole machine working. 
AS: What have you seen change? You said four years ago the name was changed, but what was happening before that? What is the difference between methadone programs then and now? 
RM: There are a couple of noticeable changes both in the clientele served and the method of service delivery. The clientele served back if we had had this conversation twenty odd years ago were almost exclusively heroin addicts. You didn’t often find a pharmaceutical opioid addict. Today there are a lot of pharmaceutical opioid addicts. In today’s world a lot of folks coming in and using heroin are the same folks that were coming in four, five, or six years ago that were using pharmaceutical opioids. They started out with vicodin, percodan, and percocet and either as a result of a legitimate medical etiology—sprain, break, or tear—or that was their substance at that time now have converted over to heroin. 
There are a couple of reasons for that. There have been changes in scheduling of some pharmaceuticals. There has been an examination by individual practitioners and larger chains of clinics or hospitals around their prescriptive practices. It’s not as easy to get the prescriptive opioids as it used to be. If you have a pool of people that have an active addiction to an opioid and the source of it starts to diminish they will come over here where they can get more, stronger, and cheaper. It is the migration of substance use. 
You see a change in the patient profile. It used to be forties and fifties and now it is twenty to twenty-four year olds. The gender changed a little bit but not as much. There was a vast discongruence in racial breakdowns too. It used to be primarily caucasian and some black. Now it is primarily Native American. There has been some shift in that. 
From a treatment intervention standpoint methadone and laam were the two original FDA approved medications to used. 
AS: What is laam? 
RM: Levacetylmethadate. That went off the market years ago. There was concern about it causing cardiac arrhythmia called QT prolongation. It is gone and you can’t find it anymore. That left methadone as the sole pharmaceutical for a time. Now you have methadone, buprenorphine products like suboxone and subutex and there are different formulations of those. There are tablets, strips, et cetera. There is vivitrol now, which is an injectible. A few others. 
Part of the desire to change the name from State Methadone Authority to State Opioid Treatment Authority was a reflection of the changes of both the drug of choice or the primary substance of abuse no longer being almost exclusively heroin and being the pharmaceutical pills as well as the treatment intervention not aimed solely at methadone but methadone and buprenorphine products and whatever the next intervention pharmaceutical happens to be. 
AS: What is your feeling about how treatment has changed in terms of the twelve-step model from the seventies and eighties? It seems to me that there were methadone clinics and those were people that were totally down and out. There is a huge stigma still around methadone. Can you tell me about what you’ve seen change and what you think about medication assisted treatment today? Where do you see it going?
RM: There has been a change in the acuity of the patients as well—the clients if you would—as well as with the age demographics and geographic areas. It used to be that heroin was primarily found in large, major metropolitan areas. You’d see it in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and Rochester. Now the maps indicate that it is everywhere. It’s not just the big city drug anymore. 
Along with that there have been responsive changes in the system. In the delivery of substance abuse treatment. If you go back the mentality—the zeitgeist—in the early mid-eighties was that everyone went to detox, twenty-eight day resident care, six months of a halfway home and then if that didn’t work it wasn’t because the system wasn’t responsive to their needs it was because they weren’t motivated or they hadn’t hit rock bottom yet. 
AS: It was the responsibility of the client. 
RM: This is back when the accepted standard were things like the hot seat. They would put you in a chair in a big circle and just pepper you with statements and questions until you broke down and cried and hit rock bottom. Then they would rebuild you and all this type of methodology. 
AS: Do you remember the names of some of the therapists that came up with that?
RM: If you just searched ‘Minnesota Model’ and ‘hot seat’ you will find a few agencies today that believe in that kind of methodology. It is decreasing. There has been a real awakening in what in today’s world I think is referred to as COD or dual diagnosis and co-occurring disorder. That is the popular term. The work I do as adjunct faculty at the graduate school is they have both a degree or Master’s confirmant in COD as well as a certification program in COD. There has been a real awakening to the idea that you aren’t just an addict or you don’t just have mental health issues. You can have both at the same time. Often one is in play or interlaced with the other. Part of that awakening is a change or an awareness that the clients coming in today are more acute than they used to be. 
In Minnesota we have what is called the Sixth Dimension model. It is a modification of the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s patient placement criteria. You have these six different dimension with a zero to four of severity or acuity rating. People coming into the system today are simply more acute than they used to be. Not only are they younger, but they are more severely affected and impacted at younger ages than they used to be. Some of that can be because of the purity of the drug. Some of it can be because of the social nature of heroin in particular. When you look at different drugs there is a different culture built around. Heroin in particular you see as a community drug. People will individually shoot heroin, but they will also do it in groups in the same vein you see people use marijuana part of the culture of marijuana is you will fire one up and pass it around the room versus tobacco and cigarettes where you don’t see that. 
The system itself has become more aware and more responsive to the acuity of the individual clients coming in. A big piece of that acuity is not only the drug itself, but the behavioral correlates that come along with that. There is an increase in mental health symptomology. If you reference the DSM 5 you will see things like ‘anxiety disorder induced by opiate withdrawal.’ There is a period of time where you have mental health symptom constellations that are a product of the intoxication or the withdrawal of the drug. They often respond to medications in the same way. Someone who comes into the emergency room or general medical care that looks like they have generalized anxiety disorder the gold standard in medicine for GAD—generalized anxiety disorder—is to use an an anxiolytic medication like alprazolam or phenazepam to treat anxiety. If you are an addict in withdrawal and you show up with a symptom constellation that looks like that that is the medication you are going to receive with no ill intent by the practitioner. That’s just what they see. That’s what their training tells them to give, which the addict will then use to modulate their withdrawal. They start to feel normal again and the cycle continues. 
With opioids you see an increase in a lot of secondary complications that come along with it too. The mental health stuff. You see a lot of additional use of potential addiction through the anxiolytic medications like alprazolam and phenazepam. You see a large incidence of blood borne pathogens with heroin addicts in particular because of route of administration with needles or behavior they may engage in as a product or byproduct of the addictive nature and addictive use of the drug. Hepatitis and HIV and things like that. Mary from RAAN [Rural AIDS Action Network] can speak directly about that. She has a lot of statistics and numbers about that. 
AS: You were talking about the Six Dimension model. 
RM: I can send you some stuff on that. It is a standardized method of assessment that we use for substance abuse treatment in Minnesota and have for a number of years now. It has six different dimentions that look at people more wholistically. It’s not just what is your drug of use, how often do you use it, when did you start using it. As an illustration dimension one is intoxication and withdrawal. Eveyone is rated zero through four. Zero is least impact and four is severe concern. With dimension one we look at intoxication withdrawal. We look at dimension two: biomedical. Does the individual have a traumatic brain injury that would affect where they would go for treatment? Also how treatment services would be delivered to them. 
Substance abuse treatment, especially in Minnesota as we have done it with the Minnesota Model where they talk about doing steps one through five and the third week is family week and how it used to be is a fairly academically driven method of service delivery that presupposed a level of cognitive ability on the part of the client that may or may not be there. Now that we have come mulitple generations down stream with what we know about FASD [fetal alcohol spectrum disorder] and neuroplasticity—how things affect the brain and how the brain responds to things—to take someone who has been an active rip and run heroin addict for the last five years and assume that they are going to be able to engage in a fairly literature based experience of reading the twelve and twelve, the schools and models, the Big Book, and completing these work books on steps one through five all in the span of twenty-eight days when you’ve been pumping delotive into yourself every six hours for the last two years—those two are discongruous. They don’t work well together. An individual client may fall behind and may not get their assignments done on time and depending on the sensitivity of the staff they are seen as resistant to treatment or not surrendering themselves. They blame the clients. The clients get frustrated and act out. Then they get washed out of the programs. 
AS: Then they are back on the streets. So how is this different? When did the Six Dimension model appear?
RM: It is about eight to ten years ago that we started doing it in Minnesota. 
AS: Who is the leader in doing this now?
RM: The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division. It is based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s model. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division, which is who I work here for are the ones who drove the idea of accepting a Minnesota-ized version here. Have you heard of the Rule 25 assessment tool? The Rule 25 assessment tool uses that Six Dimension model. When somebody has a Rule 25 done at the end of it you will see that they have a rating in dimensions one through six severity rating from one to four. That is the outcome of that. 
AS: That’s how if someone is on medicaid they need ninety days or thirty days. They look at the whole picture?
RM: Yes, they look at the whole picture. In and of itself it is not a determinate for the length of time of placement, but it does play a role in determining a level of care or type of care. If somebody is looking for an opioid treatment program in particular for heroin that is taken into account during that process. If someone has a traumatic brain injury in dimension two that would be taken into account. If somebody is homeless in their recovery environment in dimension six that is taken into account. There is a whole placement criteria of who goes to outpatient, who goes to residential care and stuff like that based on that assessment. In that Rule 25 tool there is also a mental health screening built into it two. The GAIN-SS short screen. 
Substance abuse treatment today I think is looked at more holistically than it used to be. It’s not that you’re just an addict. You can have an addiction and medical problems; you can have addiction and have mental health problems. It’s not A and B or chicken and egg. It’s more of a fused, integrated, co-occuring aspect. I think there is a greater sensitivity to that now. In the eighties you would hear a lot that people’s mental health problems would just go away if they quit using. It doesn’t necessarily work quite that cleanly. Or if you resolved your mental health problems your addiction would magically stop. That just doesn’t happen. 
There is a much greater awareness of how brain function is with PET scans and tomography and things like that. In the same sense there is a greater sensitivity that it’s not just cleanly this or that, but there is a fusion of all of it together. 
AS: And we don’t understand completely how it all interacts. There is more awareness about how complicated it really is. 
RM: Yes. There is a greater awareness of the complexity. The complexity of individuals and how delivery of treatment needs to be not just a cookie-cutter. You can’t just go to detox and just twenty-eight days of residential and just six months of halfway home. Or that this program is not the solution for everyone every time, every place, everywhere. 
AS: You see a more flexible, individualized treatment model?
RM: Yes. 
AS: Do you have any thoughts about the schedules and methadone and heroin and its regulation? Is there any chance that it would be downgraded or expanded?
RM: I’m not sure what you mean by downgraded. Methadone is a schedule two and buprenorphine is a schedule three now. 
AS: Right, so methadone is more highly regulated. You can only do it in certain places. Do you see that changing, or methadone programs becoming less stigmatized? 
RM: There is still stigmatizing to opiate treatment programs. By the DEA methadone is a schedule two. Buprenorphine products are schedule threes. Buprenorphine is a little different in that it can be used in an opiate treatment program and individual practitioners, MDs, DOs with training and additional registration and stuff can also do it out of OBOT—Office Based Opioid Treatment. Part of Buprenorphine’s introduction here in the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 was to make it more flexible for individual practitioners as opposed to having to go to a program. Methadone programs, whether it is methadone or buprenorphine through that program is still seen by many people as quote unquote harm reduction. 
In the eighties you had done everything there was to do and this was just palliative care. You were going to be there forever and this was the only thing left to offer you because everything else had failed. That’s not the attitude that you see today. Individuals may still have that belief. Certain funding streams or practitioners may believe that. Certainly the patient demographic has changed because it’s not just forty to fifty year old guy with three green teeth who has failed abstinence based treatment fifteen times. When you have people that are twenty to twenty-four showing up it’s more acceptable. 
There was a real prevalent belief that once you enrolled in an opiate treatment program in the eighties or nineties that you were there for life, but that’s simply not true. Our GAIN data tells us that an average admission to discharge timeframe is around a year and a half to two years right now. Now there’s a number of reasons that can play into that. It can be funding sources, people moving, people simply chosing to leave, people are sometimes removed from a program, administratively separated or discharged. There are a bunch of reasons why, but the fact of the matter is that the stories you hear about people who have been on methadone programs for thirty years are very small outliers at best. That’s not how the system works. 
AS: Those people are much older.
RM: There is a degree of aging out. Back in the eighties when you looked at the average person that was on a methodone program back then had a lot of additional medical complications to them. That’s not tremendously different now. We still see a lot of people that have Hepatitis or HIV or insilulary secondary problems, but there is a big difference between a fifty year old guy with a cirrhotic liver and hepatitis C and a twenty year old person that doesn’t have a cirrhotic liver and may have hepatitis in a system of health care and the ability to withstand that as a function of youth. Forty years of shooting smack versus a year and a half of pharmaceutical opioids are two very different people. The medical compromising of the older person versus the younger person is that the older person is going to hit mortality sooner than the younger person just as a function of physical decay over decades of use versus months or a couple of years. 
AS: What are you seeing about the positive outcomes with medication assisted treatment? Are you collecting data on that? Are people following clients over a period of time in the state?
RM: The short answer is yes, we do. Part of it depends on how you define success. Within that you have people that embrace any of the continuum of a definition of harm reduction. There are people that will tell you that their flavor of harm reduction is that the individual continues to come back, and whether they have intermittent use or continued use and continue to come back for some form of service. The back of the NA chip says, ‘Keep Coming Back.’ As long as you keep coming back, as long as there is the opportunity for continued intervention that’s better than nothing. 
As you move along a line of conservative interpretation of harm reduction they will tell you that there is success in a decreased amount of heroin used, or they have stopped heroin use, but they still only ocassionally smoke or drink marijuana, all the way through complete abstinance from any and all mood altering substances, maybe with the exception of tobacco and caffeine. There is a huge continuum along that line. Thirty or forty years ago it was kind of a one stop shop—either you were completely clean, minus tobacco and caffeine, or you were an active junkie. With the increasing complexity of people coming in with a lot of mental health stuff there is a greater acceptance of folks who have comorbid disorders and the use of psychotropic medications, too. It’s not that long ago, and you can still find self-help meetings around here, where they will tell you if you are on psychotropic medication you’re not sober. Or if you’re on methadone or buprenorphine or any other medication assisted therapy you’re not really sober. 
There’s nowhere else in behavioral health or med/surg that you see that type of mentality applied. I hold licensure as a drug and alcohol abuse counselor. I also hold licensure as a LPCC—a Licensed and Professional Clinical Counsellor which is a mental health professional by state definition. If I am working with somebody who is a heroin addict and we talk about medication assited therapy and we are talking primarily about methadone or buprenorphine products, if I’m working with someone who is an active hallucinatory psychotic that’s on Seroquel, which is any typical antipsychotic, nowhere in his or her treatment plan do we talk about trading off of Seroquel. Nowhere do we say, “Your life will be much better if you don’t have to keep taking that Seroquel.” 
When you talk to folks who have a bipolar disorder we talk about compliance to medication to stabilize mood, not withdrawal from medication to see if you’re all better now. Only here when we talk about active addiction do we seem to find that. Even within addiction there is a bifurcation of that mentality. There are folks who find it completely acceptable for somebody who has difficulty or is unable to stop drinking being on Antabuse Disulfiram there is a real behavioral modification way of trying to address a spiritual disorder. If you take Disulfiram or Antabuse, but you don’t drink alcohol, you might have some of the noticable sideaffects like dry mouth, loose stool, and stuff like that, but really nothing bad happens. If you take Antabuse and you drink you’re sicker than hell and puking that’s completely okay because then you are being punished for your addiction versus taking an opioid repalcement medication where if you are at normal therapeutic dose you are just normal. You’re not high and you’re not in withdrawal. You just feel normal. But then for some reason we have to talk to you about titrading off of that or weaning off of that medication because we know you really want to be ‘sober’ and you can’t be if you are still taking this medicine. Then somehow we don’t want to talk about that with anything else. “You came in today and we checked your diabetes profile and your ANC [absolute neutrofil count] is fourteen right now and your glucose is close to six hundred, but we really want to get you off of that insulin.” You don’t see those kinds of discussions in other forms of health care. 
AS: Which is a huge stigma and a huge problem. I went to Zurich a couple of months ago and met with the director of an addiction medicine clinic and because they had the needle parks in Zurich in the eighties where they had so many deaths and so much illness and how they treated that problem all on its own using medication and basically have eliminated it. People don’t do heroin very much there anymore. I just got this perspective that it’s really how we perceive it and you were just getting to that with your examples. Do you see any way in the near future where we could change the thinking and attitudes around it? Are we stuck with this hundred year old opium junkie stereotype?
RM: I think there are couple of ways and I can give you a few angles. If you go back forty or fifty years it was actually illegal to treat an addict with an opioid. There was one treatment center in the country and it was the Federal Narcotics Farm [unclear]. It was an old renovated prison. Doctors Nyswander and Dole published a landmark paper at the end of the ‘67 or ‘68 about the use of what was then the narcotic replacement was methadone—dolophine—because it has a long half life of twenty-four to thirty-six hours and all the pharmacology about it they were able to maintain addicts. There has been a shift away from incarceration—the Federal Narcotics Farm—you would go there for anywhere from twenty-one days to six months and then you either ‘got the cure’ or you didn’t and you would come back. There has been a shift away from that to the idea of methadone for those people that somehow couldn’t be reached by anybody else. 
Then you have the DATA [Drug Addiction Treatment Act] 2000 act with buprenorphine which was a very volitional, intentional act to try to destigmatize the use of medication out of a physician’s office versus going to that clinic. Prior to 2001 the Food and Drug Administration, which still plays a role, had a much larger role in regulation of methadone programs. Under those old rules and 21 CFR 291 505 you could never get anymore than a twenty-one day take home dose regardless of the amount of time you had been on the program. 
The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment steps in as the new agency in 2001 with new regulations that are more laxed or more understanding. I think the best example of that is the idea that you could never have more than two weeks of take home medication because all you are going to do is sit around and be stoned anyway versus the idea of getting people to be more normal. There is an eight-point criteria now to get take home doses and among some of those eight-point criteria and among treatment plans today is going to school, going to work, and doing the stuff that ‘normal’ people do so that you don’t just go to the clinic everyday to dose. The idea is to get you to be less and less reliant on the clinic and things like that and more and more engaged in normal ADL—activities and daily living stuff. 
Making it more acceptable to have take-home medications, having a degree of expectations that is flexible to individual needs rather than this is how we are doing it and if you don’t like it that’s too bad. I think there are landmarks that show you from the days of the Federal Narcotics Farm up through today where there is a greater empathy and understanding and expanse of the complexity of the individual client or patient, as well as the flexibility required to meet the individual. It’s not just an inner-city drug anymore. It’s not just that old dope fiend anymore. When it’s the twenty year old girl from Eagan shooting smack versus the sixty year old Hmong guy in upper Frogtown those are two very different people. It is the same drug, but the dynamics, the cultures, and the expectations are very differnt. They are all still in Minnesota. They are twenty miles apart from each other. The one size fits all has given way. 
I think there is hope. In the same vein there is competing interests. When you look at the DEA they by its nature is an enforcement authority that looks at scheduling and regulation more from a law enforcement standpoint versus DHS issued license Rule 31, which is more soft-science treatment standpoint. Rule 31 is the chemical dependency licensure for Minnesota. There are different agencies that have competing interests in the sense of regulation and the sense of funding. 
The one thing you can never control for in any piece of research is who funded it. People fund studies to get answers that they want to get. If they get answers they don’t want they stop funding or they don’t publish it. 
AS: Do you see any new changes coming down the pipe for treatment in Minnesota?
RM: Yesterday President Trump issued an executive order establishing an opioid commission. It just happened yesterday. On that commission there is a variety of individuals and titles. Some of them have yet to be determined, but it’s an interesting make up in the text of the executive order involving the Secretary of Defense. There has certainly been demonstrated change from the Federal Narcotics Farm through this stuff today. 
Now, policies are primarily created by politics, and politics gives and changes and ebbs and flows. As a sideline if you look at cannabis right now it has continued to be a schedule one all along here, which by definition is highly addictive and of no medical value. Yet, you have a large number of states that have medical cannabis laws—thirty-eight I believe—and then some of those that have recreational cannabis laws. There is this discongruency between federal scheudling by the DEA and individual states recognizing medical cannabis like Minnesota does, or recreational cannabis like Colorado. What is going to happen with the current federal administration and that state ‘sovereignty’ for medicinal or recreational cannabis is to be determined. People have theories and guesses but who knows. 
With the awakening and awareness of what is going on just in the last fifteen years or so with a greater sensitivity to co-occuring disorders, to the interlacing to substance abuse and mental health, the introducation and increasing acceptance of medication as a legitimate intervention—not necessarily a solution, but part of the equation—gives me hope that that can continue. Even though I think that is a pervasive trend—you have pockets of greater acceptance and pockets of deeper resistance to it. There are still folks who absolutely delieve that addicts should go into withdrawal and suffer. They shouldn’t die, but they should suffer because that is somehow going to make them reevaluate before they go and use again. If it was that simple nobody would ever have a second mind crushing hang over when they were an undergraduate. The first time you wrap your head around a toilet and gag your guts out you would never go out and drink again. IT just doesn’t work that way. 
There’s no addict booth at career day. People don’t choose this whether it is prescription pharmaceuticals, whether it’s heroin, whatever the drug or the method it is a condition that comes into play and prominence and in my opinion it should be treated as that. To stigmatize, lay blame, and point fingers at this group or that group is simply not true because it’s not that fifty year old carnie guy with green teeth and the body mask of Kid Rock anymore. It hasn’t been for a long time. 
AS: I don’t know if it has ever been. 
RM: Right, but people have that image. People have the image of the stereotypic heroin user and they think of Keith Richards. They don’t think of a twenty year old kid who is an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. 
I do adjunct facutly at River Falls and I teach an addiction class at the graduate program down there and The Voice is the student newspaper and five or six years ago one of the headlines of The Voice was a kid they found dead in one of the dormitories who still had the needle in his arm. He was a young, novice user who was really narcotically naive and got ahold of a hot load and had no idea what the actual strength was. He had an unintentional hydrogenic overdose because he didn’t know. That’s why you see so much overdose with younger people. 
When you look at the common profile for heroin addicts and opiate addicts right now they bifuracte pretty cleanly into the young ones and the older guys—I’m saying guys as a term and mean the older population. The older population are the people who just won’t die. They know how to live, how to survive, they know how to come down, and they take care of each other in groups. The young, narcotically naive, novice kids who think they’re superman and bullet proof have no idea that the stuff they just bought from the new handyman across the street is cut with fentanyl and will kill you stone dead. They don’t know that so they solulate it up and fire it in and they have a hydrogenic overdose from it. Dead addicts can’t recover. 
AS: There is a lot of stuff saying it is the pharmaceuticals that have made this younger generation’s access to opiates and adderall—they aren’t as frightened of drugs because they have been accustomed to them. They have a belief that heroin is just the same thing. Would you say that the pharmaceutical culture we live in has increased their nonchalance around it’s danger?
RM: There seems to be nonchalance about it. Younger people today of sixteen to twenty-four or twenty-five are always kind of the petrie dish of that generation’s culture. We have gone through the grunge kids, the emo kids, now you are into the social media, Twitter, and Facebook generation and all that. On that course of line you see a huge, vast influx of various medications, a greater willingness to use pharmaceutical intervention, which is both good and bad. Along with the acceptance of pharmaceutical intervention for an addict comes pharmaceutical intervention and a greater perponderance for things like ADD and ADHD. Back in my day there was not such a swiftness to diagnose someone as ADHD and Ritilin was about the only thing around. Now you’ve got adderall and everything else. There’s a greater buffet line of medicine intervention. The advertisements you see on television, if you even watch commercial tv anymore. You look at magazines with large-scale full glossy ads. There’s a lot of work done from companies for that. I think that is a piece of it. 
We also live in a culture whose tag line from my point of view seems to be ‘how fast can you burn and how far can you go?’ Faster, bigger, badder, harder, stronger, whether you’re talking about bycinopril because you’ve got high blood pressure and colesterol or viagra single pack ads. Everything today is flooded by pharmaceuticals. We went through the energy drink craze that was pretty targetted at adolescents, specifically male adolescents. 
AS: And couldn’t you argue that those drinks are a sort of gateway to other things?
RM: There are folks who would argue that. Caffeine is one of the ten categories in the current DSM for addicitive disorder. I think there’s hope for continued if not standard acceptance of individuals who have substance abuse and mental health disorders. I think there’s the opportuity for continued work with medication as well. I don’t think medication is exclusively the answer. I think it’s got to be a combined effort just as you have compelxity of the client you need increasing responsiveness of the treatment system of delivery. Like I said before you can’t control who funds the research and you don’t always get to control the social outcome of political decisions. 
AS: That makes me think of prevention education. Do you have a role in any of that?
RM: Our office does. The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division does have a prevention section to it. There’s not a whole lot that I do. 
AS: Has it changed from D.A.R.E. [Drug Abuse Resistant Education] program? Are they willing to talk more specifically about the dangers in public school systems?
RM: The Alcohol and Drug Abuse division does not directly fund D.A.R.E. and there isn’t any direct federal funding for D.A.R.E. Most of that is what we’ve done. There is money available—in fact Minnesota is one of the recipients of what’s called SPF RX—the Strategic Prevention Framework around Prescrition Opioids. The A and D division upstairs did receive some money from that. They are going to implementing it as part of their prevention strategy and framework this year. 
A treatment service delivery model does more with treatment than we do with prevention. When you talk about prevention you are trying to prevent something that already happens. To try to quantify and measure a negative is by its definition is difficult if not impossible versus when we look at numbers and stats and figures of teatment admissions and stuff liek that is all data gathering after the fact. So Joe comes into treatment and we ask Joe all kinds of questions and then we compile stats and numbers versus prevention where you try to prevent those numbers from ever happening.
There is an industry to treatment. There is funding and there is revenue to be created off of it. If you talk about revenue of prevention you are trying to prevent damage. 
AS: There’s not much money in prevention, is there?
RM: Not compare to treatment, no. 
AS: Anything else?
RM: The only thing I have to remind you is that I’m not saying anything as an official representative of the Department of Human Services. There’s truly no way to separate my role as the State Opioid Treatment Authority from our discussion here, but I just want for the record that I do hold those two faculty positions at Adler and River Falls, so I’m speaking in a multi-layered role and some of this is stuff I do in Minnesota, but also with Adler graduate school or University of Wisconsin at River Falls where the course work I teach is the education of young clinicians, especially Adler with their COD program, is the sensitivity about substance use disorder and mental health as a fused individual, which is an Adlerian concept by itself. With River Falls it is guidance counselors and psychologists, so it’s helping assisting or educating future professionals to be more sensitive and flexible and to increase the acuity of people coming in. The volume of medical knowledge seems to double every couple of years now with increases from everything from brain imaging to epigenetics to everything else. WE simply learn more and more at a faster rate. Because we learn more we hopefully have a greater sensitivity for the given complexity of it, and then out of that a need for us to become more flexible in our response with folks. We can’t lock you up for six days of detox and throw you twenty-eight days of residential care and then if it doesn’t work blame you for the failure. 
AS: Thank you."

MO: Insurance companies know this. Why are we spending thirty grand a month for something that could be costing us seven thousand a month if the outcomes are the same? Hazelden you can't even get a cup of tea, everything is so bare bones right now. Every budget is slashed right now. I wish them well.
AS: First thing I need you to do is state your name and that you give me permission to record this interview.
MO: This is Michael O'Neill it is January 19th. I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this interview. 
AS: We're sitting in my home, 1942 Irving Avenue South. Also present is Zachary Mallet. Did I say it right?
ZM: Mallet. 
AS: Sorry. Mike we know each other and so I'm going to do my best to not presume in our conversation. You can tell me things you've already told me before. In my questions I'll make sure I do my best to make it clear for the purposes of this recording. What I do with parents is I start with their own childhood and their early adulthood and some of their early parenting experiences. I basically want you to tell me a condensed version of your life, keeping in mind where addiction or other issues you can kind of see. 
MO: I was born in Ohio in 1963. My dad knew that Youngstown, Ohio was not going to have a future for his very large family. I was the twelfth child born to Catholic parents. My dad just had the foresight to see there wasn't going to be a future there for his family so he took a big risk and moved to Southern California which not many people were doing at the time. A lot of people were doing it but most people were like, ""Who wants to go live in that god awful desert? There're  no trees."" I moved out there. Honestly growing up in Orange County in the 1960s and 70s was dreamy. I say I grew up in sunshine. I remember lolling around on the floor in sunny windows. I had two very functional parents. I went to a good Catholic school which was a good experience. It was also a tough experience. I learned a lot about shaming. I learned about control that I didn't like. I grew up with lots of brothers and sisters that I got along with well and loved dearly and did lots of things with. I had lots of friends. I just had tons of friends ever since kindergarten. Life was pretty good. It was good to be me. I got to spend my summers at the beach and it was easy. I never saw anything but pretty much middle class function. There were a few kids that went to my school that definitely had more challenges than I did. I wasn't that tuned in on it. There were kids that didn't want you to come over to their house. 
I started to notice as I got older, I have lots of older brothers and sisters up to twenty years older than me. They were long gone by then. Some of them were moving out at sixteen because of all the kids in the house. That my house was a refuge for a lot of my older brothers and sisters, they had friends that they were with all the time and they spent a lot of time at our house. I didn't understand. Some of these women were like other sisters to me they were around so much. They kind of helped care for me. I didn't know that they came from really tough houses and our house was a haven. My mom was a gracious, giving, loving person. They didn't have that. The holidays there were anywhere from forty to seventy people in our house at the holidays. So many of them were these older teenagers who basically home wasn't a good place. My mom had gifts for them and she'd cook for them and she would talk to them. She would counsel them like a healthy adult would which they didn't have access to. I started to become more aware of that later on and I actually really admired that. That people looked up to my family and that, ""You're so lucky"" and stuff. 
There was definitely a culture of drugs and alcohol in my family. My dad drank but not a lot. He would drink nightly when he got home from work but he would drink a little bit and have dinner. He'd have a drink, he'd have dinner, he would maybe have another drink after dinner maybe not, then he would read the paper and go to bed. He ran his own business. My mom was a little bit of wine on a Friday night, that was about it. Older brothers and sisters drank a lot. Some of them did, some of them didn't at all. Some of them couldn't finish a beer if they had to in a night. Others couldn't have less than ten beers. I definitely at a young age started to see drunks in my house. Either my brothers and sisters’ friends, this is the 1960s, early 70s, lots of marijuana, lots of alcohol and no doubt other stuff that was going on that I wasn't keen on or aware of at the time. I became very attracted to it when I was in junior high school. I knew it was a matter of time before I was going to enter that arena. Sneaking a drink here or there at a wedding was one thing. At my thirteenth birthday I smoked pot for the first time with my sister. I couldn't wait for it, just couldn't wait. It was just kind of dark and mysterious and lovely and away I went. 
Probably the most regrettable choice of my life was using drugs and drinking alcohol when I was a teenager. I used excessively in high school. I smoked pot pretty much on a daily basis all throughout high school. I drank pretty much every weekend, definitely to excess. I got kicked out of high school. Easily one of the smartest kids, just natural ability, things were easy for me. I could test out with “As” on everything but couldn't finish assignments, I couldn't stay in class. I just was bored out of my mind. I really wasted a lot of really good opportunities because I was way more interested in partying. I got into the business world. 
AS: No college?
MO: Just a little bit of junior college. That's it. I liked it but I had to go make money. It took a lot of extended focus. Paying attention was always a challenge for me. Off I went into the business world. All I can say is I was lucky. I got into cocaine way too much in my early twenties. I never stole or anything like that but spent too much of my own money and lied a lot about it. I didn't like that I was always having to justify. I didn't like that. My friends and I were always lying all the time about our lives. ""It was free tonight.""
AS: You were lying about how much money you were spending.
MO: You were stealing from yourself is what you were doing. 
AS: You would have to justify it to other people.
MO: ""This one was free tonight because I did this deal for this guy and I helped him find some other people."" You just knew everybody was lying and you knew you were lying and I didn't like that. Cocaine was a problem. The real problem was the alcohol that went with the cocaine because of the high, the amphetamine high and then to neutralize. I've had hangovers for like three days before from cocaine binges and the alcohol. I could feel my kidneys just aching. In my mid-twenties, maybe it was my frontal cortex came along, I was twenty-three and I had a horrible experience with cocaine one weekend and I just stopped cold turkey. I just said, ""I'm done with that."" I knew enough to stay away from the people that I used with. Pretty soon I was used to not doing it and I was okay. I still drank alcohol but not...It was just weird. My brain was changing and I was just less interested in partying like that, I just was. I was lucky because a lot of the people I grew up with are dead, are locked up, are institutionalized or basically still live at their parents’ house in their fifties. Their lives never changed. I love those guys dearly but I just knew I couldn't be around them. I got lucky. 
AS: When you say the business world what were you doing?
MO: I was doing promotional marketing. I was going around the country and anytime a big company was going to introduce a product to the market there was a giant assault on Peoria or whatever. Coupons, and billboards, and newspaper fliers, and coupons, and ads on TV. We would show up with the samplers in supermarkets. Sampling yogurt, or bacon, or paper towels, or Nestle Quick, in thousands and thousands of stores across the entire Midwest. It was fun.
AS: They would fly you here?
MO: They'd fly me there and I'd be in a market for anywhere from two weeks to six weeks at a time. Four weeks in El Paso, Texas was the longest summer of my life. It was good. I learned a lot. I got into that business. I got into HR and I was doing training. Part of it I really liked. I liked the development, people development. Part of it I didn't like because mostly I had bosses who were just crappy. They just weren't very good leaders at all. Some of them were really smart about business but that didn't really matter. The ones that I did like were few and far between. I was kind of interested in that. 
I had a big triggering event for me. I hired a young woman who was really terrific, just fantastic. I was so proud to have her come join our team. The day she was supposed to show up she didn't show up and I was pretty pissed. I made a bunch of phone calls. The next day I found out she was hit head on and was killed the week before. She was pacing herself to see how long it would take her to get to our office. She was hit. She was a newlywed. I was devastated, just devastated. I didn't even really know exactly what was going on but I was bereft. 
Not long after that I went to the food marketing show in Chicago and I went and saw some improv theater and I thought, ""God that was awesome."" Somebody in the group who I didn't even know, I had just met them said, ""You know what? You'd probably be good at this. You should move to Chicago."" I'm like, ""I can't do that. I'm going to be a vice president."" I think a week later I gave a two weeks notice and I moved to Chicago and went and studied improv theater for three and a half years. Best move I ever made in my entire life. I moved to a big city, learned a lot about me, learned a lot about society, getting on stage doing improvisation and you will find out who you are. It will tap into all of your darkest fears. Seriously. It will tear at you and you will find out how much you spend time in your head and how much you were trying to protect an image. It's an amazing equalizer. I got to watch some ridiculous talent in Chicago at the time. Amy Poehler was one of my classmates. 
AS: Were you at Second City?
MO: Yes, I was a student at Second City. Steve Carrell was one of my teachers. I used to watch Stephen Colbert on a pretty much nightly basis. He was a remarkable talent, not entirely brilliant but he was just so brave. I'd just watch a person fail, and fail, and fail, and fail and then take off like a bird. That's a rare thing. Tina Fey was just about a year behind me in the classes. It was an awesome group of talented people that it was great to be around, thrilling to be around. Artistic people and people who really gave a damn, social activism that I didn't grow up around in the very white Orange County, California. 
I met my former wife in Chicago. We got married and knew we weren't going to stay in Chicago because we'd end up out in the 'burbs and we didn't want to. We moved back to Minnesota where she is from and I really liked Minnesota. In '97 we had a son. My son Devin was born. It was just everything I've always wanted. I've grown up around tons of children, nieces and nephews, and I've always enjoyed children but I knew I wasn't a very mature young adult. I didn't want to get married or have kids when I was young. Here I was at thirty-four and I had my first child. He was just delightful. He was just a lovely little guy. I was just madly in love with him, we did so much stuff together. 
His mom was way more into labelling. ""He's a spirited child."" He's just a kid you know. He got along with everybody. Every kid liked Devin. He just followed along. All through school every review of teachers was, ""I wish I had ten Devins in every class."" That being said, it's like, I wish he would say more. He plays very safe. he doesn't say much. He's compliant. He's a nice person. There's no problems with him ever, at all. He seems to hang around the good kids. They seemed to guide him. He was kind of a follower. Attention deficit like me, no doubt about it. No hyperactivity at all. He had a really hard time paying attention to just about anything. He grew up in Montessori which is very self-directed. He would find the path of least resistance constantly. ""Can we just go do nothing? Awesome.""
AS: Again today?
MO: They would reel him in on that. His sister Anna was two and a half years younger than him. They were super tight. They did everything together. They were just in each other's shadows. She adored him. She wore his hand-me-down Buzz Lightyear shoes and underwear and she said, ""I'm not a gore."" Girl. ""I'm not a gore. I'm a boy. It's not a ja-jina, it's a peen."" I was like, okay I've got a trans daughter or a son or whatever. Your choice, kid that's cool Those two were very tight. She was very self-directed. She was her own little boss. She just knew what she wanted and she thrived in Montessori. Devin didn't. 
Devin's mom, Anna's mom, Amy is her name, Amy and I are definitely two different people. Whether times were good or bad it was kind of a constant stress between us. It was hard being married. We really like each other, in fact we loved each other very much but it just wasn't going to sustain. We were just wired so entirely differently. In 2010 we separated and got back for a short amount of time but it just wasn't going to work. I moved to Denver, Colorado to separate ourselves. I knew divorce was just impending and I just wanted to get away from...I just had to go heal up for a while and get away from all this. I was traumatized, not that I wasn't going to be married anymore—that was actually kind of a relief. Not that she's a bad person, but it was toxic that we were together. Just traumatized that I wasn't going to be under the same roof as my kids. That was horrid. That I wasn't going to be there with them and have dinner with them and make them breakfast. That was terrifying to me. Probably the biggest trauma I'd had in my life up until that point. They were just too young. I knew I wasn't going to make their lives more toxic by having them tolerate parents who didn't get along. 
AS: How old were they at that point?
MO: Devin was thirteen, Anna was ten. I was in Denver, Devin just started eighth grade at the public school and his mom called me and said, “Hey are you sitting down?” I said, “I am as a matter of fact, I’m in my car. What’s going on?” “Devin’s been kicked out of school.” “Okay. What happened?” “He was selling pot from the bus.” Day one. Day one of eighth grade he had marijuana and he sold some marijuana to somebody on the bus and of course thirteen year olds leak the story. Maybe was he fourteen by then? Doesn’t matter. He got kicked out of school. They interrogated him, it was not okay the way they interrogated him. It was sort of no amnesty at all, you’re out. 
AS: No tolerance. This was a public school?
MO: It was a public school. He went back to the Montessori school for eighth grade which he was miserable about. It’s like, “You know what? You are totally in charge of this having happened.” We tried as much as we could to talk about, and we got divorced that fall, to talk about divorce and having talked to counselors. He was pretty surly, pretty pissed off. He was a pissed off eighth grader. “I don’t care about the divorce. It doesn’t matter. It’s okay. It’s okay.” I figured it was a problem but he just said, “It’s okay. It’s okay. Just shut up. Leave me alone.” 
He got through eighth grade and was starting to hang out with some older guys who just were not very positive elements at all. He’s always been a follower. Groups of guys hanging out wanting to cause trouble want to find followers. They always want to build their pack. They were just kind of lost souls, if you will. He was probably smoking cigarettes with them. At the time, I find out later that’s when he started to actually eat OxyContin. He was eating Oxis, occasionally. They started out free of course. Smoking pot here and there but for the most part we didn’t find, he never came home drunk, we didn’t find and paraphernalia on him. We thought we were, because both his mother and I had had experience with youth drinking alcohol and using drugs that we’d for sure know. I think he knew enough that we were savvy so he was pretty discreet about his use. As far as we know no heavy use in eighth grade. 
Freshman year was pretty much just disastrous, just barely enough, path of least resistance just enough to get by. He swam, he was a swimmer. Sophomore year same thing, just barely enough to get by. Interestingly enough a counselor at school, this is telling because it kind of shows up later, a counselor at his school happens to get a hold of Devin’s academics and it wasn’t his counselor, it was a different counselor. I don’t know how this happened or who this guy was but he was an angel if you ask me. He said, “Hey come into my office. You’re actually a smart kid. Based on what I can see here you’re smart enough to be an AP student next year.” He did because his best friend is really academic, scholarly young man. Devin says he didn’t know what that was. “You know what? You can be an AP student next year if you turn this around the rest of this year. What do you want to do about that?” It’s interesting all of his life we’d been saying, “You can do better. You’re smarter than this.” It’s just like Charlie Brown’s teacher, “Wamp, wamp, wamp.” A stranger happened to see something that he thought was promising and all of a sudden it kind of took hold and Devin worked hard that second half of his sophomore year. He got into AP classes his junior year. 
AS: Was he in a public school by this point?
MO: He’s in public school. He’s in Chaska High School which at the time was huge, it hadn’t split yet. It was an enormous high school. It had lots of wealthy Chanhassen kids, farm kids from Carver County, lots of Latino kids from down by the river. It was a pretty diverse mix of a very very large high school where you can get lost. You can hide out in a big school like that. His junior year he was taking AP classes. He had to hang out with kids who were good AP students. He had to follow them and learn how to study and learn how to do homework and learn how to prep. He struggled mightily with all the courses, especially the AP courses but he was passing them. His junior year his swimming was great. By springtime he was really fit and I’m like, “Yay! We raised a good kid.” We were kind of cocky about it, I was. 
AS: Are you back here at this point or are you still in Denver?
MO: I’m living in Chaska with my fiancée Priscilla. She was living with me in Chaska. That junior year Cilla and I got married up at Lake Superior. Devin was there with his sister and Cilla’s two grown children. Cilla’s two grown children and my son smoked pot that weekend up at that rented house we were at. No big deal, seriously not a giant big deal that teenagers smoke a little pot. In the spring his mom found him smoking dope in the house and we confiscated some buds from him. Then all of a sudden it was interesting he started to get pretty surly. A very gentle, compliant, nice young man was all of the sudden showing a nasty side of him. It was uncomfortable but it was also like he was expressing himself. He kind of wanted to create his own space and keep what was his. Basically he blamed us. “There was no problem until you caught me. Everything was fine.” And it was. “It was a really good springtime until you caught me. So I’m not the problem, you’re the problem.” Oh okay. We started to sporadically test him and he was testing negative with urine analysis. 
That summer he was working at a restaurant and he really liked it. They really liked him and he was making money and he was making friends at work. His high school buddies and he was hanging out with some older kids and meeting customers. The diner busboy and waiter and cook and all kind of aprons at that place. It was a pretty good summer overall. There were a couple things we were starting to just notice a change. He was becoming more of an adult for one thing. There was a bit of a darkness that was starting to show up. It got my attention and it got his mom’s attention. Sometimes it was him being sort of a brooding seventeen-year-old and other times it was weird, there was a transformation going on there. I had a brand new marriage. 
We rented a beach house in California in August and the morning that we were to go I found Devin spaced out in the kitchen, no in the basement, gaming at six in the morning or five in the morning. We had to get on a plane pretty soon. He was tripping really hard. We didn’t know what was going on and we didn’t know if we were going to be able to get him on a plane or not. Ultimately we found out what he did was he ate a bunch of Ambien and then if you stay awake, if you don’t fall asleep it tries to put you to sleep but if you can stay awake through that it’s like a Quaalude, you don’t fall asleep you trip. He was tripping and he doesn’t even know how much he took. It was not a good sign at all, that he was experimenting. The internet had loads of methodologies out there. He started his senior year at Normandale [Community College]. He was a PSEO student, is that what they call it?
AS: Yes.
MO: He was going to start to chop away some college credits. Things almost immediately got dark. Things started to really get bizarre. He had his own car so he was commuting to school. It was a lot of mysterious behavior. Lots of, “I need to bring something to my math teacher at nine o’clock at night.” Really? If he says he does, he does right? His mom just got married. So she was in a brand new marriage. I was in a new marriage. Amy calls and says, “Hey are you sitting down?” “No. Tell me what’s going on.” “Devin’s been fired from his job.” “What’s going on?” “He stole five hundred dollars cash, taken it out of the till.” 
AS: From the restaurant?
MO: From the restaurant. We called the guy who fired him. Devin was devastated. He was just demoralized. He was just dropping into a hole having been caught doing this. It was interesting, the guy said, “Hey I don’t know what’s going on with him but six months ago he was our best employee and everyone loved him. Customers, employees, bosses. Couldn’t pick a better guy. Six months later he’s the fucking worst. We were ready to fire him anyway. He’s just awful. This is a firable charge. We could actually press charges but we’re not going to because I suspect there’s something definitely wrong with your son and you should check what’s going on.” As soon as I got off the phone I called my wife who was at work and I said, “Do you have cash here at the home?” She did, she had several hundred dollars stashed to give to her sons for birthdays and stuff. That money was gone. We started to find close to a thousand bucks had already been…He just said it was cigarettes and gas money which was bullshit. It wasn’t. 
My wife works at a family practice clinic. A physician in her clinic, Dr. Levy, is an addiction specialist. She was telling him about these patterns and he said that was really telling. He asked her, “Does this guy Devin have any felonies.” She said, “No, I don’t think so. No.” He said, “I assure you he’s engaged in felony behavior. I assure you.” I called Amy and told her that, Devin’s mom, we started to circle the wagons around a…we didn’t know he was a heroin addict. He’s a poly-user but he had started to go from eating, snorting, smoking Oxi to snorting and smoking heroin and finding out it’s cheaper and much more effective to shoot it. He was shooting dope. He was dealing. He was dealing club drugs. The entire southwest metro my son was the dealer. He was the big connect for all the schools down there which was very demoralizing to me. 
Things came to a head. We really started to circle things up pretty tight on him. He was very vicious. It was very dark because we were cutting off his…when you cut off an addict’s supply it’s like you’re cutting off his air. He was getting incredibly mean and really dark. Turns out he was terrified of the heroin but he couldn’t quit. He tried to quit on his own. He was going through horrible withdrawals and then he would go and score again. It got to a point where he forged a check, drove to Minneapolis to go score, he went to go just by a couple of premade syringes to kill himself. He was going to kill himself with heroin that night. He gave a couple guys a hundred bucks and those angels flew away, they just took his money and said, “We’re not going to get him anything. We’re just going to take the money for ourselves.” They didn’t give him anything. He ended up overdosing on DXM which is just over-the-counter cough medicine. That’s all he could get. He was so desperate which isn’t lethal. It could kill you if you took enough. Basically it put him into Hennepin County Medical Center, he was in the emergency department for overnight and then spent four days in the ICU. We were just devastated that our son was as sick as he was.
AS: He had done cough syrup but he was also in withdrawal. 
MO: Oh yeah.
AS: So he was in opioid withdrawal. 
MO: He was in opioid withdrawal and then took all this over-the-counter DXM which really messes with your blood pressure. He was in Hennepin County Medical Center and circling the drain but mostly terrified, mostly so scared, very very sad.
AS: When was this Mike?
MO: This was November of 2015. We got him into Hazelden. He did the outpatient. You’re under the illusion that twenty-eight days sleep is going to shine him up and take some of the dents out and he’s coming home. He was just clean, that’s really all he was. He was surly. The Twelve Step didn’t mean anything. Instantly right off the bat he was saying, “I’m just going to go back to smoking pot and drinking because that was fine. That’s not a problem. I’m just not going to do heroin anymore.” “You can’t do that now.” “I can. I’ll be fine. Just leave me alone.” 
Happened to find out that this was where the anger really started to come up, he was dealing directly with gangs in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Russians and Latin Boys. He had carried a series of weapons, one, two, three pistols including a cop killer, including a forty-five with cop killer rounds. Those rounds would go right through a vest. Found out that he’s been shot at, found out that he has shot at people. He was hanging out with the gang and he threw a pistol out the window. He fired some rounds at boys who were in a neighborhood, in a neighborhood! He robbed a person at gunpoint. He robbed a couple people on the street at gunpoint. 
AS: When did you find all this out?
MO: Just found out about all that from debriefing and Hazelden. He was still a minor so we had access to his interview records and stuff. 
AS: He was seventeen?
MO: He was seventeen. He was seventeen doing horrid felonies at great risk to kill himself and kill other people. That’s when my rage really came up. I was just unbelievably distraught that my gentle son who basically had to quit football in seventh grade because he couldn’t hit a guy—it wasn’t him. That’s why he switched to swimming. He’s just such a gentle soul and here he is doing very dangerous drugs and making life very risky for other people. I was just really distraught. 
Along the way I knew and I remember hearing something at Hazelden at the family program about find a family program. Find a NarAnon or an AlAnon therapy group. I knew enough about recovery because two of my brothers, two of my oldest brothers, had been in recovery at that time for almost fifty years in AA. I had lost a sister, one of my sisters. This year will be ten years. Dead from alcoholism. Zero treatment just drank herself to death. I knew that I needed help because I was in so much torment between sadness, anger, sitting on top enormous fear, a brand new marriage, a daughter the good kid, the proverbial good kid, who was getting ignored, the stress between Devin’s mother and I. She found an AlAnon meeting and I found a NarAnon meeting. Learning almost immediately, one of my friends came up to me, one of the dads, and said, “This is going to unfold for a very long time.” Which was stunning to me, it hurt because I knew he was telling the truth because his own child had been in addiction for a number of years. I started to get better at accepting the brutal reality. Having people say things like, “Hey the good news is he’s young. It sounds like you caught it early, that’s great.” The challenge is he’s young. They think can outsmart this brutal disease, their healthy, their bodies are fairly healthy and they can bounce back from drug trauma. You’re kind of like, you know it’s tough. 
One of my friends told me the anger that I had about the terrible violent violations that were going on, “Use that energy when you go to set boundaries. Don’t bring the energy to the meeting but bring that energy like here’s why it’s important that we set these boundaries.” So I started to find out very quickly that this wasn’t a problem that was going to get solved, very quickly. Nobody was there to tell me what to do. I just showed up and kind of just shut up and listened, feel safe and having a safe place to tell your story and what it’s like to feel like this in learning from other people who have been doing this awhile that there are ways to navigate this. This was really important to find out. I wanted to fix it and it wasn’t going to get fixed. 
Having another dad walk up to me and telling me that relapse is predictable in young addicts, it’s extremely predictable. Most addicts do relapse after treatment number one, especially young addicts. You have an opportunity to prepare for what you’re going to say, how you’re going to stand, your tone, everything. What he said was, “Don’t do what I did.” He blasted his son when he relapsed and he made it worse. Just other things I learned along the way was, for me, again everything I learned there I just stole shamelessly from other people what they said. Not the first time I heard it, a lot of times it took a couple times to hear it. 
AS: It’s not stealing.
MO: It’s borrowing shamelessly. Shameless borrowing.
AS: That’s the whole point.
MO: Exactly. I’d hear something ten times and on the eleventh time it would crystallize. Of course you plan and you go deal with this, the enemy always gets to vote. You would start to learn very quickly that you have to learn how to be resilient and not go off. One of the things I noticed when I was interacting with this addict and he was now sober but he was not in recovery. I was more scared of me than him. I was so awful in how I would interact with him and he wasn’t doing what I expected. 
AS: Can you back up a little bit and talk about how you approached fathering. We don’t say fathering very often but how you approached it and then what his addiction changed in you and how that rage kind of manifested? I don’t have the sense that you were an overbearing and unreasonably demanding father. If you could just talk about what kind of a father were you? Where did that rage come from?
MO: Mostly I’m a pretty gentle soul. I’m a bleeding heart. I like to have lots of experience but I don’t like to ruffle things too much, maybe. Some people would say I’m very much a ruffler. I kind of say what’s on my mind. Living in Chicago changed my heart, changed my mind about the way I saw the world. Life wasn’t lily white Orange County; it was challenging, it was troubling, it was a lot of people. I had enormous exposure to the gay community and to Jewish people and people from all ethnicities. It started to really change the way I saw the world and how I wanted to be in the world and of course how I wanted to influence my children. I had no belief that I was going to affect how they saw the world. They’re going to choose it for themselves. I grew up with pretty conservative parents who probably, my dad definitely wanted me to be like him which never worked for me. 
With my children I definitely had a very experiential, way way way less about stuff and way more about experiences. Kind of like the Canadian model or the European model. I’d rather that they do things than have things. I was definitely outspoken politically, talk about how it’s not okay to not treat people okay. We grew up in very white, my children grew up in very white Carver County and Chaska. Extremely Christian, extremely white, extremely conservative. I likened us to being blue eggs in a very red nest. There weren’t a lot of us out there. I would challenge some of the norms out there in thinking. My children saw the city a lot. We went in to the city a lot. Including walking around and seeing things like homeless people and people who were acting completely bizarre on the street. I was like, “I’m not there to judge those people. That’s a person who has problems. That’s a person who needs help. That can happen to anybody.” I didn’t want to shelter them from the way the world is or the way the world was. 
I really wanted them to see the world and not have to go to a Minnesota school and marry somebody just like you and live in a neighborhood like this. God forbid you would do that. The reason I liked living out here was there was just a lot of open space. That was the experiential part. I couldn’t care less about the neighborhood but I loved the trails and the open space and just lots of nature and water and cool places to be with my kids. For the most part I’d try to be as conversational as possible, not too punitive. Time outs, there were times when those freaking spaced out little kids needed a time out more for me or for their mom than for them. 
AS: That’s what I used to say.
MO: They grew up in Montessori. If you turn their room into a cell they’re not going to like going into their room. If you get punished in your room you’re not going to have a lot of joy in your room. I grew up in parochial school where you were basically told you were a filthy, awful sinner and you weren’t to be trusted so good luck. Montessori was like, “Why don’t we give them one hundred percent trust? Trust them one hundred percent at the beginning and then they get to demonstrate whether they can keep the trust. To the extent that they violate it we reel them in. There’s a consequence for violating the trust but we start to give them opportunities to reel the slack back.” Some parents out there in Carver County were like, “No way!” I’m like, “Yes way. That’s exactly how I think you should treat people, trust them. Trust them and if they don’t present that they’re trustworthy then you have to keep them close, then they have to start to show up differently. I want them to learn that early on.” That was really my methodology. 
I spoke very openly, before my son and daughter were even ten we were talking about drugs and alcohol. I talked about the disease in my family. I talked about my own experience and I talked about my own regrets. I knew enough about brain science that their little brains, if they can get through their teen years without experimenting, especially any sort of heavy use the likelihood of addiction drops dramatically. Addiction is a really tough illness. I said, “Your Aunt Eileen is dead now. Those people downtown, they started early. I started early and I wish I wouldn’t have.” I was really transparent about my own use. I probably sounded like Charlie Brown’s teacher to my son as he started to get older. “I’ll be fine. I’m just going to experiment. I’ll be fine.” I was angry about that, that he went as far as he did even though I told them about it. Somehow that made it a pact. 
My wife now, Cilla, she’s like, “That doesn’t mean shit coming from a parent.” It really doesn’t. A teacher would have way more impact, a physician could have way more impact than your actual parent. You mean well, you intend well that doesn’t mean you have influence over their lives. You have an enormous amount but the stuff you really want to have it’s so hollow. Right? “You could do better; you could do better.” Then some counselor comes in and says, “You could do better” and all of a sudden he did better. It had nothing to do with me at all. Kind of humbling. How am I doing with that? 
AS: Can you describe a moment where you felt like you were kind of out of your body with your anger? I feel like there’s a point for a parent where we just can’t take in what’s actually happening and how we respond to that I think says a lot about addiction.
MO: The combination of the violence and the potential violence and the weapons and dealing. I knew there were probably parents who would gladly, if they could have, they would have shot my son right in the head. If they would have known that he was the one who got drugs into their little kid’s hand they would have shot him right in the head. Part of me couldn’t argue with that as a parent. That was the stuff that really like, “I thought you knew better. We’re gentle people. We move away from fights.” I didn’t watch football. I grew up watching football but it got to a point where I’m like, “This is so stupid. This is just such a stupid waste of time.” Fairly passive people. 
For him to engage in stuff with such ease it seems like, there was a lot of identity stuff that went on for him. Where he wasn’t a star athlete or a star scholar. In his interviews he said, “Basically I became one of those drug people who get things for you.” That was a power, there was an identity that he really relished that he was seen as the guy to go to. That was the value that he brought. At that age it makes sense. I’m not going to argue with his logic. It made sense for him to do what he did because it gave him an identity that he couldn’t achieve through other methods. Really just absolutely inside out challenged that he could have done that. I was at the point, I’ve said this a lot and I’ll say it again, you get to the point where I would choose to have him die than to kill somebody. I choose to have him die than to harm somebody irreparably. Than to have those parents standing in my driveway threatening me or screaming at me because my son drunk or high either ODed with somebody or he drove over them drunk. I got to that point. I felt horrible feeling that and saying that. 
It was interesting having other parents go, “Oh yeah. Totally identify with that. I don’t like it but I totally identify that feeling where your own child you’d be better off if they were dead and not harming.” I started to really wrestle with that kind of stuff. That identity of I’m the dad, he’s my child. When I went through divorce, identity is powerful stuff. My wife, my house, my children. I really struggled with it through addiction that one of my fellow parents is like, “She’s an adult I birthed a long time ago. I try not to refer to her as my daughter, as my kid anymore because it’s too hard.”
AS: Who? Your daughter?
MO: No this was one of our friends of NarAnon. That I have to start to separate from this parental thought that this is a little kid that needs me. That will pin you and put you into such great sadness and such confusion. I remember what it’s like, my parents, I don’t need you to do those things anymore. I did actually. I didn’t think I did. It was important that I started to establish some of my own space. When he was sober, he was sober ninety days at Hazelden not for twenty-eight. Almost ninety days and then off to sober living. He was just sober; he wasn’t in any kind of recovery at all. Sober’s tough and it’s so dangerous. The way I liken it is you’re just standing on the edge. You can step off, one bad thing can happen and you can step off or your close to the edge and ultimately there’s prelapse. You don’t just relapse. Generally, people it’s planned. They just walk over to the edge and they just wait for the trigger to happen or that moment or that safe space and they’re going to use again. Sober definitely wasn’t, I knew it was dangerous. 
He had no idea what recovery was and no interest in going through the vulnerability of sitting in meetings and telling the truth. Basically it’s you’re going to strip naked in front of everybody and you’re going to do some spins and some yoga in front of them. Seriously, I’m sure he thought, “If that was an option I would have done that instead, naked yoga in front of everybody rather than telling the truth that I’m a fucked up person. I’m confused, I’m sad, I’m angry, I want to kill myself, I want to be a better person.” That’s really hard especially for a fairly stoic seventeen-year-old who’s got a lot of image to protect. Part of me got it and part of me was so frustrated that he was doing nothing about it but he was sober. He had a sober summer back at his mom’s house, his mom’s house and my house. He worked temp work and he was sober and we had him pee in a cup. He got into Step Up at Augsburg, the sober college program at Augsburg which is renowned. They have administrators come from all over the country and actually from overseas to say, “What are you doing and how are you doing it because we’re interested in creating something similar at our university.” 
I’m going to go back in time for a second. Christmas, I think he was about three and a half years old, budgets and I don’t want my kids to have a lot of stuff I want them to get things that are necessary and fun but let’s have experience. I’d rather go sledding on Christmas than sit around opening gifts. Amy’s parents are well to do and he’s their first grandchild and they can do whatever the hell they want. So they brought over a barrel of gifts. He was excited about these gifts under the tree and then Christmas Eve there’s an enormous amount of gifts and they’re all his to go through. I’m sitting there probably having a beer, watching my son open gifts. He would rip open the gift and then get the box open, we’d maybe have to cut a little bit of tape, we’d open up and he’d look at what it was with these wild eyes and then it’d fade and he would just throw it to the side and he’d go to the next one. It was the same every time, wild eyed, ripping things open. “What is it?” He’d see it and then it would just fade and he’d go to the next one. I just sat there thinking, “Oh fuck. I’ve seen guys smoking crack cocaine and it’s the exact same body language.” 
AS: You thought that when he was three and a half?
MO: Yes. It hit me like a bolt. I talked to his mom about it later, “He was just excited.” “I know he was excited.” I didn’t really dwell on it but I never forgot that. That what I saw was exactly what I’ve seen people smoking crack cocaine do. It’s never enough and they just keep going. It was chilling. I went, “Oh my gosh. He’s got the chip.” 
AS: So he’s at Step Up.
MO: He’s at Step Up and we’re at orientation and there was a student panel that got up there. It was great. One kid’s like, “Hey. Ten schools I think I dropped out of. Pretty much I was planning where I was going to do suicide and how was I going to get it done because I’m an addict and every time I go to college there’s just drugs and alcohol everywhere and I’m a fuck up. I found this school and I’m like ‘Okay whatever I’m desperate. I don’t care anymore.’ I got to Step Up.” He has a 3.9 now, engineering. He’s like, “I love my life. I love my smart brain. I love recovery. This is so awesome.” Everybody is just like, “Yes! My kid’s going here.”
AS: They found their poster child.
MO: Yes. Another student got up there and said, “So people will want to know what do we do when we’re not students? Most students when they’re not students they are partiers. Here’s what we do we go bowling, we go clean graffiti off walls, nasty graffiti not the art stuff, we go read to the Somali kids. They read English to the Somali kids and they read English back to us. We do yoga, we go to the gym, we go to meetings, we scoop food, we bring coats to homeless people. We’ve got so many things you can do and we do it in groups. I’m like, “Yes! Great!” 
Then this young lady said, “So here’s what happens every year. There are going to be some of the students who are like, ‘This is so stupid.’ They’re not in to recovery. They’re not into service work. They’re not into helping people. They’re just very selfish and miserable. They’re going to try to recruit and find other people who think this is stupid.” Amy, Devin’s mom and I, look at each other like…Sure enough that’s who he hung out with. He was smoking cigarettes and hanging out under the bridge with kids who just were sober Step Up students. It wasn’t in our control. I’d learned enough at this point. There’s nothing I could do about that but hope he’s doing okay. Pretty soon his grades started to get dodgy. There were some gaps in some of his stories. 
AS: This is just the first semester?
MO: First semester. He started in September in October one of his best buddies that he hung out with, this kid relapsed on a Monday night. He went and used on a Monday night. He got kicked out of Step Up but was still an Augsburg student. On Wednesday another one of these Step Up students used with that kid who just relapsed. Now that kid’s been kicked out of Step Up. Then we called Devin or sent him a text that said, “Stay the fuck away from Michael. Stay away from him. He is so dangerous right now.” “I’m fine. I’m fine. It’s cool. No problem, no problem.” On Friday night Devin used with Michael. They used synthetic Xanax from China. Just lab pills that they bought online. The kid that he was with, Michael, he flatlined at Hennepin County Medical Center. He overdosed. Devin only took a half of dose but had a pretty bad night. He prelapsed and then he relapsed and he was kicked out of Step Up.
AS: Did Michael live?
MO: Michael lived and just basically went—he’s still an Augsburg student. Just back to school, just living in the dorms, “I’m fine.” He’d been through a lot of trauma in his life. His mother died when he was young and his dad’s a high powered downtown workaholic attorney. Michael was just kind of a problem. Devin was now commuting from his mom’s house and my house and enormous stress as he is now a college student at Augsburg. Academics were just falling apart all around him. 
Then he disappeared on a Wednesday night in October. No, no in November. It was early November. He disappeared and he went off and we found out through phone records that he sold his laptop, sold his speakers, bought a pizza and stayed in a hotel in Wisconsin. We figured he was probably on his way to Chicago. We didn’t know what he was doing but he went to Chicago and binged heavily with hundreds of dollars in his pocket. Crack cocaine and that synthetic Xanax stuff.
AS: He tried that again?
MO: Yes, you have no idea. The chemist who made it probably doesn’t even know what’s in it. It’s so unspecific and so deadly. He was on Vivitrol so we knew he probably wasn’t taking opiates because it’d be worthless. He just did a huge amount of drugs for several days and came home, limped home after four days. I’ll be honest with you. We’ve never gone through this before, my son’s never been homeless, he’s never gone off on these disappearing acts, he’s never overdosed on opiates as far as we know, as far as he knows. He never lost his breathing. We’re really lucky. We had very very few like the long traumas so many of the parents have been through. We were lucky. He’s a very dangerous user. He went and used excessively. Enough that he could have killed himself or killed somebody else. You’re driving around just…
AS: Was he in touch with you during these four days? What were you doing?
MO: Just waiting, contacting all of his friends. I went through his phone records and contacting everybody like, “I’m sorry. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m sorry.” It’s like, “If I hear from him I’ll tell him that his parents love him and want him to come home.” He started to pop up some messaging on Facebook popped up. Like on Saturday morning, “I just needed some time to myself.” He came limping home and went to detox at The Mission out in Plymouth. 
In those days that he was gone I remember getting dressed in the morning, I remember looking in the mirror and going, “Wow. Are these the clothes I’m going to have on when I go to the morgue? Am I going to have to identify his body wearing these clothes right now?” Just a random thought. It was a very poignant thought. His mom’s not going to identify his body. I’ll do that. That’s not his mom’s job that’s my job. Or am I going to see him in a county jail somewhere or am I going to see him in the press? Is a horrible thing going to happen? Are these the clothes I’m going to wear when I’m going to be with him. 
Saturday he fortunately limped back. No money and I said, “Devin, how are you?” He said, “I’m chill.” It just hit me like right in the spine, the fury in me that he was chill after what we went through for several days. I had to leave. “See that’s the fucking problem. Dad doesn’t know how to talk.” I just went out to the car because I wasn’t going to sit in there because I was going to say horrible things and I had nothing to say if all you are is chill when I went to give you a hug. I get that he was so addled at that point that he’d done a crap load of drugs, way more than we thought. We just thought that he smoked crack but he’d done a huge amount of drugs. It was go time. It was like something has to happen now, what are we going to do? 
We started looking at options. Hazelden, we weren’t interested in going back to a center that was very good about education and comfy and stuff. I thought the middle of the Yukon was a good idea at that point. I did. Let’s go put him in a harsh fucking place, have him struggle. The Retreat was an option. Then we happen to find out that treatment in California was an option. California is different. There’s just some wrangling out there if you’re covered by insurance and then you can actually end up in sober living covered by insurance if you’re doing outpatient. It’s not totally legal, it’s not totally straight up but they bend the rules. We’re like, “We’re okay for bending the rules. Any means necessary.” I had a conversation with him, not a lot, we didn’t have a lot of contact because he was just so apathetic. I had to set a boundary. “Until you can identify or demonstrate active recovery I don’t want you at or around or near my house.” I wanted to get into lots of details about what active recovery looks like but I don’t know what it looks like because I’m not an addict. That’s all I had to say. If he starts to use again he’s going to start to hang out with dangerous people again. I don’t want him anywhere near my house or my wife or my dogs or my daughter. His mom didn’t set that same boundary and that was her choice. 
That’s what I said to him. My hope was maybe he’ll want to go find out what active recovery looks like. He went to treatment in California. It was pretty scary. He was actually presenting schizophrenic hallucinations, schizophrenic presentation. Active hallucination not only voices and sounds and light but visual. He was seeing things. They said, “He’s just so toxic still.” He already detoxed but all the shit in that Chinese stuff is a mess. We don’t know a lot. They did a good job with him. I didn’t like them but they did a good job with him.
AS: The treatment center?
MO: Yes, they really work on the co-occurring condition stuff. They really get into, “Who the fuck are you? What’s your story? Who do you think you are? What do you want to do with this stuff? How do you want to turn out?” They really get into digging in and cornering you. It’s not gentle like Hazelden. It’s pretty fierce. Just from what we heard, he actually expressed in a moment of clarity, “I want to be a dad. I want to see the world. I want to go to school. I want to have a successful life.” Then he said, “I’m terrified I’m never going to have that stuff.” They said to him, “Well if you use the way you use you won’t. We see thousands of people and you won’t. If you use the way you use, you’ll put your brain into a state where you won’t have any of that stuff. That’s not a threat. We see it a lot. Pay attention.” He got bounced out of there and went into sober living just about a year ago. 
Right here it’s the middle of January and he been in recovery ever since. He found a sponsor. He had kind of a bullshit sponsor, just a path of least resistance sponsor. Somebody probably said to him, “Dude that’s not a sponsor, get a real sponsor.” He had the guts to go up and find a sponsor who had what he wanted and basically the sponsor told him what a lot of good sponsors tell a lot of good people in recovery. “Shut up and do what I do. Don’t think. You’re thinking got you into this place so stop thinking and do what I do. You’re going to copy everything I do. You’re going to call me. I’m not going to call you. I’m not going to put up with any bullshit. You’re either in recovery or you’re not in recovery. If you’re in, you’re in. If you’re not, you’re not. I’ll figure you out very quickly.” This is a veteran.
AS: A war veteran or a recovery veteran?
MO: No, this guy’s been in recovery a long time. Devin was doing old school AA Los Angeles Hollywood recovery. NA is interesting it’s got a lot of war stories. People go to NA and they tell lots of the drug war stories. Young people thrive on it but it doesn’t help. You go to a meeting and listen to people tell war stories all night. It was so bad. AA is more about recovery, old boys. People who’ve been through shit and lost everything. 
AS: I’ve heard people call them old timers. 
MO: Old timers, lots of veterans, the old guard. Devin found an old guard. I don’t know if the guy is twenty-eight or sixty-eight. It’s none of my business. I think his mom met him last night in Los Angeles which is really huge.
AS: Amy’s in Los Angeles.
MO: He got into recovery and he worked for a sober living company and he’s doing remarkably well. I’d say he’s healthier now, he hasn’t been this healthy since he was twelve. He’s a different person altogether. He’s healthy, he’s well. I’m wildly grateful and also very realistic. He’s only nineteen and a half. Long term recovery starts after five years. You’re a toddler, you’re not a toddler until five years, you’re just crawling around. It’s very humbling. This sponsor, remember I said that counselor in high school told him the things I told him and it made sense to him. The things that sponsor is saying are things I’ve probably said or could say or would say but it doesn’t mean shit coming from me. His recovery has nothing to do with me and I’m okay with that. It’s not my business at all. My recovery is my business and what he does and chooses and who he hangs out with is his choice. Right now I’m just a lucky guy. 
AS: Could you talk just a little bit about what you mean by your recovery? When did you realize that you had something that you had to recover from?
MO: I said I got into NarAnon while he was in his first month in treatment. This was not unfamiliar. I had actually been to AA meetings with one of my brothers years ago. I was stunned at the stuff I heard. Those were real people. His mom was familiar with recovery and a lot of people in recovery. I was like okay I guess I’ll go to this thing. I thought it was going to be miserable. I really thought I was going to walk in with a bunch of people on…they were hugging people and sharing baked goods and talking about, “Yes! She got arrested last night. Yay!” Everyone’s all excited about someone getting arrested on a felony. I’m like, “Who are these people?” 
I started to realize that there were these healthy people who had it way worse than I did. I didn’t know they had it worse. My son was in trouble but these were people who’d been dealing with this for a long time and they weren’t miserable. They were scared, they were very challenged, they lost sleep at night but they were getting back to their lives. I see things in pictures, I always see everything in pictures. That’s kind of the way I see the world and the way I try to communicate the way I see things. It’s like you go to the edge of the forest and you have this little tiny machete on your skinny little arms and you think you’re going to chop through this thing to figure out how to fix this thing and you’re just not going to. You don’t have enough energy and it’s just too thick, it’s too brutal. There are elephants who know the trails. You just got to go get behind the elephants like my son has been told, “Get behind me.” I just kind of learned to get behind other elephants. Mostly moms, not a lot of dads in recovery unfortunately but mostly moms who kind of know the path because other people had created it. Who knows where the path was initially created and it doesn’t matter. There’s a path. There’s not one path, there’s lots of paths but I kind of stopped trying to chop my way through this thing and started hanging out with people who knew a lot more than I did. 
I started to find out I had a lot of stuff to work on. My son didn’t bring my sadness, my rage, my terror to me it was always there. It just got uncorked. I had to own that. Own your shit as they say. Everything I was feeling was mine. I’d get challenged and sometimes I’d actively challenge in a meeting when somebody blames that other person for the things they’re experiencing. I try to do it gently but that’s your stuff. That’s your stuff. I guarantee there are addicts who get well and then there are family members and parents who don’t get well and go bat shit crazy. The addict’s like, “I’m doing okay now. What happened to you?” One of the best things you can do, as I learned and borrow shamelessly, is just work on your own recovery. The best way you can support them in your recovery is to be working on your own recovery so you don’t go off like that person that terrifies me. That furious, raging, spitting, angry Irishman. It’s the Wizard of Oz, behind that is this terrified person back here behind the curtain. Work on that guy because it’s not just going to be my son’s addiction where these things happen. It’s going to happen in traffic, it’s going to happen with my in-laws, with my wife, with colleagues and clients, and somebody that I bump into on the trail. I could actually be better at a lot of stuff. It really has nothing to do with my son’s addiction. Nothing. That’s incidental. 
Sometimes I feel okay. It’s interesting, I’ve missed only two meetings in only two years. Last week I’ve been sick otherwise if I have work, something else planned or booked I go. I just try to show up there for humility and inspiration, which I get every single—I got a lot of humility last night. This is just what I noticed is every time I go to a meeting if I’m paying attention I will hear things I’ve never heard before. I might because I went in the right way I’m going to think things I’ve never thought before which in turn will lead me to possibly do things I’ve never done before, possibly. That doesn’t mean I just get it and go. I don’t. A lot of the stuff just goes in one ear and out the other. “Well that’s really interesting.” But I don’t use it. Sometimes it actually penetrates and I go and do something with it. It doesn’t work exactly the way I thought it would but it works in a way that I can learn from it. That’s why I go. All these different experiences along the way. 
It’s just a lake. It’s the lake I go to so I don’t feel so horrible, so worthless and I don't blame myself. When you're by yourself it's like man the best of me does not come out. By myself with my dogs on the lake I'm actually in a pretty good place. Sitting by myself in a chair looking out a window, pulling at my skin, my best thoughts are a long way off. It's my worst thoughts, my shadows like I've got this I'll take over right now. It just kind of spills. There's so many people that just do that and that's the heartbreaking thing for me. I want to try to change that to get more people off of their butt. They have every right to sit by them self but they also have an opportunity to go hang out with people and heal and learn. 
An addict alone, you're in dangerous company as they say. Same with a parent, same with a spouse, same with a brother, same with a daughter. When you're sitting alone you're not helping yourself. The only way things have been figured out since the dawn of time has been community, people sitting in circles and talking about what's real. White people brought clipboards and said, ""We'll call this therapy."" The brown people are like, ""We've been doing this shit for thousands of years with no methodology other than sit in a circle and tell the truth."" I'm just a big fan of it. I really am. 
AS: Can you talk about what you're planning, when you're just talking about wanting to help other parents. Can you talk about what your thoughts are about what you want to be doing in the next few years?
MO: I'm working on a plan right now with a colleague, a fellow parent of an addict who just lost her son, right before Christmas. I'm actually heading over there right after this meeting to go talk a little bit about this stuff. Ultimately what we want to do is help, we want to facilitate and accelerate the process for people to learn that there's a lot of work they can do to help themselves. There's three ""Cs"" that they talk about in addiction. You didn't cause it, this is interesting for the addict to know and certainly for the family members. I didn't cause it. I cannot control it and I will not cure it. There's a fourth ""C"" that I really gravitate toward. It's really important and it's controversial, some people don't like it, but there is something called contribution. I can contribute the way I show up, there's no neutral, I'm adding to the mix. I'm either helping to improve things by working on my own recovery and learning not to engage where I don't need to engage or I'm exacerbating things by bringing my rage. By trying to control I'm adding, I'm contributing, I'm exacerbating the injury. 
AS: The contribution can be positive or negative?
MO: Contribution is neutral but you're always contributing. Are you aware of how you're contributing?
AS: Which is different from the other three?
MO: Yes, absolutely. I've heard parents say, ""I'm going to bring them home and we're just going to love him up. We're going to cook his favorite meals and we're going to watch ﻿Home Alone ﻿and I'm going to buy him some socks."" The addict's like ""Okay. Fine with me. I'll just sell those fucking socks."" Or, ""We're going to punish you. We're just going to make it really difficult for you to do anything."" Okay. Bring on the shame. 
I have an idea that we can help more people if we can get in front of audiences and just help them understand that there is a different experience if you're willing to lean in just like an addict has to lean in to their recovery. You can lean in and go find a healthy group. There's nothing we can say or do that will change anything for them. We just want to try to invite people to find a community where they can sit and have this stuff happen that just happens. I'll be damned if anyone can say exactly how it happens. I don't know. I don't know if it's realistic or not. I'd like to make a living out of it. I don't know if there's a living to be made out of it. I do know that I have enough resources and energy and skills to be able to impart to some people who are terrified that it doesn't have to keep feeling this way. 
I don't mean just going to Anon because Anon's not healthy. You can have a different experience, you can protect your marriage, you can protect your finances, you can protect your spiritual life, you can protect your other relationships with other family members. All of that stuff, every bit of that can go away if you're not paying attention. While you're trying to rescue somebody who doesn't want to be rescued. You'll go right over the falls with them and you don't have to. You can get out. Say, ""I'm going to climb down. If you're down there on the side of the river I'm going to come down and help you if I can but I'm not going over the falls with you. Those are those pictures I sent right?
It just breaks my heart that there are people sitting alone. Either afraid to share because they think they're going to get judged, they might. They may have some family members or community that they're at risk in. The dads, I'd love to get more dads to show up because they spend a lot of time very angry, deep in their grief because they can't fix something. That's a big problem. Then you got new problems. All of a sudden your family's feeling something that really has nothing to do with the addiction anymore. It's all my own beast, my shadow has shown up and everything else in my life has become a mess. If I can help people learn how to turn down their noise, help them learn how to do it them self. I can't do it for them. I have no experience, I just have an experience learning how to turn down my own noise and be like, ""This is nice. I can still hear it.""
AS: But it doesn't overtake your life. 
MO: It doesn't overtake my life. I'm only here once. What else? Anything else?
AS: Do you have anything else?
MO: I'll say what one of my friends says about this. She has two addicted children. It's not good. Here's what she says, ""I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. No way. It's way too hard."" She also says, ""I wouldn't go back to the way it was before. Speaking from a selfish place."" Not selfish in a bad way. She's a better person and she knows it. She feels that she's a better person having...
AS: Been through it.
MO: And learning a lot about herself. Just the little petty stuff she used to really get wrapped around the axel. It doesn't matter anymore. She's walking with a different grace. Imagine that. It's like the cancer patient that's like, ""This is going to kill me but man I have learned so much about me. I'm a better dad or I'm a better family member. I'm a better human having been shown that I'm going to die soon."" Wow. I'm so grateful for the exposure to the lovely friends. Heartache, I'm going to experience things I don't ever want to experience again. Lately and I'm still in it. I don't like it at all, I hate it. It's kind of a number games when you're in a community of addicts. People die or people's lives come apart. It's really hard. In the meantime, they can do things to make things better. 
AS: That's right. There's definitely an intensity to this particular path that we're on. 
MO: Either way, intense joy. One other thing I discovered a couple years ago. When I was in really deep sadness, out on the lake with my dog. You get sad and your posture changes. Your head goes down. It's just evolutionary biology. It just kind of keeps us close to home. It's interesting. My head was down a lot. I was crying I was so scared. I was so everything, mostly just scared.
I just look up at the sky and the sky was brilliant. Clouds kind of tumbling through and brilliant winter blue. I realized my son's under the same sky right now. Not very far away at all, he was actually right here in the Twin Cities. I'm a pagan. I'm a born again pagan. I was raised Christian but I'm a pagan truly. That's my church. The sky's kind of this palette that day or night I just kind of look up whether it's starry or cloudy or grey. There's no bad sky. All the people I love are under that sky. Little things like that kind of bring me to the lake. There's a lake story in here somewhere but it kind of helps, it lightens things for me. When I look up at that sky and those lovely people I love and the people who aren't here anymore, they also used to experience that sky too. It helps turn down my noise a little bit. And just keep walking. There you go. That's enough.
AS: Thank you Mike.
MO: You're welcome. Thanks for listening. "

Open Book
Margarita Ortega          -MO
Sue Purchase                -SP
SP: This is Sue Purchase. I am doing the interview with Margarita Ortega. We’re at Open Book. It is January 13th at about three o’clock. Margarita would you introduce yourself and that that you give permission for this and your name and address?
MO: My name is Margarita Ortega. I give, I give permission to to do this interview. I am a Little Earth Resident. I live at Little Earth. I was born and raised there.
SP: I should say this is the Opioid Oral History Project. So, can you tell me a little bit about, who’s Margarita?
MO: I’m just a regular ex-user. I had opportunities growing up that have brought me into different fields and being able to be an advocate for my community. But I, as a child, I grew up in a domestic violence home. My father used to beat my mother a lot. And then he starting beating us, and I grew up with that trauma. I was homeless from ten years old until I was fourteen, I lived in a tent for three and half years. I went through a lot as a kid and at fourteen we moved back to Little Earth. And at Little Earth was where a lot of my traumas and who I was, trying to figure out what it all meant. Why did I grow up in an abusive home? Why did I become homeless? Why…? So I was dealing with all those traumas and I started turning into drug use more rapidly and after that, that's when I pretty much stopped school and then, went and fell down the rabbit hole a lot deeper, and then, I got older when I turned eighteen was when I started seeing things differently. I had a child. I got pregnant, I had a child, I graduated high school. And, after high school I went right back into drugs. I ended up having a surgery. When I ended up having the surgery, that's when I started getting hooked up on opiates. 
Can you backtrack just a little bit and talk about you know, how old were you when you first started getting high?
MO: I was twelve years old. It was my mother. My mother was the one that gave me my first joint. It was because of, we were already living in tents. Uhm, my mom was being raped by my father and I knew it. Uhm, she was being beaten by my father and I knew it. And the more I tried to talk to my mother about it, to leave him, the more problems it caused. So, to my mom's sense was if she got me high, I wouldn't care just like she didn't care. That I would continue to deal with it just like she deals with it. So that was my first time using. And, I was a lot younger when I started drinking. I was actually like ten. '
SP: So you started drinking and then smoking pot?
MO: Yeah. When I was ten my mother used to give me drinks to deal with a lot of, to deal with our homelessness, and to deal with a lot of the traumas that was happening cuz even my brother was starting to beat on me. Uhm, and it was becoming normal. Uhm, and then when I started using that was pretty much how I dealt with, that's how I was taught, how to deal with trauma was to use. And, I, continued to keep that with me all the way up until I turned twenty-five. When I turned twenty-five was when I learned that there was a different way of dealing with trauma. That it wasn't drugs and alcohol, that it was another way. It was actually a healing that could happen, which I didn't know about the healing process until I got involved in my culture. 
SP: What happened at twenty-five?
MO: Well, I almost lost my child to opiates. I was using a lot of percocets and oxycodones. I was using heroin. I was using everything under the sun to deal with the trauma that was just my past. To deal with my past. 
SP: Is this before the surgery or...?
MO: This was after the surgery. And then, when anyways fast forward a little bit. I started getting involved in my culture. An elderly lady, a medicine woman. She came to me and she told me that I didn't need to be like that anymore. That I had a choice. And, I was just in the building just because I, she was an advocate that was working with families, and I was just there because I had to deal with child protection over the opiate use. And she saw me sitting there crying and begging them to not take my children away (it's still recording I think...indeterminate noise) and she told me I didn't have to be like that no more. I didn't have to do this anymore. And I didn't, you know, I asked her well then what am I supposed to do? How do I deal with all of it. How do I deal with me? How do I deal with my past? How do I deal with the pain? And then, she started inviting me to different ceremonies. they started bringing me around to all these women's ceremonies. And the more I told my story the more healing I had. And to have other women tell me that they've been sexually abused, they've went through the same things I went through, and they are strong for it. I wanted to be strong for it. I didn't wanna be, I don't wanna say weak, I just don't wanna be lost in my pain anymore. They helped me find a different way. It was through those ceremonies I was able to become my own woman instead of hiding it. I was so afraid of who I was that I didn't know my purpose. They helped me find it. Ever since then I just continue to do, I do work for the community. I work on behalf of many different organizations to be able to address opiate abuse. 
SP: How did you get involved, like in the work? It just came as an outgrowth of the wisdom of the women that you were hanging out with? Like what brought you to the actual work? 
MO: It was the, there was a lot of my friends that were dying. I lost a lot of my childhood friends that I grew up with. I lost family members. I lost my closest cousin. She was using when I started doing this work. And, no matter what I did I couldn't get her to stop, and I tried everything. There was nothing. There was no programs available at the time to get her help. So, I lost her. She died. And, when she died I just continued to keep not only talking to the addicts that are still out there that are struggling. But I started trying to find more resources. And there was hardly any. So I wanted to help build them. So I started talking with other organizations, other directors, to start creating these programs. Uhm, I started meeting with tribes to start creating these programs. that we were losing people on a massive level. We had a death in our community every two days. Uhm, and in which, in the native community, we're such a small number that when we lose someone, it hits home because we're all pretty much related. And, we all know each other since, we were you know born. 
SP:Are you talking about specifically about Little Earth? 
MO: Mhm. 
SP: Every two days?
MO: Every two days we lost another person to opiates. ANd during that time is when I really worked my tail off to get us narcan and at that time there was no narcan available for the community. 
SP: How long ago was that. If you can just give me a timeframe?
MO: 2015... they didn't' have narcan available. In 2016 was when we finally fought, we had a good enough fight to make narcan available to the community. `
SP: Is we... is that natives against heroin?
MO: No, no. That was just me and the Little Earth Residents. 
SP: Oh.... I'd like to hear more about that!! [laughs]
MO: [laughs as well] Yeah so we, I helped organize a lot of our residents. So we had meetings. We had sit downs where we were talking about this issue. Like, we're losing people left and right. Everyone is hooked on opiates. Everyone is. And we're trying to figure out, what are we gonna do? There was even people in there that were still `using and they're trying to figure out like, how do we save not only myself but save our, you know... my cousin that's also using to. So, we had these meetings and from those meetings our numbers got bigger and we started fighting for different... something to save people when they are ODing. At the time there... we didn't even know that there was something called naloxone. It wasn't until a paramedic, uhm during one of our overdoses that we got a call about that the paramedic that the paramedic used a drug called naloxone to reverse the overdose. That's when, that's just when, that just struck a light. Like, we need that. We need that here and we need that for everyone. We started meeting with our state representative. I started bringing in our state reps, I started bringing in our city council, I started bringing in all of these other political people that I knew. that I knew. that i was working with on these issues. But, you know, just trying to brainstorm. But I started actually giving them this is what we need. this is what I need you to do. And once it became available we just started training every resident. Every resident had to go through naloxone training. Every resident had to have narcan in their home. And, we made sure that we went through every house and trained everyone. Our overdoses had dropped. Our deaths had dropped. And we were just happy enough to have our loved ones. We didn't even think about social programming. I didn't think about social programming until a year later. And a year later was  when I created and helped create Natives Against Heroin. 
SP: Ah, so it started at Little Earth? 
MO: Yes.
SP: And, tell me a little bit about that. And I also would ask the question: You know, I'm from Minnesota but haven't really been a while for awhile. What about Steve's Law and Rummler? Were they helpful?
MO: Yeah they actually helped a lot when it came to advocating at the state for the naloxone to be available for the community. So the state was going to pass a bill to, there was Karen Clark I was working with, and she said that there's a bill in place but it wasn't from her, it was from another lady. She said, there's a bill in place to make naloxone available to the community. And I was like really? And she was like yes but I need you to go meet with her. And I need you to have Little Earth residents come meet with the other state reps. And that's when I met Steve's Rummler. They were already there advocating for it. So I was just able to piggy back. It was like a dream come true. It was easier enough for me to just bring Little Earth residents just to come testify. And it was like it was handed out. It was meant to be. So we just worked with Steve's Rummler, and they helped us get the nalaxone.  It was easy, it was much of a blessing, when the health department was able to do that for us.
SP: And so then there was the creation of Natives Against Heroine?
MO: Yes,
SP: How did that come about?
MO: Well, we, what we realized was no matter how many, you know naloxone kits we handed out, no matter how many people knew how to use them, we were still losing people. We still lose people today. And it's just, we needed to have a support system. Somewhere where addicts like myself and others would feel comfortable about telling their story, feel comfortable to be involved, to become their own advocates on this issue. So that way they feel empowered to not only, not only speak about the issue, but help their friends, their family members, in becoming sober. So we created Natives Against Heroin as a healing circle. At first it was just a healing circle, where we would just sit around and talk. And it was just a support group. And then, after much of the issues started rising with the drugs. When they started stripping the doctors form giving the opiates away, you know so easily.  When that happened the drug dealers became a big thing. No longer were you able to go to your doctor as your drug dealer. You now had to go through the gangs. And the gangs were having wars in Little Earth. They were actually having big wars where they were shooting people left and right. We weren't dying anymore of opiates, we were dying from guns. So then, that's when we started Natives Against Heroin to start doing patrols. So our addicts, the ones that were in recovery, started actually patrolling Little Earth. Then we started walking around, talking to all the gangs and the drug dealers. And telling them, we have children here. We've already had children shot multiple times. We don't need no more, our children cannot be going through this, not our kids. We had multiple children that were shot and brought to the emergency room because of the drug war in our community. So we did, we started that patrol. From there became the marches. We started doing marches to shut down drug dealers. So, we started going up to drug dealer's houses that we knew. That we were tired of talking to, to tell them to quit.
SP: And they were living at Little Earth?
MO: They're living at Little Earth, they're drug dealers in different res's that we went to. We went to the reservations too because drugs were being transported not only from Little Earth but from the res's to Little Earth, from Little Earth to the res's. So we were going all over through the state of Minnesota. Shutting down drug dealers. So we would go to the drug dealer's house and we would all stand out there and we would all tell them, like a big group of us, sometimes there were thousands of us out there, telling them— ""You need to quit dealing drugs in our community.""
SP: Wow that is a bold move. How did that go?
MO: It went well, it went well!
SP: I mean, like, can you give an example of your first march up to a house?
MO: Our very first one we had over seven thousand people. We marched all the way from Red Lake. All the way to different drug houses in Red Lake. It was, at first it was just an awareness march. Then the people wanted to address the drug dealers. Because they wanted to address the drug dealers, we just said let's go for it. And we winged it the first one. And when we did that drug dealer's house, at first he didn't quit. He fought. He was arguing with us, yelling at us, telling us to stop. ""You guys are shaming us."" All this stuff. And then, six months later he becomes one of our members. He quits dealing and he becomes one of our members. And then that's when we knew. We're gonna keep doing this. When we started, when we started going from different res's and different res's we were able to change drug dealers from dealing for their—'cuz a lot of them are dealing just for their use, 'cuz they're users—and we understand that. So once they become a part of our membership, then they create their own, instead of doing it on a drug base, you create your own chapter. And you have your own addicts and everyone that you used to deal with, deal to, have 'em come in, and you become their support to become sober.
SP: So, through that are people like getting access to treatment?
MO: Mhm. Yeah everyone has contacts for treatment facilities. People go to treatment. Some people will just go through ceremony and just do ceremony to get clean. Some people will just use the sweat lodge. We have a few members that I know. They were active users and on just, they were just using Percocets, but they used the sweat lodge to become clean.
SP: So, is it safe to say that NAH supports harm reductive efforts?
MO: Oh, of course. We do that a lot. We even have members in our group that are still active users, but since they're active users we still, they still need support, they still need a family, they still need help, and we're still there for them. And it's, it doesn't, we don't shame them. We know that they're using. It's okay. It's more so when you're ready. And, and when we help with that, like when you're ready, you can do more. But it's up to them when they're ready to do more.
SP: Wow. So, you're a community organizer?
MO: Yes.
SP: And, prompted by opioids? And trauma?
MO: Yes, yes.
SP: And, so you start organizing at Little Earth. Natives Against Heroin grows.
MO: Yeah. 
SP: And then, tell me more about your organizing from that—NAH— to you know running to be a state representative? How did that happen? [laughs]
MO: Well, so with NAH., because we were going through all different towns and reservations and the state, We startedm well I started getting to know the state representatives. Started getting to know a lot of politicians, because I knew that there was bills that needed to be passed so that we could address more of the harm reduction side of this. 
SP: So, were you educating?
MO: I was educating quote “politicians” on the issue [Sue laughs]. That was my job, was to educate them on what they didn't know. So, what brought me into running was more so that my state representative was retiring. The one that was helping me through all of this.
SP: Karen Clark?
MO: Yeah. The one that was helping me through all of it was retiring and I had, I didn't know what to do. At the time I was like, I freaked out. I was scared 'cuz I was... all the work that we've done, all the work that we still need to do, still needs to happen in the House. And when she said she was retiring I just, I knew somebody had to take that mantle. I knew somebody had to step up and do something. So that way our harm reduction services actually go through so that pharmaceutical companies actually have to pay for what they're causing. So I decided to run. And then, when I decided to run I didn't realize that I would become bare naked. That my story would come out. And I would have to, I would say I would have to deal with the trauma in a more public eye.... again. Like usually when you deal with trauma, you can deal with it in a private setting. You know, where you're just with you and your therapist, or you and your healers and stuff. It's more private. But when you're running in public view, your traumas come out for everyone to see. And they wanna use those traumas to help push your agenda, right? But what they don't understand is that it's a bare naked feeling. You revealed everything about yourself to the world. And I wasn't ready for that. That was the hard part. I wasn't ready for that. I didn't know that that's what I was signing up for at the time. That I was, I really thought that I could run and not have to tell my story and not have to tell people that I was a user, that I was sexually abused, that I was you know beaten as a child, that I was homeless for four years... you know? I didn't know that I had to tell everybody that. And, when I was running it all had to come out.
SP: What was that like for you? And how did you deal with it?
MO: It was extremely hard to deal with [laughs]. It was very... painful? Because it was a public pain. And it... how I dealt with it was mostly... I tried to remember that all of who I am, those traumas are me. They made me who I am. And I, I needed to use that. I've been using it all this time to help my community. I've been using all my traumas all this time to make a different life for everyone in my community. And I just needed to remember that and continue to remember that whenever people would you know, at the doors some people would, you know like say: ""You don't have no business running."" You know, ""You have no business running. You're just ...all you are, you're just full of all this trauma. That's all you are. You're just one trauma"" [laughs]. But, the thing was, the thing was, I had to fight against that stigma.
SP: So it must have been very public. I mean, I can only imagine to the degree that I have been you know, publicly involved working in community, but never in a political sense. And having to share information, and then you get people's response. I mean like, it must have been, I can't imagine. I mean like... like...
MO: People thought, there were some people that thought that I was running just for people to feel sorry for me or something.
SP: And they would say things like that?
MO: Mhm, mhm. Yeah. And it was more so, it was more so like, me trying to prove myself to people. That I'm different. I'm not my past. I'm not my traumas. My traumas don't define me. They help push me, but they don't define me. I had to prove that to people time and time again. And it was because of all the interviews. So I was the first Little Earth resident to ever run for public office. We've never had a Little Earth resident that ever ran. So, for me to be the first I had a lot of interviews. A lot of interviews from different you know radio stations, to reporters, to newspapers. And it was being the ""first,"" that's where my story had gotten out, of who I am. And that's how everybody found out. And that's how everybody saw me. So that's, that's where it all began with the trauma part. And then, that was the hardest part of my campaign.
SP: Was that the beginning of the campaign or throughout the whole campaign?
MO: It was more so in the middle of the campaign, towards the middle. In the beginning I kept it really hush. I kept my past out of it. It was my campaign team that wanted to have me talk about my issues with a reporter. Talk about my past traumas with a reporter. And it was my campaign team that thought it would be best because that's what made me stand out from all of the other candidates. There were seven candidates running in my race. So, to make me stand out, what made me different from all of them was my life, my life story. That I was the only one, out of all of seven of us, that has lived this life. And that has actually used those traumas to address the issues. So, that's what they wanted to use. And that's what made it come up in public. I just didn't realize how hard it was gonna be afterwards. For me anyway, just for me. It wasn't, it wasn't hard for everybody else, it was more so hard for me [laughs].
SP: Well I would imagine it was just hard for you! [Ortega laughing] And so the campaign is recently over. What about two months maybe? Not even that?
MO: Yep, yep. It's recently over.
SP: And so, how did the campaign turn out for you?
MO: Well, I got... no matter what my team is like ""We won!"" Even though we didn't win. I had the least amount of money out of any campaign, out of all seven. I only had ten thousand dollars throughout my whole campaign. Ten thousand dollars. But I got, I got the most votes on election day. I won primary day, I lost early vote.
SP: Wow. Right on.
MO: Yeah, and they were all running with around 90 to 100 thousand dollars—their campaigns were.
SP: How did you go about fundraising?
MO: I didn't wanna. I fundraised right off of the doors. So when I would talk to people at the doors, they would give me money right at the door. I would ask them if they would vote for me, if they would support me. And then they said yes, and then I would ask them, ""Well would you be able to you know contribute to my campaign. You know for regular costs of printing and everything."" And that was it. And that's how I raised ten thousand was just off from the doors, off from neighbors. That's what I wanted. I wanted to make sure my campaign was fully ran by the community. So, I did it. I made sure that the money that we got was only from the community. Which I guess was my downfall. I should've accepted money from PACs and everybody else, but I wanted to make a statement.
SP: It sounds like you did.
MO: Yeah.
SP: And so, now that the campaign is over, what are you doing now? The two part question...and then, would you run for office again? [Both proceed to laugh].
MO: Right now... I'm gonna go back to school. I still have a lot of contracts that I have to fulfill. So, and I still have Natives Against Heroin that I'm turning into an org. So, there's still a lot of work that I'm doing. And then, I'm just gonna go back to school for a while. Finish up my degree. And I don't think I'll run again. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I know I'm, this coming next few months, I'm training other Little Earth residents to run.
SP: Fantastic.
MO: So, I got a grant to train other Little Earth residents to sit on neighborhood boards, to sit on commissions, and to also run for public office.
SP: That is fantastic.
MO: I'm a power builder. I like to make sure I help lift people up.
SP: And, what about school? Get a degree in what?
MO: Law enforcement is my degree.
SP: Really? So, can you talk a little bit about that. Why did you decide law enforcement? [Ortega laughing]. I just didn't expect that!
MO: A lot of people don't. [Both laughing]. A lot of people don't! I wanted to change the criminal justice system. So I started my degree back in, 2013? I went to college. I started it out but I never finished. I dropped out of college so that way I could you know raise my daughter. She was going through a lot of health problems at the time. So I stopped school to take care of her. And then, from there I went on working and then started on doing all of this community organizing stuff, so that just became a farther priority. But my degree, my major, has always been law enforcement. Only because of the police brutality that was happening in my community, and to a lot of my family members. I wanted to change the criminal justice system from the inside. So I thought I would become a cop to do that. So I will go finish my law enforcement degree. Then go to the U of M for criminal justice.
SP: Right on. And so, do you think, like at some point working within the criminal justice system somehow other that a cop? Or do you think it's really, or do you wanna be a ""peace officer""? I think that's what they're often...
MO: Mhm. No, I don't wanna be a peace officer. I will do something different within the field. I'm, at first I wanted to be a ""peace officer"" and then reach detective. But then I was like, that's just... I wanna be there before the problems occur. I wanna be able to address it before everything gets to the point of, you know... I don't wanna be there afterwards. After all is said and done, and everyone is already hurt and families are already destroyed. I wanna be there to help fix families. I wanna be there to help address the traumas that our criminal justice system does to our families. 'Cuz there's, not matter what, I get it people make mistakes. We're human beings. But I also understand that, we also have other human beings that are connected to us. If we throw someone in prison, when we throw them in prison like that, their children suffer, their families suffer. They are in prison just as much as their family member is in prison. And we need to be addressing, how is it that we keep... how do we minimize the trauma for the families that are going through this system? We do understand that he or she has a price to pay. We understand that. But we have to minimize the trauma. How can they still parent? We have to allow them to still be a parent. We have to allow them to still... if it's us providing rides for their kids to go here, to see their parents on a weekly basis. If it's doing live Skypes so they can see their kid's dance recital. You know, like, if something we have to do something to minimize and allow them to still be parents while they're incarcerated.
SP: I would agree with you a hundred percent.
MO: 'Cuz they should be able, we could do Skype videos, you know? Like have some [laughs] ""It's my kid's first soccer game."" ""Well guess what? You're gonna sit here and watch your kid's soccer game. Like you're still in prison but, here's your kid's soccer game."" You know? You can still be a part of that, in some type of way. We need to be providing something to help minimize this, because we're just, we're creating a generational trauma that is continuing to play out with a lot of our communities.
SP: Are you a leader in the broader Native community in Minnesota?
MO: Yes.
SP: Well that's fantastic.
MO: Yes. It's not just the Native community. Ever since my campaign it's all over Minneapolis. I wouldn't call myself a leader, I'm more so just an advocate. I just like to help people. It fills my soul. It's one of those things where you say like, if you don't like a job you're not gonna stay there very long, but this is one thing where helping people, it fulfills me. Where I go home, and I feel like I've done good. I've done what I needed to do for the day. And then I can wake up the next day and do it again, and feel good about it. I've had plenty of jobs where... I worked in a homeless shelter. It was the hardest job I had. I told myself I'll never do it again. I worked in a youth homeless shelter for Native kids. And, the shelter would take children—it would be child protection—would take children away from their parents. And they would put them into this, our shelter. And, having to see them, their little faces crying for their parents. All they want is love. And you can see it, and you can feel it. That's all they're yearning for, is their parents' love. I couldn't be a part of that. I couldn't be a part of holding them from their families. All I wanted was for them to have their parents. And when I had to see that, and deal with it every day, I told myself I needed to do something different. I can't be a part of this. I can't hurt these babies. They didn't deserve it. They didn't do nothing wrong for them to have to be sitting in a shelter, wondering what's gonna happen to them. They shouldn't be worried about what's happening to them. So that's, it just reminded me of boarding schools all over again.
SP: I can understand why. I suspect that many people see you as a leader despite your protest that you're just an advocate [both laugh]. And especially for women, and for Native women. You know, I think that for me, I think a lot about, well certainly harm reduction is something I believe in. I've worked in for over twenty years. But my focus, and my emphasis has always been around women. Not to exclude men, but women, women identified, and trying to create positive change for the lives of women, and that are pregnant and parenting, and no access to resources, and desperate. So, I'm wondering...
MO: Women that are incarcerated have harsher sentences than men.
SP: Yes.
MO: They get longer sentences. And it's, it pissed me off when I was in college. I argued with a lot of my instructors in college. I know I'm going back to go argue again [both laugh]. Because it was, it's discriminatory. It's discrimination. And we have a protective class against discrimination against sex. But yet, our criminal justice system can blatantly and openly discriminate over and over and over again. And no judge, no one, gets held accountable. Especially when these women have children, or they're giving birth in prison. A lot of children die from giving birth, from their mothers giving birth in prison. The babies, some of 'em don't even survive. And it's only because of the kind of treatment they get when they're giving birth. They're cuffed to a bed. How would you like it to give birth, being cuffed to a bed? That's...
SP: I can't even imagine.
MO: Right? It's just... oh my god... like, the things that I've read. I tend to take up the harsh topics in everything I do. Even in college I did it. I don't know why it is about me. I take up the topics that nobody wants to talk about. And I tend to write about 'em, and research 'em, and do what I can to figure out well how can we change it? And my instructors were always, me and my instructors were always at each other's necks [laughs]. And it was only because I was always wanting to change a system. Like this can't be happening. Like look at these numbers. And, my instructors are always, you know like... well we'll find out how they feel when they see me come back [laughs].
SP: Well it sounds to me like it's fantastic. Like you are really there to learn. And to create positive change for yourself and for other people. And it sounds like you educate your instructors.
MO: Yeah.
SP: I don't know, in my experience, you know when I would do some education in schools around harm reduction like in the '90s, nobody had ever really heard of it. And, it's Minnesota so abstinence is expected. So it was a hard conversation to have, and it was like spending a lot of time explaining to people what harm reduction was. And it was more related to HIV and Hep-C, rather than overdose. So I'm curious now, like, harm reduction seems to be fairly common-place throughout the country, and in Minnesota! What is your experience like? You know like in school, or other community places? Do people know and support harm reduction? Do you spend a lot of time explaining to them why it matters? Or what's that like?
MO: What I've noticed, harm reduction is much more accepted in the communities of color. In communities of color, it's way more accepted, more looked at like yes we need this. But when you look at the counterparts, like white society for instance. They still believe in abstinence. That's where the hardest part is. The older white folks. It's harder to explain to them. There are still some, you know cuz I, throughout my door knocking when people would ask me about my background in opiates and all of this. It was more so the older white men, that would have the hardest time to accept harm reduction. That I was giving people a way to just continue to use and use and use and use... and to keep the drug stuff going and going. No matter what we do, the drugs will always be there. And that is not because of communities of color. That is because of our country. Our country is allowing the drugs to be there. They are allowing that to be shipped in. It's just communities of color, because they deal with a lot of trauma, they deal with a lot of poverty, and poverty creates trauma, that's why drugs are so susceptible in the communities of color. It is not their fault, why it's here. So, the more I tried to explain that to an older white man, for instance... I think it's because I'm a woman of color. That gives them sometimes the feeling of ""I don't need to listen to you,"" or ""You're not talking."" You know? Being a woman, like you said, you automatically lose some type of respect from some male counterparts. There are a lot of males out there that will automatically lose respect for you just because you're a woman. Being a woman of color you even lose more. So, in this state it's a lot more simpler and easier 'cuz if you go out to like Georgia for instance.... Georgia is so far away from harm reduction. They're still in the criminalization stage where they just wanna criminalize every.... but, I get it, they have a lot of overdoses and stuff going on over there too. But it's, it's gonna take them a while to learn that harm reduction actually helps reduce overdoses. Harm reduction actually helps promote more sobriety, but that takes time to show them that. Because harm reduction is so big in Minnesota, we are the lab rats. We are the ones that will do the data, we'll be the ones to collect all this data, and then we'll start seeing the trickle effects in other states. But we have to be the first. So, right now we will make all the mistakes. But, it's okay to make mistakes, 'cuz we can learn from them. And, we're just fortunate that we have a lot of people in our state that believe in the same thing. That want to be the first to try this. So it will take some time. We'll see it throughout the country, but it'll take time. Am I making sense?
SP: You are absolutely making sense. I was just thinking about where I wanted to go with that. I think that, you are such a strong, I'm sorry I'm gonna use the word leader. And not because... I can see that in you. Your willingness to stand up. Your willingness to be heard. Your bravery and your courage just shine through. And, I'm wondering, like just really I guess in many ways excited to see where you will go next [Ortega laughs]. You don't strike me as a person that is necessarily content [Ortega laughs]. You've just got to keep moving and keep building with what you're doing, and your passion comes through. If I could be so bold, it's like it's grown out of your own experience.
MO: Yes, it has.
SP: And that, you share that. And that, you know your face, and how you radiate...like you're infectious [Both laugh].
MO: Well, thank you! [Both laugh].
SP: I would imagine that, really for younger women, for young girls, for your daughters... two of them right?
MO: Mhm.
SP: That you are a very strong role model.
MO: Yeah. I started out mentoring kids, you know?
SP: Did you?
MO: Mhm. My very first job was a youth mentor.
SP: And were they youth using drugs?
MO: Mhm.
SP: How was that? [Ortega laughs]. I mean like, did they expect, I mean like what was the relationship like? I think oftentimes like youth expect, you know adults to be finger wagging. And, telling them that they shouldn't be using drugs. I mean like, what was that conversation like when you were a mentor of youth, based on your own experience?
MO: I was honest. I was very honest with them. That's really where, that's where the trust came in. That's where I was able to build trust. The more honest you are with people, the more trusting a person can be. And then, once a person trusts you the more impact you can make on them. Especially when it comes to kids and teens. I was honest with them! Like yeah, I used. I used and you guys are using. But guess what? We can do something different. I can do it with you. The more I showed them, and gave them a part of me, the more they gave me them. So, I was able to change a lot of—I call them my kids cuz I'll always look at them as my kids—I was able to change their lives. There's a lot of my kids that already graduated college. A lot of my kids that are already you know, I have one kid that's already almost a lawyer! She's got one more, like session, or like class bar she was saying. One more test, and she'll be able to be a lawyer. I still keep in contact with a lot of my kids. And they still, wherever they see me they still get super excited to see me. And it's like, they're always so happy to tell me how well they're doing. And how much I've helped them. And it's more so listening and being a part of their story, just as much as they're a part of mine.
SP: That's really powerful isn't it?
MO: Yeah.
SP: Growing experience.
MO: That's one thing that I try to explain to people a lot. Life experience means way more than a textbook experience. I'm gonna go back to school and go get my degree and everything, and show everybody like, yes I can do your textbooks. That's totally fine. I'll do your textbooks. But one thing they can't do, is live the life that I lived. One thing they can't do is experience what I've experienced. Or done, what I've done. 'Cuz there is a lot of lives that I've impacted. A lot of lives that I've helped change. And, I am humbled by how much people have trusted me into their lives. And, I am able to help them have a better life. Give them hope. Cuz there's a lot of addicts out here that don't even have hope. And for me to be able to give them hope for another day, that we can do this another day, and we'll get through it. It means the world to me. It means the world to me to see the light in them come out.
SP: Thank you. I think that's a wonderful place to end the interview [Ortega laughs]. I guess I should ask, is there anything else you want to add?
MO: Nope! That everything."

Interviewer
January 26, 2017
At Minnesota Alternatives
Spring Lake Park, Minnesota
Paula DeSanto    -PD
Amy Sullivan     -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I'm in Spring Lake Park, Minnesota at Minnesota Alternatives with Paula DeSanto. Paula can you state your name and say that you give me permission?
PD: This is Paula DeSanto and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record today. 
AS: Thank you. One of the things I like to start off with in the interviews is kind of just to get more of a full picture of who you are. I'm interviewing you because you're a professional in the field but I'm also trying to get a sense of people's journeys to where they ended up. If you could just give me a little background. You can spend as much or as little time on it as you want. Where you grew up and stuff like that. Who you are.
PD: What inspired me to be doing what I'm doing?
AS: What inspired you.
PD: I grew up in Rochester, Minnesota. I was, I am, the daughter of a physician. My father's a physician who worked for the state hospital down in Rochester. He was not in the field of psychiatry per se but his job was to be the primary care doctor for the internal medicine doctors that took care of the patients that were at the Rochester State Hospital that got physically ill. I was born into a home that was actually on the state hospital campus. We would go to the hospital, that was back in the days when the boundaries were all blurry. We would be taken to the hospital. We would be attending events that they had at the hospital with the patients. My mother tells a story once when we walked into a bathroom in a hospital and apparently there was feces all over the wall. I looked at her and I said, ""I'm not cleaning this up."" She says, ""No, you don't have to. That's okay."" 
There were times when we would be at home, it was an open campus back then, it was much more of an asylum and patients were free to roam about. The patients would come into our home. She shared a story once where a patient came in and immediately went to the drawer and was rummaging through the utensils drawer. She got quite alarmed, she thought maybe he was looking for a weapon. It turns out he wanted a bottle opener. There are some interesting stories then. I have memories of my father bringing patients home. They would have a bunch of cuts on their arms. I was curious about why they would do things like that. It set a clear impression that people with mental illness are people that are in trouble and aren't to be feared or aren't pathological or somehow different than us. They're just ill. Both my parents were very compassionate people. There was just a culture of compassion in our home. That was kind of early experience with mental health issues. We did not have any experience with substance use disorder dynamic in our family. Neither of my parents used drugs or alcohol at all. 
When I was a young child I was pretty independent and willful and was good at negotiating. I was quite certain I was heading for a career in law. I just assumed that was what I was going to do. I went to a couple years of community college in Rochester then moved up to Minneapolis to start at the U of M to continue on towards a bachelor’s degree in political science with the anticipation that I was heading towards some kind of prelaw program. Then on a whim decided to take my college tuition money and go on a road trip. I took the quarter or semester off with a friend, went out to Arizona and just had a lot of fun. Then some sort of epiphany occurred to me and I decided I didn't want to be an attorney. Instead I wanted to be a social worker. 
AS: What year was this or what year were you born?
PD: I was born in '61. Graduated high school in '79 and moved up to Minneapolis in '81.
AS: This is the early 80s that you go on this road trip. That's awesome. Do you have siblings?
PD: I do, I come from a family of five girls. 
AS: Where are you in the family?
PD: I'm number two. Some other kind of interesting stories; I was caught in the seventh grade with marijuana in school because it was around and a lot of people were dabbling with it in the seventh grade. I was wanting to be kind of a leader. I bought some pot and a bunch of us were going to go to a movie that night and go and smoke some pot and try it out. It really was very experimental at that time. We were young. We were in the bathroom smoking cigarettes as well. The things we did at young ages. I had this bag of pot in my lunch bag. We got caught smoking cigarettes and they found the pot. 
AS: There's probably more going on here. We're going to take a look.
PD: Curiously though I was sent to the assistant principal's office and he said, ""I'm calling your mom."" I said, ""Let me call her."" I got on the phone with my mom and she was a very rational person. She said, ""What's going on?"" ""I'm in the principal's office. I got in some trouble."" She said, ""Smoking in the can."" I said, ""Worse."" ""Drugs?"" ""Yep."" She came and picked me up and I was just sent home for the day. There actually weren't any consequences from the school except that they wanted me to be evaluated by a counselor for drug and alcohol problem I guess. I remember that night I went home and my dad took me out to play tennis instead of going to the movies. We went and played tennis and I told my parents it was experimental. I wanted to kind of be cool so I was the one that bought it. I had money. We were all going to go do it but I didn't have a problem. It was true. It was a true story. They accepted it. The counselor called a couple months later saying to come in for an evaluation. I told them I didn't need it and my mother supported me so I never got the evaluation. 
It did launch a fairly longstanding experience with cannabis. I was blessed with this, my father's from the Philippines, he came from the Philippines to Minnesota to study medicine. As a result of some of my Asian ancestry I lack and enzyme that breaks down alcohol so I have a constant state of Antabuse in my system. If I drink I get rashy or uncomfortable and my heartrate increases. So I don't drink. Alcohol was never my thing. A lot of my peers were in to alcohol at early ages as they were into cannabis and speed and LSD and mushrooms. I dabbled pretty hard from kind of junior high through high school. I had the good fortune to have enough common sense and supportive home and family environment that I really never got into trouble. I was able to maintain my academics and I started working at fifteen in the food industry. Despite having a pretty intensive with substance use, I bet I was stoned almost every day for three, four, five years. I managed to not get in much trouble. 
AS: And you didn't get caught again.
PD: I didn't get caught again. Curiously by the time I graduated high school I pretty much had outgrown most of that stuff and was able to stay out of it.
AS: What about your sisters?
PD: They weren't. They didn't venture. Maybe a little casual alcohol use but they were pretty, and a little bit of pot dabbling but they didn't like the experience with cannabis that I did. They stayed away for the most part. There really wasn't any direct intro through my siblings or my parents. When we start to talk about nephews and nieces and second generation there's more stuff going on.
AS: What about your mom. You said your dad came from the Philippines to med school. Where's your mom from? 
PD: My mom is from northern Minnesota, small town called Breckenridge near Fargo. She's got German ancestry and she was working in Minneapolis as a secretary. She hadn't had a college education and they started dating and she got pregnant and they got married. That's kind of their story. They kept trying to have a boy and five girls later.
AS: My parents did the same thing, they tried. They stopped after three.
PD: After three girls? That question comes up frequently about what's your history? Are you in recovery? I get that a lot from people, from clients. I say, ""I have a pretty extensive experience with drugs and alcohol but I was fortunate that I really never ended up developing symptoms of an alcohol use disorder."" I might have maybe had one or two. I don't think it was ever really anything beyond mild. 
AS: Your life didn't spin out of control as a result. It didn't take over your life.
PD: Right. 
AS: I want to come back to that later when you're talking about clients. We'll just try to remember that about why is it that in this field people feel like the person that they're talking to or confiding in has to have had that same experience to effectively relate and treat to them when in all other aspects of psychotherapy and medicine we don't expect, we don't have that expectation. Maybe we can talk about that a little.
PD: Do you want to briefly cover it now?
AS: Let's just talk about that now. 
PD: That was a design of the field. The field was created typically by people initially who were in recovery.
AS: The Minnesota Model.
PD: Exactly. When it started they chose to adopt AA.
AS: And help people help others.
PD: Absolutely that was a key part of it. The system created that phenomenon. Clients don't really cling to that. My response to them typically is, they may be curious but I typically say, ""You know, while I appreciate that's a concern for you and that you feel that might help me better identify with you. I think that there are lots of ways for me to be able to identify with you. That's why having an open heart and a good skill set. I'm a woman, you're a man. I can't identify with that fully. I'm not your parent. So you're saying that anyone who comes in here with a mental illness, if I don't have that mental illness I can't help them. If I don't have that personal background, I can't help them. There's no way we can walk in everybody's shoes. What matters more is that we're people that are really interested in trying to help you. We're compassionate. We're welcoming. We have skills. We have some skills that we can offer you if you want them. Skills and knowledge."" 
AS: Then they kind of back down. Would you say part of that, the way that's been created has to do with stigma and the power of stigma? That if I haven't battled with addiction myself they might see that as there being some stigma because stigma is so strong against it around us? 
PD: I don't know if it's stigma so much as the system has created this idea that there's normies and there's abnormies. You somehow are a group separate from us. If you don't actually have this thing they've convinced you that you have. This genetic disease, this abnormal brain that makes you unique. We're all kind of in it and if you're not in it you're separate from us. I think that unfortunately that traditional 12 Step disease based approaches have created that divide. They created it and fueled it. That language still comes up. I'm like, ""What?"" We spend a lot of time pointing out our commonalities and how blurry those things really are. The difference between someone with a substance use issue and not and how things happen on continuums and different levels of severity. Client today, staff tomorrow. Staff today, client tomorrow. It's really very blurry. We all have a lot of the same conditions. 
AS: It's just how they impact our lives. 
PD: I think more and more that we recognize the environmental factors are significant. In terms of the stressors that people are struggling with in the environment that they're in in terms of their ability to navigate a lot of the challenges. We're looking at really highly stimulated people today. I think it creates a lot of unsettled nervous systems out there. I think that's hard too. Everyone's all amped up all the time. They get their first drink or their first benzo or their first opiate.
AS: And they finally calm down.
PD: Right.
AS: Let's go back to your epiphany or your moment on the road trip where you decided that you wanted to do social work and not law. You had moved from wanting to maybe be a police officer to lawyer. You always wanted to do something for people?
PD: Yes. 
AS: It just changed.
PD: Being a lawyer was really being an advocate.
AS: You were moving towards that.
PD: Definitely.
AS: What happened after the road trip?
PD: I think I just had a chance to slow down a little bit and kind of reevaluate where I was heading. While political science was interesting to me I think I realized it was about human relationships. I went back to the U and changed my major from political science to human relationships. Then I started a different course.
AS: By that point you were what? A junior?
PD: I was. 
AS: Then where did you go from there?
PD: Then I finished up the human relationships program at the University of Minnesota and then right on the heels of that I started working in the field of mental health in 1981. Right when I moved up here I got a job as a mental health worker without any training, without any degrees. I just got a tech type job in a big large residential facility. They hired me quite frankly I think because when they asked me, ""What's the difference between mental illness and mental retardation?"" I knew the difference. I think that was my credential. I started working in a big facility, a two hundred bed facility in St. Paul as a mental health worker. That just kind of launched my career and I've been doing it ever since. I finished my undergraduate work and I was working by then in a higher level position as a mental health counselor once I got my bachelor’s degree. That went right into a master’s degree. 
There was an employer that I had that was very innovative and very person-centered in her approach and she pursued work coming out of Boston University, the Center for Psych Rehab, Dr. William Anthony's work. Back then it was highly progressive. The idea that there's a patient movement out there. That there's an approach toward mental health care that doesn't fit the positions in charge that it really is the person that should be in the center and the doctor and the medical team are one part of that. As a patient my goals, my wants, and my needs should be respected in this process. That was the heart of this work coming out of Boston University. I entered a master’s program at the support of my employer at the time to get a masters in psychiatric rehabilitation counseling. 
AS: Did you do that in Boston or did you do that here?
PD: It was both actually. I went out there for intensive course work and all the clinical work was done here through transcription and actual CDs and cassette tapes.
AS: Cassette tapes, not even CDs.
PD: Record and play buttons.
AS: You'd get your course content that way.
PD: I'd get my clinical work, yes. It was a program that was designed for working clinicians. The work was done on audio and sent to my instructors to evaluate. Then I'd be flying out there periodically for intensive coursework. It was kind of a half, half.
AS: Pre-internet.
PD: Exactly. 
AS: Pre online course work. We moved around back then. 
PD: That kind of helped solidify some credentials anyway. Then I worked for that organization for eleven years. I ended up working as a director, developing a new program. It was called, supportive living services that basically provided an assertive case management type service to people where you go out into their homes and help them manage their mental health issues in their homes. Very boots on the ground, community based, do what it takes. That was after working several years in the residential intensive mental health. It was all mental health really. I worked for that organization for eleven years. 
Then I got head hunted by the department of human services to go out to Anoka Metro Region Treatment Center. They were at that time moving from their old state hospital campus to their new multimillion dollar facility. The commissioner was spending millions of dollars to build this new state hospital. My job was to transition, help them transition their clinical services from a kind of highly medical outdated model to a person centered progressive model as they moved to their new state of the art facility. 
AS: Do you remember what year this is?
PD: It would have been about; I can look at my resume. 
AS: That's okay. You can give it to me later.
PD: Let me see, early 90s. 
AS: May I ask you a question about the history of mental health? In the 80s Reagan puts all kind of mentally ill people back out. Would you say your career at this point kind of reflects what, you were going from an institution into people's homes? Did you see positives and negatives? We tend to only think of New York City and all the mentally ill. Do you remember any of that? I find that part really interesting.
PD: Definitely.
AS: It was probably really good for some people and really horrible for others.
PD: Absolutely. I think any time you run into an everybody needs the same thing kind of thinking you're going to run into trouble. The assumption back then was everyone needs to get out of the asylums and in apartments on their own. For a lot of people that was the last thing they needed. Granted there was the development of group homes. The group homes back then weren't actually homes. People could be in them if they needed to be in them. When I first started in mental health, in residential mental health people could be in them for years. They were really a place, they were transitional homes and then you could go when you wanted to go, when you needed to go, when there were resources to accommodate your next step. 
AS: But you could also just stay.
PD: Yes, you could stay long-term and they'd redefine them to ninety day programs. A sort of intensive treatment, residential treatment. With the idea then ACT teams, assertive community treatment, wrap around teams, supportive living services like the programs that were developing would help people transition from state hospitals to more group homes, short term residential treatment into long-term stays in communities in their apartments. Good, yes absolutely but most people probably would prefer to have their own places and be able to be active members of their community. For a lot of people with severe substance use issues and mental health issues living alone in an apartment was not considered to be an environment that they're going to desire. It just led to isolation and a return of symptoms and a lack of community. They weren't naturally prone to community integration. The community wasn't welcoming. That continues today. 
There's some kind of pendulum that moves all over the place but there's definitely some recognition that we need to have long-term community type settings for people. It's not the idea that everybody needs to be alone in an apartment is the best option. Congregate living, with lots of supports on site where services can kind of come in and out of people's lives based on their current acuity. That way have people that can be available twenty-four seven if needed but not programming them if they don't need the programming, being flexible. There's been lots of heroes up there who have advocated for a return to some more of that community housing models, cooperative housing, supportive housing. There's a lot of regulations now that prohibit it because you can't have too many people living together or you move into these institutes for mental diseases clauses that prevent you from actually developing programs that house people with disabilities. They want to be integrated. We could go on and on about that. 
AS: Then there's all the zoning and the neighbors and people who don't want those people in their neighborhood. 
PD: Right. My job was to actually close two of the units at the state hospital and open up then two sixty bed units, one in Bloomington and one in St. Paul. Then transition the rest of the units to a facility. Integrate their mental health and substance use disorder care and bring patient centered state of the art services to the state of the art hospital.
AS: At this point are you an administrator?
PD: Yes.
AS: You've kind of worked into that. You're not dealing directly one on one with residents.
PD: I did a fair amount. I had a primary treatment unit that was a psychiatrist and a social worker and some other disciplines and I was the treatment director on the unit. So I did a lot with the units. The two sixty bed units I was hands on there trying to direct the care as well and then trying to get the hospital to do stuff differently which continues to be an ongoing struggle. It was real apparent to me that while the intentions from the department of human services might have been good in terms of we really want a person centered, state of the art, mission driven services but there's so many conflicting interests because we had also had a public safety medical model. It was a very difficult system to try to change because everybody's worried about risk and liability. 
AS: Are people hurting themselves or hurting other people?
PD: I did that for five years and then said, ""Oh boy. I'm not committed to them."" Another epiphany. It was. I had a dream that if I stayed at that job I was going to get cancer. It was one of those really, really obvious messages and so I listened to the dream. I gave them a year's notice and I left. I worked my ass off for another year and gave up wrapping up these projects I was deep into. Then I moved on. I went traveling for six months and then got a job with People Incorporated which is a very mission driven pretty state of the art mental health organization. I worked for them for nine years directing a campus on the North side of Minneapolis. I had a nice integrated network of services there that I helped develop and create and led a big capital campaign and built buildings. That was great. I thought that was probably where I was going to end up retiring. Then I had another epiphany. The universe keeps kind of just telling me what to do. 
AS: You listened. 
PD: It was a Sunday afternoon and I was in the tub and this message said you need to open a drug and alcohol treatment program. What are you talking about? You need to do this. Alright. At that point I was feeling pretty discouraged about having worked in mental health for decades now and seen the revolving door. All the stuff you talk about in your chapter, inaccessibility and the same things over and over that repetitive nature of things. This is a continuous loop, barriers to access, unwelcoming, one size fits all, blaming the family, all the stuff. I saw it and I saw it firsthand, I heard about it from clients over and over. It's just like how long are we going to keep blaming the client for the system's failure? 
I'd been trying to champion mental health person centered care for all of my career really. Mental health has been enormous strides towards moving toward a patient to patient recovery movement which is impactful. I think we've come a long way in mental health in terms of making that a rehabilitative experience and much more person centered. We have a long way to go. But with drug and alcohol we were still stuck in the 50s. There we were. There I was. I guess in 2009, April basically given marching orders. We opened that September and here we are today trying to recreate the system. 
AS: Who would you say your marching orders come from in your epiphany?
PD: I think they're just universal.
AS: Something bigger than yourself.
PD: Yes. I think I'm here to provide service and to give guidance. I think that we all have access to that if we tap into that flow and listen, if we're willing to listen and be open. I think I appreciate you emphasizing that because I think that probably is what kind of keeps me going. I just trust that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing and we're doing the best we can.
AS: In the moment where we are.
PD: Exactly. That's all you can do. I'm not guided by fear; I'm not guided by liability or worry. Let's just do the best we can to create an environment where people feel welcome and comfortable so they can get out of survival mode and start to open up and trust and heal. Whatever that looks like. Do the best we can with that. I just have an enormous confidence that if it all comes tumbling down then it’s time to do something else. My survival doesn't rely on anything. I trust that regardless I'll be okay. I have two operating principles: how's this going to read in the Star Tribune with big decisions? Most times it reads fine. It'll read okay. How will it read? That's kind of how we make decisions. Most of what we do I think you can justify pretty clearly. It doesn't fit the norms or the rules or always the safest routes but builds a hell of a good argument. I can sleep with that and worst case scenario it all comes tumbling down, I'm going to be okay. There's other stuff to do. That keeps us in the flow. When you're in the flow the universe helps you. It just does.
AS: Were you raised in a religion at all? Did your parents model this or did you kind of just get this as you grew?
PD: My father's Catholic and he tried to impose it upon us but my mother she's a self-proclaimed atheist. She didn't support him. No way he's going to round up five kids and take care of it. There was this attempt at Catholicism but the closest we got to a church was the bingo hall probably. 
AS: So you didn't really have a formal religious education to speak of. That's really interesting. Okay so 2009 you started Minnesota Alternatives. Did you get your PhD?
PD: No. 
AS: You did not get your PhD. Okay so tell me how did this come about? You thought ""I'm going to open up my own clinic.""
PD: I had been doing program development for a long time. My first job I was quickly into leadership roles and development programs. The state hospitals development programs and people incorporated my job as to develop programs. I know how to do it. I know the rules. I know how to work the process of getting a program. I just kind of started networking to figure out where would be the best place to do it. At that time, because of a rich history working in Anoka County it seemed like this would probably be the easiest place. That's where we started. We started in Columbia Heights in 2009 and moved up here to expand in 2011, into Spring Lake Park. 
AS: Now we're talking about Minnesota Alternatives?
PD: Correct. 
AS: Just for the record here.
PD: Minnesota Alternatives, that's what it's been ever since. The model has been evolving as we continue to get feedback from the clients about what's helpful and what's not helpful. We had a basic structure and the structure that we used was kind of drawing from my heroes. Certainly William Anthony and person centered care. Gabor Mate in terms of understanding trauma and attachment and the power of environment. I'm a fan of Mark Lewis, Joe Rispenza the concepts of being able to evolve your brain and looking at neuroplasticity and our capacities to harness, our ability to train our brains. Marshall Libhann has done a lot of skills and my training of Boston University was very skills based and helping people develop recovery visions, rehabilitation goals they call them. 
Basically was a vision. What does that vision look like? What do we do to help you realize that vision? Very person centered. You decide and we help you figure out how to get there. That's always the paradigm with which I've worked. That continues to be the center of everything we do. We build in more educational information about what's the best of the best and ways to help support people through a lot of trauma work for example and individual therapy. Helping also with accountability. If people need accountability we can do that too. The system’s heavy on accountability that's not the piece that we emphasize but for a lot of people that's what they want. 
AS: The addiction treatment system?
PD: Absolutely. Probation and addiction treatment are in bed together. What's with that? That's just absurd how that developed. We kind of think about these pillars of therapy and counseling and welcoming and comfortable and really priority on engagement. Then we have education which hopefully is science based state of the art with a heavy emphasis on true informed decision making so that people know what the risks are. Let them know the opportunities and the risks and they get to decide. Heavy emphasis again on harnessing the powers of neuroplasticity and then overcoming well-worn pathways from addictive behaviors or any behaviors that we've been caught in for a long time. Support, education, and accountability. People really want accountability and we can do that. We can do that if they need it. That has been the goal for the last nine years, is to offer an alternative for people other than traditional treatment. Our program's open ended, people get to decide how long they come, how often they come, what they do while they're here. If they want to just come for skills fine. If they want to stay for the process, the goal is that everything we offer people participate in because they find it helpful. 
AS: If the 12 Step program doesn't resonate with them you have other options. 
PD: Yes, and if it does that's fine too. A lot of people actually are working the 12 Step programs and coming here. They're not mutually exclusive. 
AS: What about medication? How have you approached that?
PD: We are not a provider of methadone but we have prescribers who can prescribe sabaxone and there are addiction psychiatrists who can prescribe sabaxone and or any other medications that help reduce recurrence or severity of recurrence. We're big proponents of medications if people want them. We have found them to be incredibly helpful along with psychiatric medications.
AS: Do you work in conjunction with methadone clinics? Is there a continuum of care or do people have to have those separate services, can what they do here count for what they might have to do at let's say Valhalla?
PD: Absolutely. We work real closely. We have a lot of clients who are at Valhalla and so there’s release signed and then we coordinate the care. It works really well because a lot of the clients that we work that they're working with they're fairly complicated. There might be a lot of complex medical issues involved as well. We bring in primary care. Then we kind of work together in terms of how we can best support people. It works so well because they several paradigms in terms of trying to reduce barriers to engagement and keep them coming. And harm reduction. When people ask what your program philosophy, I don't throw out harm reduction because people think all kinds of things when you say that. I say, we are person centered, meaning we embrace a whole range of goals from abstinence to harm and risk reduction. People get to decide. 
I think that idea, that people come because they find it helpful. We teach skills on a regular training curriculum like you would go to college. If you demonstrate that if you get this you, you're integrating it then don't go to that class that day. You don't need to be there, it's not relevant to you. If you want to go because you want the reinforcement because you learn through repetition, fine. If you want to go because you want to support your peers in learning and be an example, fine. You don't have to. You don't have to do stuff that you already know. 
AS: It keeps people from feeling bored and resentful. 
PD: Exactly. Ironically what we find is that most people don't want to stop. We have to push, gently encourage people out.
AS: They're feeling very heard and at home here.
PD: Why would I stop coming to something that helps me grow? Why would I stop? You've got a good point. We really try to validate that for people but we have services on site. As people are getting ready to go and have got it, they've really developed mastery, they have gained or regained control of their lives then we say, ""Why don't you start dabbling with some support services."" Just start going over there while you're still actively in treatment and check out some of the support services.
AS: But that you also offer here.
PD: Yes, through the non-profit. Try those then that's what helps people.
AS: What do you offer there? Are there names of programs?
PD: Yes.
AS: What are those called?
PD: There's a co-ed, these are all led by peer specialists these are people who have gone through some clinical cure specialist training. There's a co-ed group on Monday nights they call it a peer support group. Tuesday we offer group for family and loved ones based on CRFT, the Community Reinforcement Family Training. Wednesday they're gender specific. There's a men and women's group. Also peer support groups. Thursday we have Smart Recovery. Then Friday is movies and a meal. You can just drop in from four to eight Monday through Friday and just hang out. 
AS: Just be there. 
PD: It's all anonymous. There's no paperwork anybody needs to fill out. We don't require that they prove that they have any kind of diagnosis. It's free. It's like an AA club in that way. There is no expectation that you have to say anything about who you are. There's no paperwork tracking you.
AS: This is a boring question but how are insurance companies dealing with this program?
PD: Well, really well. Curiously, you'd think they'd start to say, ""You know what? That has been there three years, I think it's time."" But they don't. We have yet to have an insurance company cut anybody off. I think because it's outpatient care and they understand that.
AS: It's counseling. It could be one on one counseling and group therapy. Do you offer group therapy?
PD: Both. I think that because it's not five days a week, five hours a day people might come once a month. People might come...
AS: Someone here is saying, they're here so they get billed?
PD: Absolutely. The health insurance companies understand that substance use disorders on the severe end are not episodic, typically, and don't just kind of go away. It's a long distance through the whole process. It's a severe mental illness. Generally, people need to have the opportunity to move in and out of services fairly seamlessly if their acuity changes, if their needs change. To have a system that says, ""We'll hang in there with people long term as they go through the ups and downs of their illness and then keep them engaged."" I think four years was our longest client. The health plans, they're like, ""We love that. They're still engaged. It's keeping them from more higher cost services or emergency rooms."" We're in network with all the health plans and I think if you ask most of them they say we're a good provider. 
AS: Did you have to sell this to health insurance companies or you just started it?
PD: They were thrilled. The health insurance companies are fed up with everybody getting the same old same old. 
AS: And relapsing.
PD: Not seeing any outcomes. We've been measuring outcomes.
AS: That's at thirty, forty thousand dollars a pop. 
PD: Exactly. High cost and ineffectiveness. We've been tracking outcomes from the beginning and we have really strong outcomes.
AS: Do you know those off the top of your head? You can give them to me later.
PD: Probably close to sixty percent successfully complete. That shows reduced use, it shows higher quality of life. It shows less consequences as a result of use. It shows that they're making changes, moving along the process of change. We've been doing twelve month follow up. It's ninety some, high ninety percent of people are out there living with reasonable to high quality of life and not problematic use. Probably half of them at any given time might still be using. 
We just did another big evaluation; we just did another big call to try to get twelve-month post follow up response in terms of how people are doing. We've been able to get maybe close to two hundred people and they're doing really well. They're doing well. We've been tracking outcomes from the beginning. We're just doing another, we have all our 2016 outcomes that are all being compiled and all the client feedback. Every time somebody is discharged we do an admission and discharge survey to assess these things pre and post and at twelve months. We have data. When I went to a health insurance meeting and they have all these providers come and they're like, ""We want to talk about your outcomes"" and nobody had anything. They had admission and discharge stats but nobody was measuring...
AS: The other providers?
PD: Yes, they were like no clinical outcomes. 
AS: How can they get away with that?
PD: Exactly. Right? I got three minutes Amy. Are we getting close?
AS: Sure. 
PD: I'm looking at this and we've kind of gone through most. 
AS: I forgot to ask you.
PD: I got through most.
[Heavy machinery noise in background]
AS: Let's sit over here a bit. Well it's only making a little bit of a buzz on here. I think we're still recording.
PD: I'm mostly curious about what it is.
AS: You talked about your best practices. If you could predict something that would happen, something good to happen regarding addiction treatment what would it be? Or change the system somehow what you see where there would just be a huge shift? What's going to take?
PD: I think we have a mental health system that we can use to model things after. Mental health has a lot of community based services. Therapists see people long term; you don't cut them off because they have problems with their symptoms. You should be able to see your counselor long term. You should be able to get wraparound services in your home if you need that level that would include a prescriber and a nurse and a counselor and a therapist. That you have prescribers who are available to you long term that when your symptoms become more severe they don't cut you off. If you need outpatient programs that you should be able to move through them fairly quickly without having to go through complex assessments. You should be able to stay engaged with them long term. A much more robust peer support system so that we've got peer support centers.
AS: Places where people can go when they're struggling or just want to have company. 
PD: And have outreach workers too so that their peers can go out in people's homes and reach out.
AS: Really model it like much of what we do...
PD: With mental health. We should be able to do a lot of the medications in primary care. One of my big questions right now, and I'm working closely with Allina with this, is that we help support their primary care providers to provide medications to help reduce recurrence and that they really start to robustly serve this population. The way that we can support them is that we kind of do these warm handoffs or agree to these long term partnerships. And say, ""If you've got someone that you see in your clinic and you're worried you call us. We'll go see that person. We'll check in with them. If you want us to monitor their medication, we'll come down to the clinic and get their meds.""
AS: Instead of having two separate silos that don't really communicate with each other. More coordinated efforts between it. 
PD: Absolutely and whether that's if we're co located which I think would be the logical thing to do, that we actually co locate right in the clinic. If they have somebody that they see and they want to refer them they can just send them down the hall and a very welcoming drug and alcohol or co trained mental health professional will start to talk with them about their needs. Then not assuming that everybody needs treatment but they would get referred to a mental health therapist or they just do some early intervention kind of prevention. 
There's a lot of people that come through the drop in. I started talking to one of them and it’s like, ""You know what. You don't need treatment. Here's a rethinking drinking booklet, here's some information on Naltrexone, here's some strategies. Here's a screen so you can actually monitor when you've gone from recreational into problematic use. Here's actually the screen they would use to determine here's the symptoms and if you have two or more you're kind of moving into trouble. Look at all this. Call me."" A lot of people are like, ""Oh God that's so helpful."" As opposed to ""You've got to come in and get this three-hundred-dollar assessment."" 
AS: And then go away for thirty days and disrupt your family. 
PD: Or this assumption that if you're an outpatient and you have a use episode that you need residential. That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard about. 
AS: You're in outpatient, you relapse, and then you have to head back in.
PD: To residential. We accept goals other than abstinence because there's this whole theory of cross addiction that if once you have an alcohol problem you automatically have an opiate problem. Or if once you have a cocaine problem you automatically have a cannabis problem. It's not founded. It's inaccurate. 
AS: It's not based in scientific evidence.
PD: It's not based in our neurophysiological capacity. 
AS: The Minnesota Model, that's why you opened this place. Is to offer something different. 
PD: The other thing is I'm not trying to covet this. I want this approach to be available to anybody who wants to try any parts of it. I do lots of training. I give information out. I don't require that you go through these high cost trainings in order to use the stuff. I wrote a book that's just very simple. Take it, use any of it, any pieces of it you want. Call me. The more that people just dabble with the ideas. If you're just starting to dabble with the idea of it, letting someone stay in your program without embracing that goal of abstinence and you feel a little bit uncomfortable about it call me and I can help give you some reassurance that it's going to be okay. This is how you can cover your butt if this is what your concerns are. It's happening. There's lots of providers now that are lining up, if you will, starting to try different things. The response to this program has been overwhelming. We cannot keep up. We cannot even come close to keeping up. 
AS: How many people are you serving right now?
PD: Probably one hundred.
AS: Then you're opening a second location in St. Paul. When does that open?
PD: Hopefully in February. At any given time, there's a waiting list which is awful.
AS: But your capacity here is one hundred?
PD: About. 
AS: Will that be about the same there?
PD: Probably a little less, it's a smaller space. 
AS: Thank you Paula. 
PD: I just want to say. Amy what I really appreciate about your article is I just want to comment that I really like your ideas about mothers feeling empowered to start to challenge the status quo. All the judgement that the system gives, the blaming the parent, and your comparison to having a child in the military. All your energy is just wondering is this person going to make it through the day. Your priority is to preserve life. At what point, how long can you do that? Then it becomes your own survival questions.
AS: Which is what we talk about in the rooms in Nar Anon. Okay my life is out of control now because of this. And what you're saying is we don't have to get to that point. 
PD: Right, hopefully not for sure.
AS: It's what most people get to. 
PD: How do we help support people?
AS: The addicts are told when they hit their bottom, then I'm going to funeral more often than I really care to. For people who shouldn't be dead.
PD: Absolutely. We're also a distributor of NarCan too. 
AS: Good. 
PD: I just really recognize and appreciate how you package this in terms of really helping people understand what it is to be a parent of someone who is struggling to help preserve their life. How do they stay well enough to survive that experience or even better how do they stay well enough to become an agent for change?
AS: Thank you for that compliment. That means a lot to me. I really respect what you're doing here. I wish I'd known of you some years ago. How it's unfolded is how it's unfolded. She's alive and doing well, thriving with medication assisted treatment I should say. 
PD: That's good. 
AS: It's been a lifesaver. I'm the preacher for it. I tell anybody.

Minnetonka, Minnesota
Ann Perry-AP
Amy Sullivan-AS
AP: We’re going to go there and celebrate. We got to know her and she said, “I was just at a drug task force meeting and Spencer’s name came up.” She said, “There’s a huge investigation going on between Carver County and Anoka County.” He died in Anoka County in Columbia Heights. “There’s some inter-relationship with everything. Do you mind if I give your numbers to the investigators?” I was up at the cabin and Dean said, “Absolutely, but Ann’s been talking to the Anoka County investigator.” Then I heard two weeks ago, I’ll have you read it. 
AS: What, to think about the investigation?
AP: Yes, what if they find somebody? Spencer probably would have known this person or asked him to buy heroin.
AS: Don’t you think they’re just looking so that they can bust somebody?
AP: I think they’re to go as high up the ladder that they can. Does it affect me as a mom?
AS: I don’t know if it’s going to affect you as a mom at all. It’s so confusing because it’s our child’s addiction. 
AP: He said, “I really want to find this person that made Spencer accessible to his addiction.” There’re lots of people who make him accessible. I was always so fearful of the public safety people.
AS: Why? What do you mean?
AP: Just because they’re looking for the glory of these big drug busts. I just remember that when they had the Hennepin County heroin town hall meeting.
AS: When we went to that, you and me and Kim.
AP: When they threw away all our Nar-Anon flyers. We were just starting the Nar-Anon. We ran off fifty copies of the flyers for our meetings and thought there might be some parents there.
AS: Yes, there were a lot of parents there I think. 
AP: We asked at one of the tables if we could display these. The woman said, “Well let me check with the sheriff to make sure it’s okay.” When it was over we went by the garbage can and there they all were.
AS: No! They hadn’t even been put on…
AP: On the table. 
AS: Then they made us all sign in and wanted to get our email addresses.
AP: Andy Luger says if you just keep your kids in sports and talk about it around the dining room table. Here were the four front rows full of parents with dead children. How insensitive can you get?
AS: That same message came from someone who spoke from Teen Challenge. You needed to have dinner with your children. I remember looking at you and Kim.
AP: Well that didn’t work. [laughs]
AS: Where we are at right now, our kids aren’t in seventh grade anymore. This isn’t the DARE program. 
AP: Hopefully they’re past that message.
AS: I’m not sure they are. If you want to just read that release form. This is Amy Sullivan it is July 6, 2016. I’m at Ann Perry’s home in Minnetonka, Minnesota. She’s folding laundry and we’re sitting at the kitchen table. The electricity went out last night in a huge storm, so there are generators going all over the neighborhood here. Ann, would you state your name and say that you give me permission to record this?
AP: Yes, Amy. My name is Ann Perry and I give you, Amy Sullivan, permission to record this interview.
AS: Thanks. Let’s start with your childhood, where you were raised, what your childhood was like, your early adulthood, parenthood. You can just keep going and I’ll ask questions as I need to. 
AP: I was born in 1951. I’ll be sixty-five at the end of the month. I was the second of six children. I was born in Wisconsin, but my parents moved here, I believe, when I was two. My father fought in World War II. He was a very young recruit or enlistee. I think in 1944. He was put in a division that liberated a lot of the concentration camps in Europe, which has some bearing on what I’ll say later. He has a half-sister that’s five years older than he. His parents were very close to me growing up. I’d often go and stay with them during the summertime because of the number of children my mom had. My mother grew up in Wisconsin. My father grew up in Wisconsin. They met in high school. She went to college and she became a nurse during World War II, but she never practiced because the war ended afterwards. She grew up with a degree but never using the degree in her professional life until later. 
Early on in my childhood my dad became an alcoholic. I think a lot of it had to do with the trauma he experienced in World War II and what he saw in World War II. That’s probably not the only reason. He probably had some alcohol addiction in his family, too. It was very difficult growing up in a family, especially with six kids, with an alcoholic. My mother often put me in the position of being a parent. We would find my dad passed out on the floor. She would have me run up and get a doctor. I often found myself having to take care of her because she was always wimping out for things like that. I had a real strong relationship with my oldest sister until she got into junior high. Then she became very distant from me. I always kind of feel like I raised myself. I grew up by raising myself. It has its good and bad traits about it. 
When I went to high school I became very wild. I got suspended from school once. I drank, smoked pot and hash. Then I went off to college. I wasn’t really a serious student until I was probably a junior. Then I became very interested in history and geography. I got a double major. Then a girlfriend and I went to Europe, we hitch hiked around. It was so much fun. Then I came back and didn’t really know what to do. First, I got a teaching degree and in student teaching discovered that I really didn’t like teaching kids, middle and high school. One of my professors taught an urban planning class. I took that and became enamored with it. The head of the department told me about an urban planning master’s program down in St. Louis. I went down there. I didn’t know a soul, probably the best thing for me.
I was registering for classes and I met my husband Dean. I was dating somebody else. We just became good friends, it was a two year graduate program, and we just became good friends. Then the second year he asked if I would move in, just as friends. I did and I think there were only two women out of the program of eighty people. This was before women got into college and did things.
AS: What year is this? Do you remember? 
AP: That was in 1975. I graduated in ’77. We got married a week after; my mom planned the whole wedding. We had nothing to do with it. We all said we’d go where the first job was. That was when affirmative action was really big. Being a white female, I didn’t have any problem getting a job. I wanted to go back to Minnesota because I loved it. Dean was from Valparaiso, Indiana. We both moved here. Dean had a terrible time finding a job, being a white male. He eventually did, and I think we were married four years before we had Spencer. I had a midwife and it was great. I’ll never go through childbirth again though without having drugs. [laughs] Spencer was born, and I worked for the City of Minnetonka. Dean worked for the City of Rosemount. We lived in South Minneapolis. We decided we should probably move close to one of our jobs. We found our house out in Minnetonka. 
AS: That’s this house?
AP: No, it’s another house close by. We found a wonderful daycare, it was a family daycare. It was a little hobby farm and all the kids got to bottle feed the little lambs. It was wonderful. Spencer, he had a wonderful childhood. We held him back, he was a summer baby. We put him through when he five, should he go to kindergarten or not? They recommended that he did, which was a mistake. He didn’t do well socially his first year of kindergarten. At the family daycare the family daycare mom, we became very close friends, our families; had a son who was about a year older than Spencer. Spencer was terribly bullied at that daycare. We ended up taking him out and switched him over to a different school so he wouldn’t have the stigma of being with the same kids for a repeated grade. Spencer always kind of resented us for that. Even though in later years he’ll admit how terrible the bullying was. I never knew about it and Spencer would never say anything about it. 
He had a wonderful elementary school. Although he wasn’t the best student, he was always very smart. Red hair shenanigans, always played sports. He loved T-ball and baseball. He was in Little League. He and Dean were in the Y Guide program. He always had a problem; he would never want to stay over at other people’s homes for the night with other kids. One time he spent the night with a good friend. He ended up walking home because he didn’t want to be apart from us. He was always very close to us. Both of our jobs, being in the public employment, you had a lot of night meetings. You had to hold meetings when people were done with their jobs during the day. I was gone a lot, Dean was gone a lot. In our parenting we would always make sure we’d always schedule our meetings so the other person could go and be there. We were gone and I always felt so guilty for that. 
I love my job. I had a boss who was absolutely wonderful. He would push me so much to do as well as I could. That kind of overcame some of the guilt of mothering. Growing up out in the suburbs you didn’t have a big network of working moms back then, like you do now. My network of working moms were people in the daycare, either work or in daycare. It still remains strong today. We still get together for daycare mom group meetings. I know your transcriber can’t see but I want to show you pictures. It’s just in the other room here. Shelley and her cousins and my sisters put these boards together for the funeral. This was his childhood. There’re pictures of him as a baby with his cousins. I made all his Halloween costumes, wrestling, swimming.
AS: Oh, look at that red hair.
AP: He was a very sensitive, shy boy. He just loved doing things. I’m going to cry. I’m going to get the Kleenex box. That’s okay. This is very good for me to talk about this. This was up until probably junior high. Slip n’ slide, baseball. How could this kid become addicted to heroin? You look at these pictures. I kept thinking, “Is it because I worked so much?” 
Then back when he, I think he was entering seventh grade, the city manager left to become director of the League of Cities for Minnesota. A new city manager was hired where I worked. He just didn’t have the values that the previous manager had. I just thought, “I’m not willing to work this hard for somebody that doesn’t have the same values that I do.” I thought, “Well I’ll take some time off. I’ll be able to spend time with Spence.” I was really worried about him.
AS: How old was he at this point?
AP: He was twelve, thirteen. Getting to the point where he could probably come home from school on his own.
AS: And get in some trouble?
AP: I was so worried about that. I took time off and Shelley, his sister, and I drove him up to Camp Menogyn. He and another friend went there and Shelly and I were going to camp and drive around Lake Superior. We ended up having car trouble and never made it. I did okay.
AS: At home?
AP: At home. I was sort of rattling around the house. I thought, “I just am not being stimulated.” I was getting crabby. I went back to work; I did contract work then went back to work full-time. Then he started middle school. 
AS: Spencer was born in 1981.
AP: In middle school through high school pictures—it was called junior high back then—it was seventh, eighth, and ninth grade. In eighth grade he got caught in school. He had put some booze in a water bottle and he got caught, he and another friend. That was really his first foray that we knew, of him using substances. Dean and I always drank in front of him. We didn’t drink a lot. 
AS: It was in your house.
AP: Then we found a bottle of vodka that had been refilled with water. Then at fifteen or sixteen we caught him with his good friend John, his parents are the ones coming from Montana today. I think he’s in one of these pictures. 
AS: Is this Dean?
AP: That’s Dean and Spence. They look so much alike. Every summer we’d go up to Ely to a camp called Camp Van Vac. It was just kind of stone cabins. It did have electricity, cold running water, central bathrooms. We just loved it. 
I think he started smoking pot when he was fifteen. He got caught by the police, he and two other guys were parked in a car and the police came up to them, opened the car doors and smoke just billowed out. Pot. The police, bless their hearts, kept them in the jail cell longer than they had to and then released them. 
AS: To try to make an impression. Was this here in Minnetonka?
AP: I think it was the Orono or Long Lake police. They notify the schools right away. Spencer was on the baseball team. He got kicked off the baseball team, which is what you do for somebody in trouble. It just irritated me. Then he had to go to chemical dependency…
AS: So backtrack. Tell me what you mean about being kicked off?
AP: Being kicked off of the baseball team, it always impressed me that here kids in trouble could not participate in healthy activities.
AS: They see it as a punishment. It’s a privilege to be able to play on the team.
AP: I don’t know if that view is still held today or not. I understand that he has to be accountable, but to punish him by taking him out? Then he went to a chemical dependency class that the high school ran. It was very good. It was run by a wonderful counselor. I think he had to do that for six months. I noticed from the time he was fifteen, I think probably here, we went out to Montana to visit our friends. I don’t think he smiled that whole year he was fifteen. We’d tell jokes, take him to counseling, took him to a therapist who thought he had ADD. He was on Ritalin. That’s another thing I feel terribly guilty about. I think that was either eighth or ninth grade that started. High school was relatively benign. He had good buds; he did a lot of activities that we thought were healthy. He told us later that he was smoking pot the whole time he was in high school. 
Then he went to college. He didn’t know where he wanted to go. I, of course, filled out his applications. He got accepted at the U [University of Minnesota] and went there. He was very, very homesick. He lived down there. He would come home a lot and then the second year he asked if he could live on…I can just picture it, it’s right off here, the tall building, it was brand new when he moved in, student housing. He moved in with three other high school friends that were doing fairly well, but all they did was party. 
AS: So he moved off campus?
AP: It was off campus. What was the name of that? We tried and tried to keep him back in. We talked to the counselors. He’d go in. He was put on probation. We even had his pediatrician write him a note about his ADD. We were very into enabling, into doing everything we could to keep him in college. He, looking backwards, he was probably one who should have taken a year or two off before going to college to figure things out. We didn’t want him to; we thought college is the way to go. 
AS: Can you back up for a second and talk about his sister?
AP: Shelley was born in 1984.
AS: So they’re three years apart.
AP: She was always a delightful, happy child until ninth grade. Then she sunk into a horrible depression. A depression so bad she would drag her mattress into our room and sleep in our room with us. She could not get out of bed. She said, “It felt like it was enveloping me and taking me down.” She was so sad and so she went to heavy duty counseling. They put her on antidepressant meds. Every one you can think of. 
AS: To just find something that worked?
AP: Until we found something that worked. She gained a horrible amount of weight. She survived; she did very well in school. She wanted to go away to school. She wanted to go to DePauw University outside of Indianapolis which was smaller than her high school. She just fell in love with it. We wanted her to go to St. Olaf because it was close. We were just so worried about her depression. She did well. We ended up saying, “Okay, you can go to DePauw.” 
She did well there the first year, but then she started cutting herself. I went down there. She ended up in the hospital. Let me back up. After cutting herself we get a call that she was in the emergency room. She had taken a bottle and a half of Tylenol, which is significant—liver issues. She was in the ICU. They had washed her stomach out with charcoal. They thought it was a suicide attempt. It may have been. She said, “I can’t say for sure if it was a suicide attempt. There was a voice telling me to just keep taking these pills and that’s what I did.” That was very traumatic on us. 
Spencer will always say, “You spent more time on her, trying to help her with her depression than you did me with trying to overcome addiction,” which wasn’t at all true. That’s his perception of it. He watched a lot of it because he was with us when that was happening. Shelley got better. She ended up graduating from DePauw. She had to go to summer school. She was upset because she couldn’t walk with her class—that was a big deal for small schools. She came back here and she decided she wanted to go back to school. She had a degree in anthropology, which is something you could really use in finding a job. That was sarcastic. She was really interested in theater. She went back to the U and got a degree in theater. 
AS: There’s a dog snoring in the background. [laughs] She has a degree in anthropology.
AP: Anthropology from DePauw and then the U for theater. Then she discovered that there weren’t a lot of jobs in theater. She went back to Hamline [University] and she’s finished up all her coursework for her master’s in theater education. She’s got her teaching degree. This last half year she taught at the middle school in North Minneapolis. I can’t think of the name of it right now. Now she is has a very serious boyfriend, Jeff. 
Her hair is green. I never know what color her hair is going to be. I had a horrible time; she has tattoos all over the place. Here she is. You think my kid Spencer has always been very conservative and worried what people thought of him. She’s out there. She’s always very responsible about drinking and using drugs and everything, very responsible. He’s off the deep end. One thing at least in dealing with addiction, it’s taught me to be very tolerant of Shelley, very approving of what her choices are. Not approving, accepting what her choices are in life. So Spencer’s addiction, while he was in college he had a very bad case of mono. This is probably caused by all the partying.
AS: The mono?
AP: Yes. His doctor, probably being well meaning at the time, he had a horrible sore throat, prescribed him tons of Percocet.
AS: For a sore throat?
AP: Because it was so bad.
AS: I’ve never heard that for sore throat. Wow.
AP: It was at the time he had his first girlfriend. He never dated at all in high school. He was too shy and immature. It was probably his first or second year. He met this girl Cassie who was just absolutely wild. She had no place to go so she wondered if she could stay at our house. I said, “No, no, no.” And then, “Yes.” Her parents wouldn’t allow her back in their home. 
AS: He was in high school or college?
AP: College, this was after he had dropped out. I said, “She can stay in a separate bedroom. I want no interaction between you two sexually, in my house. She has to actively look for a place to live.” She was an alcoholic and we didn’t know it. They would drink and drink. I ended up taking her down to HCMC emergency room, sitting with her when she had these horrible cases of anxiety. 
Her parents lived over in Hopkins. Her mom had nothing to do with her. Her dad would come and just be disgusted and walk away. So me, the enabler, would sit with her. I just felt so bad for her. Then those two ended up, Spencer and Cassie, moving to an apartment down near the U. She ended up going off the deep end in an alcoholic craze. The police found her banging on the doors of Ridgedale at eight o’clock on a Saturday morning.
AS: Of the shopping mall?
AP: Of the shopping mall. Probably two weeks previous to that we were gone, Spencer and Cassie were at our house and she started attacking him. He called the police. She got charged with domestic abuse. After the shopping center thing, Spencer was probably twenty one; we had no business saying this to him. We said, “That’s it. We will not tolerate her being around you.” That was the end of Cassie and Spencer together.
He was clearly abusing alcohol, looking backwards, with her. I’m assuming it probably ended up being pot. Then he told me, a couple years ago, how they would get renewals of the Percocet from the doctor’s prescriptions and take as many as they could. Probably when he was twenty five or twenty six, he had his first bout with appendicitis. He ended up in the hospital. It was so inflamed they couldn’t operate. For pain control they give him Percocet and oxycodone. Sometime between his mono and his appendicitis I figure he probably got addicted to pain meds. 
Then he met Jamie and they probably dated for two years. Then he moved in with her at the U. She was a nursing student at the U. She got pregnant in her junior year. Right before—let me backup. I’m trying to think if Aidan was born before or after his second appendicitis attack. I think it must have been right after Aidan was born, more Percocet, more oxycodone. Jamie called us right after Christmas.
AS: So Ann you’re looking on your laptop?
AP: Which is Spencer’s drug history.
AS: You kept a history of this written down.
AP: He entered The Retreat. Jamie came to us saying, “Something’s wrong with Spencer. He’s acting weird.” She thought he was addicted to pot, which he probably was. We called The Retreat. We did an intervention, just ourselves with him and Jamie and said, “You’ve got to enter treatment. This is unacceptable.”
AS: At this point Aidan is born?
AP: Aidan is born. He was born in September 2008. This was in February 2009. He told us that he was only on pot. When I talked to The Retreat, to Mike Kennedy, did you ever know him? He was a nurse anesthetist. He was Shelley’s nurse anesthetist to the doctor when she was born. Shelley’s doctor knew him really well. He became addicted to fentanyl and pain pills, which was very convenient being a nurse anesthetist. He would just open a vein in his leg when he was treating a patient and drain the medication into him. Anyways, he ended up being Spencer’s counselor. He told us, “Make sure it’s only pot. If there’s any pain pills in him he’ll have to go to detox.” We had no idea about the Percocet, we were very naïve. 
After three days when he was at The Retreat he started going into withdrawal. They sent him to the Mission to go into detox. He came back and he told us he had taken a couple Suboxone and that’s what he had to detox from. We had no clue what that meant. He did the full thirty days there. They really wanted him to go live in a sober house. He refused to because he didn’t want to be apart from Jamie and Aidan. He did well. He did well for probably six to eight months. Then Jamie could tell that he was withdrawing again and something was wrong. Right before Christmas I remember her calling us to come over to their house because she couldn’t wake him up. We couldn’t wake him up either. We had no idea. He was probably overdosing. Eventually he came to. Then we brought him to Fairview Chemical Dependency for an evaluation. Of course he wouldn’t let us in. He told us, he just thought he should go to outpatient treatment. They recommended Nystrom. 
At the same time Jamie had graduated the previous spring. That’s when the nurse’s freeze came on. There were no nursing jobs to be had whatsoever except in a nursing home. She wanted to be a hospital nurse. That was her dream. She applied out of state. The only two hospitals that were hiring then were ones connected with Native American communities because they got grant money. One was in Ellisville, Montana the other was in Casper, Wyoming. She interviewed both; got both jobs but she preferred the Ellisville, Montana job. This was in December, January. Spencer insisted that he move out there with her even though he obviously had an addiction going. He moved out there with her. He detoxed on his own, going out there. Then he did pretty well for a year. He got a job as a landscaper. Then he probably started heroin, I want to say out in Montana. That was 2011. The FDA changed the formula for…
AS: Oxycodone.
AP: Oxycodone and Percocet. 
AS: You couldn’t crush it.
AP: I bet he became a heroin addict, putting things together, back then. He kept asking us for money. Jamie kept saying, this is July 2011, he wasn’t paying rent. He kept coming up with these weird reasons for needing money from us. Then he started pawning things probably in August of 2011. Then his addiction really got bad. This was all out in Montana. Jamie called us in October saying she found a pop can with some resin in it that wasn’t pot. 
AS: She was still thinking it was pot at this point?
AP: Yes. I think she just got worn out, that she didn’t care what he was doing. She needed somebody to watch Aidan. Then we, in response to that, kept saying, “You’ve got to handle this yourself and do things.” We had no clue.
AS: To her?
AP: To her. Or, “Kick him out.” I said, “We’ll come and get Aidan. He can’t be in this type of environment.” I ended up in the end of October going out there and getting Aidan and brought him back to Minnesota. 
AS: Just your grandson, just him?
AP: Just him. Spencer said he was going to stay there. He stayed out there until Thanksgiving. We sent him money. His car had died. He probably sold it for drugs. His car had died by then. We sent him money to take the train. Jamie had kicked him out of the house. Then on Thanksgiving Day he said he had to run to an AA meeting. 
AS: He was here?
AP: He was here. He started using. He started pawning from us. 
AS: He said he had to go to an AA meeting but he wasn’t going to an AA meeting?
AP: No, he was using. He pawned all through December 2011. At the same time Dean’s mom was dying.
AS: When you say pawn, he was just taking things from the house?
AP: Half the stuff we didn’t even know was gone. That was so foreign. We finally figured out he was pawning from us. Dean looked for his drill and he couldn’t find it. “I don’t know what happened to it.” I’m trying to remember.
AS: Your mom was dying?
AP: Dean’s mom was dying. Dean had to go to Santa Fe to be with her. While he was gone Spencer took all this other stuff. He confessed to me that he was pawning. I threw him out of the house. He spent the night at a friend of his. Then he came back. I let him back in. He ended up going through withdrawal. Then we started talking about treatment options with him. This is right before Christmas. 
He had come home from Montana, $40,000 in hospital bills from doctor shopping. He would go saying he had a stomach ache caused by the appendicitis removal. I think there were two hospitals and several clinics there. He had no insurance here. When you become a resident of another state and then come back to Minnesota you have to wait at least three months before you can get medical insurance. He was too old to be on ours. We said, “You can go to the Salvation Army.” Dean took him down. This was right before Christmas. 
AS: He’d go to the Salvation Army for what?
AP: Treatment, Adult Rehabilitation Center near Harbor Lights. Dean had done some volunteer work with it before. He took him down there and started registering him. He just freaked out, he said, “This isn’t my type of environment.” We said, “You’ve got to go somewhere.” He said, “What about The Retreat?” We didn’t have the money, so we borrowed money from my mother. They took him back. Right after Christmas he went there. He lasted a week before he started using. He got kicked out. Then he entered, when he got kicked out of there, that’s when he decided to enter the Salvation Army rehab. He wasn’t too good for that. He used with another resident. That kid was four days from graduating from The Retreat and going into a sober house. So he detoxed at home between The Retreat and the Salvation Army. 
AS: That’s how he got kicked out of the retreat? 
AP: Yes, he called his dealer and he came right up there.
AS: By this point he’s using heroin?
AP: He’s using heroin.
AS: Do you guys know this at this point, that he’s using heroin?
AP: At this point we know it was heroin. We were totally shocked.
AS: What did heroin mean to you and Dean at the time?
AP: Heroin meant to me you lived under a bridge and you were from a bad family. You were brought up in a dysfunctional family, not to say that ours wasn’t. Not a mom and a dad living together, graduating from high school and going to college. We were in shock. It took me two years to tell people that he was a heroin addict, my friends. It took me three years to go to Al-Anon. I started with Al-Anon. Then I worked back over to Nar-Anon. How many times has he relapsed? I can’t tell you. He went to Salvation Army. He used. Everybody there uses. Then he was in and out of treatment. Do you want to know the details?
AS: Just how many times maybe.
AP: He was in Teen Challenge twice, Salvation Army; he went to Fairview five or six times. He went to Unity Hospital and then up to Cambridge to Dellwood. Did Maddie ever go there?
AS: Close, but no.
AP: He went to someplace in St. Cloud. He ended up living at Serenity Village for a while. Fairview was the most focused. Focus 12 was in St. Cloud. He was at Cornerstone in St. Paul sober living. I think he was in treatment fifteen times.
DP: Hi.
AS: Hi. Let me pause this.
DP: Ann was so frustrated at the end and frustrated with me because I didn’t follow the book. Now that he’s gone, her problem really is should she have been following the book.
AS: In what way? What do you mean?
DP: No enabling, no help, you’ve got to draw the line, we’re hurting him, you’re not helping him.
AS: You’re hurting him by helping him.
DP: He needs to help himself. She’s reevaluating whether or not that really…
AS: That’s what I’m coming up against. That’s what I’m discovering.
DP: Then you say, “Where’s that line that allows you to fudge on this but not on that?” You’ve got to do it case by case.
AS: You’ve just got to live with the consequences of whatever happens. 
[Break in Recording]
AS: You were talking about all these treatments. Fifteen times. How were you feeling as a mom?
AP: I was so angry and I kept thinking, “Why isn’t this working? What are we doing wrong?” He was on Suboxone. He was probably on Suboxone two years. I’d always heard how controversial it was. I especially heard at Teen Challenge, “That wasn’t acceptable. If you were really serious about it you should be able to do it without MAT.” 
AS: Medication assisted treatment. 
AP: It’s always that bullshit. 
AS: It’s so macho and has this kind of moral…
AP: Stigma to it. I just always felt so inadequate. I think that goes back to having an alcoholic dad and needing to control things and make sure people could survive alright when something bad is happening. I really attribute it to the growth in the Nar-Anon program for helping me discover who me is a lot. Where else did I want to go with this? I felt so much judgement from my oldest sister who said, “This whole family needs to do tough love. That would solve everything if we just did tough love.” My oldest sister is a social worker and very well thought of. How can you say something like that in the profession you’re in? Maybe you’d like to come and say that to my Nar-Anon group and see how that goes over? 
AS: You’re being judged for helping too much because he keeps going to treatment and relapsing and treatment and relapsing and it’s not working?
AP: It’s not working and yet we have a relationship, a strong relationship.
AS: You and Spencer? 
AP: And his dad. 
AS: You were in some ways working on it together. Can you unpack that a little bit for me? What you mean when you talk about enabling—a re you saying that at that point you felt you were doing too much, or are you saying that other people were telling you you were doing too much for him?
AP: Other people were telling me I was doing too much for him. To some degree—this is the odd thing, especially since he’s gone now, doing things to stay close to your child, to have a relationship is so important to me. That’s what you do as family. Because he has a disease like this you’re not supposed to do these things? I really detached from him, especially the last year before he died. I feel guilty about that. I know that’s what you’re supposed to do to protect yourself, but I feel very guilty for that. I never went and saw him the last time he was in treatment. Dean did most of that. Even Jamie and Aidan went and saw him. There’s so much guilt with that. 
I’d get so angry at him. I could not control my anger when some facets of addiction would come out. That’s what I’m really trying to work through now, is the teaching some of these things. I don’t know if detachment is necessarily part of the twelve steps. I think it’s grown out of the twelve steps. Part of the teachings that they tell you in different family programs, or different books to help families of addicts is you need to detach. I don’t think that’s right. I know you have to, to some degree, to protect yourself. I look back, should we have turned him into the police even?
AS: At what point?
AP: When he was stealing from us. We were being financially; I can’t tell you how much stuff we paid for out of pawning. We just couldn’t do it anymore.
AS: To get your things back? Because you didn’t want to call the police?
AP: Right. Then you feel, “Well, Shelley’s so independent. She was brought up to be very independent. Why isn’t Spencer that way, too?” They’re just two different kids, you know that intellectually. One of the things you feel guilty about, too, is never really realizing that recovery was not working. 
AS: You feel guilty that you didn’t realize?
AP: What do you do in those situations? Do you ship them off to Vancouver where they have a hospital where they allow addicts to continue to use but do it in a safe way? I don’t want to blame anybody, but there is no medical answer for it. Suboxone wasn’t working for him.
AS: Did he ever try methadone?
AP: Not legitimately, let me put it that way. No, I don’t think he ever did. 
AS: He was never monitored that way where you have to go in everyday and be drug tested?
AP: We talked about it a lot. He was seeing an addiction psychiatrist for the last two or three years. I said, “Why didn’t Dr. Buchanan ever recommend methadone?” Then he saw Dr. Amer previously to that. He said, they just said he wasn’t a good candidate. They thought the Suboxone would be appropriate.
AS: Do you think that’s a class designation, or racial and class designation?
AP: I don’t know.
AS: I feel like it could be.
AP: Your daughter and Sean are very successful at it. Although I know Kim says it makes Sean sick a lot. Maddie’s never been sick. There was another couple in our St. Paul, well Tom and Jackie whose daughter was very successful on it. It might be. 
AS: I feel like it’s a class and race-based decision that maybe people don’t realize their bias for it, or they think methadone is for the underclass.
AP: The inner city. That’s the zoning laws. Right in federal law they say they can’t go into the suburbs.
AS: Methadone clinics?
AP: Yes. I should go back and look at the law because it came up in our urban planning stuff. They have to be within so many miles or feet of a hospital. There’s that methadone clinic up in Brooklyn Park, Valhalla, and Woodbury. Maybe that’s close enough to that Woodbury Hospital. There were some restrictions so they would never locate out in the suburbs. I see that a lot as being with the AIDS epidemic because there was so much prejudice, this was probably in the early ‘80s, about locating them in the suburbs.
AS: AIDS hospices.
AP: It was a big deal about group homes and where they should be located.
AS: There’s a geography of addiction and recovery. 
AP: Absolutely! I’m surprised nobody has done any, maybe somebody has, but I haven’t seen anything about it. That would be a very interesting study to do. The only reason sober homes are out here now is because if they’re six or less they’re permitted as a right. It’s no different than a single family home. They can’t discriminate. There’s quite a few out here now. Where were we? 
AS: Let’s go back to where you were with your list of places and where the last few…
AP: The last treatment program that he was in was a Fairview Lodging Plus. We had tried to get him in and this was a month before he died. 
[Interruption due to the vacuum cleaner]
AP: We tried to get him into St. Joe’s right before Christmas. His MA insurance would only permit seven days of treatment.
AS: Seven days? Why? Do you think because he’d been in so many times, or what do you think?
AP: No, it’s MA Medica. I wrote it down here.
AS: So January…
AP: He said, “MA Medica would only pay four to seven days of treatment.” I said, “Do you have problems with other types of MA?” He was on MA UCare and then the state dropped UCare and went to, I can’t remember, there are two more. One is Hennepin County, one is not very good. It was only MA Medica that this counselor told me they had problem with. The other MAs they had no problems with thirty days of treatment. I think this is when the Obama Treatment, Chemical Dependency Treatment protocols were rolling out too. There’s probably some confusion between insurance and everything else. 
Then we had to go back to Fairview. He did well; he was excited to be there. It was the first time he started talking about what he wanted to do in the future. He got real excited about becoming a counselor in the recovery. He said, “I think I really want to do that.” He even called the U while he was at Fairview to see what it would take to get into that program.
AS: This is in the winter?
AP: This was in February of this year. Then at Fairview they were going to arrange for a sober house for him to go to. He arranged with River Ridge to go to Glenview Lodge which is here in Minnetonka. They kept him in Fairview another week because he was having problems finding a sober house. When he called River Ridge nobody would answer the phone the day he got out. So I got mad and called them. The person that ran the sober home finally called Spencer back. They talked and they mutually agreed that his sober home experience would be the same as what he’d just been through at Fairview. 
Then we had told them about New Heights sober home. It was run by the drummer that is in the church band. Spencer went and looked at it. He said, “This is the first place I really feel comfortable.” He had nothing but good things to say about that sober house. He really liked it. He died Sunday, April 3. He spent Thursday night; he and Jamie took the kids to a movie. 
AS: Which kids?
AP: Aidan and Aidan’s half-sister, Sadie. After Jamie threw Spencer out of the house in Montana she fell in love with this other guy and they got married like three months later. He ended up being a drug addict, too. By the time she found out she was already pregnant with her daughter Sadie, she’ll be three in August. She ended up divorcing this guy. Then she moved back to Minnesota. Here she is.
AS: So she’s here now?
AP: There’s a picture of her. 
AS: So go back to when he moves in to this sober house that he liked. How long was he there?
AP: He was there three weeks. He liked his roommates. He was going to IOP, intensive outpatient treatment, at New Way. He had been to New Way before. This was three years ago and they really changed. They’ve got new curriculum, new staff. It’s very good from what I hear from many sources. He really liked it. That was so odd about how he died. 
AS: Is he on any medicine at this point?
AP: He’s still on Suboxone. He had just had a meeting with his psychiatrist. He was over; he got his first pass for the weekend to spend time at our house with Aidan. You could see his personality again, everything coming through. Saturday night, the night before he died, he asked me to shave his neck. He had his shirt off. He had just taken a shower and he had gotten a haircut and he didn’t like what they did around the neck. I shaved it and I looked all over to see, nothing. He was just my boy again. I don’t know what happened. 
AS: Talk about what you know happened between Saturday night and Sunday. Talk about the timeline.
AP: Saturday night he had dinner with us. He had gone to New Way on Saturday for a makeup session. He had met this new girlfriend, Maria. I never met her. He had spent the day with her Wednesday. He had hours to make up at New Way on Saturday. He spent Friday night with us, with Aidan. They had a ball. Left to go to New Way, he came back here for dinner. I heard his phone text messaging going off around nine o’clock. He said he had to get back to the sober house by ten, his pass was over. Then we thought he didn’t call on Sunday. He said he was going to call. We didn’t think anything about it. It was probably four in the afternoon. It was a really nice day that Sunday. Spencer was riding the bike with the neighborhood kids here.
AS: You mean Aidan?
AP: Aidan. The groundskeeper at church came driving up with his girlfriend, we know them fairly well. He’s a former coke addict. He’s a really good friend of Greg’s. He said, “Come in the house I have something terrible to tell you.” I thought he had gotten kicked out of the sober home. Dean and I were both there. He said, “Spencer overdosed and died.” I called my sister Susan to come over right away and Jane. They came over and Claire and then I called Jamie. Then we talked to the medical investigator. She said it was really odd when they found him because there was a needle next to his arm. He was face down in the bathroom. This is the first floor bathroom where everybody is coming and going. They had to jimmy the door open, it was locked. The syringe was half full. She said, “Usually you never find that. They’ve used the whole syringe.” She said, “We also found some vomit on his pillow upstairs. We’re going to do a full autopsy on him.” I had told them he was…
[Interruption due to vacuum cleaner]
AS: She was going to go ahead and do a full autopsy.
AP: She said, “We also found two packets of heroin in his wallet. We’re able to lift the DNA off of it. We’ve got a cell phone, too. Do you happen to know what his passcode is?”
AS: This is the medical examiner?
AP: Investigator. 
AS: Let’s back up. The owner of New Heights sober house comes to your house?
AP: No, his friend. 
AS: A friend of his who knew you from church.
AP: Greg had called Dean’s cell phone and couldn’t get ahold of us. Greg is the owner of the house. He didn’t know how to get a hold of us when we didn’t have our cell phones. That’s why he called his friend from our church. They were able to find our address. He came over and told us, he and his girlfriend. 
AS: Were you two alone? Was Aidan here?
AP: Aidan was here, he was out riding the bike. We were just goofing around with him. When they told us, some neighbor must have watched him; I have no idea who was taking care of him while this was going on. We called my sisters and then talked to the medical investigator. Then they wondered if we had the passcode to Spencer’s phone. Aidan had given it to me right before Christmas because we had suspected that he was using. We knew he was using.
AS: Aidan told you what the passcode was?
AP: Spencer’s phone had some of his games on it. Aidan gave us the passcode. They were able to get in his phone and go back and do the trace of telephone numbers, trying to find a person of interest. That’s those emails I showed you. That’s all we know right now. He lived with us the last two years. He probably was clean maybe six months. The way I figure it he probably started using again last summer. Benzos, heroin, pot, I don’t know what but he was using something other than heroin. We had to call the police twice to come and get him because he was acting so goofy. 
AS: Goofy or violent?
AP: He was waving around and we wanted to take him to the hospital. He wouldn’t go with us to the emergency room. He was just waving all over the place. He could barely stand, could barely talk. The first time the police took him to Fairview detox. They used a seventy-two hour hold. “No problem at all based on our interview with him.” At one thirty that morning we get a call from some kid down at the U who’s found him walking along the light-rail tracks. So Fairview released him. He had obviously had his stomach pumped. I don’t know what he took. When I get his medical records, I haven’t done that yet. Christmas Eve it was just disgusting. Right before church…
AS: This past Christmas Eve?
AP: He had previously used. He just went down like a pancake in the pew. You know how packed it usually is. We had the whole family over here, cousins, nieces, nephews. He had obviously used again and Jamie and the kids, everybody was here. He would refuse to go upstairs. We couldn’t bodily take him up, we weren’t strong enough. He just sat there. My whole family was exposed to him. I said, “This is just what addiction is. This is what they act like.” Dean and I said, “Let’s just forget about being bothered by it.” This is what the disease manifests itself as. At one point he was sitting next to my niece and said, “I don’t want to be this way at all. I’m so sorry. I just don’t want to be this way.” 
He always wanted to go into treatment. He never fought it. Probably two years ago, we had to throw him out. He lived on the streets for a couple months. Maybe not even that long. He got beat up. He finally called and said, “I’m ready to go to treatment.” As a mom I just know that he wasn’t going to recover. I had his funeral planned out in my head for at least the last year, maybe even the last two years, Amy. It was tearing Dean and I apart. I felt bad as a mother not being able to protect my marriage from that. Dean felt bad and I always would get upset with Dean because he was such an enabler. But is that so wrong with what happens? Then I have felt tremendous guilt because we don’t have to deal with the ramifications of heroin use anymore. I can’t tell you what that feels like to not have to have that constant worry, that constant pain all the time. We have the pain of not having him. 
AS: So you feel guilty that you’re relieved?
AP: Yes.
AS: But being relieved means that your son is no longer in your life. 
AP: I remember the first time going back to Nar-Anon. I was walking out the door after, I think it was Christy, but she said, “I felt so bad for you. Everybody went around the circle and here you don’t have your son anymore.” But what I was feeling was that I’m so glad I don’t have to go through what they’re going through anymore. I felt always so inadequate in dealing with it; I thought I worked enough of them at home. I know that some of these processes are—I was so totally confused with Rule 25, never having to deal with that. What you do, getting so many conflicting answers? I’d get so frustrated with the people I would talk to on the phone who would use acronyms for everything and think you knew. I was supposed to know what that meant and I didn’t. I was so frustrated in dealing with the insurance, trying to get ahold of the right person. So frustrated with dealing with counselors at different rehab facilities and knowing what they put in to try to help. What they give, the gifts they have. 
AS: But you were frustrated with them?
AP: Because I couldn’t get them to understand what he was going through. I guess it all comes down to that I know so little about addiction but I know so much about it. It’s so confusing to me. As a mom I would never want any mother to go through this, even living through it with your child still being alive. In fact, I think it’s almost worse, unless they’re in successful recovery.
AS: Even then it’s always on your back.
AP: It’s always in the back of your mind. You’re never going to get rid of that feeling. I want to do something and I get angry. It’s the anger, I felt so numb and angry these last three months since he’s died. I’m angry because I can’t remember the good parts of it. I’m so angry about the addiction parts of him. I felt so numb. I said, “How could this have happened?” Look at those pictures. How could that be? That a disease could be that insidious. I often felt like, especially the last six months when he went off the deep end with using again, he’s dead but his body is still working. Like a zombie. 
AS: At what point would you say you started to detach from him? Was it like the last six months, back in the fall?
AP: Yes. Even before then. It was at least in August because I remember I was seeing a therapist at Hazleton. We had gone through all these different techniques. She said, “I just don’t see that you need to see me anymore.” Dean and I went back and I knew I had to break my ties with her, being an individual therapist, when Dean and I went to her. Dean and Spence and I went to therapy in the fall and, this is off the tape, just this nincompoop. 
AS: We’ve had plenty of people talk about their inadequate professional support.
AP: Spencer there, “Don’t you realize he’s using?” We’re sitting in a family therapy session.
AS: At a renowned institution for recovery.
AP: “Can’t you see the signs? Can’t you pull him out of this?” Then Dean and I started seeing her.
AS: Not the same person? Or the same person?
AP: The same person I saw. Not the one for the three of us. The good one. I just love her. She was able to get through with Dean about how this enabling was not helping. Then looking back, I’ve had many conversations with the director of the family program at The Retreat now about this issue between when you’ve lost somebody, enabling, and detachment. They still don’t believe in MAT over at The Retreat.
AS: I think we’re on the brink of change, at least some people I’ve talked to say we’re on the brink of change with it. You want to keep the addict alive as long as you can in hopes that they will recover. The bottom with opioids is death. There’s no coming up from that. Can you go back a little bit about feeling; I wonder if last fall when you were so frustrated and angry with him, do you think that you just kind of maxed out? That you just became so worn down and exhausted by the addiction that you had to detach to just maintain your sanity?
AP: Yes.
AS: I don’t want to put words in your mouth. Before you jump ahead to enabling and the kind of critique of that, what was that like for you as a mother to get to that point? It’s years of addiction, it’s fifteen treatments.
AP: What got me to that point? I really started buying into the Twelve-Step program. I really felt really tied in to, there’s nothing I can do to change this. I’m just going to take the fourth step out of here. I truly believe that in order for me to get healthy and to survive this I needed to rely on my higher power. I started becoming very spiritual again and did a lot of reading on spiritualness; I read a lot of Karen Hesse’s stuff. Really reading about not being able to deal with another person’s addiction. Her book, hearing her speak, just attending and doing more step work myself and thinking about it and doing more readings. I just knew I had to rely, for me, on God, my higher power. 
I almost had an epiphany, I remember one day I woke up in the morning and I just felt, I knew it was black and white: there’s nothing I can do about this anymore. There’s absolutely nothing I can do. It took me a long, long time to get there. Mothering doesn’t work, nothing, there’s nothing I can do that’s stronger than heroin and what it does to my son. The only thing stronger than me is God. I thought if I can survive his death. I knew that’s what it was going to be, I’m just going to have to give in to God. I think that’s when I felt detached. Then I couldn’t do anything. I have to let God do his will with Spencer.
AS: Was there a little bit of peace in that?
AP: Yes, there was a lot of peace in that. I hear messages coming from the outside. That’s where you should feel guilty as a mom. You couldn’t be part of that peace. I’m not explaining this very well. I had no part in it anymore. It was between Spencer and his higher power, or my God. I knew there was nothing I could do. That’s hard for a mom to say that.
AS: It’s the opposite of how we’re trained and raised and feel.
AP: I was kind of a controlling person. Hopefully I’m not that much anymore. That’s kind of the way I was brought up to be, I had to be controlling. I have no regrets about doing everything I was able to do. I have no regrets that way at all. I did too much or a lot. I know there was nothing more I could do. I have great peace with that. I have trouble remembering him before without drugs. That’s what I have to work on in this next time, getting over the numbness and the anger of that.
AS: Do the pictures of him as a child help?
AP: This is the first time since the funeral that I’ve brought them out. 
AS: Thank you for sharing them.
AP: Shelley said, “Mom, you’ve really got to look at these to make sure they’re okay before we put them out.” The last seven years I had to look at those pictures, some obviously he was using. I wanted to make sure there weren’t any obviously using pictures there. I had recorded on my phone with him right before Christmas, of him flopped over on the couch, passed out from using, his head in his cereal bowl.
AS: You had taken pictures of that?
AP: It helped for me to look at that. That might perpetuate the anger. I don’t know how I feel about that right now. I’m trying to think of what else. 
AS: I wanted to ask you something and now I just completely forgot. 
AP: I joined these other; they’re primarily mom sites, closed Facebook pages for parents or loved ones of addicts that are dead. One is Grass, which is a national organization that doesn’t have a chapter in Minnesota. It’s a Twelve-Step program for moms or anybody who’s lost a loved one. It’s primarily mothers. It’s just so disgusting to look at, but it’s a very healthy site for people to vent.
AS: Why is it disgusting? Because so many people have lost their children?
AP: Yes, so many women or moms can’t get over it. I should show you some of the posts from it. You probably can’t get on it. Then there’s another one with Compassionate Friends, it’s the same way. I find there’s little support for people like me in the Twin Cities. There’s Gloria’s group, but Dean can’t stand her. 
AS: I know what I was going to ask you. You and Dean, what I heard is that you went to the sober house after Spencer died. Can you talk about why you did that? What happened, just for this record? What made you do that, what did you say and how was it received?
AP: I still don’t even know what time Spencer died at. It says so on the death certificate, it says two in the afternoon, but he probably died before that. When Greg couldn’t get ahold of us, after we talked to the medical investigator we talked to Greg. Greg told us that he was not in the house when Spencer died. He was coming back from his church. He didn’t get there until one. All the residents there were traumatized. There were about twenty vehicles and it was cornered off. The police investigators had interviewed about eight of them. He said, “I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve got all these traumatized people.” I said, “We can come over and talk to them.” Greg said, “Would you?” 
Dean and Shelley and I went over there Monday night, the day after Spencer died, which is when they always have their group meetings. It was packed. We told them what we had been through and told them how we felt and told them how happy Spencer was at the sober house. How thankful he was that he was there. We told them not to give up hope, there’s so much hope in recovery. Everybody was crying. This beautiful girl, she was absolutely gorgeous, was just sobbing. Saying, “I feel so bad for what I put my parents through.” So many of them said that. A lot of these people that live in the sober home parents have disowned them because of the addiction and the collateral damage with addiction. It was very soothing for Dean and I to hear the outreach that they gave. Several of them came up to us afterwards and told us how much they liked Spencer, how kind he was and what a compassionate person he was, which was really helpful to me. That’s how we brought him up to be. Then I had to have the person that found him show me everything and show me how he was laying when he was found. I had to have his roommate show me his room. I laid down in his bed to see what he would see when he was alive. All this is helpful.
AS: Do you want to go inside so we can get Kleenex?
AP: Oh yes. We’ve been back a couple times now. I met a woman there, it was probably two or three weeks ago, that came up to me and said she went in to Fairview the same time that Spencer did. They developed a friend relationship. She just wanted me to know what impact Spencer had on her. She said, “I just remember Jamie and Aidan had just come back from his Boy Scout meeting. He was in his little Boy Scout outfit running around Fairview Recovery Plus floor.” Just hearing those things, I only can think of, sometimes I don’t want to hear stories from his friends from after high school because he stole from them or did something. All I’ve heard is bad the last seven years just to hear something good is just so nice. 
AS: What did you do at his funeral? You talked about how it took you two or three years to tell people that your son was an addict. I think something changed in you by the time of his funeral.
AP: Yes. We wanted J. R., our pastor, to be very open about addiction. You were gone.
AS: I was out of town.
AP: I can give you a CD of it if you want.
AS: Yes.
AP: It’s up to you. It was a very kind of addiction based sermon. We just said we didn’t want to sugar coat anything about his life, but we want to celebrate his life. He had very good parts of his life. He had a wonderful life until addiction took over. It was kind of two parts. We had his good friend John talk. John talked a lot about the younger days and growing up and knowing what struggles Spencer went through. Then Greg the sober home guy, he spoke too about addiction. There were a lot of people from his sober home in attendance. I think four pews were filled with our people.
AS: From Nar-Anon?
AP: Yes. Several of his high school friends attended and said, “We just knew what a good guy Spencer was before drugs took over. That’s the memories we have of him.” I don’t know how many people; there were a lot of people there. At the end, J. R. just gave; we gave the hands on the back kind of thing and said the serenity prayers in closing. That was very powerful. J. R. gets so pissed off. 
AS: This is your pastor?
AP: Our pastor. This is the third heroin death since January.
AS: The third?
AP: Third or fourth. Our church always hosts the stuff with The Retreat about recovery stuff. 
AS: What church is it that you go to?
AP: It’s Wayzata Community, it’s a UCC church. The only reason we started going there is because of Spencer’s addiction. A friend of mine goes, says, “You should come to the service with me. It’s so calm and soothing.” Then I met the building and grounds guy there, who’s a former addict. 
AS: He ends up being friends with the sober house director.
AP: He knew Spencer because when Spencer worked landscaping that church was one of the places they had accounts. It’s connecting the dots. It was a very open; we didn’t want to cover up anything about addiction. Dean and I and Shelley have grown so much being open about it. We didn’t want Spencer’s death to be anything different from cancer or diabetes or anything else or have any stigma attached to it. There’s no reason not to talk about addiction as part of a celebration of a life event. 
AS: Aidan is how old?
AP: Seven.
AS: How is he doing? What does he know about the cause of his father’s death?
AP: We’ve tried to stay age appropriate with him. We’ve always told him since he was about three that his dad had a brain disease. When he died we told him that he died in his sleep. I mean he wasn’t asleep I guess technically. Aidan has been very quiet about his dad’s death. We’ve been, every occasion we’re with him, we tell Spencer stories, funny stories. He loves hearing that. I went to his end of the year first grade picnic and started talking to one of his best friend’s dads. He said, “This kid just told me that Aidan’s dad died this morning. I knew a kid in his class’s dad died. I didn’t know it was Aidan’s died.” I said, “What did he tell you he died of?” “Brain disease.” It was that morning that this little kid told his father. I said, “Well, that’s what we told him, but it was a heroin overdose.” The little kid’s dad is a special ed teacher at Minnetonka High School and deals a lot with kids who have had terrible anxiety either through relative’s addiction, their parents, or them dealing with it themselves. He totally got it. It was good having that conversation with him. 
We told his Boy Scout leaders the true cause. I don’t know how to. Jamie’s got the name of all these child psychiatrists, but she doesn’t feel the need to call them yet. That’s probably okay. His teacher at school, he’s had a male first grade teacher that has been very good for him. He’s been wonderful. I don’t know what to think. Now I feel, I see Dean, we’re parenting his son. I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. We’re being more than grandparents. 
AS: How so? Is he staying with you?
AP: He stays with us like every three weekends because Jamie has to work those weekends. We try to help her out throughout daycare and financially we’re helping him. Although one of the best things we ever did was take out life insurance policies on the kids when they were babies. We’ve been paying them up every year. I would recommend that Maddie and Brandon take out an insurance policy. I think we paid twenty-four dollars a month for years. I thought we stopped paying it but we didn’t. Then now Aidan has Social Security. Spencer was never able to financially support Aidan, very rarely. We were always doing it. It’s good what he couldn’t provide in life he can provide in death now for his son. Part of the mothering or grandmothering is we have to take care of Aidan. We want to. 
AS: Why are you kind of critical of that? 
AP: It gets back to that damn enabling thing. Am I enabling Jamie? We’re helping her. I don’t know. I just want to get that word out of my vocabulary, that detachment right now. 
AS: I’m not a fan of them now. Not after my tenth interview with mothers, you being number ten today. I’m not seeing the benefit. 
AP: I’ve never heard anything or read anything about mothering when your child dies. Enabling and detachment aren’t a good thing.
AS: No, they don’t help us. 
AP: Have you heard other mothers say that?
AS: Yes, many. It seems to me there’s a continuum somehow, there’s like a measured kind of—I’m just thinking this out loud. When you get to a point mothering your addict child that you’ve done everything you feel you can possibly do then you have to save yourself and realize that your child has to figure this out on their own. That’s where that pop psychology idea of enabling and codependency comes in. As parents we are codependent. We’re dependent, our children are depending on us for their lives, and addiction just throws that whole thing into this strange… It’s like a hall of mirrors in a way for parents. 
In any other disease or disorder or mental illness, however you want to think about addiction, doing everything we can is completely and utterly acceptable and expected. For some reason when we get into Twelve-Step program and this whole codependency thing, I think a lot of it comes from Al-Anon and spouses of addicts—that whole movement. Doing the care work of your beloved addict, you become part of the problem instead of looking at addiction as the problem, lack of resources, lack of treatment, lack of money, lack of knowledge about addiction is the problem. It’s not the mothers and fathers wanting to help their children live to the other side of addiction. That’s where I’m really, really thinking hard about this because it’s not working. Yet, when I ask my daughter, she will say, “It had nothing to do with you, Mom. Thank you for not giving up on me, but you could not have stopped me.” That’s the in between space that we need to talk more about. 
AP: Going back to the comment about forcing or allowing them to make decisions on their own. I feel that the disease robbed Spencer of the development of his frontal lobe. So that he couldn’t reach that point. He did make a comment when he was living on the streets, when we threw him out, that that made him realize he needed treatment. That was the best thing for him when we threw him out. It didn’t change him to grow anymore and develop breaks in his brain or other things that the frontal lobe produces. I don’t know that much about the brain science just what I’ve been taught. He could never survive that. He could never develop those skills and make a turn around. 
AS: He needed to be in sustained recovery for a very long time for that to happen. Was he thirty-five?
AP: Thirty-four. Tomorrow he’ll be thirty-five.
AS: Tomorrow is Spencer’s birthday.
AP: Earth Day is what I’m calling it.
AS: That’s lovely, Ann.
AP: That’s when he came to earth. 
AS: Should we stop?
AP: Yes.
AS: Thank you.
AP: This has been so helpful to me. 
AS: Your courage and your willingness to talk to me so fresh in grief, I just want to say I was not going to ask you.
AP: Why?
AS: Well, I was going to ask you months ago when I decided I was going to do this. When he died I realized, “I’m not going to bother her.” Then you came back to Nar-Anon so quickly and I was getting to the end of my interviews and I thought, “If she’s at the meeting tonight I’m going to ask her.” As a document in this moment that freshness of the grief is so powerful. I’m so grateful to you for being willing to talk about it and be so honest. Starting the Nar-Anon that you did two years ago, our connection in the St. Paul group, all of that has been, you’ve just been a really incredible force for a lot of people to feel at home in this turmoil that we live in. 
AP: I need to keep coming back. Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit there anymore. I need to be there. I’d like to ask Barbara. Did you interview Barbara?
AS: No. The one who came to our group right before Spencer died, who lost her son?
AP: Lost her son three years ago. I haven’t talked to her about this issue and I wanted to explore that. 
AS: Which issue? About enabling?
AP: Enabling and detachment and everything. I guess I need to think about this some more. 
AS: She’s also three years out and you’re three months out.
AP: Anyways, I don’t know if I told you, The Retreat is finally having a grief support group. It’s starting August 20. I don’t even know where to post it. I was going to post it on our Facebook page. They’re for people like me. I’m really curious to see how they’re going to; it’s a Twelve-Step grief support, to see how that goes.
AS: Maybe just go and see if you like it before you start posting about it."

AS: Alright this is Amy Sullivan. It's May 10th, 2019. I'm interviewing Cody Petrich? [Pronouncing last name as Petri-ck]. 
CP: Petrich. [Emphasizing pronunciation of last name is Petri-ch]. 
AS: Petrich. I always get the names wrong. And we are at Macalester College. And, Cody could you just state your name, and spell your name? 
CP: Yes. 
AS: And say that you give me permission?
CP: Of course. So, Cody is C-O-D-Y [spelling]. Petrich is P-E-T-R-I-C-H [spelling]. And, I give permission. 
AS: Thank you. Let's talk about... tell me about your early life. You're about to graduate from college, here at Macalester, here in a week. 
CP: Yes, yes, yes. 
AS: So, let's go way back. 
CP: So yeah, I am in Saint Paul right now, but came from Lansing, Illinois. It was, it's about twenty minutes south of downtown Chicago. Nestled up next to the border of Indiana. But, I was born in '97, in Lansing, and stayed eighteen years, at least the same street. 
AS: Same house? 
CP: Yeah, furthest I moved was four houses down [both laughing]. There was a weird set up, at one point my Ma and Dad lived four houses away. And, we lost my ma's house, I just moved in with my dad down the road. Made it pretty easy to move [both laughing].
AS: Yeah I'll say. 
CP: Didn't necessarily prepare me for the Minnesota move, but… 
AS: Right. So, tell me about your childhood. 
CP: I was pretty happy. I was spoiled in a lot of ways. Very outdoorsy. Yeah so, I think right around the time I started actually being cognizant—I was about five, I think. My ma and dad had gotten divorced at five. And so, I lived with my ma, my Aunt Tracy, my cousins, Uncle Rye, my brother Greg. In a small little Cape Cod house. Big backyard, park across the street. I don't know, for the most part childhood was good. Allowed to go outside and play. Do all that fun stuff. 
AS: Could you roam around in the neighborhood?
CP: Oh yeah. I still keep in contact with guys from a couple blocks down and around. Playing football, different things. Started to get into sports a little later on. But for the most part, just did school, came home and played, just did fun stuff. 
AS: How, how was school for you? Did you have… 
CP: Easy [both laughing]. I guess I don't need to be cocky with it, but yeah I had a brother who was pretty focused with school. And smart. 
AS: Is he older? tell me about your siblings. 
CP: Yeah he's older. Let's see I'm 21. He would be 29. Lives in Colorado. Got a wife and kid. Doing his thing. Yeah, so we have eight years difference. And he's technically a half brother. I think his dad is somewhere in Florida right now. I really don't know if he's alive or dead or not. He was a heroin addict himself. But, I think my mom and Greg had moved from Florida back to Chicago to kind of get away from that. So yeah, Greg was raised mostly with my dad and my ma. Even when they split. Then I've got an uncle who's actually my legal brother. My ma had taken custody of him when their ma had died. So she raised him from I think when he was like, somewhere between five and ten years old. And, he's got another eight year difference from my brother. So, he's sixteen years older than me. 
AS: Oh, okay. 
CP: Eight, eight, and eight. But yeah, I mean Greg stayed with us up until, up until he went to college. He went to University of Iowa, doing an ROTC program. My uncle Rye stayed with us, till he was like way too old [laughing]—twenty-five, twenty six. He was a little bit more of like a partie. Funny guy. My Aunt Tracey, and Lindsey—Lindsey is my cousin, but we grew up in the same room and stuff, so more sister-like to me. I don't know when they moved out, but I think it was earlier on. Probably when I was like five, six, seven—around there. And yeah. My dad wasn't in the immediate house, the four houses down… until I was about sixth grade. But, he stayed in the town regardless.
AS: Oh, so you grew up with going back and forth?
CP: Yeah, yeah. I think we did the good old court, back-and-forth every other weekend?
AS: By court, you mean the typical custody arrangement?
CP: Yeah, yeah. And, like yeah, I guess like my ma and dad were never like best friends or high on each other. But, they got along enough for me not to ever have to deal with clashes between the two. So, I was very fortunate for that. 
AS: Do you have any younger siblings?
CP: No, no. I had a younger step-brother for a little while. My ma's second husband, Rick. And his son was Ricky [both laughing]. That was like a year, year and a half. I don't know what's going on with those two either. Not anymore. 
AS: How was your teenage, how were your teenage years? 
CP: Pretty angsty, I would say [laughing]. Typically angsty. I think it was right when I got into high school, close around there. Is when I had moved in with my dad. And so… 
AS: Did something precipitate that? 
CP: Yeah, my ma had… the house that we had got foreclosed down. She was kind of at that point. I'm trying to think. Yeah, I moved out of that house like middle of freshman year, that high school year. After having been out of the house for like a couple of months. The prior summer I wanna say. But yeah it's like, my ma had been clean from, I think she had a three and a half year sobriety time. Which I think was the longest for her since she had started. I think she had started when she was like fourteen. At least with cigarettes, I know that. She had heroin in the house and other drugs and stuff from when she had told me. But, I think seventh grade summer, or eighth grade summer, either or, she had, she was working construction at the time. Making good money, feeling really good. And like, whenever she wasn't working construction she was a server, or doing like cleaning. But I think, whichever summer it was, she had gotten in an accident. Like a motor vehicle accident. She was on her motorcycle, and some uninsured driver hit her. I think she had a contusion on one of her legs. Yeah, so a bone was popping out and all that good stuff. But she went to the hospital, got recovered from it. I think successfully did whatever drug treatment she had chose for that. Little after that, relapsed. And, I knew about some of the relapse… Or, I didn't know up until the point. But I did find her overdosed. 
AS: Oh my gosh. When you were a middle schooler?
CP: Yeah, either seventh grade summer or eighth grade summer. 
AS: Was that the first time you were aware of her drug use?
CP: No, no… 
AS: Oh, do you wanna back up?
CP: Yeah I can go back [both laughing]. I skipped a lot. 
AS: Okay, my point is, I'm trying to have you not skip. No it just takes a minute. 
CP: Me and my ma were really close. We were… she was probably more open with me than she should have been. Yeah I went to NA meetings with her, open groups, closed groups. It was, her home group had a babysitter, nanny whatever you wanna call it. 
AS: So from how old do you remember going to meetings with her? 
CP: Ever since.
AS: Your whole life?
CP: Yeah, yeah. Obviously when she wasn't going to the meetings I wasn't going to the meetings. 
AS: No.
CP: But, yeah I met a lot, a lot of people. 'Cuz I mean, that's how my ma was. Was when she was going to the meetings she was involved, and going to the cookouts, camping things. So yeah, I think once I got up to middle school was when it was a little bit more tempoed. I definitely saw… 
AS: What was more tempoed? 
CP: Like, meeting attendance, and… 
AS: That she didn't go anymore?
CP: No. And for whatever reason, I don't know. She barked a lot of BS towards the end of the… 
AS: So was the three years when you were a younger kid? The three and a half years that you remember?
CP: It was… probably like fourth grade, fifth grade, up until she had the accident.
AS: Like seventh grade? Oh, okay.
CP: So it was, I mean, pretty I don't know vibrant time for me. I was just kinda no responsibilities. 
AS: Yeah, it's a great age. 
CP: Yeah, and yeah she would help me get to practices, games, school, all that good stuff. But, I always say when she was clean best mother in the world. But, it's hard to take care of your responsibilities when you're using. So, so yeah. We did meetings early on. I knew a bunch of her sober friends. I still keep in contact with quite a few of 'em. But yeah, I think it was prior to the meetings. What were we saying? 
AS: Oh, we were talking about when you moved in with your dad, what had happened? 'Cuz your mom, and you said your mom had relapsed, and then you also mentioned an overdose.
CP: Yeah so, I mean I… 
AS: I was asking what precipitated you leaving?
CP: I wasn't quite aware. I wasn't aware at all really. That she had relapsed prior. Obviously you find her overdosed I knew what it was right away. 
AS: You did?
CP: Yeah. 
AS: How did you know what an overdose was? In eighth grade, whatever it was. Seventh of eighth grade.
CP: I wanna say partially my ma, partially the town I grew up in, partially I mean just Chicago in general. I was cognizant of it, pretty early on that I knew my ma could die from that type of stuff. So yeah, I had found her in our bathroom, because I had to poop [both laughing]. She, yeah just like the, it's a nasty sound, but like snoring pretty much. I had actually, someone relapsed at the sober house the other day so then, kinda just took me all the way back. So I mean, that incident went down. And got in contact with family, got in contact with paramedics obviously. And, she was fine. And, I don't remember if I had moved out right after that or not. I don't think I had, until like my dad pretty much gave me the option. And, I didn't wanna leave, but you know she got back and things never really got better. And, you could just tell. Fricken’ house is dirty, and my ma would never have a dirty house. Getting home late never was an issue, lack of communication, yada yada. Up until the point where she just took off. Yeah, for I don't know like a year, two year stint. 
AS: Where'd she go?
CP: From, what she told me, she was pushing. She was pushing drugs from Chicago Heights to Champaign-Urbana, where U of I is. And, she said she had been a lot of places. I don't know. 
AS: So she was dealing? 
CP: Yeah, and mostly, what she said, was just for her own fix. She was staying in trap houses and... She said luckily, she had met someone who was pretty much the operator of whatever was going on, and she said you know,  relative to what it could have been, he was good to her. And so, yeah. She, I don't think she ever left Chicago, or the area, or Illinois. But, I can't quite remember how we found her. I know that there was jail time at some point, and calls from Cook County. I think it was my junior year, winter. Yeah winter break, my junior year of high school. So, she had been gone. She left that freshman year. I really didn't… 
AS: Wow. And you didn't see her? 
CP: No. 
AS: Were you ever in touch with her? Did she ever call you, or?
CP: It's still blurry to me. But, I'm pretty sure I got in touch with her. Earlier on, maybe a little bit more frequently. 'Cuz once we lost the house I knew she was… I think she was living in, I forget the name of that damn town. Somewhere in Chicago. With her sober boyfriend's like apartment. He just kept an apartment for when he was working construction, so. He'd come down to the city. But, I don't remember too much. It was, yeah like I said I had gotten calls. I remember getting calls from the jail, the prison, being like, ""Sweet. At least now I know where she is.”
AS: You're saying it was good, 'cuz you knew she was safe there?
CP: Yeah. Yeah and my ma was tough so I wasn't too worried about her being alright. 
AS: No that's a common feeling of relief among many people, at least they're somewhere… 
CP: Exactly. 
AS: … where, at least they're not out on the street. 
CP: Yeah. It was tough for me though, 'cuz I think I got a call. 'Cuz that type of stuff would mess up my day for… I mean, I thought about my ma a lot, but like I also had school, and I was achieving pretty highly with that. And so, I had a good outlet. I had that, and sports to kind of focus on. But, yeah I remember getting that jail call was, I was at school at like six in the morning doing something. And, I got that call, and it just fucked up the day. But yeah, trying to think. 
AS: So, you're a junior, and she comes back into your life? What happened?
CP: Mhm. That January she got into a treatment program, in-patient program, up in like Northern Chicago. Northern suburbs. Really fancy program. I don't know how the hell she got in [both laughing]. But, even before that I think she had tried another treatment center before that ‘'cuz I think I remember visiting her at another treatment center. I had also visited her at treatment centers before her three and a half year stint. 
AS: Oh, when you were a little kid?
CP: Yeah. I remember that vaguely. But, I think that was around the time my dad, her and my dad were getting divorced or what not. 
AS: When you were like five?
CP: Yeah, yeah. Roughly around there. I been to quite a few treatment centers, without having worked there like I do now. 
AS: Yeah, right. 
CP: Yeah, she had gotten clean that January. And, she was kinda just trying to figure out where to go. You know it's a… 
AS: 'Cuz she has no home. 
CP: Nope. No home. 
AS: Now she has a record, criminal record. 
CP: Yeah she had a record before, way before. I think she got picked up for paraphernalia. I think that's what it was. But, yeah she… 
AS: Oh, so she never had a felony? Or she did?
CP: I have no idea…  I wanna say…  no she is a felon. 'Cuz we couldn't get… she wanted a gun, and she couldn't get a gun [both laughing]. 
AS: Oh my gosh, wow.
CP: But, I remember she got out of treatment, and were just, she was trying to just figure out what, I guess what the next move is. And, somehow, Ken her sober boyfriend—they had probably been dating for four or five years—they had met when she started working construction. He was still in the picture. I talked with him last week actually. But, he lives in northwest Illinois. And so, my thought was, get her out there. And it's a hell of a drive to Chicago Heights to pick stuff up. And, I think she was, with the same idea. So, she went up there. Not too sure if she was working construction, or waitressing, or what she was doing. But, she was working. And, you know she'd come out to Chicago every now and again so we could hang out. Or, I'd go up there. Or, what not. And, she struggled, big time with that. 
AS: Was it just, do you know about her treatment? Was it just abstinence-based? Was she ever on any of the medications? 
CP: Yeah, it was abstinence-based. I don't know if she ever took psychotic drugs, or anti-psychotics… 
AS: No, I mean did she ever take methadone or suboxone?
CP: Not to my knowledge. I don't know, she was pretty old-school. So, I don't know if she would've. But, yeah. And, I'm not too sure if she took other medications either for other stuff. Yeah I know, when she was up there, I don't really know what the clean time would be for her, 'cuz I mean she was struggling. 
AS: But she lived with Ken?
CP: Yeah, and Ken was good. He was really old-fashioned. I mean they were living in a town of six hundred people. So, there wasn't no dope up there. Or at least, not easily findable. And, yeah. Like I said, she made a lot of efforts to get back down to see me. And like, you know it was rolling a dice every time I got to see her. It was either, she was… I could tell if she was clean, or I could tell if she was high. 
AS: You knew that? Yeah, from a long time. A long history. 
CP: Yeah, yeah. And I remember going up there with my good friend Harry. Harry grew up three blocks from us, and my ma was his ma. Vice versa, whatever. And, we were up there, and my ma was… she was dopesick. And, I knew that the whole weekend she was dopesick. But, I forget why we wanted to go up there, we did. And, I think my ma was of the mind that we didn't have to drop Harry off in Iowa. 'Cuz he had moved by this time. But, she wanted to cut the trip short. A no brainer to me. And Harry's like, ""Okay well, yeah I guess this could be a drive or whatever."" And, my ma figures out that we have to drop Harry off, and it's gonna be this much longer. And, yeah. 
AS: She couldn't take it?
CP: No. No, I mean she, we did it! 'Cuz she gotta get back to Chicago Heights somewhere. But, that was the first time I had ever seen her be nasty to Harry. And, unfortunately, that was the last time Harry had seen her. And, so yeah that was tough for him. But yeah, that's just one instance. I know there were other instances. She came down for a game, my junior year cuz I was playing or what not. 
AS: What sport were you playing? 
CP: Football. 
AS: Okay. 
CP: Yeah, yeah I was. Luckily got to play quarterback for four years. Got to junior year, and started varsity which was cool. 
AS: Mhm, that's cool. 
CP: Very cool. But yeah, she had came out for one of the games. It was a really nasty hotel over by the highway. And, she had gotten a place there for the night. And she was like, ""You know…"" I could tell she was doing good at the time, she wasn't high or anything, but she was like, ""Yeah you know you wanna come hang out, and spend the night here that's fine."" And I was like, ""I really don't wanna be on those bedsheets, but that's fine."" And, so I hung out with her for a little while, and then left, hung out with some friends, came back, probably midnight to one. And, door was locked. And like, I couldn't get the damn door open. I needed to get in there to sleep. But, she wasn't overdosed she was just really fricken’ high. She had nodded out. And so, I remember that night. That was bad for me. I wasn't too sure what to do off the bat. And eventually, just kinda knocking until she woke up. Yelling at her or whatever. 
AS: Oh my gosh. 
CP: Yeah. But, I don't think she remembers. She probably don't remember it. Or, didn't remember it. 
AS: And you, you were able to get in there?
CP: Yeah, I got in there that night. She had kinda slid [unclear]. And, yeah just another instance of us hanging out, or having our time, and she was using. 
AS: Right. 
CP: Yeah. Even up like before she had passed, I think we had hung out the week, weekend before. She had overdosed on Thursday during football season. So, fall of 2014. Prior to that Thursday… 
AS: Is that your senior year, '14?
CP: Yeah, so she was pretty steadily coming down on Thursday nights for football. We would have practice, do our pasta night or whatever, and then we'd be off for the night. So I'd do practice, go to pasta night, lead prayer. I wouldn't eat anything, I'd leave with her. And we'd go to the movies, or go get dinner or something. And, we went to the movies, and I really couldn't tell if she was or not. I wasn't really trying to tell. But, I just remember her like at the end of the night giving me a hug, and I wasn't good. Like, I could feel something was off. And, she knew it too. But yeah… 
AS: What do you mean she knew it too?
CP: I think she was a little ashamed. I think she was high. 
AS: Oh, oh. 
CP: And, I think she might have noticed that I hadn't noticed. Which I usually do [laughs]. I don't know… that might be a little… 
AS: What would you do when you noticed?
CP: It was better to be hanging out with her, than not to be. 
AS: So you would just… would you say something to her, or?
CP: Mmm… no. 
AS: So, when you say notice it's more of like, you two in your body language, and how well you knew each other. 
CP: Yeah, yeah. And, I mean me and her had had talks about her use, I'd confronted her on more than one occasion. Pretty formally. You know, I wasn't gonna talk to her when she's high. 'Cuz you know, I got a bunch of drunks in the family too. I don't talk to them when they're drunk. But, yeah like, I remember having a conversation out in Elizabeth, the northwest Illinois town. Very strong conversation. I remember going and confronting her. That Chicago town, I forget the name of it. And, telling her like, pretty much just telling her, “I know you're using. What's your game plan? At least you need to know that.” And, so yeah. I must've probably talked to her, I was at least checking up at the time. You know, ""How you been doing? You been feeling alright?"" Yada, yada. When she was coming out, and yeah, the week prior to her passing when we were hanging out, I knew she was struggling. 
AS: Was that when you hugged her? What you were just talking about?
CP: Yeah, yeah. And we had both driven separately to the movie theater. So, I remember the hug, whatever. She's tearing up. And, she went back to her car, and just sat there for a while. And, I like couldn't leave. 
AS: 'Cuz you wanted to see her drive away?
CP: Yeah, mostly that. Yeah, mostly that. 'Cuz I had, she was staying with my uncle, I think I called my uncle that night. I usually don't like, babysit or you know, I really hated having to make calls to check up on my own mother. So, I didn't very many times. But, I remember calling Rye that night, and just being like, ""She make it?"" ""Yeah."" ""Okay, cool.""
AS: Oh, to see if she made it back. So, she was living with him at that point? Or he was… ?
CP: No, she was just staying there. This was one of her visits from northwest. 
AS: Oh right, right. Sorry. 
CP: Yeah. Nah it's fine. And so, yeah. It was… still made it to the game that week. We kinda did that, and went back up to Elizabeth. But, yeah the next weekend was when she came down for her normal Thursday to hang out with me. And, she just never made it. 
AS: She never made it to… ? 
CP: To us. 
AS: What did she, what happened?
CP: Might have stopped off in Chicago Heights. 'Cuz Chicago Heights is right next door to Lansing. I mean you can get dope from either spots, but, yeah she… I remember I called her that morning. Didn't get a response. 
AS: Called her Thursday?
CP: Yeah, that morning. Just to see if she was coming out. 'Cuz I had spoken to her the night before. And, apparently her and Ken were not doing good. Ken wasn't very honest with me up there. She was living in a different place with three other girls, probably other servers. But, yeah she sounded good, she sounded fine. That Wednesday night. And then, called her Thursday morning. Nothing. I'm like, ""Okay, whatever."" Time keeps going, and I'm like, ""Okay, still haven't gotten a call."" School finishes. I have like an hour break in between school and practice. Tried to give her a call again. Wasn't getting nothing. Called Ken, to see if he had heard from her. Nothing. Called my uncle, ""You hear from her?"" Nothing. Okay. Finally, I get dressed, go to practice. And yeah, like did the whole practice. Hour and a half goes by. We're about to do our last thing for the day. I saw my uncle whip up, like with his car. Right next to the practice field, which he probably hadn't been there since he had played himself. So, I knew, I knew something was up. Like I knew… 
AS: Was that Rye?
CP: Yeah, yeah. I knew right away. So, he just gave me the ""choo-choo"" [imitating sound].
Got to drive back to the… to the locker room. Got dressed. Hopped in Rye's car. And, Rye really didn't have to say nothing. Like we, he gave me the rundown: ""She's at the hospital, she OD'd, they didn't find her till very late. And so, she's in critical condition."" Yada yada. Comatosed. But yeah, she had apparently went to Chicago Heights earlier that morning. Picked up. I think it was some form of speed ball. So, heroin and coke. I think it was some old lady's apartment, in like a sky-rise. I don't know. Some lady must've either been crazy, or nice enough to let her up into the apartment. I think she, I don't know if she got found inside or outside. But, basically she had overdosed. No one found her for a long time, and they found her when her body temp was like 91°, 92°,
AS: Who found her? Do you know?
CP: No clue. No clue. I didn't get enough answers on that, from my mom [unclear]. Yeah, so we went over there. And she… yeah.
AS: You went to the hospital? 
CP: Mhm. 
AS: Where? She was in Chicago Heights, in a hospital?
CP: Yeah, yeah. So it was only ten, fifteen minutes from the house. But, but yeah. It was, that was Thursday. And, she ended up passing away on Sunday. Basically, since then had found her so low with the body temp and it took so long, there were like traumatic brain issues that she was gonna be experiencing, if we took her off life support, and she still came through. Even if she would've lived without the life support, she would have been more, for lack of a better term, like vegetable state. 
AS: Right. 
CP: And so, we waited Thursday, Friday. I think the neurologist met with her on Saturday, or Friday. And, we got results Saturday. And basically, it came down to me and Greg. We had to make a decision. Yeah. 
AS: What was your decision? I mean, what do you mean? 
CP: Like, whether or not to keep her on life support or not. We knew… 
AS: But, if she came through. What was the… ?
CP: There was a chance that if we kept her on life support, that at some point she, her body would like regenerate, regenerate enough to be able… 
AS: To stay alive without it… 
CP: … Without it, yeah. 
AS: Oh, I see what you're saying. 
CP: But even if that was the case… 
AS: Even if it did, she would never regain her full consciousness. 
CP: Mhm, for real yeah. 
AS: So that was left to you and... 
CP: Me and my brother.
AS: Greg. 
CP: Yeah, I don't know it, I mean obviously a very difficult decision. Awful decision. But, I, oddly enough me and ma had had conversations about it prior. And so, I knew what the answer was. 
AS: You mean, what she would want?
CP: Yeah. She had told me prior like she would not ever want to live, like highly debilitated or what not. 
AS: Right right. 
CP: And, so yeah. That was a real shit weekend. But we had family come up, all of her brothers and sister. 
AS: Was that, so that was the fall of your senior year?
CP: Yeah, it was.
AS: When did she pass?
CP: October 19th. And, yeah. Nah, senior year from there on out was a little bit tougher. I've done through for me [unclear] a bunch of shit. 
AS: Oh, yeah.
CP: Yeah and it was right in the middle of my senior year of football. 
AS: And college applications… 
CP: College applications. And so I, I just did my best to keep going with it. Yeah. Did the burial and all that stuff. And, had to figure out things to do with items. By that time she didn't have much. When we lost the house she pretty much lost everything. 
AS: And, that had been several years before, like three?
CP: Yeah, my freshman year. Yeah, so three years prior. But yeah, that's, I think that's most of that. 
AS: So how, how was your dad through all this? Are you close to your dad?
CP: Yeah, we're closer now. He's very, I guess business-like in a way. Not, not in any overbearing manner. He's very quiet and polite. A little quieter than most. But, yeah I mean he kinda let me do what I was choosing to do. I knew that I didn't have to mess with, you know what was going on with my ma. I could've stayed a distance, and you know processed whatever I had to process. But, I had seen family members pull out of relationships with her, no contact with her. 
AS: With her?
CP: Yeah. And, that pissed me off. It was really just me and Ken. 
AS: Wow. 
CP: Yeah, but as time, Greg. Summer before my junior year, my brother got married in Alaska 'cuz he was stationed up there. My ma came with us. My dad went out. Whole family went up. But, I think she was using at the time too up there. She ended up, like not staying with my brother at their house, for a night or too. Mostly 'cuz of an argument 'cuz Greg knew. She went and stayed with some random lady. 
AS: Wow.
CP: Very nice lady! [Both laughing]. She's, she's facebook friends with us. But, there was a point to that, but. 
AS: Oh, but it was about Greg and his relationship with her. 
CP: Yeah. Greg had had enough. And, you know, I never really blame Greg for you know, not being, trying to get his hands dirty in it. 'Cuz you know, he's had two parents tap out from that. 
AS: Oh, his father died? Or just disappeared? Oh yeah that was who you… right, you were saying at the beginning… 
CP: I don't know. Last I heard of, whatever his name is… he's a double amputee down in Florida from Hep-C, and needle sharing, and whatever. 
AS: Oh my goodness. 
CP: Yeah, most I ever heard about the dude was you know, maybe a, ""Hey I'll come up for… I'm doing better now. I'll come up for your grad!""
AS: And then he wouldn't show up. 
CP: No [laughing], no. And so, I don't know. Yeah. I don't think I've ever had a conversation with Greg about… me and Greg don't. Even though I'm a psych major and all this stuff. My family's very much not.  Lot of Indiana roots. Blue collar. Union. That type of work. 
AS: Don't talk about stuff? Is that what you're saying?
CP: Yeah. To a degree yeah. I mean we, we always knew. Like We always knew if Red was using or what not, but it's not like we were sitting down, and devising plans, or… 
AS: If who was using? 
CP: Um my ma. 
AS: What'd you call her?
CP: Red. 
AS: Red. What was your mom's name? 
CP: Michelle. Michelle Horsely. [Check spelling]. But yeah, we called her Big Red, 'cuz she was intimidating. She was like 5'1"". Very skinny, but very intimidating  [Sullivan laughing]. Could clean her, but it didn't matter. 
AS: At 5'1""? 
CP: Yeah, yeah. She laid the law. Usually with like chores and stuff like that, but so yeah. I got a tattoo of her, and it doesn't have her real name. But, it's just “Red” [laughing]. It was a good nickname. 
AS: When did you do that?
CP: Right when I turned eighteen. So, yeah the July following that senior year. Before I came up here. Yeah. Trying to think if there's more.
AS: Do you need a break? 
CP: Yeah. 
AS: Okay, okay. 
… 
AS: Okay we're back. So, what I'm wondering, so you're eighteen, and it's your senior year. What kind of support did you have? What kind of a support network did you have to kind of cope with all this? 
CP: Like immediate support. I had a lot. A lot. Having grown up with, like in the same town for so long. Met a lot of people, and developed a lot of relationships. And I, I still keep in contact with a lot of those folk now days. No, she had immediately passed, and social media is blowing up. People are checking in, and all this stuff. I got a lot of financial support from people. 
AS: You did?
CP: That, you know, whether I knew 'em or not. Yeah. 
AS: Do you feel like people knew your… they knew, because you were in a pretty small town for a long time, that they knew your mom's story? I mean was it… 
CP: To a degree, yeah. And, I became a little bit more aware of other people's awareness as I was getting older. And so, I think I got a little added support 'cuz of that. And, a lot of it because people knew that my mom, she was a good people. But yeah, even when she had overdosed, like my eighth grade summer, she you know even the paramedic that came, I knew the paramedic. I played ball with three of his sons. Baseball with three of his sons for most of life. And so, I, yeah I remember sitting out like trunk, in the bed of some, my uncle's buddy's truck. 'Cuz they came over from the bar. One of 'em. And I was just sitting there. And, I was like, ""Fuck."" Yeah. Definitely when it happened people knew. It wasn't necessarily a surprise, for any. But, yeah. 
AS: What about your mom's parents and her family? You mentioned that there was a lot of addiction in the family? Is that on her side? 
CP: I don't know too much about my grandma. And, I heard a little bit more about my grandpa. 
AS: Had they passed away already? 
CP: Both of 'em are passed by this point. So my ma I think passed away at forty-three. Her ma passed away at forty-two, from I think it was a heart attack. Complications with maybe substance, maybe not. But yeah, she had passed away at forty-two. So, I think my ma was nineteen at the time. Took over custody of Rye. And, her other siblings were old enough to pretty much do their own thing. But, yeah. Her dad was absent. Picked up, and made a new family twenty minutes down the road. Yep. And so, I don't know too much about the dude, besides that. When I went back, I think I went with my uncles and my aunt to Portillos—very good Italian beef place. We were talking about it,  and apparently he had passed away. But, I remember my ma telling stories about her... like they knew where he was. And, like showing up at the house and talking with his wife, and you know just not being able to see him. And so, yeah. It wasn't. Unfortunately, like that wasn't like weird to me either ‘cuz I knew a lot of buddies and stuff whose fathers were absent. My best friend's father is you know, mainly absent. Most of the guys around my block have dads absent. But yeah, I mean as far as her childhood went, she, they... it was wild. I know that they didn't have the same opportunities that I did. I wanna say she was, what they called home was Cedar Point, Indiana. Which is like forty minutes, thirty minutes, into Indiana from Illinois. And, they'd bounce at a whole bunch. But yeah, I think Cedar Point was their longest stint. And they just stayed in northwest Indiana, bouncing. 
AS: And then at nineteen, she's in charge of her little brother?
CP: Yep. 
AS: Who was?
CP: I wanna say like five or six. 
AS: Yeah. 
CP: He was younger, but at that point you know, he knew what was going on. And, I think that, I think that's when she bounced to Arizona, or to Florida because she, she might've been nineteen, she might've been seventeen. But, I do know that she was pregnant with Greg when she was nineteen. And so, she had to have been in Florida. Or maybe… dude came up, and then went back to Florida. 
AS: Yeah, yeah. 
CP: She wasn't there for very long. So yeah, like. I don't think all of 'em had, like the same dad. I think my mom's dad, she shared that dad with like two of her siblings. And the other two had different dads. That dad's still in the picture. I think. So, my maybe grandpa. He lives in the backwoods of Indiana. He's fun [laughs].
AS: Yeah. 
CP: He could probably use some Macalester education, but that's okay. 
AS: You said, he could probably use some Macalester education? [Laughing].
CP: Yeah, he's a funny dude, but I don't think… he's not the most politically correct. My cousin, she's mixed, 'cuz my Aunt Tracy married my Uncle Frank. And so, it's an inter-racial marriage. And so, my Linsey's mixed, and I just remember going to cook out in high school at some point with Lindsey, and my aunt, and Frank, and they're doing karaoke [unclear].  End up saying the ""N-word"" multiple times. 
AS: Oh my gosh. 
CP: But yeah. So yeah, as far as her raising and all that. They relied on each other a lot. I mean, she was very close with my aunt and my three uncles. Even though they're spread out. 
AS: Your mom was close with her siblings, is that what you're saying?
CP: Yeah. Yeah, she was really the glue for our family as far as getting together or doing events. Doing like, you know, I was always, always had, always celebrated holidays. Always went to church. That type of stuff. And, I can't say that about my uncles or my aunt. 
AS: Oh I see, yeah. 
CP: And so, she was very high, high productivity. In a lot of areas. But, I don't know where she learned that 'cuz I know her ma and dad weren't, not necessarily the most engaged. But, the one thing that they do tell me about my grandma, my ma's ma, was that she just like, was a very like, loving person. Showed it in different ways. And my ma was too. Strict with little things, chores and she never really monitored homework or anything for me, 'cuz she didn't have to. But, you know I… multiple occasions not being able to go out 'cuz I gotta go whack a bush down or something. I got put to work quite a bit. But, and that's how she was. She was incredibly loving. Not even just like her family, but I mean she, from what I consider pretty racist roots in Indiana, prejudiced roots in Indiana, I think her lived experience, and her relationship with her ma, kind of allowed for her to talk to me more about like, people who don't look like us, or who have less, or more, or yada yada. And so she passed that down to me pretty well. 
AS: That's an awesome thing. 
CP: Yeah, it was sweet. She was pretty crazy for some ways, she'll talk to anybody. Like I said, when we were in Alaska, she had no idea who this woman was. And, for some reason, that woman has probably posted on my ma's wall more than anyone! 
AS: Really? Oh my gosh [laughing].
CP: I think, she showed a, the lady didn't want anything. They went to bed, and my ma cleaned the entire place. Like that's just how she was. 
AS: Very outgoing
CP: Outgoing, and she worked for, she could appreciate a good day's work. And, she passed that along to me. I think that's probably as much as I really know about the childhood. Also impressed  'cuz I heard that they used to get their asses whooped quite a bit. I never got a finger laid on me. Ever, no. Some stern talkings, but… 
AS: That's different. 
CP: Yeah, yeah. 
AS: So how was it for you at Macalester?
CP: It's been awful. It's really been awful. 
AS: Why?
CP: I don't necessarily think it's Macalester or anything. I just don't think I was ready. I think, I was pretty spoiled as far as support back home. Knowing where I'm gonna be, where I'm gonna eat, and all these things. And, I don't know. I just like, didn't do too well with due diligence. Like, planning how I was gonna be living up here. 
AS: You mean, once you weren't in the dorms?
CP: Yeah, yeah. You know, I had no cookbook, none of that stuff. And, a lot of it I had to learn. And still learning. But, and I was… back home like, even though my ma had passed from overdose. It's not, like anything like, crazy. It's a little crazy up here. Like guys… you can just see it in the face. 
AS: What's crazy here? What do you mean?
CP: To me, the lack of loss. Sometimes. 
AS: The lack of laws, or loss?
CP: Loss, loss. 
AS: What do you mean by that?
CP: Like I say, 'cuz I mean, even with hearing like how my ma was raised, and family stuff. Like I knew a lot of broken families back home. Know a lot of people who had family struggles that were very different from mine, but like you still understand the struggle a little bit. Us coming from a pretty lower socio-economic area… 
AS: To this… 
CP: To this.
AS: … school.
CP: I was never really exposed to much money. I didn't take too many drives on northside of Chicago, or any of that stuff. So, from what like, from what I knew and understood, that's just kinda how life was. I knew there was different, different classes and what not. But I just hadn't interacted with 'em very much. And so, that was tough for me. 
AS: When you came here, because people had, are coming from… 
CP: Yeah, some money. 
AS: … a lot of money. Yeah. 
CP: Yeah, you know full families. They don't have to worry about, you know, food in the morning or, that type of stuff. And so, yeah it was difficult kind of managing my own like emotional regulation and stuff. It really didn't matter to me whether I was, whether the person was trying to be nice or a dick [unclear] to me, I just had a deep hate, a deep hate for that type of stuff. 
AS: A deep hate for?
CP: For people with money, really. And that's just something that I've been working on these four years. 
AS: Is it because… why is that? If you weren't exposed to it, what was it about it that made… ?
CP: 'Cuz I knew that… it was probably less so in the dorms. I mean, my first two years were fine. Most of my struggles were self-inflicted. You know, getting too drunk or being disrespectful to the wrong person or something. But, once I got out of the dorms. You know, having to go pick up groceries, having to buy notebooks, and books, and…  lot of frustration with just how my family had rallied around the death. Like I said, my ma was the glue. And so, without her, I mean. No one's getting on the other people's case to do the right thing, or what I would perceive to be the right thing. 
AS: Did you have, have you had support from your family while you've been here, or you've been kind of alone?
CP: A lot of alone, a lot of alone. In my eyes. You know, I do call. I call [laughs]. A twenty-one year old dude, you know calling aunts, uncles. And you know, it's always the same: ""Well, yeah we're real proud of you."" Yada, yada. But, that doesn't feed me in the morning. It doesn't prepare me for school. 
AS: So, how have you… so, has being here been a financial burden for you?
CP: Huge, huge financial burden. 
AS: With loans, and, I mean or did you have… ?
CP: Yeah, loans… this was the best option. I mean, I wasn't gonna bust butt in high school and grade school, 'cuz I was, I don't know for whatever reason I thought college would really warrant the full twelve year track, but no. Yeah, I wasn't gonna bust butt in high school and not go to a college… 
AS: That was… 
CP: That was good [unclear] Especially Mac. Ultimately, I picked Mac 'cuz of the financial aid that it offered. And, it's enough. It's close to the full tuition. 
AS: Wow. 
CP: First two years, I had to cover room and board. And, I'm still covering a little bit now. But, you know that's… 
AS: That's impressive. 
CP: Yeah, yeah! And I mean, I have had it easy in certain areas. Like, my dad pays my rent. I take care of utilities. You know, work on the weekends. I get paid, you know a pretty good for twenty-one years old. And so like, we make it happen, but it's tight [laughs]. I've had to go to food banks, I've had people drop off food for me. I just, like, it's just… knowing that other people don't have to do that stuff. 
AS: That resentment, that's hard. 
CP: Yeah, deal with that stress. Yeah it's… 
AS: Do you think, do you see an insensitivity? 
CP: At times, oh yeah!
AS: … of your peers towards that? 
CP: At times. 
AS: … Or just lack of understanding? 
CP: Yeah. But, I mean I'm also smart enough to know it's not 'cuz of, you know how much money their family makes, it's the individual person. And so, I've just had to remind myself that a lot. Unfortunately I've got some roommates that aren't very sensitive to it. And so, that, that hasn't been great. I made a bad roommate decision coming out of the dorms, staying with friends as opposed to good roommates. 
AS: Oh, that's a hard lesson, isn't it? 
CP: Very hard lesson. And, we're still learning 'cuz we gotta get the house cleaned up. But, you know, one of my guys, his dad's a lawyer and his ma teaches, and they do well. Like he, he gets it. Like, we don't necessarily sit there and do cry sessions with each other, but he understands when he's pushing something too far. Whereas, I got two guys who live upstairs that are just dumb. I hear about their stories: ""Oh yeah, didn't always live in Scottsdale next to this Arizona Cardinal's player."" ""Tell me more."" 
AS: So Cody, I know that you have been working in a sober house. Or, sober living. And then, you also just mentioned getting drunk. So what is your, what's your relationship to substances? And then what, how did you end up getting, working in a… 
CP: Yeah… 
AS: I realize those are probably two different… they might be two different stories, they might be the same!
CP: No, it's… but it's an important question to ask. So yeah, I… my biggest issue with substance right now is nicotine. I've been chewing, smoking, vaping, since fourteen pretty steadily. And unfortunately, it's a substance that I just like haven't gotten around to do anything about. On the other hand, you know alcohol. I was drinking a lot in high school, which is weird to say. 
AS: Why? Why does that seem weird? 
CP: It just like, I get up here, and I hear about the things about drinking, you know sex, and just like initial exposure to that type of stuff. 
AS: When people just get to college, they're just being exposed?
CP: I was fourteen, and I was doing really not fourteen year old things. But, it's natural like in that type of environment I suppose. If you're not disciplined—I wasn't very disciplined. And so, yeah. I've drank, smoked weed, you know I've tried… what have I tried. Some psychedelics, I've tried coke on one night—and that's really the only hard drug that I've tried. But, all of that was early. You know, high school.
AS: In high school?
CP: High school was drinking, smoking. College still smoked, drank, but it was really my first two years where I was like, you know I've always known that I had this, I wanted to work in the field, and I don't wanna work as a hypocrite. And so, you know, my first two years… 
AS: You wanna work in the addiction field?
CP: Yeah, yeah. And so, I was still getting blacked out drunk and all that in freshman and sophomore year. To a point where like, the issues that were coming from were just too much for me to want to deal with. And so I, I was able to cut back on binge drinking, pretty wildly and pretty quickly. To the point where like I'm, you I'm in bed at ten, eleven PM on Fridays and Saturdays now. [Sullivan laughing]. And yeah, I'll still go out to the bars and stuff, but I couldn't tell you the last time I got unbearably drunk. And you know, I do still, still smoke, but not as frequently as I used to. And it's always been something that's a little different for me, it's more social interaction and stuff. But you know I've, if I know I'm working Monday through Friday, you won't see me drinking or smoking, you know day prior throughout that week. And, right now, I've just been doing weekends. So, kind of hard to use mind-altering substance during school, like during the weekdays. And, during the weekends I just, something innate in me, like I have that discipline. 
AS: Yeah, you're able to regulate it?
CP: Yeah, yeah. And it's to the point now where I really don't even… like drinking is a chore. I feel old, for whatever reason. It was a little scary my sophomore year, and I kinda had to have my own talk with myself. Unfortunately I've seen different sorts of addictions, and they don't map out well. Especially drinking with my ma's side. 
AS: In your family? Oh yeah, yeah. 
CP: Yeah, I have people who… my uncles always said, you know, ""Red's gone. I'll step up."" Bullshit, you're not gonna step up. You're still drinking.
AS: Oh, he'll… oh 'cuz she died, he's gonna get clean? 
CP: Well, no. Not even necessarily. He doesn't think he has an issue. He just ""drinks.""
AS: He'll step up to be there for you?
CP: Yeah. And like, you know, trying to bring family closer: ""We'll do this on the weekend."" It's just bullshit. Like, he works a lot which I get. But, he likes to go to the bars, and drink as a hobby. I mean that's the activity. It's not anything else. I've been around for him. He's a large man. He's been up in the three hundreds. I've had to drag him around before… 
AS: Oh my gosh. 
CP: … or try! And it's just ugly stuff. And I have the two roommates right now, that are still going hard drinking. You know, Monday night, Wednesday, Tuesday… whatever it doesn't matter. Even after asking 'em not to. You know, whether it's for my sleep 'cuz the living room is right above my room. Or 'cuz... I, I tell 'em. I get, I get frustrated. And frustrated is probably a nice way to put it. Like, if you're drunk, and you're spouting… like I've dealt with that way too many times for me to want to put up with you. And so, yeah, mostly seeing a lot of stuff, and then being a part of some issues. After not being cognizant or what not, kinda led me to get away from it myself. Also, knowing that I was going in the field. 
AS: Yeah, your exposure. So when did you start being interested in working in… ?
CP: Like third grade. 
AS: In drug treatment? 
CP: Early, early. 
AS: Third grade?
CP: Promise, I promise. I always liked the idea of like, being a counselor and having like a really comfy chair. [Sullivan laughing]. But no, I knew my ma's therapist back then. And she, she was just like a badass lady. I still, I talked with her this week. It's Jan. But, she's an addictions counselor back in, back in Chicago. But she does all sorts of different therapies. Like family, and trauma, this and that. I actually saw her for a little while after, after my ma had passed. With the seven hundred dollars that I had gotten from social security, whatever it was. 
AS: Oh yeah, oh my gosh. That's what you got?
CP: Yeah. 
AS: From social security?
CP: I've been learning quick that there aren't… no one's gonna give you nothin' unless you build it, as far as money. 
AS: Yeah. 
CP: Yeah, so that was a nasty taste. But, yeah I saw her for a little while. And, I knew her prior. She had spoken at the funeral. Really, really enjoyed my ma. But yeah, I met her when we were young, and like saw her house. And I was like, ""This house is sweet."" And, she was cool. She was a little bit more like, hard-headed than other… what I had thought of counselors, you know? She was probably the only person that I knew would tell my ma, like different. Like you know, ""No you're wrong. Period."" 
AS: Oh instead of just listening, kind of placidly?
CP: Yeah. 
AS: Yeah. 
CP: No, she was about work. You know. Getting stuff done. 
AS: Figuring your stuff out. 
CP: Absolutely. And so, I liked that idea. And, I never really gotten away with it… or gotten away from it. I've always been good at the math. So I was like, also trying to flirt with the idea of like being an Econ major. I liked the idea of having lots of money. [Sullivan laughing]. But, I didn't really care about the work. But, I got away from that pretty, pretty quickly, so. 
AS: So, when did you start working in the sober living?
CP: So this is a year and five months. So, January of 2018. And yeah, I've pretty much worked every shift you could work over there. During the summer I was full-time. Well they sign me for full-time which is nice 'cuz of benefits and stuff. 
AS: Oh, so you're a full-time? You work full-time?
CP: Not currently, but they still keep me on so I can keep the benefits. 
AS: Oh, that's fantastic. 
CP: It's been sweet. Sweet to see things, like build. 
AS: And where is it that you work?
CP: Supportive Living Solutions. The recovery program has the Arrigoni Houses. So, Arrigoni East, and Arrigoni West. East is in Saint Paul, and West is in Minneapolis, like next to the U's ""frat bro."" Which is kind of funny. 
AS: Oh that is. 
CP: So, I work mostly at East, but you know I've been over to West. They put me on consistent schedules over there at times, and I fill in a lot. 
AS: So what do you do? What's your job?
CP: So, say I'm there during the day, during like business hours, along with like having to you know kinda oversee our clients, I'm also trying to recruit new ones, and build waitlists. But, currently what my shits have been is weekend mornings. And so that's more just, you know client focused and facility focused. Lot of it is, you know medication administration. Making sure the guys are taking their meds at the right time. Case management. I've got eight- I think eight right now- eight of the twenty-nine guys in there, will meet with me weekly to go over like what's going on, and cover some basics. You know: ""Eating? Sleeping? Feel alright? making your appointments? Do we need to make an appointment?"" Yada, yada. I oversee the accountability program. So, making sure the guys are taking care of their responsibilities in the house. Making sure that they're, you know, that their hygiene is fine. That they're washing their sheets once a week, and they're making their meetings that we require, and I guess just like general supervision. We don't offer program in the house. We have like a Tuesday night AA meeting, Thursday night NA meeting. But, some guest speakers on Monday sometimes. But by and large, like the guys are either going out and doing out-patient programs with Saint Joes, Meridian, or you know just making regular meetings on their own. We don't require that they do AA, NA. Really anything that's I guess self-help. So like therapy sessions count for outside meetings, meditations... although not, people don't really do it. What else, guys will go to Church on Sunday, some of 'em. But, yeah no it's been really cool. And like I've done a lot of different things. 
AS: Different jobs in that, with that business?
CP: Yeah I mean, one day I'll be you know trying to touch base with other service providers to see if they've got people that want to get in. Some nights I'll just show up, pass meds, really not doing much. If the guys are doing their house jobs I don't really have to do anything. 
AS: You don't do night shifts do you?
CP: I have. 
AS: You have? Oh okay. 
CP: Yeah. 
AS: Do you have to stay awake for those?
CP: No. 
AS: No. 
CP: No. 
AS: Just have to be in the house?
CP: I've had night shifts where I've slept for the five full hours. I've had 'em where I get waken up an hour after for whatever reason. And like, yeah. It's just so much variability. And, kinda learning just like what those service providers, like... it's a lot. It can be a lot. And unfortunately the system that we have in place now, not too many people are incentivised 'cuz you're not getting paid much. And so, you really rely on a couple of really good staffers. And that's what we've had over there. I've just tried to do my best to kind of pick up if there is slack on the weekends, try to pick up slack on the weekends. 
AS: And do you see the job as informing you about what you would want to do in the future? And what've you… what're you thinking about your future right now?
CP: It hasn't deterred me from wanting to do it. 
AS: Oh no, that wasn't my question. 
CP: Yeah… 
AS: But, sorry! I didn't know… 
CP: I think I don't want to stay in residential living. 
AS: Oh, okay. Right. It hasn't deterred you from addiction as a field to work in, but you don't... oh sorry.
CP: I still want to go get a degree at some point so I could find that comfortable chair. [Sullivan laughing]. 
AS: Get a… like another Psych degree? Or an MSW, or something?
CP: Some sort of degree that's gonna...  
AS: Counseling? 
CP: … allow me to counsel. Right now what I've been looking at is Masters in Social Work. Quick cheap way to get to counseling. And I do like the idea of you know resource allocation. But, still gotta do more research on that and I don't know. It's, it's tough because like I know when I leave here there's just like, there's certain things that I feel like I bring to the table 'cuz of lived experience. 
AS: Yeah.
CP: For example, we had a guy... They switched me from my Saturday, Sunday morning shifts to the evening shifts, so that my replacement could just kinda get used to it. And she's bright, and I'm glad that we got her. She's a certified social worker during the week, but no. That night shift that Saturday, or no, that Sunday. I'm supposed to get off at midnight. I didn't leave until 1:30, 1:45. I caught a dude smoking meth in the, in the bathroom. Yeah. And so, similar thing with my ma. I could hear that frickin' snore. And so, immediately I'm thinking I gotta... 
AS: A snore from meth?
CP: Yeah the dude, I'm guessing… I can't see behind the door, but… 
AS: Right. 
CP: You know, I was trying to close a window 'cuz we have a sensor on it. I got, armed the alarm. And, it's midnight. I'm trying to get out of this facility. And, yeah like couldn't get in that bathroom all night. And, I just figured like, bad timing, bad timing. Kept happening. But, I also knew that there was two dudes that I hadn't seen all day. And like, sometimes it's just like that. Other times, it's usually not. So, one of the guys got home. And I was like, ""Okay, whatever."" And, yeah so, my plan was to go shut that window, walk down the hall, make sure that dude had gotten home. I didn't even make it to his room 'cuz I, once I heard the snore, I was like ""Okay well, he's using in the bathroom, and he's fallen asleep."" And so I: [Mimics knocking sound]. Knocked on the door. ""Steph!"" I was like ""[unclear] Blah, blah, blah. Open up!"" And he goes, still snoring. [Mimics knocking sound]. I finally got him to wake up with the banging, 'cuz you know I was like, ""Dude I'm coming in."" Once I knew he was, wasn't just OD'd. You know he'd woken up, and I could hear him trying to talk to me again. I know he's scared, very scared. He's about to lose housing. And so I, and I'm mad 'cuz I wanna leave. I'm human, and I don't wanna be there dealing with this. But, I go yeah, I'm like, ""You got five seconds dude, I'm coming in. Make sure your pants are up. Whatever, I don't wanna see it."" And, he turns on the shower. And I was like, ""[Unclear]"" Okay, well that's fine. And so, instead of you know, going in there, and like pulling the dude out, I let him shower. I let him take the ten, fifteen minute shower. Sat by the stairs, played with the cat that we have. Waited for him to be done. Still hadn't came out after I heard the water was off, and I was like, okay I'm coming in. And so I came in, got him out, and it was a long process. Which it didn't have to be. I could have very easily let him shower, went and called the cab, had it ready, and shipped him off like right away. But… 
AS: Shipped him just to wherever? Just leave?
CP: The detox. Yeah. 
AS: Oh, the detox. Oh, okay. 
CP: 'Cuz if you're intoxicated in there you got two options. You got family or friends to come pick you up, or shipping you to detox. We just can't have you high in the facility. And I've had guys, you know high on meth, high, or drunk, or smoked out, or whatever, in there and you know I never had an instance where the guys, I felt that they were a danger to me or to the other guys in the house. Granted, still can't have you in there messing like... I don't want other guys to be urging or whatever. But, at the same time, I try to you know, still like allow some dignity to happen within the process. And so, I brought the client down, asked him questions I had to ask like: ""Are you intoxicated?"" ""Yes."" ""Were you smoking meth in the bathroom?"" ""No."" ""I really want you to be honest with me. Were you? ‘Cuz if you're not honest, it's bad."" And, I just, he wasn't able to give me that answer. We knew. And, later found his pipes or whatever. But, you know. I did more than just like, I couldn't be mad at him. The guy was, has a mental health issue. He's been out of meds, for you know a week or two. And, it's a pretty serious mental health condition. 
AS: He's been out of his medication?
CP: Yeah. 
AS: Why?
CP: Not taking it. 
AS: Oh. 
CP: Could be insurance, could be his own not wanting to take it. It was insurance. I did more follow up with it, and yeah he just hadn't gotten his card. But...
AS: So what happened?
CP: It's hard to say. 
AS: Is he still there?
CP: No. No he got discharged. Yeah, I mean it's a pretty clear rule from when you come in. You use in the facility, you got… we'll bring you back. You got ninety days, but we're not gonna bring you back right away. 
AS: You have ninety days what? To come back?
CP: Out of the facility to, you have to wait ninety days, if you got discharged. 
AS: Oh, oh I see. Because of drug use. 
CP: Yeah. But I mean guys relapse, and it's not an immediate discharge. We've brought a lot of guys back. We just try to preach, you know like honesty. Mostly honestly. That's really… if you tell us that you're relapsed, we'll work with you. Now if it's more frequent and stuff, maybe that bed is probably just better for someone who's a little bit more ready to work it. But, I mean that's always been my thing. You know, if there's people in the house using, we gotta get 'em out so that people who are ready to work the stuff can get here. And, even if they're using in the house, you know what I mean, this is probably the only place where they're not gonna be getting crazy chewed up by the people, and judged, and all that stuff, so it's like... I've had, I had another guy who was very high on meth. Call [unclear] Got him to admit. It's midday. But, I still let him go up to his room and pack. Still let him eat the meal with us. You know, supper, but make sure sure he gets something in his stomach before you know, you go sit in detox, or you go sit with this family member that like really doesn't want you in the house. So yeah. Just seeing the side of my ma, and like and I don't know sensing dejection that she received, all that stuff. I get that like it's a fricken' nuisance. Like, people being high is a nuisance. But, same time it's, you know there's a lot of other shit that goes on with it. Yeah, I just try to keep that in mind when I'm working. 
AS: They're people. 
CP: Yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. And so yeah, I don't wanna be disrespecting them any more than I would a regular person. Or someone without substance abuse problems. So. And that was another thing is that I've learned from it. I really like the field because unfortunately substance really doesn't discriminate. You can be wherever in life, and if you fall into a pattern or whatnot, it's a tough thing to get rid of. So. It's gonna be sad going, a little bit. 
AS: Leaving the work?
CP: Leaving the place, yeah. 
AS: When's your last day?
CP: Sunday night. 
AS: Oh!
CP: Yeah so I'm just hoping no one's smoking meth in the bathroom. [Sullivan laughing]. I'd be frickin mad. 
AS: Your wish for your last day at the job, on the job. 
CP: And, it's very infrequent. 
AS: Is meth the main thing that you… ?
CP: No, no. 
AS: Oh it's just everything. 
CP: Yeah. Yeah pretty much. I've had another guys in there. I had a guy my age in there for weed. You know if you're a weed smoker, then you start thinking about some things. 
AS: What do you mean? Oh if you are, because you are. 
CP: Yeah, I'm like, well it can be an issue. Yeah, yeah it could be an issue. 
AS: Right right. 
CP: Yada, yada. But, yeah it's, I don't know. It's been a crazy ride. And, I've enjoyed it. And, it's been challenging and easy at some days. I just hope that…  'cuz I do believe the Arigoni houses— especially East here in Saint Paul— is probably one of the best government funded programs, residential programs that you could get into. So, I just, I hope that the two main staff members don't get more overworked than they already are. And that they're able to stay. 'Cuz I know the guys benefit from it. And… 
AS: How many live there?
CP: Twenty-nine. 
AS: Wow!
CP: Yeah. And then, Minneapolis one is either thirty-one or thirty-two. So, yeah very rare to, like guys are using in the facility. But I mean, that does happen, and I've driven guys that we've discharged over to the next facility. Or, seen what that looks like. And I'm like, ""Shit."" Not where I would wanna be. 
AS: Right, right. 
CP: So yeah. 
AS: That's good. Anything else you wanna say?
CP: Can't think of nothing, no. 
AS: Thank you. It's really a pleasure. I'm really, I feel really fortunate to have had you in class, and to have you willing to talk about this. It's a hard topic, but I think you're… 
CP: No, no. 
AS: … I'm sure you're doing your mom proud. 
CP: Trying! [Petrich laughing]. Definitely trying. 
AS: Yeah. 
CP: Yeah. We'll continue it. Definitely continue it. 
AS: Thank you. "

Interviewer

Minneapolis, Minnesota
Kim Powers-KP
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan in my home in Minneapolis interviewing Kim Powers on July 5, 2016. Kim could you state your name and just say that you give me permission to record this interview?
KP: This is Kim Powers, and I give Amy complete permission to record this conversation.
AS: Thank you. Like I was saying before, could you just start by talking about your own childhood? Talk about your childhood and just some highlights from it. Where were you raised, your education, did you go to college, your career, how you had Shawn?
KP: Okay. I was born in Sioux City, Iowa. My dad was in the Air Force. We lived there like six months. It really doesn’t count. I was always embarrassed that I was born in Sioux City, Iowa. We moved to the Twin Cities, my parents and I. I was first born and we moved to Mendota Heights. I spent most of my early years, until I was about twelve, in Mendota Heights. Nice neighborhood, big yard, lots of close friends. That type of thing. My parents’ marriage was pretty rocky from the beginning. If I was to look at their parenting I would say that my mother was extremely distracted with what my dad was doing. She also lost her father, she lost a baby.
AS: After you?
KP: After me, yes. She had a child that was born with spina bifida that lived about six months and died at that point. I think emotionally she had a lot of trauma going on during that period of time. But with a two year old, you’re kind of left to fend for yourself, not a lot of conversation ever about what was happening or comfort in that. 
AS: Do you remember that?
KP: No, I can’t remember any of that. I would have been two. I think we were planned to be almost exactly two years apart. I’m a March baby, my sister’s April, and my brother’s May. It was planned in my dad’s mind. How crazy that is?
AS: A year apart, or more?
KP: Two years apart.
AS: Two years each, okay.
KP: Because of the loss of Dale, my brother, there was a gap. My sister is four years younger and then I have a brother that’s two years younger than her. I mean we had a lot of family friends; we did family ski vacations, and the cabin. Now Shawn is fourth generation of going to the cabin. It’s been in our family for a really long time. That was always a special place. My dad wasn’t very present. My mom was kind of the, she single parented in some regards because it turns out he had a whole other life outside of his marriage with someone else. 
AS: What did he do for a living after the Air Force?
KP: He was a stockbroker. A very matriarchal mother who kind of called all the shots in their marriage for a long period of time, from what I understand. Once he was independent when she died he gambled all that money away. There was a form of addiction in my family that I didn’t realize at the time, but absolutely he had a gambling addiction whether he’d admit it or not. It became extremely apparent through the rest of his life. He died this spring, he had nothing.
AS: Did they stay married?
KP: No, the divorce was when I was about twenty-five. They were married twenty-three years and not happily. Odd dynamics, no communication, but just nonverbal cues. I think between the three of us kids I think we would have wished they were divorced earlier because I don’t think we thought my mom was being treated fairly or respectfully.
AS: When did you find out about the affair? How old were you?
KP: Thirty-three when I found out. I went through college. I went to high school, graduated from college, moved to California after working for Dayton’s for a while, I was recruited out of college. I moved to California, I was there about seven years. Shawn was born when I was thirty-three, at the tail end of that period of time. She was not planned and I was not married to her father. We agreed it was one of those crazy, wild drunk nights that she was conceived. Our relationship was kind of on and off. I found out right after Thanksgiving. We decided that we financially…We were not going to get married. 
I looked at this very much as going into it as a single parent. I mean, I felt like I had a choice whether to have the child if I was ready or to abort the pregnancy. We both were on the same page. She was born in July of 1990. She’s almost twenty-six. We decided at that point to get married. We were going to move to Minnesota. His family, there’s addiction in his family. He has two nieces that have gone through severe heroin addiction. They’re now clean. Both of them are clean for a period of time. You know it’s odd because I don’t know if you interview your perspective husband about all the family dynamics, in illness and mental illness. I would have never even have thought about doing that. There was a lot of craziness on his side of the family.
AS: Romance kind of rules.
KP: It does, it overrides. We were going to move to Minnesota. We came back, we planned a wedding. I called it off the night before. It just wasn’t the right reason to get married. Having a child in our lives was not the right reason to get married.
AS: She was born by this point?
KP: She was born in July; this was December.
AS: The December after she was born?
KP: Yes. His friends were outrageous at the groom’s dinner. They were drunk; they were talking about taking him out to get him laid at the strip clubs in front of my grandparents and my family. I just kind of went, “He’s got no spine. I can’t have a father,” which relates to my own father, “in Shawn’s life that’s not going…” It was not the right reason. They were toasting to, “Oh my parents got married because of the kid.” All these other things and I called it off the night before. No regrets, but drama.
AS: That is really strong of you.
KP: It was. I had so much support after. I just felt crazy at the time. It was a really good 
decision. It was a higher power situation.
AS: You also were not in your teens or your twenties. You were thirty-three. 
KP: I had a career, I travelled. Exactly.
AS: It wasn’t 1960. 
KP: Anyways, Shawn and I, after that, moved to Minnesota to be with my family. I was a single mom; my parents helped tremendously. The family dynamic was great. I went back to work probably when she was close to nine months to a year. I had that time with her. I was pretty traumatized by the calling off of the wedding. I was pretty distressed during that period of time. 
Her childhood was good. We moved into a townhome, she had lots of friends. She was happy, really very curious about everything, details and people. She’d remember things. A happy kid. I remember someone telling me that if you have a happy kid you’re going to have a hell of a teenager. Seriously, I do remember. I’ve never forgotten. I’ve never forgotten that statement.
AS: What a terrible thing to say.
KP: I know. Does it set you up? Then you mentally start thinking that way. I’ve never forgotten it. She had a lot of anxiety. She used to have tremendous anxiety about public bathrooms. She also had anxiety, every time we’d get in the car she’d have to pee. Wherever we were we had to find a bathroom. The grocery store, Walgreens, a coffee shop, whatever. It was a really odd kind of social anxiety maybe. When I talk about that now, that’s definitely what’s going on right now. Tremendous amount of recovery. Or maybe I’m figuring that out, or she’s just starting to feel again. I think that’s true. It’s certainly not easy going through the sober aspect. I’m not sure she’s clean. I question that, some of the behaviors and stuff. They just feel too familiar. 
AS: Talk about her as a teenager and you as a mom. So you’re working full-time, here in the Cities?
KP: Yes. When she was in elementary we lived in Minnetonka. I bought a house in Minnetonka, a great neighborhood. It was all about creating an environment where she would be healthy and have friends. A good neighborhood, she was happy and active and everything through middle school, I mean grade school. I met somebody and I got married. His name was Kevin and we moved from Minnetonka, which is where we were really grounded—that was a mistake in my mind—we moved to Mahtomedi as she was going into middle school. 
She inherited two step-brothers. I think they were ten, eleven, and twelve at the time. She was in the middle, two boys. They did not get along for a long time. My husband’s ex-wife was very angry that he got married to somebody that had a daughter. Just as Shawn was going into middle school, that exact transitional time. I think uprooting her at that point and my… I think I remember packing in our house in Minnetonka and saying, “I wonder when I’m ever going to come out of this box. Where is Kim going? How is this going to work? We’ve been so happy here, going through this transition.” We moved into a very volatile situation, ex-wife showing up at the house. The boys, whenever Kevin would try to discipline them, called the police. A lot of drama around that.
AS: They would call the police on their father?
KP: Yes. He cared so much about them. He had them fifty percent of the time. Anytime he did something or raised his voice or whatever they would call the police. Or they’d call their mom. It was unpleasant. When she had a man in her life it was a little bit easier, but they were jealous of Shawn. They thought she was spoiled rotten.
AS: The boys were?
KP: Yes. We had a beautiful home with a pool. She had a great group of friends, popular, well-liked. She was playing hockey then. She was on the hockey team. They didn’t like any of that for quite a while. Until I got to a point where we had some dialogue. I just said, “I’m not your mom. I don’t want to be your mom. You think I spoil Shawn, I’ll spoil you too if you let me. I’d rather be your friend.” I never liked the term step-mom. It had negative connotations for me. 
During that period of time Shawn started hanging out with some more kind of bad boy types. People that were getting in trouble, not doing well in school, shooting paintballs at somebody, or throwing toilet paper in the school, things like that. 
There was a transition that happened during that period of time. Kevin and I, we weren’t married very long, it was less than three years. Shawn and I stayed in Mahtomedi, moved into a neighborhood close by. That transitional time seems to be a huge change. What I pinpoint, she doesn’t agree with that. She doesn’t think it’s the divorce, the moving into a smaller house. It was less prestigious; people didn’t hang out as much because we didn’t have a pool. 
AS: That didn’t bother her?
KP: She says it doesn’t. I think it did. It just really—there was a big shift. 
AS: At the time you saw that it did.
KP: I felt it. Her behavior started changing. She told me several years later—we were at the cabin—she said that she was accused of being a lesbian by some of the girls that she hung out with. She said one night the girls got together. You know I always had a house full of kids. I always wanted to be the mom with the neighborhood hanging out. I didn’t have that as much. I really wanted that. She always had friends overnight. I encouraged all of that. I was probably not the greatest disciplinarian. You want to go toilet paper? Go for it. It seemed very harmless to me. I wasn’t very good at holding the line either if I was upset about something or, “You’re grounded.” This was true in the dynamic with my parents also. My dad would say, “You’re grounded.” My mom would say, “Here are the car keys.” There was never that cohesiveness between parents giving the same message that we’re backing each other up. 
She kind of started, she told me later that there were a group of women, a group of young women, girls together one night and they were practicing kissing. They swore to each other, “Nobody’s going to tell anybody about this.” It was just like what’s it like and what do you do? That type of thing. Then one of them accused her to many of the people at school that she was a lesbian. They treated her differently on her hockey team. I don’t know if Shawn created this as a fantasy or if it was reality. She told me, many years later, that changed who she was, how people reacted to her at school. She didn’t have the same group of friends. She was kind of an outcast at that point. The boys, on the other hand, she always liked boys. They knew completely differently that she wasn’t… It was the girls, that catty, hurtful dynamic that happened. I think the first time she partied she was at a home and I called. I was one of these, “Talk to the parents, are they going to be home, no alcohol, no drugs.” I get a phone call. They say, “She’s vomiting. She’s so drunk.”
AS: The parents called you?
KP: Yes, they were home. “She doesn’t have her bra. She doesn’t know where it went. Can you come get her?” I’m like, “Number one I called. Number two you were there. How could this have possibly happened? Weren’t you aware of that house party going on with a bunch of young kids?” Her first drinking experience that I knew about she ended up in the hospital.
AS: How old was she?
KP: She would have been thirteen. 
AS: Thirteen or fourteen?
KP: Yes, right in early middle school. She said, “I’m going to die.” She was so sick. I said, “Do you think I should take you to the hospital?” I didn’t know. I thought she might have alcohol poisoning or something. So I took her. They never reported it, which they’re supposed to do to the school, to her hockey coach, all these things. They never reported it to anybody. The medical staff didn’t. She kind of got away with that to a certain point. It just started snowballing after that. 
AS: Even after being so sick she went right back to it.
KP: Yes. I’d gone out of town to Austin, Texas to go to a concert. I dated. I really tried to keep a balance between work, home life, and parenting. I wasn’t one of these, “I can’t leave and do anything else just because I’m a mom.” I travelled quite a bit for work. We had nannies and we had family and she had daycare, all these things to cover. When I went to this particular venue and I was gone and I got a phone call because my neighbors were watching our dogs and walking over to the house and things. They walked up and there’s a huge house party going on. She was supposedly staying with another family for the weekend. They knew I was out of town. It was like homecoming weekend.
AS: What was your relationship with other parents? It sounds like you weren’t supported by other parents or that there wasn’t…
KP: A network?
AS: Yes, there wasn’t a watching out for. You thought you had done what you needed to do.
KP: Right. In that instance that did not pan out that way. I would say I had, because of the hockey, I was surrounded by parents all the time, other moms. We were really connected. We watched over each other’s kids. A lot of, “Oh she did this.” It was there but I think there’s some acceptance. “They’re kids; they’re just going to experiment.” We didn’t allow drinking in our homes or some of that, “Oh they can drink and I’m going to take the keys.”
AS: She and her friend probably told those parents they were going to someone else’s house.
KP: They didn’t follow up or whatever. Word got out. College kids were home for homecoming. This is high school now. I get a phone call from my friends who are watching the house saying, “They won’t even let us in the house. We don’t own it.” They knew the whole drill, these kids. “You can’t come in, you don’t live here. You don’t have permission to come into the house.” They even said that the police could not enter my home. I called them. Without my permission to go in and raid this party and get everybody out of my house. 
AS: So did you do that?
KP: Oh, yes. I was kind of hesitant to pull in other resources. I got on a plane and came back right away. It was a mess. My sister had gone over and cleaned the house but it was trashed. They got minors for that because they were drinking underage. They had to go to a class. None of it ever made any impact. It just continued. When I look back on my childhood, I mean I partied too. My parents weren’t that aware, but it was never to the point where you get in trouble with the police. We’d hang out as a group. It was very much more innocent. I don’t think the drugs or the drinking was as prominent either. It was just a little here, a little there. The drinking was always guzzling with them. I don’t know if Maddie is like this. Could she sit down and just have a glass of wine? Do you know what I mean? That generation didn’t drink that way. They drank to get drunk. 
AS: The binge movement. We can call it that.
KP: I did feel support. I felt some judgement from my own mom. I always felt like it was my fault. I was made to feel, “How could she have done that? Where were you?”
AS: Right. Why weren’t you there?
KP: Right.
AS: By this point had you divorced Kevin?
KP: Yes. I was a single mom at that point. 
AS: What goes on? Her addiction, her substance abuse just keeps going?
KP: I would say it started with the alcohol. She never liked weed or smoking pot I guess. I know some of that was involved. I think she was into Adderall. Adderall was probably the first drug that was introduced. They were selling it in middle school. She really liked it. Maybe at that point it was something that could have been recommended from a physician because of anxiety. I just don’t remember her…
AS: That would be more for ADD wouldn’t it?
KP: Right. When she was in grade school at one point she had a teacher, one teacher, the bad teacher that you never liked. There’s always one witchy teacher. She walked by me in the hall one day and said, “She’s got ADHD you need to get her tested.” I did. It really threw me for a loop. They said she was borderline. They didn’t feel that she needed any medication or therapy or anything. 
AS: She liked the feeling of the speed of Adderall.
KP: Which is interesting because she doesn’t like meth. They’re one molecule, according to her, there’s one molecule between Adderall and meth. That’s it. It’s that close.
AS: I did not know that. So what happens through high school? 
KP: She was flunking out of classes, hanging with the wrong people, sneaking out at night, all that, all the dynamics. Her friends changed, who she was hanging with, a couple years older, not necessarily her school district. It was scary for me. I thought she was really mixing with the wrong people. How do you stop it? You’re not really in control of every single person that they see after school or their friends. 
AS: Or how they meet people.
KP: I felt pretty helpless at certain points during that. I felt she was spinning out of control in some ways. She and I weren’t getting along because I was trying to set rules. She’s just like, “I don’t have to listen to you.” I sent her to California to her dad’s. Her dad lives in the LA area. He had been active in her life from the time we split, when I called off the wedding. He was active. He’d see her. He’d come to Minnesota when she was an infant all the way through childhood, every three to four months. They’d go stay in a hotel. He was very consistent with child support until he got married. Then she started to go see him when she was about five. She started flying to California when she was about five. He got married in that time. It really changed a lot. She would call. She wasn’t very nice to Shawn when she was there. She had to sleep on a cot in another room. She wanted Marty to do paternity testing because she didn’t know for sure. They look so much alike. I was going through that. Shawn wasn’t aware of it. They called her Montessori [school] and said, “How much is Kim paying for child support?” That was sad. He’d always been very consistent and loving. 
As she started acting out in high school I called him. We were in touch and I said, “I can’t manage it. She’s out of control. She’s failing classes. I think she should come be with you for a while.” So she went to California, enrolled in high school for a year, partied a lot. He was a ruthless disciplinarian, to the point of being mean, not physically. He’d belittle her a lot for, “You don’t pick up your bowl of cereal.” He’d dump it on the floor. It was a really tight ship. She couldn’t see people except at school. She was still partying there. I think she was there about six months. Five to six months. Then he called me and she’d run away, Friday night in Los Angeles. He had no idea where she was.
AS: She probably doesn’t have a cell phone at this point?
KP: She had a cell phone. She called me. She’s like, “I’m not going back. I’m with friends.” It was terrifying. He called the police and nobody can track her down. It was like a twenty-four hour period where she was talking to me. I knew she was okay. She would not connect with him. That ended that whole California experience. She barely made it through high school. She ended up in like a specialized program for kids that were struggling in another building. She excelled. She was always a good student, but she just didn’t care. She didn’t apply herself. She was like, “What for? I can do this.” High school that was kind of the catalyst. She took a year off, a gap year in between because she didn’t know what she wanted to do. I was really paranoid about investing all this money. She wanted to go to Portland, Oregon to college. 
AS: Portland State?
KP: Yes. She moved in with a guy and his family who was an addict for sure. 
AS: So she didn’t go to Portland?
KP: No, this was the year in between. She did end up in Portland. She moved out on Mother’s Day. She said, “I’m moving in with so-and-so.” I could not stand him. His family, they allowed her to move in with him. She was nineteen at the time, eighteen to nineteen, and lived in the Cities. She called. I knew it was rocky.
AS: Here you mean? She’s here; she’s not in Portland yet
KP: She’s still in the Cities; it was that year in between. She called me. He’d overdosed on heroin. I assume it was heroin. She just said he’d overdosed and she experienced it. She’d never seen anything like it before. She wanted to move out. She came back. 
AS: Was he alive? Did he live through it?
KP: Yes. Can I use your bathroom? Pause!
[Break in Recording].
KP: She’d always wanted to go to Portland. My best friend who’s her godmother lived in Portland. We’d spent quite a bit of time there. To me it’s marvelous, but really drug loaded. I did not know at the time. She ended up going to college, was excited, and got her apartment downtown. She didn’t want to live in a dorm. Stupid!
AS: So many parallels.
KP: Really? Oh my God! Just like set up, Ikea, painting—it was just all set up. It was fabulous. By herself, she didn’t want a roommate. I don’t know how much she went to class. I think she was good for a while. I was very resentful; it’s caused a lot of conflict with my best friend from high school. We’ve gone our separate ways because she just didn’t play a part. She was there. Did she ever invite her over for dinner? Did she kind of monitor her and stuff? I really am kind of angry about that. It wasn’t her job either. It just continued into the whole heroin. 
AS: You think that’s when she started using? It was in Portland not before?
KP: I think she tried it right before. I think she’d been exposed to it before. I don’t think she’d injected it probably. I think she’d been exposed. It just went from the Adderall to the drinking, or the drinking and the Adderall. I think she’d experimented with other things at one point. I don’t know opiates for sure. She talks about Oxy being a big, big influence. That was kind of the gateway for her, in her opinion. That got her into the heroin. It’s the same story that we hear. I thought heroin was… She was so paranoid about needles, doctors, any blood, anything like that. I would never have imagined. It was readily available in Portland. One of my friend’s sons that she had met when we were out there skiing one time turned her onto it. That was it. She was hooked, immediately. 
She came home for Christmas. I didn’t sense that she was really in trouble. She was around and hanging out with family and everything. January she called me and she said, “I’m in a hotel bathtub in Seattle with some other people, they are in the other room and they have no idea. I’m trying to detox from heroin. Will you come get me?” That was my first.
AS: They have no idea what? 
KP: That she was detoxing. She said she was partying with them but she was doing it individually and they didn’t know. Whether that’s true or not I don’t know. I said, “No I won’t come get you, but I’ll get you a plane ticket. Go to the airport and I’ll come get you in Minneapolis.” I took her to Fairview. My sister and I went and picked her up, took her Fairview and said, “She wants to detox. What’s the process?” She had dropped her classes; she had no insurance because she had dropped her classes. They said, “$5,000 and she can stay for three days to detox. You just have to give us the cash, write us a check.” I didn’t really have $5,000 at that point. I said, “Will she die?” 
I didn’t know anything about it, nothing. I went online when I got the phone call from her, from the time she was flying home. It was all terrifying. I thought, “She’s going to die.” What is detox? What is that about? What do you do? They said, “She won’t die from it. Alcohol detox is the worst and she could die from alcohol detox. She won’t die. She’ll be really uncomfortable. You could take her home and then put her in treatment.” That’s what I did. That was my first exposure to the restless legs and the vomiting and the sweating and all that. She went through that for a couple of days. She went to the retreat from there. I think it was three days, three or four days before she could go in.
AS: Is she twenty now?
KP: Yes. She went through The Retreat. It was very alcohol oriented at that point. They weren’t really addressing other drugs then. She stayed. It was the first treatment that she completed until this past year. She stayed, she went through it, and she liked it. She went into sober living; they didn’t think she was working the steps. It was all Twelve-Step. She didn’t buy in, she didn’t like it. They just didn’t work for her. She did not buy into it. Higher power is just something she can’t relate to or fathom or, “What is that? What shape does that take?” It was too religious oriented for her mind, too God focused. She just didn’t buy in. They were like, “We want her in sober living, but she’s not done a third step, or fourth step.” So she wouldn’t go. It was the thirty-day program, or twenty-eight day program. She went into sober living. She made it thirty days and she drank one night. They kicked her out. She came home. 
I was married to Bruce then. Bruce, when she went to Portland, in his mind she’s gone. “I have Kim to myself finally.” She was fifteen when we met. We didn’t get married right away. He felt she was out of control and very judgmental, didn’t relate. He was just pissed about the whole thing. “My friend’s kids don’t have any problems. Why are we going through this?” She went to college and out of sight, out of mind. Now, she’ll be fine. Well it didn’t happen. She was back. It was very difficult on my marriage. It’s a big part why it didn’t last, a lot of anger on his part, a lot of hate. He’s not an angry guy, particularly, but he just wanted me. He wanted her to be normal, whatever that meant. He just couldn’t control it, which is big. He didn’t know how to handle it watching me go through this dynamic of this addict in and out of our lives. Setting her up in an apartment and then losing the apartment because she wouldn’t pay rent, losing jobs, and cars being impounded. I was just enabling all that. I was just trying to think. She couldn’t make her rent. I’d write a check. 
AS: Did you see that as enabling at the time?
KP: No. I didn’t know what that meant. I was trying to do everything that I possibly could to get her life to be normal. She’s in trouble because she couldn’t pay rent, things will even out. It was just a downward spiral, it went on for years until I went to Nar-Anon. It really changed it. I was desperate. She stole from us.
AS: She’s back in your house?
KP: In and out. She’s in an apartment, she’s got a job, but that’s when the heroin got really bad. 
AS: Here she got an apartment and job?
KP: Yes, she was back here at that point. When she flew back from Portland she was back here. 
AS: But moved out of your house to her own apartment. So you set her up again, she got a job, then she relapses.
KP: I think she was using the whole time, either alcohol or heroin at that point. She couldn’t keep any job or any living situation for periods of time. If you were to ask Shawn she says that she got involved with this guy named Troy who she knew in high school. She’d always had a fascination and a crush on him. He had been through treatment for alcohol, gambling addiction, but he had a son and he was living with his mom. He was working and he didn’t associate with anybody. I think he got caught up in her lifestyle. I think she influenced, or has gotten many people involved in heroin versus the other way around. 
AS: So he got involved with heroin?
KP: Yes, lost custody of his son. His mom was kind of crazy, but he got involved with the law and gambling. They were hanging out at the casinos. He would win. She said he’d win all this money. They’d be in a hotel, a lot of drug dealing at Mystic [Lake Casino]. I had no control over any of it. At that point she was twenty-one, she was an adult, and she could do whatever she wanted to. You try. You try to have hope. You try to influence. You try to come home; this really isn’t a healthy relationship. That was the only thing she really cared about, was being high. 
Bruce, we had talked about splitting up. He had so much resentment toward her. We had a conversation with some friends of ours. This was 2014 January, and we had a dinner with her and her boyfriend and said, “We’re going to put it all behind us.” He was going to forgive her and try to move on from his resentment. I was going to be less enabling. We’d gotten some really good guidance from a couple that we knew well. “Troy, we accept you.” They stayed overnight. They stole from us the next morning. It was all planned. We had a lockbox that was hidden. We had the key to the lockbox that was hidden. It had obviously been staged well ahead of time. 
AS: So you mean they were going to steal that stuff?
KP: Oh yes, they knew where everything was. They knew where the key was. They’d gone in the lockbox. They took my jewelry. I went to work. They’d stayed overnight. That was it in terms of her living with us. She was out. 
AS: You’ve told me before that she was on methadone. Was that before 2014? Can you talk 
about when that happened?
KP: After The Retreat and getting kicked out of sober living she was seeing a therapist, or had gotten some counseling through The Retreat. She was connected to somebody through sober living. This person said, “Okay, I think she should go to treatment again for alcohol. I think that based on the heroin use and addiction that methadone might not be a bad idea.” She went to treatment. She did go to treatment in Meadow Creek, which is up near Pine City. She stayed there, she’s been there twice, and she stayed there almost through the whole program. Again a twenty-eight day program, which I feel is never long enough. She was connected based on the therapy there; they put her in a methadone program when she left there. That was the next step. 
She went to Valhalla Place in Woodbury for three and a half years. She was on methadone. She did pretty well. She worked, she had a car. That was kind of in between. That gap between 2014. It worked. She had an amazing, amazing counselor who I felt was a God gift in her life. She was very, very bonded with him, and spent hours talking to him. He talked to me, we would go in together. He talked to her boyfriend of the day. He was very involved. Bruce got laid off his job, which meant no private insurance. She had to pay for methadone, which was very expensive. I covered it at that point, she couldn’t make it. She couldn’t pay for it. 
AS: She couldn’t go on MA [medical assistance]?
KP: I don’t know if we knew about it then. So Rick left the clinic.
AS: The therapist?
KP: Yes, and went into private practice. She lost insurance and couldn’t cover the cost of the methadone at that point. She relapsed right after that. She relapsed, she was at about thirty milligrams. She was like one fifty or one sixty.
AS: At the beginning?
KP: Well they ramped her up to that point. I don’t know what her max was. She’s on thirty now and it’s not enough. They want her to go up more. 
AS: You said before, you don’t have to answer this, but that you had felt pressure from your family or other people were pressuring her to quit the methadone even though it was working. Can you talk about that? Was that before the insurance problem?
KP: It was before. When she was taking it the family dynamic, my family dynamic—me included—was, “It’s a narcotic.” We heard all about the detox and how horrible it was and how was it affecting her as a person, a lot of pressure. I was kind of brought up in that whole idea. Rick was completely against her going off of it. We were like, “She needs to get off this. It’s another drug. What’s the difference if she’s on heroin or she’s on something like this?” There was a lot of family pressure to get her off. It was a mistake. If I look back now, if I knew what I knew today about how it stabilized her, I would never. That’s when she started using, she relapsed. She hadn’t used in three and a half years. There is a gap period in this whole thing until she was like twenty-six when she wasn’t using. She was drinking.
AS: Like three years.
KP: She drank during that period of time. She went to treatment for alcohol. 
AS: While she was even on methadone?
KP: She was living with a boyfriend who was an alcoholic. It was very, not violent, but it was a lot of police involvement and a lot of drama. She’s definitely an alcoholic on top of it. I think if she had kept that out of the picture she was doing okay. She was pretty stable on methadone. So that was a mistake. We didn’t know. It was, “What’s methadone?”
AS: It had such a bad reputation even just a few years ago; it still has a bad reputation.
KP: But it’s highly prescribed now. She needs it. After coming off methadone she said she would never take it again. She had no idea how drugged that she felt. 
AS: Three years ago? But now?
KP: She didn’t want to go on methadone again, but she was court ordered to go on methadone now. She went to jail. She’s been in jail three times. She’s been in the workhouse twice. 
AS: In jail for possession?
KP: Nothing related to heroin. She got a DWI. She didn’t go to court. She didn’t show up for her court date. It manifested itself into a warrant and some jail time. It was all based on a DWI. Never possession, never been picked up for heroin. I implanted a lot of that though into the system with probation officers and all this.
AS: What do you mean you implanted it?
KP: I gave them a lot of information about her use and that she really needed help. That she needed treatment. It was not alcohol necessarily even though that’s what she got picked up for.
AS: So you would intervene at the moment where she got picked up and you would call? Tell me what you would do.
KP: She had a probation officer. The first probation officer and I would communicate back and forth when she’d get picked up. She got picked up the first time, went into the workhouse. We talked quite a bit during that period of time about it’s not only alcohol. She’s going to die if she stays out there on the street. When they stole from us, when she and Troy stole from us, she was out of the house, she was done. She was home once after that for about two years. 
AS: Did you call the police on her at that point?
KP: Yes. They were gone, but we reported it. It was about $16,000, $18,000 worth of things that they had taken. 
AS: Did you ever get any of it back?
KP: I recently got a check, a $10,000 check from my insurance company, within the last month. It’s been two years. It was two years in January. We didn’t report it to Home Owners Insurance because we thought we wanted restitution from them. We wanted them to be punished, not punished. They were so messed up. They were so fucked up at the time. We thought they were going to die. They were living on the streets. Shawn was held at gunpoint. Who knows what she did for drugs. She had no job, no money. I didn’t give her anything for those two years. I’d meet with her in the car every once and awhile. It was a scary group of people and the places that she was living were just ratty. It felt like it couldn’t have gotten any worse. She was having people die in her life. She had somebody die in her arms. I thought that would turn it around. It didn’t. It’s like a trigger. Anyways, do you want me to go back? [Speaks to cat]. 
AS: I’m just thinking about that. Is that when you started coming to Nar-Anon?
KP: I started coming to Nar-Anon after I kicked her out. Bruce was unhappy and the law was involved. I just felt I had nowhere to go. I was not getting any support at home from Bruce. She’d call in the middle of the night. She wouldn’t know where she was. “Come and get me.” 
AS: But she wouldn’t know where she was?
KP: She wouldn’t know where she was. She’d go on these… I just kept thinking if I don’t respond and if I never did anything, I’ll never be able to live with myself. I’d go look for her in Uptown. I’d drive in the middle of the night up and down the street looking for her. Hiawatha area was the worst. 
AS: How many times did this happen?
KP: Phone calls like that? Regularly. You go through periods of no contact.
AS: This was after you said you hit your bottom with her, which was when they robbed you? This is after?
KP: That was really then.
AS: You hit your bottom where you said, “You can’t be in our house.” That’s what you meant by that?
KP: It didn’t mean I disconnected from her or detached from her completely. 
AS: So you stayed in touch with her through this dark time?
KP: I called when I knew there was a warrant out. My dad was in the VA Hospital. We thought he wasn’t going to live. I had her come to the hospital and I arranged with security guards at the front desk when she came in to arrest her. I did. My sister and I had this whole plan. She’s going to go up. 
AS: You’re going to tell her that her grandpa is dying, which he was.
KP: He was really sick. He was. I said, “I think you should come to see him.” I talked to the security guards, there was a warrant out for her arrest and could they arrest her. I had no idea where she was at that point. I’d see her. She’d meet me at Kowalski’s in Uptown sometimes. I didn’t know where she was living, who she was with. She was moving all the time and she had abscesses. She looked so incredibly like she was going to die. She’d call and say, “I’m being held at gunpoint” then she’d hang up. “I’m in this horrible place. I’m afraid of these people, they’re really dangerous,” and then she’d hang up. I had no idea where she was.
AS: What would you do? What would you do at this point, just get in your car?
KP: You kind of build this little network of people that she knows. I had phone numbers. “Do you know where she is or who she’s with?” “Oh, I think she’s here.” “I haven’t seen her for a couple weeks.”
AS: What was that like on your psyche and your body? I know how it is, but I need you to say it.
KP: I was sick. I was physically ill. I was losing weight. I wasn’t sleeping. I was on this hunt, almost this feeling of what little piece of information can I get to go find her? Will she leave with me if I find her? I would find her. She didn’t want to go. “No, these are my people.” She’d be so fucked up. There were years like those two and a half years from the point where we kicked her out to the point to her getting arrested. Well, what happened at the VA, she gave them a false name when she checked in. They didn’t know it was her, gave them another name. She could work the system. 
AS: She knew what you were probably going to do. 
KP: Anything to do with police, security, anything like that. She walks in to this waiting room in the ER. My sister and I are looking like, “How the hell did she get in here?” This security guard comes walking down the hallway, “Do you know what your mother tried to do? She tried to have you arrested.” Yes! Shawn was horrified. She was so mad. She just walked out. There was a police car that had been notified that was waiting outside when she went out there. They arrested her on the spot. She was so mad at me. I’ve done it twice now.
AS: You’ve done this same thing?
KP: I had her arrested in Minnetonka. She got arrested, went into Hennepin, ended up at the workhouse because of her warrant. Pissed at me, angry, but she was there for three weeks probably. Then they let her out. Somebody picked her up. She didn’t even let me know when she was getting out. A friend picked her up. She just went right back out and did the same thing. 
She could have gone to Hazleton at that time. “I’m just going to go see my friends to say goodbye.” This was always the drill. “I need to go say goodbye to everybody.” Did you ever hear that? “Just go say goodbye, nothing’s going to happen. I’ll be back.” She went into treatment a couple times, several times. She’d go in, I’d beg her to go in, she’d go in to Fairview, she’d detox for a couple days and then leave. She’d go into treatment, they’d recommend treatment, she’d stay for two or three days and she was gone. She went to Hazleton twice, stayed for three days. She never even got into the program. She used in my car in the Hazleton parking lot the night she was going in. I knew it. She’s like, “One more. I’m going to be so sick, just one more time.” Did you ever buy drugs for your daughter?
AS: No. 
KP: I’m sure I’ve financed so much of that over the years. 
AS: I mean I don’t know. I didn’t actually physically buy them.
KP: Oh no, I never did either. Suboxone—I never was involved in any transaction.
AS: No, no. I’m sure the cash.
KP: Ann [Perry] will tell you stories like that.
AS: I’m sure the cash that I handed over for jobs around the house. 
What can you say about your mothering? What can you say about addiction and mothering? Are there things you’ve learned?
KP: I don’t know how they could possibly go hand in hand at times because you question your sanity. I question my sanity. I beat myself up for a long, long time about what I did wrong. I wasn’t around enough or I didn’t monitor her enough or I wasn’t a disciplinarian, I didn’t catch it early enough. My mom who’s so judgmental about everything that I did. She loves Shawn, it’s her first grandchild, and she does. It was just like, “You can’t put her back on the street. She can’t be home.” It was just this constant questioning of your own mind of what you were doing right and what you were doing wrong. 
I think when it comes to mothering an addict, it’s a loaded question. To me mothering is supportive and nurturing and caring and non-judgement and respect and patience. I’ve been so challenged in that regard. I felt that way this weekend. I felt like I was on the opposite end of the spectrum. Unless I’m spiritually fit or involved in prayer or reading or meditation or just being connected. Nature does that for me, work does that for me. I have a real hard time staying grounded in that regard. Just being supportive and letting her do her own thing because I just feel like it’s going back down, it’s starting to spiral. The definition of mothering that’s what gets flipped. 
AS: To where you say, “That’s not mothering what I’m doing. I’m doing the opposite.” Is that to survive?
KP: Yes, I think so. It’s just to stay sane. I get angry and I get frustrated. I have been going through a period of my divorce of loneliness and starting to navigate life solo.
AS: Because you and Bruce just got divorced?
KP: Right. Her living with me has been positive at times but she has a boyfriend now. He’s there all the time. I can’t do it in a small space. I feel like I’m taking care of two other people. I’ve set boundaries around it. I’ve told them that he just can’t be there. He’s not working and he’s floating. I don’t know. He’s supposedly clean for three years. He told me recently that Shawn’s been using. He’s been using. He’s got diabetes and he’s been asking for his needles. I don’t know what’s true or not. Were they in a fight? Is it that he’s trying to get her in trouble or he’s trying to get away from her? I think they both know that they shouldn’t be together. It’s in my home and it’s in my space. I don’t think we should be living together. I can’t, I can’t do it. I told her today. We went to the cabin. I’ve set this boundary and I haven’t kept it. My mind—it’s that mind chatter that says, “Okay, she goes out there. What are the chances of her not relapsing?” At least she’s got a roof over her head. She didn’t for years. 
AS: But she’s using.
KP: I don’t know.
AS: You don’t know, right. So the unknown—no matter if she’s in your house or not in your house—is still there.
KP: It’s that constant. At least she’s living somewhere and she’s in treatment. 
AS: Oh, she is?
KP: Yes, she’s at New Way every day, in outpatient.
AS: They’re drug testing her, right?
KP: I think so. She’s on methadone. 
AS: She’s staying on it?
KP: She’s still on methadone. 
AS: So what are you doubting?
KP: She’s not working a program.
AS: Even though she’s going to outpatient?
KP: I don’t know. I don’t see any change in her behavior. It feels like using behavior is starting over again.
AS: So you saw a change. 
KP: We went to a cabin, and they slept for three days. They didn’t do anything the whole time we were up there. That’s what scares me. They’re swearing it’s nothing. How can you possibly sleep for three days and three nights? We were kayaking once, they didn’t go to town, they didn’t go fishing, and they didn’t do anything. They slept. They did it Memorial Day, same thing. It doesn’t feel right. [long pause] That’s what’s bugging me. 
AS: That feeling, that familiar feeling that you’ve had many times in the past when you’ve 
known things. 
KP: My gut’s usually been accurate. Trust your gut. It’s usually really accurate. I’ve got strong intuition about things. It doesn’t feel good.
AS: You know what it’s like to live with active addiction and deception, which is part of the addiction, is the deception and lying.
KP: And lack of motivation.
AS: Does she have a job?
KP: No. 
AS: What did she say today when you said, “This isn’t working out.”
KP: For the first time she said she was going to call Greg about sober living. She’s said it a million times before. I think she’s got that one foot in, one foot out. The feelings that come up for me, the anger, which I’ve been working on and trying to be more compassionate and understanding and knowing that even if you’re in recovery it’s really tough. It takes a while. It’s a whole different dynamic. 
AS: It can take up to two years.
KP: I know, but is that the behavior that goes along with it? Just doing nothing? I don’t know. Do you know? You went through it.
AS: I saw a lot of working the program and working towards goals and being accountable to social workers and counselors and people outside of her family. 
KP: That’s what I think is lacking. I believe that that has to be a part of recovery, the community, the connectedness. Setting and having the support system is huge. 
AS: And deciding you’re going to do something with your life not just be not using. 
KP: Right, just be there. Just go. Whatever you do every day. 
AS: But the state of not using isn’t recovery. It’s just not using.
KP: That’s what’s happening. There’re no meetings. She likes the treatment that she’s in. I don’t know how long she’s there. She was court ordered to be there, but she likes it. She said, “I trust the group. I can talk about anything I want to.” She doesn’t talk to me at all. Last week I was like, “How are you doing? Can we just connect?” Otherwise you fill in the blanks. The assumptions can be really a negative thing.
AS: It’s dangerous for us.
KP: For all of us.
AS: That’s where we go because of the traumas that we’ve been through. The blanks we fill in are all on despair and tragedy. 
KP: Exactly. You put the words right in my mouth. I was reading this meditation I have about that on my refrigerator. It’s exactly those words. We had some therapy when she was at Park. She had a fabulous counselor. I was so looking forward to continuing with her. She just said, “The two of you assume completely the wrong things about what the other person is thinking. You’re not talking about it. Take one little baby step at a time and talk about this.” Shawn talks a lot, she processes. Sometimes she just talks on and on, most of the time she doesn’t say anything. She’s like, “Oh, we’ll talk later.” Later never happens. 
I was asking her and she got all upset. She was crying and she was having problems with Ryan. She finally dumped. She used to do information dumps periodically throughout her teenage years. All of a sudden I’d get things I wish I’d never heard, but I got a big dump truck load at once. It was just like this vomit of information. She kind of went on that rant the other night. “I talk all day in therapy; I’m in counseling for four hours a day. I don’t want to talk anymore when I get home. I’m talked out. I’ve been talking about all this stuff all day long.”
AS: Which is understandable.
KP: Thank you. I get that. Then it was like, “You always want to have these serious conversations.” I’m like, “I just want to have a conversation. I don’t care if it’s about the weather or walk around the block or go to dinner or sit down and eat together.” A lot about her relationship and she said, “I’m feeling for the first time. I haven’t had these feelings for years. It’s terrifying. It hurts and it’s scary for me.” Her social anxiety is off the charts. She’s feeling all those things that she was medicating before. That was all positive information. It was dramatic, but I got this feedback. I understand that. Thank you for sharing it. She’s like, “I’m all upset!” I’m like, “I get it. I needed that.” Yes! 
AS: Because I love you. 
KP: I do. Then we go away for the weekend and this whole weird dynamic. 
AS: Is there anything else you want to say? I’m just aware of the time. 
KP: I think I know in my heart, I’m sure you’ve heard this; this is the hardest challenge, the biggest thing that I have ever experienced in my entire life. I almost didn’t make it myself. I don’t know if you knew this but I ended up hospitalized at one point. I did. I tried to commit suicide over this. 
AS: A while ago?
KP: It was a year ago in April. I was in Nar-Anon then. 
AS: I didn’t know that. I’m sorry. 
KP: I’ve never thought about it since. Shawn had left treatment one more time, was back on the street. I just cracked that day. I just tried to find her, I was driving around. I was out of my mind. I just said, “She’s going to die. I can’t outlive her. I don’t want to live through losing a child.” That’s how I felt. That’s the craziness that was overcoming me. “I can’t outlive her. She’s going to die.”
AS: That made you want to kill yourself?
KP: Yes. 
AS: That’s really heavy. How long were you in the hospital?
KP: Five days. 
AS: Did you get good help?
KP: Oh, yes. I felt completely out of my element because I was surrounded by people who had been there many times. It was so extreme. It was completely foreign to me. I was that desperate that I had to go there. 
AS: To protect yourself. Did you take yourself to the hospital?
KP: No, somebody called an ambulance for me. I remember calling Shawn and saying, “Would you come see me?” She wouldn’t come see me. That was really painful. Even then the drugs were more important.
AS: You told her how you felt?
KP: Yes. 
AS: That’s the power of addiction, isn’t it?
KP: It can manifest itself and grow and morph within each one of us. It can take over every part of our being. I think if I had been in a more spiritual place at the time I don’t think it would have been that extreme. I just didn’t believe in anything. I didn’t believe there was a God. I didn’t believe there was a higher power. It was just like, “I’ve had enough.” Why? Why does this keep happening to me? That’s how I felt. It wasn’t about her. Why? What did I do to deserve this?
AS: Right, and that nothing you’re doing is helping.
KP: It took a long time to get there, to realize that there’s nothing I can do except love her and tell her if she’s ready. She wasn’t ready. She went into treatment so many times for the family or for us or for me. She’d say straight out, “I’m not ready. I don’t want to quit.” 
AS: Do you know how many times she’s been in treatment?
KP: I think this is her ninth. She’s very proud to say that. It’s odd. That they would say, “Oh, this is my ninth treatment.” I just cringe. She never went through it. She didn’t stay. She never stayed, all those times. I think she stayed the first time at The Retreat; she went through Meadow Creek the first time she stayed, and then she went through Park. So three out of the nine, she spent any period of time then. To me it doesn’t count. What’d you get from that? Maybe it was a baby step forward each time. I don’t know how long she’s been clean. She said she’s done meth twice since January. Amy, I don’t know. She told me she hadn’t done anything. 
AS: So the deception isn’t over yet. How are you today? How are you since you were hospitalized? How are you doing?
KP: I’ve been on an uphill. It was just kind of one of these, in my mind, like a one-time feeling. I’ve never felt it before or after. I went through some pretty intense treatment. I went to DBT. Are you familiar with DBT?
AS: Yes. 
KP: Last summer, and that was helpful. It gives you new skills to use. It’s like a different language. 
AS: The hospitalization was a year ago April?
KP: Yes. 
AS: So like sixteen months ago.
KP: I did that last summer. I have a fantastic therapist and we do EMDR, which has helped me tremendously with all of this. It’s amazing how a session can change my perception or my reactions to things. It’s fantastic. Those tools—that work—has kept me stable ever since then. I get angry. I’m trying to work on the anger part of it. I know you’ve been there
AS: Hang in there. I have, but I have to say the anxiety doesn’t go away. It becomes part of you. It’s part of your story with that child. It’s something that she’ll be living with and I’ll be living 
with. 
KP: It gives me hope when I see other moms, other families, other parents. 
AS: We need that hope to survive. It was those other people in the meetings whose kids were four or five years in recovery that helped me when my daughter was homeless by the river. 
KP: Is she still on methadone?
AS: Yes.
KP: Does she talk about getting off of it?
AS: Yes, they’re tapering down really slowly.
KP: Are they both taking it?
AS: Yes. 
KP: I support it now. I wish I would have been more knowledgeable, but she hates it. They want her on a higher dose so she’ll feel better. She won’t do it. She sees the psychiatrist this week. We were talking about the system, that part of it. I’m rambling, I’m sorry.
AS: No, no. It’s okay. 
KP: That whole idea of trying to find help, starting with no insurance. MA has been actually pretty great. Through Medica she’s gotten a lot of benefits. That way once we figured out that whole navigating thing. She couldn’t have done that navigating. I had to do that piece. She could never have figured it out. It took me months. Then trying to find her a psychiatrist, which has been a new thing. I called the U of M Department of Behavioral Health or Mental Health and Addiction. They said, “Well our one psychiatrist just retired and we’re not taking any new patients.” I went, “What?”
AS: At the U of M?
KP: The U of M! This is not like Nystrom, one of the other smaller psychiatric clinics. 
AS: It’s not a small practice.
KP: I said, “Can you give me a referral?” “No we don’t have any referrals. I have no idea what to tell you.” I was just like, “I’m the mother of this addict.” I just went on this whole rant about how can you not have an idea of where to point people when this is so prominent? I called a psychiatrist that I know. Why I didn’t go that route in the first place? She gave me the name of one in Plymouth, Plymouth Psych Clinic or something. They got her in in a week. She goes Thursday. 
AS: But you had to do that. You had to have the tenacity as a mother to keep at it. We don’t take no for an answer.
KP: You almost have to go through personal connections to find a resource. If you go down the normal channels of MA or Medica, any of those channels, you don’t get anywhere. Or you get three to four months. We start with a physical thinking, “Oh, you’ll get a referral.” Took her to Fairview, had a physical, they said, “Here’s a couple names.” It’s at least three to four months to get in. She just walked out and she felt hopeless. The anxiety has to be treated. The mental health part has to be treated. We found another resource; we’ll see where that goes.
AS: That’s where a certain level of education and access to other resources comes into play for our kids.
KP: We know how to navigate that.
AS: But if you didn’t, where’s your kid? They’re in jail.
KP: That’s not a solution. I just don’t think that’s a solution.
AS: Not for anybody.
KP: Not enough treatment. That’s enough.
AS: Thank you.
KP: Oh, you’re welcome.
AS: Thank you this was really good. 
KP: Thank you for asking. "

At the Home of Amy Sullivan
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Sue Purchase    -SP
Amy Sullivan   -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan this is part two interview with Sue Purchase. We’re in my house in Minneapolis on May ninth. Sue do you give me permission again?
SP: I absolutely give you permission Amy.
AS: Thank you dear. I think we were around 2001. If you want to go back a little further we can definitely start. I didn’t listen to the very end to find out where we were. You were the director of Women With a Point from 1996 to ‘99?
SP: 2001. I resigned in 2001.
AS: We did start talking about the Fit Pack and you started to work in Australia. 
SP: Did I talk about the Fit Pack with the disposal project that we did?
AS: I don’t know but go ahead. 
SP: It ties in nicely with really raising awareness around harm reduction, the importance of certainly access to clean syringes. Some of the terminology was starting to change, rather than syringe exchange it would be syringe access. There were more sources available for syringes for people actively using illicit drugs. We had the pharmacy project going with four area pharmacies. One was in South Minneapolis on 26th and Nicollet. I can’t remember the name of it. They had two locations. That one and then there was one on Lake Street, really well known. Then we had one on the West Side of St. Paul where there was predominately a Latino population, lots of heroin. There was one on the East Side of St. Paul, more of white working class, methamphetamine. Then we had a pharmacy, I think it was Merwin Drug over on the North Side of Minneapolis. This project involved community based pharmacists selling, they could sell the Fit Pack. The personal sharps container came packed with a ten pack of syringes and there was a mailing card. There was a research component attached to it. It had a sticker on the front that we had designed that really talked about safe injecting, safe disposal, and harm reduction message. Then people were involved in that. I can’t remember exactly how it all came about. Participants at the storefront would participate in a survey; they got a t-shirt that had art on it that was designed by a program participant. It was of a demon being shot out of a syringe with flames behind it. It was a circular image, red and yellow and very vibrant. In a really interesting font it said, “Be Blood Aware. Better Safe Than Sorry.” We had this whole disposal awareness campaign. Through that what we learned was how pharmacies were participating with users, what the cost of syringes were. The one on 26th and Nicollet oftentimes charged five dollars a ten pack. They didn’t want active drug users in their pharmacies. 
AS: Was that more money than they should have been charging?
SP: Yes. Syringes wholesale are seventy cents apiece or they were at the time. You’d get ten of them in a pack. With pharmacy access laws you were allowed to buy a ten pack but you couldn’t buy more than that at a time. Seventy cents wholesale being sold for five dollars a ten pack. Their policy around that was based on appearance. If you appeared to be somebody buying syringes for illicit purposes you paid five bucks. If you were a diabetic I think it was three dollars. There was a price break. That was interesting, not a surprise. The pharmacy on the North Side of Minneapolis they were asking for identification and limiting the number of visits that a person could have to a pharmacy. Really deterrents around enactment, on the surface it was really great to have pharmacy access but there were glitches in the system. This project the aim was to help alleviate those glitches, get more uniform policies throughout pharmacies, and give access to people, address safe disposal. 
AS: Was this a grant funded project?
SP: It was a grant funded project.
AS: With Access Works?
SP: Access Works with the Minnesota Department of Health. It was titled the Better Safe Than Sorry Disposal Proposal. 
AS: We have those documents.
SP: Yes, exactly. That got funded and really created another level of awareness. Working with participants, participants are more involved. The project, although the research component of it was never fully completed, we worked in collaboration with Sarah Riebeckie and Seth Wells from the University of Minnesota. I’m not sure whatever really happened with the data there. Sarah might know something more about it. There was that and that project was also replicated throughout New York City. At the time the big move was pharmacy access for drug users. Not all pharmacies in Minnesota wanted to participate. It was a voluntary thing. Disposal had never been adequately addressed for pharmacists to feel real comfortable with selling syringes. 
AS: With the idea that people would bring their used syringes back?
SP: That there would be this personal sharps container. The pharmacists were handing the syringes out within this ten pack and so they felt better. The ten pack was in the Fit Pack. They were handing out a disposal mechanism with the syringes so they felt better about that with the sense that discarded syringes weren’t going to be left laying on the ground. 
AS: Do you throw the whole Fit Pack away?
SP: The Fit Pack can be thrown in the garbage.
AS: The whole thing when you’re done with those ten?
SP: Yes or it could have been brought back to the needle exchange. There were so many valuable aspects to the Fit Pack in that it also created a much more positive relationship with law enforcement. People who were on the streets having some encounter with a cop, they didn’t have to worry about patting them down and that they’re going to accidentally get a needle stick because they were carried safely. It also provided a level of safety for the user because the dirty ones were going down inside, one way flap. You can’t get them out. No one wants to stick their finger down there so that residue that will get people a felony when they’re trying to return used syringes to a needle exchange, that’s where some of the rub comes in. You want them returned but oftentimes people can’t hold on to them for fear of prosecution, something’s going to happen. It was a win, win situation in that way. It was a great project. It really raised awareness. 
A lot of education happened that way not only for community pharmacies but for the individual user. Much more in a sense activism really a big part of Access Works was always about engaging and educating program participants, everybody, about whether it was know your rights, safe disposal, how do you write to your congressperson. In the storefront there was a room and all the walls were pretty bare. I think I bought two hundred dollars’ worth of posters and postcards from Northern Sun. It was fantastic because we created this collage on the wall. People would come look at them and ask about them and the quotes. It was such a wonderful opportunity to educate and open a mind and put forth other ideas. We had letter writing campaigns. We had the nuns; they had Peace House on Franklin. Are you familiar? They used to protest at the School of Americas. What were their names? They’re the Sisters of Carondelet. I’m going to blank it out, I should know it so well. They came and did stuff. We had voter’s rights; the women’s users group had the League of Women Voters. We did so many educational opportunities on a variety of topics. 
AS: To just engage people who came through the door.
SP: Yes, an informed consumer. 
AS: When we talk with Rae later we can go into what you guys did together and that stuff. Do you want to focus on your life for this? If you want to.
SP: We can do that.
AS: So after you went to work for Fit Pack what’s been going on in your life since?
SP: I went to work for Fit Pack and I worked for them until 2004, 2005.
AS: Did you leave the cities?
SP: I did. I moved to Tacoma, Washington. My husband Dave ran a program in Tacoma. Kind of a twofold, he had a needle exchange, it was the first publicly funded legal needle exchange in the United States. 
AS: How did you meet Dave?
SP: Everybody knew Dave Purchase.
AS: But how did you meet him?
SP: I met him at a conference. I met him at the first harm reduction conference in Oakland, California. 
AS: Do you remember the year?
SP: 1996. I thought he was a showboat. 
AS: What do you mean by that?
SP: Well Dave was a presence. I thought that he was just a little too full of himself, met him there. Had to have a conversation with him about...Dave had the needle exchange in Tacoma but he also had a larger national organization. It was the North American Syringe Exchange Network, NASEN is the acronym. NASEN involved technical assistance for startup needle exchange programs in the United States and other places in the world. It had a buyers club for needle exchange programs. It had a grants program. Then I can’t remember if it was an annual conference or every two years Dave put on a conference. He was a really well-known figure. Dave was instrumental in starting all the New York programs. He worked throughout the country. He worked throughout the world, programs in Hawaii and Vietnam and Puerto Rico, everywhere. He’s this larger than life figure. I think he’s arrogant and annoying. I have to do business with him. 
AS: Somehow a romance developed?
SP: Not so much. Then a year goes by. I had to apply for money with him. You had to. The needle exchange pots of dollars were so few and far between you didn’t not apply. I had to apply for money from him. I didn’t get funded. I remember calling him on the phone and saying, “What’s the deal? Where’s my money? Why didn’t I get some?” Out of that he sent me a little money for needle exchange. I remember then Dave was self-described as glib and he was. He’d make some comment like, “Oh darling you should marry me and take me away from all of this.” 
Then some time goes by. I don’t know if it’s later that year but I’m at a drug policy conference in New Orleans and in the opening reception. I think I was with my colleague Toni. We’re standing at the bar. I look across the room and I say, “Oh no Dave Purchase is coming across the room. Let’s move.” We said hello. Later that night, Dave used to hold court in the bar, everybody was there. This was harm reduction in the United States. All these people who are the old timers now were young, having a conversation with him in the bar. It was a good conversation, it was an interesting conversation. He wasn’t annoying. It was enjoyable. Then there was an attraction. The conference goes on. I don’t know what the hell he had said to me. The last day or something he said there was a spark between us. I don’t remember how I responded to that. He was going on to Denver to another harm reduction conference. I was going home to Minneapolis. I think I had told him that I’d lived in Colorado for years. He had a sister that lived up in the mountains. 
He sent me a card that said something like, “Proof of purchase to follow.” I think he sent me some Fat Tire beer in the mail. You couldn’t get it in Minnesota. That’s when it said, “Proof of purchase to follow.” He was coming to visit. That was the proof of Purchase. And visit he did. What a human being, certainly human. We had an amazing relationship for about nine years, travelled, worked together, my confidante, his confidante. We lived in Tacoma, Washington and he ran a program. I had run a program. I had run a much more progressive, comprehensive program. Dave had started a needle exchange and it didn’t really expand beyond where it was in 1988, on the corner of 14th and G Street. Minnesota offers a lot of services. Minnesota is hospitable. Tacoma is not hospitable. It’s the West Coast and there’s black tar heroin. Tacoma was built on Indian burial grounds and I think the spirits were revolting. I worked on the corner of 14th and G Street in a van. 
The Tacoma Needle Exchange has a very strict one for one policy. They might still have a strict one for one policy. Dave created that policy when he was being glib with People magazine. He got all this attention, it’s the late 80s and it’s a new thing in the United States. Dave answered off the cuff and it became policy. Working at the needle exchange, if somebody didn’t come with a used syringe they weren’t supposed to get a clean one. That program was constantly under the gun. The people of Tacoma weren’t fond of the needle exchange at all. They were always looking to shut it down. It was located on the corner of 14th and G Street is the Catholic Worker community. There’s St. Leo’s, the Catholic Church sits right above with the hospitality kitchen. There is Father Bicks who is in charge of stuff. He was a Jesuit priest who used to protest at School of Americas all of this stuff. Bicks was an amazing human. There’s the Guadalupe House on the other corner and all the Catholic Workers. There is Joe the nurse who works at the medical clinic at St. Leo’s. 
There’s a one for one policy. There are people in the neighborhood who spy. People, in order to have a clean syringe, a sterile syringe had to dig around in the dirt, they had to dig around in the grass, they had to find a piece of a plunger. They had to find evidence of a syringe and bring it. Dave had people working for him that were very obedient but that wasn’t me. I was a game changer at the exchange. They’d come on Fridays and I’d say, “Five can get you ten.” It wasn’t going to be a strict one for one. I wasn’t going to be stupid about it but it wasn’t a policy I could abide by. There was tension. The black tar heroin, the sex workers, on the West Coast the amount of homeless with people sleeping outside in the jungle. 
AS: What do you mean by the jungle?
SP: The jungle was...you know Almond Roca candy? It comes out of Tacoma, Washington. So did Ted Bundy and the D.C. sniper. As we go on I’m sure I’ll remember some other highlights. Behind the Almond Roca factory, you know Seattle, Tacoma; the Northwest is really green and lush. Bushes, trees, you name it. Behind the Almond Roca there was the I-5 that goes through there. There was this big area, wooded under the freeway and behind the factory that was called the jungle that was the homeless camp. It was huge and dangerous and dirty. There are sex workers; there was the Green River killer. At the needle exchange I took the bad date report. 
AS: What’s that?
SP: The bad date report was for women who were sex workers. If they had a bad date they could report it to us and we compiled a weekly bad date sheet so we would hand it out at the van for other working girls so they would know who to be aware of. It might be so and so got picked up. She was raped at knife point and thrown out of a truck at Tacoma Avenue or something, some story around that. We would compile that. I’d take those reports. There’s also SOAP and SODA laws in Tacoma. There is in Seattle as well, in many places in the United States. SOAP stood for “Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution” and SODA stood for “Stay Out of Areas of Drug Abuse.” If you had a crime, you’d had a drug crime you couldn’t be in those areas. All social services, all low income housing, the needle exchange, all of it are in these areas. Most of Tacoma are SOAP and SODA areas. You could only be there between nine and eleven, nine and twelve, ten and twelve that you could be there to do your business. Otherwise you were subject to arrest and brought back to jail. The correctional system is a revolving constant. 
AS: I’ve never heard of that before.
SP: That’s a longer story too. We would help women escape the cops. They’d be there looking for them. They’d cruise the needle exchange. I had several encounters with law enforcement. The point of the needle exchange is not only that people get sterile supplies but also they can get some help with housing, they might need an ID, they might want to go to treatment, they might want to get on methadone. All of that takes time. That’s the work we did there. It’s long and complicated. That was work that I brought there that had never been done there in the past. It kept people hanging out at the van. There were complaints about that in the neighborhood. There was a dude named Wes who worked up at the hospitality kitchen and he liked to take pictures of the people who were participants at the needle exchange and then he would deny them food. 
There was one woman in particular that I remember. There’s MRSA going around, a drug resistant staph infection, eighty five to ninety percent of the participants had MRSA. Abscesses, wounds that you wouldn’t even begin to believe. There was one woman who was intent on saving her life and get a clean syringe. She’d risk everything to come and get it. She’d have to shoot dope on the fly. Dope sick, got to get your fix, got to earn money, all those things that it takes to survive. The whole top of her arm, the left arm, was eaten away by an abscess. You didn’t have to worry about finding a vein. You could load it up and put it through your clothes and stick it in your arm while you’re moving and hiding from the cops. Those sorts of situations I see more and more and more. Dave and I have disagreements.
AS: Had you seen things as bad as that in Minneapolis?
SP: No, not at all. 
AS: It was worse in Tacoma.
SP: Oh my God it was way, way worse.
AS: This was in 2004?
SP: Yes and Minnesota didn’t necessarily have black tar heroin, they had China white. Black tar is nasty. People would transport it under their fingernails; maybe it’s in their pussy. However you don’t get busted. You think about all the bacteria and you’re shooting it. The health risks are huge. I would help sex workers evade the cops. I’d drive to the site. I’d put them in my car, drive up around the block and drop them off so they wouldn’t get arrested. I brought people to clinics. I went to meetings. I talked. I spoke up. 
AS: This rubbed Dave the wrong way?
SP: Yes. It began to certainly he was getting more flak from the community because there’s more presence at the exchange. All the participants loved me. They showed up. “Go see Sue. She’ll hook you up. She’ll help you out.” I’m seeing all this stuff and I’ve got things going on in my personal life at the same time.
AS: Were you married to Dave?
SP: We got married in 1999. There’s so much that’s happening. One of the things that happens towards the end, there’s a woman named Valerie. She’s a Native woman. She’s trying so hard to get her life together and get on track. She wants to go home to her family at the Flathead Indian Reservation. Montana is close to Washington. You get a lot of tribes. She got shot in the head one block down on Faucet. Shot in the head and killed. All I remember saying to Dave is, “Every social service provider in this town has blood on his hands, including you.” I had expectations of Dave. I believed that he should be doing certain things a certain way. He should have built that program and moved it along and been responsive to the needs of the community and he was not. I lost respect for him. 
Then there was somebody else. There was something else that had happened, which I can’t remember right now. I met a woman named Linda. This is a story about stigma. Linda had lived on the streets for fifteen years in Tacoma. She was beautiful when she was young. She was from Montana. She had kids that she was estranged from. She did sex work to survive. She had seizure disorder. She would go to the medical clinic up at St. Leo’s. The nurse that ran St. Leo’s medical clinic was on the Catholic Worker community, Joe. Joe had been a medic in the Vietnam War. He had a heart of gold. He understood what happened with people on the street and how hard it was. How I met Joe and I met Linda is they came to the van one day. He explained what was going on with Linda and her seizures and she couldn’t hold on to her medicine and was always disappearing. People like seizure medicine. You can get high on it. The arrangement is I would hold on to Linda’s medication and she’d come by the van every morning to get them. Linda wasn’t much of an injection drug user. She was a crack smoker. This arrangement worked for a while. I make sure that every day Linda gets one pill in her mouth. It happens for a week, two weeks, a month. Then Linda disappears. I don’t think much of it. I hold on to the meds. 
Then there’s this dude named Troy. Troy comes by the van a lot, a good guy. He’d come by and he’d say, “Sue, Linda got housed.” I’m like, “That’s awesome. That’s really awesome.” He’d be like, “You should go visit her.” I’m like, “Yes I should. I’ll do it.” Then he comes by and he tells me that she has cancer and she doesn’t have long to live. He really wants me to visit her. I agree. Troy and Linda had been friends years before. I don’t remember what Linda told me. Troy had a reputation on the streets for slashed throats. The streets are rough. He’s kind of funny. He gave me this beautiful hand knit scarf. He liked me. He and Linda had had some issues. They got along. They were friends, they were close. 
I finally go to visit Linda. Her belly is really distended, she had liver cancer. Linda had been living with AIDS for twenty years. She’d gotten housed for the last six months of her life. She had this boyfriend. What the fuck was his name. I can picture him in my brain. I don’t think much of the guy. She’s got a son in prison. She’s got this guy as a boyfriend. Linda likes to smoke crack. I go over and meet her. We talk. I meet her daughter in law, I leave. Somehow I get in the mix with Linda. I started checking on her; make sure she has her meds. She loved to smoke cigarettes and she loved to smoke crack. Somehow in there we had an agreement. She needed some care; I could help out with it. I knew she smoked crack. I’m like, “Here’s the deal. I don’t care.” We became very close and I ended up helping her with the help of Joe the nurse and Linda’s boyfriend, we helped her die at home. It’s a longer story. It was representative of the stigma, the lack of services, and the lack of caring for people who were homeless, strung out, and had been drug users in Tacoma. There was no harm reduction there. There was a needle exchange. Needle exchange is a strategy that reduces harm but it does not mean that it’s done with compassion or with any sort of insights or care. It simply exchanges a syringe on a good day. The marriage ended after that, not long after that. I moved back to Minnesota in 2007. Before I leave Tacoma Rae wants to leave Access Works. Her computer had been stolen and she had had enough. 
AS: We’ll have to have that story tonight. 
SP: We’ll pick up there with Rae. I went back to Minnesota. She had called me saying, “Do you want the organization back?” I said, “No, not necessarily.” I was burnt out on needle exchange. I was burnt out period. 
AS: It takes so much energy to do it the way you were doing it, with more harm reduction model than just needle exchange. 
SP: It takes a lot. The idea behind needle exchange is it builds a bridge to other services. 
AS: It’s a part of harm reduction but it’s not the only part.
SP: Right. I take it back on a temporary basis. I was shocked by what had happened there, what had changed. The program certainly was booming when I left but by the time I get back, this is four years later; there are youngsters there that are from the suburbs. Pills are plentiful. People are coming through the door.
AS: You’re saying the users changed, the people who came through the door between 2004 and ‘07. 
SP: Yes, it’s like the fall of 2007. They’re younger, they’re from the suburbs, and they don’t look like they belong there. They are there looking to hook up. 
AS: They’re there looking for heroin because their pills are too expensive or not available.
SP: Yes. They’ve got a habit. They’re coming to the needle exchange. I’m looking around in part in disbelief of what I had created there. It was working. It was a drop in center. We had active drug users providing services across the board. We had people shooting dope in the bathroom. We had kids…
AS: This is what was happening there that hadn’t been happening before.
SP: Not to the degree. It was always a struggle because it’s harm reduction. Even prior to me leaving people would dump off bodies that had overdosed. They weren’t dead but they’d drop them off at our back door. They knew we were a safe place. I can’t even begin to tell you all of the stuff. All of the reasons that that space served communities. There were funerals for people who were infected with HIV through injection drug use, had worked in the community and had died. Robert Preston, his was there. The intention is always that it would be normalized community. That people, all people, were viewed as part of the community and welcomed if they wanted to come there. They did. It was astounding. There’s this safety issue. I think I showed you the sign that says, “Please don’t shoot dope in our bathroom, if you must please use the sharps container.” People would put syringes down the toilet. We had wraparound services in there. Rae can talk more about that from her experience in terms of being hired and what she had implemented in my absence. It was working and it was working well. 
It had changed. You could see certainly the increase in drug use. During that time in that transition period with Rae and I, we’re getting Narcan brought in with a doctor, Jim Hervenco. I can’t remember what days we had the clinic and how the training happened. He wrote the prescription. People had Narcan the first day that we had it. One of the outreach workers, Tommy Stevens, he had run in the front door of the drop in and said someone in two buildings over had overdosed. I think he had fallen behind a couch. Tommy Narcaned him, brought him out, saved a life, just that quick. It was absolutely amazing. 
I’m burnt out; Rae’s burnt out and has moved on. The board isn’t particularly affective. Fundraising is difficult. I want out. I didn’t like working with them. I’m fried. In my own life at the time I had friends dying of cancer. My mother had died and suicides among friends, countless overdose deaths in Tacoma. There were at least ten overdose deaths in Tacoma in the year that I was working at the exchange there, the woman who got shot in the head, Linda dying. 
AS: You’re just surrounded by trauma. 
SP: Surrounded by it. I remember sitting in there thinking...I’d gotten a divorce. People continued to tell me one sad story after another.
AS: You’re off the chart for that list where you have to make a point for everything.
SP: I couldn’t be there anymore. I didn’t have the magic to save that organization. I think Rae had been in discussions somehow with MAP. I don’t remember how that happened. I’m like vehemently opposed to MAP having that program. What happens is that they hire this woman…
AS: She did say, “We took over your program.”
SP: Yes she did, fucking bitch. There was a woman named Laurie Wolner who was hired as the executive director. Laurie Wolner had been a case director at MAP for many years, a terrible reputation, not nice to people, all sorts of things. She shuts it down. She decides to close. They tell people it’s a funding issue. Lorraine Teal could see the writing on the wall. She wanted money for her program, her needle exchange. During the history of Access Works there were times...Dave’s needle exchange conference was in Minneapolis in 2000. We had honored Dave. He had beat cancer. People came from all over the world for this conference. MAP was there. Bob Tracy was there. He talked how MAP had deemphasized needle exchange. There were grants that we had written that MAP plagiarized. I knew people. I had friends that were the founders. They read my applications. I think it may have been Dave. He’d read my applications. He read MAP’s application and recognized my program description. They had taken my stuff and plagiarized.
AS: How did they get it?
SP: How did they get my program?
AS: How did they get copies of your grant proposals?
SP: A lot of it was public information. You’d have access. There was always competition for it. In the beginning of Women With a Point, prior to funding through the Health Department, we’d want to have a collaborative relationship with MAP. We don’t have the budget, they’ve got it and we’re disposing the syringes we’re collecting with Minnesota AIDS Project. They get to have our numbers. Numbers matter for grant opportunities. They got to count our numbers. The first year in what I didn’t think was a successful year; it’s a brand new program. We exchanged ten thousand syringes. I don’t remember what MAP had exchanged, four thousand or something. It’s significantly higher. We start getting funding and we’re doing our own disposal. MAP can’t count our numbers anymore. Competition stiffens. In Minnesota for funding competition is everything. It’s a competitive process. They don’t encourage collaboration. It’s a dog eat dog. Lorraine is nothing if not competitive. She can see Women With a Point and Access Works becoming the hottest gig in town. Everybody talked about it and we got more and more money.
AS: You did get Ryan White funds.
SP: We got Ryan White funds, we got directly funded CDC grant. We were the first needle exchange program in the United States to have a directly funded CDC grant when federal funding for needle exchange was illegal. It was a coup. She resented every bit of it. Opportunity knocked at her door. They got it and they shut us down. Access Works went away. That’s directly attributed to Lorraine Teal, without a doubt in my mind.
AS: What did you do after that?
SP: I started Morpheus Project in Minneapolis. It was a brief intervention needle exchange program with Lee Hurtle. I have to leave Minnesota. At the time my best friend is dying of cancer. I was really in Minnesota because she was here dying of cancer not because I really wanted to live in Minnesota. My youngest son was still in high school and graduating. I came back. I was here from 2007 to 2011. I ran Morpheus Project, distributed Narcan. I really ran a needle exchange out of my house. I worked for Simpson Housing. They wanted a harm reduction housing program for women. They thought they’d hire me. It was a brand new start up program. It had amazing potential. I had eighty five percent of my case load were chronically homeless native women. It was good work. It was really good work. For me that was a slacker job. I’m losing my shit. 
AS: What do you mean?
SP: Mentally I’m struggling. I’m in grief. My friend Lisa had died. Her son Grant had died from a suicide a year and a half before that. It was just so much death. My sister Dianne died. I’m sure there were others, friends, overdoses in Minnesota. I know a lot of people. Simpson Housing, we have a parting of the ways. I bug out. I saw the Dalai Lama on Mother’s Day of 2011. I’d been in grad school. I was going to do an MBA on strategic planning and using a harm reduction model. I had it all figured out in my head how it could work. I thought it would be a good place for me because it’s a liberal catholic women’s college. It wasn’t quite liberal enough for me. That went south. I flunked out of grad school. All through school I’d had a 4.0. I just couldn’t keep it together anymore. I sold all my shit, took all my stuff, brought my Buddha to Rae’s house. I have a two hundred and fifty pound sandstone Buddha and he travels with me. He had to go to Rae’s house for a while. Then he was over at a meditation center in St. Paul for a while. I retrieved him in 2013 when I moved to Georgetown. 
I had been in therapy and diagnosed with PTSD. Drugs had become a problem in a way that was reminiscent of early days. I had to go. So I left. I got rid of all my shit except for like two crates. I brought those down to a friend’s house in St. Louis, stayed there for a bit, got healthier. Then I went to Colorado. I went to the mountains. My daughter is there and things aren’t good with her. She’s in and out of jail and precariously housed at that point. She steals all my money. It’s just really hard. I worked at Loveland Ski Area for a season. Then I got in my car and I drove to San Francisco and stayed there for a while. I couch surfed and got my car towed on 4/20 in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood. It’s kind of a funny story. I went down to Tucson, stayed with friends. Went back up to Seattle and stayed with friends there. 
In the fall I went back to Colorado and started therapy. I’ve been there ever since. Morpheus Project—for whatever reason I can’t not do needle exchange. I have Rocky Mountain Morpheus Project up there, this fledgling little stellar mountain needle exchange program at the continental divide. My last real effort in developing a program in that way. During my days of couch surfing I volunteered with the Berkeley needle exchange program which is called NEED. I’ve worked at needle exchange programs and volunteered throughout the country. For that I am so grateful. It’s an honor in ways that many people don’t understand. What Dave liked about me and what he saw from the very beginning was that I got it. Should we talk anymore about my personal life? 
AS: You don’t have to say her name but could you tell me about the person who you brought to the harm reduction summit and what you were doing for her for those days? I don’t want you to say her name because I don’t have her permission but if you could just tell me.
SP: I know her because I know her mother.
AS: Is that connected in any way to your harm reduction work?
SP: I’m always taking care of somebody. My last big save or something before I bugged out is that I knew that she needed to leave the reservation. 
AS: Bugged out when?
SP: When I left Minneapolis. She was struggling on a reservation in South Dakota. She came to Minneapolis and lived with me for a few months. I had gotten to know her through her mom. She would show up periodically in Minneapolis. She wasn’t necessarily living on a reservation then, she was somewhere else. The first time I met her I picked her up at the emergency room at HCMC because she’d been down in the Franklin, Nicollet area and someone had stabbed her in the head with a screw driver. Her mom needed her to be picked up at HCMC which is frequently referred to as the chop shop. I picked her up there. That was the beginning of us knowing one another. She would periodically come and go out of Minneapolis. I always kept track with her mom. She’d come and stay with me. She had some things happen on the reservation that were awful. She came to Minneapolis, she went to treatment. She’s been here ever since. She was always a drinker in the past. She’s got a meth habit. She is a community theater performer on homelessness and telling her story. Everybody wants to hear a good homeless tragic story for whatever reason. She talks about her hopes, her dreams, things that she’d like to do. She’d like to be a nurse. She has an uncle who works for the tribe in South Dakota and does amazing work and they’re really close. She wants to do work like her uncle does. She’s got some stuff to work through. I brought her up to White Earth with me. I thought it would be a good environment for her, we’d have quality time. She’s got an apartment; she’s got a place to live. She’d be with some supportive people. She’ll tell you that telling her story is really hard and it opens everything up. When the performance is over there’s nothing but a bottle. What do you do with that? 
AS: Really what is the point of all this?
SP: It’s to educate the fucking white people in the community about homelessness so they’ll rise to the occasion and do something goddamn different. So they’ll be sympathetic and not stigmatize people. So they’ll learn a lesson, so that they look around and wake the fuck up, all of it. I’m so, so sad. People think now that Trump’s in office look what’s going on in the world. Where the fuck have you been? Where have you been? The Democratic Party, there’s a lot of great things to say about Barack Obama but there’s a lot of shitty things to say about Barack Obama. What the fuck is wrong with people? The looky loo tour everybody loves it. I used to take people down to Curry Avenue. 
AS: The what?
SP: I used to call it the looky loo tour because there’s people that are liberal and they want to do what’s politically correct and then be hipsters and groovy at a cocktail party and talk about how edgy they are. I’d bring them down to Curry Avenue. They’d have no idea. What they knew was Block E and the drive by on the highway. They’d never been to Curry Avenue. Some people got it and they were truly humble and appropriate. Other people got baptism by fire and it was good for them. They would never forget it. I would say that I have contributed a lot to Minnesota.
AS: I would say you have. 
SP: Thank you for the opportunity to talk about it.
AS: You’re so welcome. It’s been my privilege. 
SP: There’s just so much sadness. I can’t come here in the wintertime. 
AS: Thank you Sue.
SP: You’re welcome. I can fill in blank spaces for you in the future if you want. "

Interviewer
April 27, 2017
Minneapolis, Minnesota
Sue Purchase     -SP
Amy Sullivan    -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan I’m at my home with Sue Purchase. It is April 27, 2017. At my house and I’m with Sue Purchase. Sue do you want to state your name? 
SP: I am Sue Purchase and I give Amy Sullivan permission to record this interview. 
AS: Let’s start with your childhood. You said you’d grown up in Cloquet. Do you want to talk about your parents, your childhood, your early life?
SP: I grew up in Northern Minnesota. I was born in Duluth in 1959. Number five of what would be six children. First four years were spent in Esko, Minnesota. Esko is a suburb of Cloquet. A very strong Finnish community. Number five of six kids. Moved to Cloquet when I was five years old. Went to grade school there.
AS: What did your parents do?
SP: My dad, he worked for the co-op store, very much Northern Minnesota. He lost his job working there and then he worked at the paper mill for Potlatch. I guess for the rest of his life. I must have been nine years old or something. He started working for Potlatch. That was in the mid-60s, the paper industry was huge. They had Potlatch, Diamond Match, and two other active mills. There was a mill bus. It was a mill town. That’s what he did. My mother, she never worked outside the house. 
AS: How would describe your economic situation growing up?
SP: I would say the working poor. It’s interesting to think about. What I remember, my mother always scrabbling for money. Always worried about money, the things we could and could not have because of money. I suspect that my dad probably made good money. For the times and for the mill industry. Given the times there was a living wage but he drank it all up. There was no money. I remember things like he’d come home drunk and pass out and she’d go through his wallet after the fact to see what was left, what there could be for school lunches. It’s interesting to talk about. I don’t know what year it was, ‘65 maybe, when free lunches started. It must have been Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty but we certainly qualified. I think that I was in the third grade...It must have been around third grade however old I would be then. They were blue and yellow. I don’t know if one was free or one was reduced or you got one of the colors for hot lunch and one was for milk. There was some sort of order to the tickets but I remember the shame. I hated it. I hated using them. Growing up I always felt like everybody in town knew about my house, which was fairly true. He was a drinker and he was violent. I grew up at 1802 Carleton Avenue. Carleton Avenue was one of the main streets in Cloquet. I always felt like we were on display for all of the dysfunction and violence and drinking that happened there. Always a lot of shame related to it. 
AS: Do you have older brothers or sisters or both?
SP: My oldest sister Dianne, I think she was seventeen years older than I was. My mother’s first husband was Greek. He was killed in World War II. Dianne was a baby. My mother was from Floodwood, another small town in Minnesota. I think she had grown up with my dad so she knew him. She had my sister Dianne and then she married my dad Charlie after the first husband was killed. I don’t know how much older she was than my oldest brother, maybe four years. There was Dianne and then there’s my brother Chuck. He was the first born son of my dad. Then there’s my sister Scary Mary. She just had a birthday. She’s around sixty five. Then there’s my brother Jimmy and he is four years older than I am. He was a drinker. Scary Mary is a drinker, Chuck is a drinker. Dianne was way into pills. Then there’s me. Then there’s my brother Michael. He’s two and a half years younger than I am. He for sure is a drinker. There’s been a lot of other drugs in the mix. Every single child. Substance use, violence, and trauma. Absolutely. My mother, she was really proud of the fact that she didn’t smoke cigarettes and she’d have a half a glass of wine. She wasn’t a drinker. There was always some odd sharing of pills. 
AS: Among who?
SP: My oldest sister for sure and with my mom. I don’t know if that extended beyond to my sister Mary Jane or not. There was a culture. 
AS: Do you know what kind of pills they were sharing?
SP: Generally speed. 
AS: That makes sense because that was available. It was prescribed to housewives with lots of children. 
SP: Absolutely, to get stuff done and it’s good for a little depression. 
AS: We were at the school lunches, elementary school, junior high; you were telling me a story about your friend who you met in Cloquet, Debbie. 
SP: So what happens, my parents get a divorce when I’m in the third grade. The mid-60s in Northern Minnesota people didn’t get divorced. Small town environment, everybody knows everything about everybody. 
AS: Was your dad violent with your mom?
SP: Oh yes. 
AS: It was physical abuse.
SP: All my life. 
AS: Was everybody a target?
SP: Everybody was a target. Me less than anybody else in the house. That’s interesting to me too. They got a divorce. My mother had lived in Oregon in the past and always wanted to go back. The summer between fifth and sixth grade we moved to Oregon. It’s myself, my younger brother, and my older brother Jimmy. We’re out there for about six months or so. I loved being in Oregon. It’s not cold Northern Minnesota. Then Jimmy doesn’t adjust well to it. We move back to Cloquet in early February. It sucked. We moved back into this house at 1802 Carleton Avenue. The old man is still living there because he had moved back in the house. My older sister was there. He had moved back in the house when we moved to Oregon. We come back. He’s supposed to move out. What I remember about that is just waiting for him to be gone. I didn’t like him being around. He was just a problem. Two weeks after we got back he died. He died of a stroke in the living room. I wasn’t there. That was something. I might need to write to my therapist later tonight. 
AS: We can pause whenever you want. 
SP: It’s interesting because I’m in therapy and we do a lot of talking. There’s just so much stuff. Sometimes not knowing what I don’t know. There was a change. When I think about myself it was Susie who moved to Oregon. I was always known as Susie, as a little girl. My mother would always talk about how Susie was so docile and so calm and this and that. 
We get back and we always think about it as that’s when ‘A Boy Named Sue’ showed up. My alter ego. It’s absolutely—I love Johnny Cash. I grew up hearing his music. I was really close to my brothers and I had to be a badass to survive. If I was going to be sweet and docile I wasn’t going to make it. In the sixth grade he gets buried. It’s cold when he dies. They can’t bury him; they kept him somewhere until the ground was thawed in the spring. I don’t remember much of that but the relief of having him gone. I didn’t have to worry about his violence any longer. 
It was hard in the sixth grade. There was a new girl who had moved to town, Connie Carlblom. She had older siblings and a fucked up family life too. We’re still friends to this day. There were some older girls in the neighborhood and we started smoking cigarettes and drinking. My older brother was married and had a little girl and I used to babysit. I used to steal their cigarettes. I’ve probably been smoking since I was nine sort of. Bringing booze to school in a baby food jar. 
AS: And nobody caught you doing this?
SP: Nobody paid much attention to what I was doing. 
AS: Because you were so docile and sweet.
SP: They were caught up in whatever else. I think that it was every child for themselves.
AS: In your household?
SP: Yes. Dorothy was preoccupied in whatever else went on in her life. Probably in retrospect she probably, I don’t know before my dad and before her first husband what happened growing up. 
AS: Dorothy is your mom?
SP: Dorothy’s my mom. Sometimes I called her Dot Monster. She probably had, I don’t know what her childhood experience was but when her siblings would talk about her, she was known as a problem. Maybe bipolar, maybe borderline personality. Certainly she had a lot of trauma in her life. She never drank. She didn’t do drugs. She knew divide and conquer really well and she could be wicked. She would play divide and conquer between her kids really well. She wasn’t a supportive mother. It wouldn’t be like, “Susie how are you doing now that we’re back from Oregon and your dad is dead? How’s life in the sixth grade?” That wasn’t going to happen. I had a lifelong friend, Lisa; we’d been friends since kindergarten. When I got back in the sixth grade Lisa was there as my friend. This other woman Connie. We all got a really similar mindset. We were friends, we had fucked up childhoods. 
Connie and I in the summer between sixth and seventh grade we were with her older sister Gail. Gail is beautiful. She’s was just a hip chick. So we’re at the glass block department store in Duluth. I don’t know why we were there together; we’d gotten dropped off somehow. We were there and we’re shoplifting. I’ve got Gail’s purse carrying it. It’s got a pack of Marlboro Reds with two joints in the pack. We get busted for shoplifting. Connie’s parents get called. They come and pick us up. The police must have been involved somehow, the school. Before I’m ever in the seventh grade I had to start seeing the guidance counselor. A man named Brian Burg, I really liked him. I don’t know how all that got set up. I remember sitting in his office. I had to start seeing him before school started. He told me at the outset, he referred to me as being a survivor. I remember sitting there thinking, “What the fuck does that mean? How do you know that about me? What’s going on? What do you know that I don’t know? What does that mean? What am I surviving?” This is my life. I am twelve. I don’t have insights. It made me so uncomfortable. So I just withdraw a little bit more. Certainly the pot smoking just continues. 
In junior high in Cloquet all the grade schools come together and you’re united at the junior high. My friend Lisa that I’d gone all through Garfield School with, the new girl Connie who joins us in the sixth grade, Debbie Holman. Along comes Debbie and then there’s another girl, Mary Dickinson. There’s more but that was the core. Mary and Debbie, they had been friends for life at the Sacred Heart school. They’d gone to the Catholic school. What a group of groups and energy. There was about, I don’t remember how many of us in number but there was Robin Ward. Robin Ward came from Garfield School. I knew her all my life too. In the fourth grade there’s modular scheduling. I don’t know if you’re familiar with modular scheduling in the state of Minnesota but by that point it’s becoming the later 60s. Things are starting to change. The traditional classroom is going away. There were twenty minute mods and children moved from classroom to classroom. More autonomy, more independence. That starts in the fourth grade. It continues on throughout my school career up through high school. I think I was the first year to get it and I think I was the last year to get it. That was fun. In the seventh grade we’ve got modular scheduling.
I’ve got to backtrack to this story about the fourth grade and Robin Ward. We’re sitting in a classroom. There’s a teacher named Mr. Saliga. Probably young at the time, twenties, I have no idea. Older guy from a little kid’s perspective. He would talk about shit that was so inappropriate while sitting at his desk to the classroom. One of them, he talked about Robin Ward’s parents being divorced. I remember sitting there thinking, “Wow, there’s somebody else that can identify with me.” Robin and I would be friends all our lives. Up until probably the last ten years. He was sexually inappropriate. We didn’t know. We were little girls and didn’t have a voice and any place to share it. With divorced parents and things that had happened and nowhere to go with it. There’re these layers of stuff that start. 
AS: That just kind of sets up the trajectory.
SP: So we get to seventh grade and we all get together. I’m not sure how we all met. We formed our club. It was the Weed Weevils. It was given to us, this name by my friend Lisa, her older brother Joel, who was very instrumental all my life. We all have Weed Weevil names. We earned them somehow. Lisa’s name, she was the queen of the Weed Weevils, she was Wee Helvi. Not all of us are Finlanders but many of us are. Then Mary Dickinson became Mad Dog. She loved to drink Mad Dog. Her mother was a teacher. She would leave early in the morning. Her mother partied at night and she taught during the day, grade school children. She’d be gone by seven thirty am. This fledgling group of Weed Weevils, these adolescent girls would gather in Mary’s bedroom. We’d have an ounce of weed, a lid, four fingers and we would roll joints and each of us would have one and we’d keep them passing. Then we’d get really high. Then we’d go to school. We had a presence. We were rascals and fun and outrageous and didn’t give a shit. We weren’t shy.
AS: Were you getting in trouble all the time?
SP: We started. That’s how we start seventh grade. We smoke cigarettes in the bathroom. 
AS: What was your name?
SP: Susie Monster. I don’t even remember, in the seventh grade I’m sure I started getting suspended then. In the eighth grade I think it was Lisa and I, we had skipped out of school. We started dropping acid I think in the eighth grade, maybe not in the seventh. I think I was fourteen the first time I did acid. It was at a junior high fun night, the school dance. It just continued. Then the first day of ninth grade there was like four of us and we had planned, we got two joints and we were behind the school somewhere. There was a church across the street close to the junior high and we’re back there getting high. Somebody reported us so the principal comes from one way, the assistant principal from the other way. We’re caught and suspended from school. My mother was pissed. 
AS: How long were you suspended for?
SP: I think it was only three days. I don’t think we got more than three days. I had been on in-school suspension. Just in trouble. Still modular scheduling. All this independence to move around the school and these new found friends. All of the things that they talk about as things change for kids, junior high.
AS: Where were you getting your drugs?
SP: Lisa had an older brother Joel who was six years older than we were. He’s the same age as my sister Scary Mary. Joel was way into drugs. We weevilled from him. We knew people around town.
AS: So it was easy.
SP: It was very easy. We always hung out with older people, older siblings. We figured it out. We were resourceful. The LSD, I don’t remember how we got that. It was something that it just continued to escalate. In the ninth grade after I got caught, there was so much independence you could easily leave school. There wasn’t a lot of supervision by teachers. You were supposed to be accountable, there was passing time. You’d have a schedule and maybe mods one and two you were in Social Studies and then you’d have free time from mods five through eleven. I think there were eighteen in a day. Eighteen twenty-minute periods. You were expected to go to a resource center, use your time wisely, study, and not get in trouble, and not be caught in the hallways. We used it to our advantage. We had no fear. The ninth grade episode, whatever other friends we were with they got suspended, I got suspended. I went home. 
AS: That was the pot episode?
SP: Yes. I got out of my house. I moved in with my older brother. My oldest brother’s name is Chuck. He was always my hero. He liked me. I moved in with him and his wife and my nephew and niece. They were little. My nephew Tom must have been two years old. My niece Michelle must have been four or five. Chuck and Pam, my sister-in-law Pam twenty-two, twenty-three years old. My brother a couple years older than that. They loved to drink, they loved to party. Not smoke pot. 
AS: Did you just fight with your mom and leave? Is that what happened?
SP: Yes, I asked my brother if I could move in with him. I’d had enough of her shit. I had been leaving home, my oldest brother told me the last time I was up here two years ago, and we were talking about me and writing. That I had started writing again probably since 2006. He said to me, “Susie you were a writer since you learned how. You wrote to everybody.” I didn’t remember that. My mother took my diary when I was maybe sixteen, fifteen. I’d hidden it and she read it. It was used against me. I didn’t write after that. There’s this memory that he talks about in me writing. Then it comes back to me. From the time I was really little I’d write to my grandma. Floodwood, fifty miles away, Northern Minnesota. I would ask her if I could come stay with her. It would just be arranged. I don’t remember exactly how I got a stamp or if I figure out you didn’t need to necessarily have a stamp on the envelope. I knew where the mailbox was on the corner. It would be arranged. I’d have an uncle that would come and pick me up and I’d go to my grandma’s house for whatever number of days or she’d call my mother. As I got older I’d just hop on the Greyhound Bus and somebody’d meet me. My grandma knew that my mother was incompetent and could not protect her children. My grandma liked me. So I was allowed to come and stay. I started out really young just taking care of business. I’ve always known that I could only depend on myself. As time went on, and by the ninth grade the old man’s dead and shit’s happened. I’m an adolescent girl with hormones and I’ve got a period. 
AS: So you take off to live with them. Is it the same town? Are they in Cloquet?
SP: They’re in Cloquet, another part of town. I take off to live with them and he’s got more structure for me living with them. I’ve got responsibilities that I’ve got to do and can’t say no and wouldn’t talk back. I respect him. I could drink there. I could smoke cigarettes in front of them. I’m just enjoying it even more. My friends and I we just become more emboldened and empowered. More drugs, more acid. I’m not sure what else was in the mix in the ninth grade. Drinking, a lot of drinking. A lot of pot. I live with them for a year. My mother wants me to come home. I must have. My sophomore year I moved from the junior high to the high school which is on 18th Street. In the ninth grade Debbie Holman starts going to treatment. Debbie gets sent away. We all tried to understand that. We want to be badasses, hoods they’d call us. Debbie gets sent away. I remember there was conversation around that. I don’t know how we knew what we knew. 
AS: To drug treatment she gets sent away or she gets sent away for mental health?
SP: She gets sent away to drug treatment. I can’t think of what the name of that one was. Debbie can tell you. She’s gone for a long time. It is a therapeutic community. Fuck, Debbie had to wear a sign. She had to wear a sign in treatment. It said, “I’m a dirty slip-sliding junkie.” We were fourteen. Oh my God. It’s Debbie’s story to tell. There was shit that had to happen to us. 
AS: You were part of it. You’re not telling her story, you’re telling it from your…
SP: It was intense. We didn’t know. You don’t talk about stuff, it’s Northern Minnesota. It’s the 60s, the early 70s. Things might be changing, things might be becoming more liberal but not in Northern Minnesota. There’s a tradition. Girls are not supposed to be wild and out of hand and rebellious and have a club that is all about getting high and getting over. We did. It was like, “Fuck you. You think we shouldn’t do this? Well we’re going to show you what we can do.” We didn’t care. We had fun. Debbie goes to treatment. 
AS: Are you sexually active at this point?
SP: We become sexually active. 
AS: Were you being stalked or abused?
SP: There’s abuse. 
AS: While you were drunk or high.
SP: There was always but it wasn’t really talked about a lot. It was talked about after the fact among some of us. We’re an ever expanding group. Junior high, ninth grade, tenth grade we start to take on momentum. There’s the core group: Crazy Mad Dog, Wee Helvi, and there’s Connie. There’s Peggy and there’s Debbie and there’s Berta and there’s Brenda and there’s Pixie. Debbie’s name is Crazy Fry Brain of the Weed Weevils. 
AS: So there’re a dozen of you?
SP: Yes, easily a dozen of us. Really we just feed off one another and we all have similarities. There’s Robin and there’s Jennifer. Jennifer had mono, something happened to her in junior high. Maybe mono was just the excuse. I don’t know if she had some sort of mental breakdown. She came back to school and things were never really the same with her. We all start becoming sexually active. Parties and drinking. 
AS: I got you off track, Debbie comes back.
SP: What I remember is I’d start out on my corner of 18th Street, stop by her house in the morning. We’d sit up in her bedroom and do bong hits. Then we would listen to Cat Stevens “Father and Son.” Get ready and then we’d walk to high school further down 18th Street and maybe do some bong hits in the bathroom stalls. Smoke some cigarettes for sure. Get ready for school and there was a bunch of girls in there smoking cigarettes. It was just known, the first floor bathroom you smoked cigarettes. There was graffiti in the stalls. By the time we were sixteen I don’t remember if Debbie stays in high school the whole time or if she comes and goes during different periods of time there. I think she was around for the most part. We continued to get high. That’s a routine and more acid. Berta gets pregnant at sixteen. I think we were sixteen. 
Connie’s sister Gail, the beautiful one, she moves to Minneapolis. She quit school. Gail lives in a house down off of Lake Street. There used to be a grocery school called Applebaum’s. She’s living down there with this black dude named Sunny Gangs. I get introduced to Curtis Mayfield, somewhere around in there. I think it was Sunny Gangs, he loved that music. I just bought that CD for the road trip. I found it somewhere cheap. That’s what’s funny about memories. We would hitchhike, we would leave Cloquet. Debbie and Connie and I, we’d hitchhike from Cloquet down to Minneapolis. We went to Gail and Sunny’s house one time. These two guys gave us a ride. They were crazy. Debbie and I still laugh about us. They bought us a half gallon of vodka, drinking on the way down. We get down here and we go to Applebaum’s shoplifting food. You steal everything. That’s part of the Weed Weevil club thing. You save your money for drugs and you steal things, shoplift, a way of making money. We get caught shoplifting in Applebaum’s. Connie and I get to go back to her sister’s house but Debbie gets taken. She gets taken away to juvie or something because she’s got priors. She’s got history. 
Our antics just increased. We become more empowered. Growing up angry, frustrated. Debbie goes away. There’s always some different pairing of friends within this group. Some of us become closer. It’s a dance. Berta gets pregnant and has that baby, Amanda. I don’t think that baby fared very well. There was a lot of sexual abuse in that household—things that we learned after the fact. All of these girls, some of us do drugs differently than others. 
The eleventh grade I go to live with my sister Dianne in Duluth. She’s got three boys. I have three nephews. Her oldest one is Ricky. He’s two years younger than I am. Then there’s my brother Michael two and a half years younger than I am. We’re close, the three of us. We grew up together. Ricky, smart, smart guy. Not a lick of common sense. He deals drugs. He deals hash, probably sold pot. They’re in to partying. I’m into getting hash from him. There’s just more drugs. I don’t remember exactly what happened but he came to live at my mother’s house. He always lived and spent a lot of time with us. I go to live with my sister in an apartment in Duluth. At least for half of the year. Maybe the full year my junior year is spent at Central High School. 
Dianne and I were close in many ways to the degree that we were close in my family. She talked a lot about experiences. She was beautiful. She had long, dark black hair. She wore in a long braid down her back. She looked like an Indian. Indians are discriminated against in Northern Minnesota. She’s half Greek, she’s beautiful. She’s my mother’s first child. My mother never let anybody forget that she’d had a first husband that she really loved. He was killed and she married Charlie by default and she has these kids by him but really Dianne’s the favorite. My sister grows up; to the time she’s twelve years old in the family house. It must have been in Esko with the old man beating the shit out of her. She goes to high school in Esko. This small town, smaller than Cloquet, with black eyes and split lips. I don’t know what happened in there. My grandma thinks that my mother’s incompetent, can’t raise her children, all of that. It really gets established with Dianne. Dianne is sent to reform school in Southern Minnesota, Sauk Centre. A couple different places, Red Wing maybe. She’s sent away. She never comes home to live. She, at seventeen, has Ricky this baby. Her first marriage. Lives in Duluth. Then she would be divorced a lot of different times. When I go to live with her when I’m a junior in high school it’s one of those times when she’s not married. She and I would talk. We would talk about trying to sort out what had happened growing up. She’d talk about her experience being sent away and the violence. We tried to understand why our mother didn’t protect us. There was always this curiosity and trying to understand what happened, our trauma. 
AS: So you’re sixteen when you go to live with her and she’s how old?
SP: She’s like seventeen years older than I am.
AS: So she’s like thirty one. 
SP: Yes. She’s close to my mother at the same time. 
AS: Just trying to understand it. 
SP: In many ways hates my mother. Angry, pissed off. That dynamic is just so hard. My sister Dianne wants to be friends with me and friends with my friends. My sister Dianne when I think about music, I was introduced to different music by each of my siblings. My sister Dianne introduced me to the blues. I think from the time I was two years old I’ve loved the blues. Otis Redding, Little Richard, oh my God, Ray Charles. My sister Dianne was a brown girl that loved the blues. That understanding of what it means to be a brown girl when you’re non-white started with her. When I’d go to stay with my grandma all those times, all the old ladies from Floodwood would get together which is considered so Minnesotan, a little lunch. Then they’d want to do the run down where I fit in in the sequence of siblings. Old people, “Oh you’re Dorothy’s daughter.” They’d have me do this run down. I’d say my sister Dianne. It happened without fail. There was always that qualified. “She’s only your half-sister.” 
AS: Is this because she was Greek? Just because of her dark hair? Did she have a dark complexion? 
SP: Yes, she’s beautiful. She looks like a Native woman. Yes. There’s all of that stuff. It just gets layered and layered. I live with her. We’re close. As close as we can be. I don’t trust any of them. There’s this thing of wanting Dorothy’s attention. My mother always encouraged divide and conquer. If she could ammunition against one of her children that was so much the better for her. There’s no trust. I think Dianne tried to be a supportive big sister and take care of me, look out for me as she possibly could. I think I need a bathroom break. 
[Break in Recording]
SP: So I live with her for my junior year. I move back to Cloquet for my senior year in high school. That was just a year of partying. My mother left town for a month and went to the West Coast. It was crazy. My brothers and I, we had a whole month to party in that house. We had a plan. We had Operation Bar Glass. Preparing for my mother to leave town so we could party and have a fun time. We covered up her china cabinet and all of this stuff. 
AS: Just to protect it?
SP: Just to protect things. We had Operation Bar Glass, we had all these other glasses. We were trying to take care of the house to the best of our ability and have a party. It was huge. It was a lot of fun in many ways. There were constantly people in that house. My nephew that deals hash. There was always somebody there and we were getting high. We’d have parties. Sneaking into the bars in Northern Minnesota at seventeen, eighteen years old. We’d bring the party home to the house. Somebody talked about how the streets were lined with cars. There was nowhere to park to go into the house. They were fun parties. They didn’t totally destroy the house. We had a lot of people there, a lot of friends. 
There were a lot of things that got talked about after the fact. Apparently one friend was raped during the party. I don’t know how the circumstances were talked about. The friend Connie, she certainly struggles with mental health issues now. She brought it up earlier this year she was up visiting me, asking if I remembered. I don’t know that I remember. There’s pieces of it sort of, snippets. Things weren’t really acknowledged. They just went on. We went on. We continued to party. I left Cloquet right after graduation and went to Minneapolis and then went on further, Colorado. The Weed Weevils slowly dispersed. There were a lot of things that happened, drug use that increased. People that went to treatment like Debbie in and out. It was at the time when girls still wanted to get married out of high school. I think maybe more settled.
AS: When did you graduate high school?
SP: 1978. All I ever wanted from Cloquet was to leave Cloquet. I was leaving, no two ways about it. I had established more of a life in Minneapolis. I talked about hitchhiking down there and we’d stay with Gail. We continued to go down there, drinking in Moby Dick’s at eighteen, underage.
AS: Was it underage in the 70s?
SP: Nineteen was the legal drinking age in Minnesota at that point. It kind of shifted back and forth. I’d been drinking in Superior, Wisconsin for a long time. It was just across the bridge. Minnesota was still nineteen. We would drink in Moby Dick’s. I don’t know if you’re familiar with Moby’s. It used to be downtown on Hennepin Avenue, down by the Gay 90s and Augie’s. We would drink in there. The first time I was ever in the Gay 90s I’d been doing acid. It was crazy. The friend Brenda, her older brother Bobby was HIV positive, a gay man. He hung out at the Gay 90s all the time. We had an in with older people continually. At Moby’s that place had a reputation. Downtown Minneapolis in the 70s with pimps and sex workers with big hats with feathers. We were in hog heaven. It was fun. It was entertaining. It was a challenge. It wasn’t boring. We never liked to be boring. 
AS: Was it scary to you ever? Was it dangerous?
SP: Certainly should have been. Should have been scared. Connie met this guy, some black man that we’d met. There weren’t really black guys in Northern Minnesota. Not in Cloquet, there might have been one. I remember her taking off with him. She just talked about this too. She was gone for a few days. She tells some wild story around what happened. None of it was good. Real, imagined I’m not sure. Probably to some degree very real. Kidnapped. 
Then during that time I don’t know if we were seventeen or eighteen, Connie’s sister Gail, the beautiful one, living with Sunny Gangs. She is a prostitute in Minneapolis, strung out on heroin. She ends up dying. The story goes that she was on a golf course in Vadnais Heights and she was wearing a lot of silver, turquoise necklaces, bracelets. When the lightning struck because of the jewelry. I don’t know whether that’s a true story, if that’s what we were told. She ends up dead anyways. 
AS: From a lightning strike?
SP: That’s what they said. She’s dead. Sunny Gangs right around that time is accused of killing a cop. We’re living on the North side of Minneapolis. There’s myself and there’s Robin and Jennifer. Connie lives in South Minneapolis. She lives over on Cedar Avenue over by Little Earth. We had gotten in a car accident on Cedar Avenue. We’d been down partying at Moby Dick’s. Then we had some people in the car with us. I think there were two guys and four girls. We’re on our way to some party. Connie hit a parked car. I ended up having my forehead cut open. Jennifer was in the front seat; she hit the windshield and had glass in her face. We were the only two hurt. There was an ambulance going by as it happened. It was an old Plymouth Valiant. I think they pulled me out through the window and into the ambulance. I remember this old guy saying because I think we had a bag of weed or we had other drugs in the car. What I remember is him telling me that he wasn’t going to do anything about that. The drugs weren’t going to be talked about. They brought us to HCMC.
AS: Who was telling you that? The cop?
SP: What I remember is a cop. That I was in an ambulance. I was laid out on the gurney. I think he saw us as wild young girls. 
AS: Maybe take it for themselves.
SP: Yes, right. We’re brought to HCMC and Jennifer’s face is cleaned out and I’m stitched up. They just let us go. They let us go. That was right at my nineteenth birthday. I’d been in three car accidents in three months. I think I’d been in Montana on a little road trip with Lisa and this woman Peggy. That wasn’t really our fault, not necessarily drugs involved. There’d been that. There was the one in Minneapolis. Then I’m back in Northern Minnesota in Cloquet for Christmas and New Year’s. Lisa and I get in a car accident on Carleton Avenue and I hit the windshield again and we’re drunk. I think I’d had a concussion. They put me in the hospital then. It was always something. 
We live in Minneapolis and then Lisa wants to go on a road trip. She calls me up. She’s still living in Cloquet, I’m in Minneapolis. She calls me up at like midnight. She proposes this road trip that we would leave Minnesota on the fifteenth of June, we’d have a pound of pot. Lisa was always a planner. We would go through the Black Hills and we’d camp along the way. Then we’d go to Gillette, Wyoming because there was the oil shale boom or something there. All these people from Cloquet had gone there to work. Gillette is an armpit of Wyoming. We’d go through Yellowstone and up to Seattle, down the West Coast and then into Mexico. We’d take this trip. I remember saying to her, “You’re drunk. Call me back tomorrow when you’re sober.” Which she does. I’m like, “Okay. I’m game but we’ve got to go a month later and only two ounces of pot. We’re not bringing a pound Lisa. We could get in trouble with a pound.” We do the road trip. As it turns out with left with expired tabs. We make this road trip, party the whole way. Yellowstone, the Northwest, we get to Tacoma and spend some time because Robin’s living there. We surprise her. Robin was pregnant and we didn’t know it at the time. We leave, have a great time. Party the whole way. We travelled for six weeks. We didn’t go into Mexico. We ran out of money in Arizona at the border. I had to call my brother. He wired some to Durango. 
We get to Colorado, we get to Denver, and I’ve got a friend there who I’ve known since I was fifteen years old. She came to live in Cloquet when she was fifteen. Her uncle was the assistant principal at the high school. She’s still a part of my life. She lives down the mountain in Allen’s Park. We go to her house, her and her mom’s house in Denver. We get some day labor jobs in Denver. Lisa and I get enough money to go up the mountain to Summit County. I think we’d seen a Keystone Resort ad in the paper, in the Denver Post or something. We think, “We’re going up there.” We get a job at the employment office. It’s the boom of construction in Summit County. Just really starting to be built up. There’s all the little towns, Breckenridge and Silver Thorn and Frisco and Dylan. Lisa and I get this job up on Wilderness, up on the mountain as construction laborers. Moving this guy from one unit to another building. He pays us in cash. He lets us camp in the finished condos. We think is great. We get a bunch of money for working and we go out on a Friday night and again underage drinking. Now it’s twenty one in Colorado and we’re nineteen. 
We met up with the locals right away. We get a room to rent on Silver Lane in Silverthorne at this guy Bob Dennis’s house. Lisa and I have bunk beds and we live across the street from the Mint Saloon. We think we have died and gone to heaven. Willie Nelson used to drink over at the Mint Saloon. Oh it was fun. We’re out of Cloquet. We get in with the locals. I met my first husband there, Ron. He was friends with some other people that lived in that house. When Lisa and I had gotten there it was somewhere in there, we did acid. I got some Red Dragon acid in the mail. We’d do acid and hang out at the lake. Still did other drugs like cocaine had been a part of my life for quite a while. There’s tons of cocaine in Summit County.
AS: Now we’re in the early 80s.
SP: It’s 1979, late ‘79. I meet Ron. He’s into injecting cocaine. He’s got long hair. I immediately think he is something. He’s vegetarian, lives in some old trailer. The mountains are not developed. A lot of people lived lives with wood stoves for heat, kerosene lamps, vegetarians. Kind of that sort of mountain hippie lifestyle, the Grateful Dead. Ron’s got a trailer. I just think, “Oh my God he’s cooler than shit.” I picked up with him. It must have been late August, first of September 1979. It’s not long and I’m living with him in this trailer. Maybe before that. Ron liked to drink. He liked to drink Jack Daniels and he’d turn the bottle upside and do bubbles as he called them. It was a violent relationship from the very start. 
He had this old trailer, those really old ones, a lot of them are still left up there. It’s this narrow hallway, a straight line of rooms. I walk in and he’s in the back. He’s in the bathroom with this guy. This biker named Steve. It’s sort of that Go Ask Alice moment. It’s dark, lowlights and Ron’s tied off with a syringe in his arm with cocaine. It was a dramatic moment. I called it the Go Ask Alice moment because Go Ask Alice was supposed to be the scared straight movie. It was the 70s. I got the rinse. Whatever is left is the residue. You put in a little water to make sure you get everything out. You don’t want to waste what’s in that syringe. It didn’t do anything for me. Maybe opened up a new way of thinking. I was always curious. Why not try it? I think at the time that’s a fairly isolated incident. 
AS: That was it? You just tried it and it didn’t do anything exciting?
SP: Yes, and Ron and I continued to live together. Certainly I didn’t think, “Oh my God, he’s not for me.” 
AS: You were primed for violence.
SP: Yes. So we go to Oregon. My mother is living in Southern Oregon again. She moved back and forth between Oregon and Minnesota more times than I could count. Her and brother Michael, my brother Michael must be still seventeen or something. I get pregnant with Christa. We moved back to Colorado. She is born in October of 1980. She’s a cesarean section. We rent the house on Silver Lane, the same one that I started out renting a room in. We get to rent the whole house. There’s rooms upstairs that we rent out to other people. Lisa lives with us in that house, rents a room. It’s Ron and Lisa and I downstairs. Christa comes home, new baby. I might have occasionally smoked pot while I was pregnant with Christa. I really didn’t smoke cigarettes, I tried to quit. Ron’s violent. I left him. 
AS: Is he hitting you?
SP: Yes. He’s crazy. 
AS: Sorry I have to ask.
SP: You should ask. There’s a lot of it that I don’t really remember. There was one time he’s got me, I’m on the couch I’m nine months pregnant. I’ve got my knees pulled to my chest to the degree that you can in that situation. There’s a coffee table that was homemade out of two by fours. Those thick pieces of wood, it’s L-shaped. He breaks that table. What I remember is him holding a piece of it over my head. It doesn’t connect with me. It’s really threatening. I don’t really remember then what happened there. I know that I run out of the house and that I’m hiding across the road in the ditch. I don’t know what happens after that. I end up leaving Ron. Maybe that incident. Maybe it was the night before my baby shower there was something. I don’t really know where I went. 
AS: When you left him?
SP: I left for a while. Didn’t I leave? I think I left. 
AS: While you were still pregnant?
SP: Yes, but I don’t really remember that. I don’t know if I just went back in the house. I don’t know. It seems like I left. But if I did I wasn’t gone long. It’s close to the due date. I don’t know. I delivered Christa. She’s born. I go back there. I live with them. My twenty-first birthday was the seventh of September, 1980. I remember thinking that for many people that are twenty one they want to go to the bar because that’s legal drinking age. It wasn’t a big deal for me at that point. I’d been in the bar for years. I didn’t see the excitement of it. Some people came over for a little birthday party. I wasn’t drinking. I took it serious. Christa was a tiny baby. I’ve always loved babies. The bedroom was off the living room. There was a rocking chair in there. I was sitting in there breast feeding Christa. Ron came in and he punched me in the face. Punched me in the mouth. I’m not sure why. What my offense was at that point. It seemed out of the blue. He was remorseful the next day and all of that happy shit that goes along with that. That would just continue. 
AS: How long did you stay with him?
SP: Christa was six. I don’t remember how it happened. Within there Christa was a year old. I started injecting again with Ron. I think it was Christa’s first birthday, no it’s not Christa’s first birthday. It is Ron’s birthday. I don’t know if he was turning twenty five. He must have been. We have this birthday party. His birthday’s the eighteenth of March. October to March however old Christa was. She’s there taking care of her. We have this party. I think it’s there that I start injecting again. 
AS: Cocaine?
SP: Yes. That would continue for a while. For at least a year. The times when I can get along with Ron, he used to talk about bell ringers or ear ringers. Cocaine was described that way. If you were injecting you’d get an ear ringer. That was a good hit. I’m sure I was curious about that. He would always take off with the paycheck. He was a paint contractor. He made good money but there wasn’t ever really money. I get into injecting with him. It makes life easier. We can communicate better. I’d put the kids to bed and we’d sit up and get high.
AS: You have more than one kid at this point?
SP: There’s Christa and then Ron’s got a daughter by a previous marriage. It wasn’t even a marriage, this woman that he lived with, Caroline. Caroline went by Rosie. She was German. Her parents had immigrated to the United States from Germany, Carola and Hans Wolf. They owned a delicatessen in Keystone. Keystone Resort is a small resort. Keystone opened in 1975. This is ‘79. It’s a very small county, it’s just starting. It’s profound because the ski industry and all that it brings. 
AS: So you end up with the daughter somehow?
SP: We end up with the daughter Jenny when she is four years old. Ron had never really had much for visitation, didn’t really know her well. They’d split up when she was a baby. Jenny is so abused by the time she’s four years old. We just get her on emergency, something had happened. There was an incident. We go to court in Breckenridge and we end up having her. She’s part of it. I am twenty one years old and parenting this little girl who’d been so severely abused, physically, mentally, emotionally, sexually by the whole family including her mother. There’s that. Jenny is four, Christa is one, Ron likes to move. 
We move down to the Western Slope. He’s working jobs. He doesn’t really stay down there. I’m left down there. Drugs are still involved, not injecting. Pills ground up on bong hits. I don’t know. Drugs are always a part of the situation in greater degrees with Ron. They’re never completely absent from my life. I have something in me, my own life experience whatever it was, reducing the harm, reducing the use. Trying to navigate situations.
AS: Would you say that you at that time felt like you were in control of your use? Is that what you’re talking about? 
SP: Yes, I would say I had more control over my use. 
AS: Your life didn’t spin out of control?
SP: I was never a chaotic drug user to the way that I would describe that. 
AS: You were able to take care of the people you were supposed to?
SP: Take care of the kids. 
AS: Take care of yourself as best you could with Ron. 
SP: Yes. I had grown up in chaos. I didn’t want chaos for my children at all. Jenny’s a part of it. Christa’s a baby. Ron moves me to the Western Slope but he’s working in Summit County. He always moved around and I never had a voice. I just went along with it. There was a time; I can remember visiting him in Summit County in the town of Frisco. We were staying in some hotel room. He’d beat the shit out of me there too and I left. I couldn’t leave with Jenny. I didn’t feel like I could leave with her. She wasn’t my child. It was hard having Jenny. Really, really hard. She’s got a lot of issues. 
I’ve got Christa and we leave. I think I leave for the summer. I go to my mother’s in Oregon and from there we went to my family’s in Minnesota. I end up going back to Ron. I end up getting pregnant with my son Blake. The patterns just continue. Drug use really isn’t a part of my life at all. I’m living up in Leadville. Jenny is abusive. She’s sexually abusive to Christa. I feel like I had no understanding of that. I just knew that something, Christa had been potty trained and she’d developed a yeast infection. I had taken her to the doctor. Certainly I know Jenny’s fucked up and there’s issues. Talking about it and starting to gain some insights. 
Ron’s always gone and his lifestyle just continues. He’s violent. I’m figuring a way to get out of this situation. Jenny goes to live in a foster home. She eventually ends up in state hospital in Pueblo. She’s not bad enough to be there so she gets sent to a group home in Denver, Mt. St. Vincent. It still exists. Ron doesn’t participate. I try to, to the best of my ability, to go to meetings and stuff like that. Now I’ve got Blake and he’s born a month premature. There’s violence during the pregnancy. He’s born a month premature in Leadville. Jenny, the parental rights were severed of Ron’s and of the mother. The mother, Caroline aka Rosie, she was told that if she did not sever her parental rights that she would be prosecuted. Jenny lives at Mt. St. Vincent’s for years and is eventually adopted. She’s defined as a success story given the circumstances of her life. As she was older once she turned eighteen I had contact with her. 
During those years in between there was a social worker in Steamboat, I lived in Steamboat too. She was really great, really wonderful. In one letting me know that it wasn’t my fault, that I’d done the best I could by her. That story sort of comes to an end. 
Jenny leaves, we move to Leadville, from Leadville we move to Summit County down the mountain. Leadville’s over ten thousand feet high, it’s a high mountain town. They’re beautiful and they’re crazy. Summit County, we move there. Ron is still a paint contractor. His drug use continues. He starts dealing drugs. I think around that time, I’d be sort of in and out of use. I think that injecting may have been something that happened occasionally, maybe more snorting. Ron is certainly spinning out of control. Not that he had much to start with. Things are getting crazy. I’m trying to get away from him. He flushed fifteen thousand dollars’ worth of cocaine down the toilet. Frisco’s a small town, maybe there’s four thousand people. A tourist town, the cops don’t care. It’s the wild, wild West in the mountains. You can get away with anything you damn well please up there. He told me that he thought he was being followed by; he was at the Moose Jaw bar, an ambulance and a corvette. He crawled through a creek bed getting away.
AS: So he’s losing it at this point.
SP: He is losing his shit. Flushes fifteen thousand dollars’ worth down the toilet. He’s still working on job sites. He travels with two guns.
AS: So he’s paranoid.
SP: Oh my God he’s so paranoid. 
AS: He has guns?
SP: He’s got guns. Yes. He had guns.
AS: What’s your escape plan at this point? Do you have one?
SP: I was working on one. We live in a couple little houses in the town of Frisco. Probably non-payment of rent, whatever it was that’s why we moved. Then we moved to this little other area of the county, Willowbrook, in this house. I’m trying to get away. To the best of my ability get away. I always knew that if I wanted to get away I wouldn’t be able to take much with me. 
AS: And you’re at your most vulnerable when you have left or you’re about to leave. That’s when you’re most at risk of being killed. 
SP: During this time this house in Willowbrook, a split level house. I’d been cleaning condos. He was extremely paranoid. It’s a subdivision. There’s tracks through the snow and he’d think that people were coming over to the house. He’d make me take my kids to work with me because he thought I was fucking somebody on the side. It’s really a heightened state of alert. I’m trying to get away. He’s becoming increasingly dangerous. I couldn’t shower by myself. I’m telling him I’ve got to get away. I need a divorce. We’re getting high so that I can talk to him. It makes it so much easier. He agrees. His rationale is that if I went back to Southern Oregon where my mother was he’d give me a divorce. We’re going to move together because that’s how it’s going to happen. I don’t know if it’s within a week of us moving, a couple days, the house is packed up. I have these really good friends and old neighbors, Mary Ann and Mac. We go to their house for dinner. Ron had been drinking all day long. He would be so ugly, so unpredictable. We go there for dinner, he drinks the whole way through it. You can read people. I know that things aren’t going to be good. I get in the car and he’s saying shit the whole way home. What happens next is that he beat me in front of my kids. I think they thought I was dead. He rapes me. I still don’t really know how to get away from him. The next day, I don’t remember exactly how it happens; I talked to Mary Ann and Mac. I go to their house. They see my face is just a mess. They’re like, “Susie you’ve got to go. We’re going to give you this money and you’ve got to go.” 
Little by little I start putting together a plan. I was never going to raise my children in a house like I grew up in. My friend Denise she goes with me. We plan it. I strategically put things through the house and the next day Ron leaves with my brother. They had to go down to Denver for something. I put my kids in the back seat and I said, “You don’t move. Stay right here.” I threw whatever I could throw in my car and I drove away. I left. I went to Oregon. He follows me. I knew that he was following me. I started out in Southern Oregon in Grants Pass. I’ve got relatives all through. My sister flies in and meets me, my sister Dianne. We drive back to Minnesota together. I leave Ron. 
AS: He just follows but you didn’t see him?
SP: Never saw him again. No, I stayed one step ahead of him the whole time.
AS: Then he never comes to Minnesota?
SP: I think at one point he’s there looking for me. He didn’t know where I was. I lived downtown Minneapolis, I lived in the Elliot Park neighborhood. Another saga begins. 
AS: So you never see him again? How do you get divorced from him? You were married?
SP: I was still married to him. I live in Elliot Park. Oh my God the people involved in my life there, love them, love them, love them. I come back and I’m staying with my sister Dianne over in Richfield, South Minneapolis. During that time, I hadn’t ever really thought about it like this, my mother had remarried and she’s living with this man in Southern Oregon. While the time that I’m leaving and moving back to Minneapolis my mother moves back. It was nuts. She’s got my daughter Christa, I’ve got Blake. Staying at my sister Dianne’s house. I’m looking for housing, getting on welfare. Five hundred and twenty eight bucks a month AFDC. I think I still have a car payment to make. I’m looking for places to live downtown Minneapolis and on Franklin Avenue. Oh my God Franklin was such a dump. It’s really sort of like a Go Ask Alice junkie crazy environment. That’s like 1986. There hadn’t been gentrification started yet. Somehow through all the phone calls, different things I end up with subsidized housing in the Elliot Park neighborhood. 
I meet this guy, Ira Simms. My sister Dianne and I used to call him the black Tom Selleck of Elliot Park. He was a handsome man. Ira liked me. I get to know him. We get to be friends. He gives me a unit to live in. He says he’s got a place to live. It is 1601 Elliot, the top unit; it had been rehabbed, one of those old houses, Section Eight housing. I paid a hundred dollars a month. Ira liked to smoke crack. My friend Jennifer, I get reunited with her. Jennifer likes to do cocaine too. Her plan is she’s got a good job, works for some insurance company. We’ll just buy a whole bunch and do as much as we can and get sick of it. I’m not injecting but I’ve got a craving. Things had happened, goofy things. I started smoking crack with Ira. That was a horrible experience. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried crack. 
AS: I have not tried crack.
SP: It is toxic. It is gross, it is disgusting. It hurts. I moved Jennifer in, she pays rent. It helps with money. I don’t remember. I moved it that place in the spring maybe, March, February maybe. I moved into this apartment. Then I live there, I’m not even in there a year. Ron doesn’t know where I’m at. Maybe I’ve been there a few months; he doesn’t know where I am. He had an address and a phone number for my sister. He’d been in Minneapolis looking for me. Something weird had happened then too. I got some phone calls. Something had happened. Nothing comes of it. I’d been warned, he goes back to Colorado. He’d occasionally call my sister. She would arrange for the kids and I to be at her house at a certain time. This is landlines, there’s no cellphones, there’s no three way call either. 
AS: And he never gets my phone number?
SP: He never gets my phone number. Not allowed. We go to my sister’s on Friday that’d she’d arranged. At this point I’d had my kids, Christa for sure I think Blake was too young, there was a group started in Minnesota. It’s the holy land of treatment, social services, all of it. I had Christa in this newly forming group, it was called Children are People Too. It was for kids, I think it was in the Linden Hills neighborhood. It was for kids that came from substance using parents or trauma. I have no idea how I got hooked up with it. It was one of those early sort of hippie, social services. We’d started that. 
There’s that weekend and my sister arranges for us to be at her house for him to call. He talks to the kids maybe just talked to Christa. He kind of ignored Blake. I have a conversation with him. He’s nuts and I know this at this point. He’s back in Colorado. When he’d been in Oregon my mother would talk about him being catatonic and the neighbor’s yard. He just continued down this path with this speedball, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. He gets back to Colorado. He’s living with a woman out in Plains, he calls talking crazy. What I remember saying to him is that, “My life would be so much better if yours was just over.” Those are my parting words to him. 
The following week, a nice day in Minneapolis, it’s warm, it’s in the seventies. I’m at Lake Nokomis with my kids. I come back and get a phone call from my nephew and Ron’s dead. He stepped out of a moving car. The county coroner from Greeley, the only number they had was my sister’s. The county coroner in Greeley called. Calls and tells my nephew all of this stuff. Craig thinks it could be a hoax. People do crazy shit and Ron did crazy shit. He hung out with a bunch of people. He takes down all the information and then he calls me and tells me about all of it. I have to call Ron’s dad. I have to call the county coroner. He was a really formidable; he’d been an executive for AT&T. Ron was the youngest child and always the problem child. I have to listen to this man tell me about all of it and how they verified that it was him. Ron’s dead. I got two kids, living in Elliot Park. It was a come to Jesus moment, profound, life changing. 
AS: Was it just a huge, incredible relief?
SP: It was so life changing. It was a huge relief on so many levels. I remember thinking first and foremost that for sure I was a single parent. There was no optimism, no hope for the future. Ron was never going to get better. Very cut and dried. You don’t hold out hope anymore. I didn’t have to be afraid. I could come and go. To the degree that would be physically possible, the rest was something else. 
AS: You didn’t have to think about the moment when he might show up and do something.
SP: Ever again.
AS: To you or the kids or sabotage you. He’s out of the picture. 
SP: He’s dead.
AS: He’s just what you asked for a week before. 
SP: Yes, right. 
AS: That’s so crazy.
SP: It was crazy. I go to the funeral. I go out to Colorado. I don’t take my kids. My brother comes down from Northern Minnesota and picks them up. I go out there. My friend Lisa meets me at the airport. She holds my hand. It’s a visitation and I see him laying in the casket. His parents put him in a suit. He had been airborne. He’d been in this car with this woman Holly. Holly had no regard for life whatsoever. Ron had been in this town for three months and had been eighty sixed out of most bars. We go to her house. We pick through Ron’s shit. It was like picking through a garbage dump. 
We listen to Holly, I’d already had a phone conversation with her and she talks about the experience and what happened that day with Ron. Kind of piecing it together. They’d been drinking and in the bars. She talks about how in between Fort Lupton and this town of Hudson, it’s an old rural road, dark, no lights. That he looked over at her and said goodbye and stepped out of the car. The accident report said she was going thirty, thirty five miles per hour. He was airborne and he hit a sign that took off the top of his head. He died by the side of the road. It was ruled a homicide. 
AS: He jumped out of the car?
SP: Supposedly yes. He stepped out. That was her story. He’d also been prospecting for some bikers out of Boulder. I don’t know rolled over on a dope deal somewhere. He hung out with people who were intense and dangerous. Very little regard for life, drugs were always a part of it. Shit happened. It is a scary story isn’t it?
AS: So scary.
SP: I’m never real sure if I should be scared or what I should do with it. A pause would be good.
[Break in Recording]
AS: We’re back. Part two.
SP: Ron died. I have my kids, Christa in some support group for little kids. I go to therapy and talk about the fact that my parting words to him that it would be better if his life was over. It was interesting in that the therapist talked a lot about, “You know you weren’t responsible for his death Sue.” I was like, “Oh, I thought that I was.” What a relief that is to hear somebody say it. I don’t know if I internalized that message. I learned a lot from it. I’ve never said something like that to anybody again. Maybe haven’t felt the need. How powerful that was. From there, my sister Dianne and I we went to adult children of alcoholics meetings. She introduced me. We went at Abbott Hospital. I remember thinking, it was an all-women’s group, and they might as well have been speaking Chinese because I couldn’t understand them and what they were saying. I couldn’t contribute. I was afraid to talk, afraid of my emotions overwhelming me. I didn’t know how to talk about a dead husband. Really, how do you talk about that? 
AS: Not to mention all the abuse you suffered under him. You were like shell shocked. Right? Would that be fair to say?
SP: It’s easy to say that. I think the day when I found out that he had died, I don’t know if he would talk about ghosts, stuff like that. I just remember thinking, “Now the bastard’s everywhere.” In some ways there was no containing him. Not being able to sleep and always looking over my shoulder, making sure that he was dead. When I saw the body I looked for the paint under his fingernails just to make sure that it was really him. Because of that and that experience and being able to understand it and begin to process it then, I would say that I’m not completely done processing it. A real commitment to wanting to break that cycle of substance use and mental health issues. Not knowing how just knowing that it couldn’t happen. It was just so important to figure out the key. But it’s not a nice and neat little tidy package. It doesn’t happen like that. I think that I thought if I went to therapy, if I went to school, if I did this, if I did that I would guard against it. If my kids had a college education, if I had a college education. If I made more money, if I did this, if I did that. That’s bullshit. That’s not happening. 
I don’t know if it was a year. My desire was to get back to Colorado. It wasn’t long after Ron died, maybe the following fall, a year; I’m not sure how long. Within a couple years I was back in Colorado. I started out managing a Safeway grocery store, their delicatessen. The sense that I could be and do something more. I could rise above it and made a better wage and worked there, health insurance and creating a better life. I married again. I have a son Kelly. The marriage lasted a couple years. We moved back to Minneapolis. I went back to school for the third time. During the time that Ron died I tried to go back to school. I was going to go to St. Mary’s. It’s part of St. Kate’s now and be a chemical dependency counselor. That wasn’t happening. I didn’t make it in school. I went back to Colorado. 
Came back, went back to school at MCTC and started in Women’s Studies. I had success. I did well in school, I learned and it opened up other worlds. I made a decision to get a divorce. Jim was an improvement over Ron. He still had a drug use history, verbally abusive. I went back to school and that saved my life. It was the beginning of Women With a Point. I did projects related to needle exchange. I read a book The Opposing Viewpoints Series on AIDS. They had talked about needle exchange in it. They’d also talked about gay men. It was a woman who wrote it, her brother had died of AIDS. She described it as a twisted celebration of an immoral life. I thought, “Wow, how could you say something like that?” Isn’t that horrible? It prompted something in me. 
I should go back and say that around the time that Ron died, I was trying to get a divorce. Living in Elliot Park, I had a neighbor Susan Beecher. She’s a photographer in Minneapolis, a wonderful human being. She was my neighbor. I had people across the street. I had a legal aid attorney that lived across the street handling my case. They were trying to serve him by publication when he died. I was still married to him. I got social security for my kids, survivor benefits. I got survivor benefits for me. It raised me up and out of poverty a little bit. It was such a life changing event. In so many ways. The aftermath of it still continues. Ron never really got fully talked about I don’t think. In that I tried to share with my kids only good stories about Ron. 
AS: Do they remember anything about Ron?
SP: Certainly Christa does. Blake has never really talked about him. Blake had said when he died, one day we were in the car and he’s in the backseat and he’s like, “Can’t believe my dad’s dead meat.” I’m like, “Alrighty.” One time we were in the art museum and there was an exhibit, maybe it was at the Walker, it was a pile of what looked like dog bones. He looks at me and he’s like, “Are those my dad’s bones?” I’m like, “Wow.” I think the first thing that he had said or Christa said when I told them that Ron was dead, they said, “Now we don’t have to be afraid anymore.” It was huge. My daughter Christa has struggled all her life around the death of her dad. She was diagnosed bipolar when she was fifteen. Maybe she was seventeen, depressive before that. Certainly in retrospect, in knowing more I can say that at age eight for sure that Christa had trauma. Things would happen. I didn’t recognize it for what it was. I didn’t know until later. She’s always struggled. 
AS: How old was she when Ron died?
SP: Six. I had a book it was called How to Deal with When a Parent Dies. I always bought books. You read something. I tried to figure it out and navigate it. Christa is a story in and of herself that we could talk about for a long time. Her drug use and her struggle with mental health issues. The impact on us as a family, the impact on her children now. She lives up in the mountain with my brother. Her behavior is like her dad’s. She’s somewhat dangerous. She’s been homeless on the streets of Fort Collins for years and in and out of jail. She was released to me two different times. 
AS: From jail?
SP: Prison. There’s very few treatment programs for women in Colorado, very few. Writing fraudulent prescriptions at the King’s Super grocery store and she was arrested there. 
AS: She was writing her own prescriptions?
SP: She’d gotten out of prison, she was released to me. She was out a month. She had two different doctor appointments. Where are you the mom and where are you always the outreach worker? She stole a prescription pad somewhere along the line. Then she wrote it and she tried to cash it at a King’s Super in the pharmacy. It’s a big grocery store. We were there grocery shopping together. I had no idea that she was back in that space. She was still on probation, all of these obligations. We’re grocery shopping and she looks at me and says, “I don’t feel very good. I want to just go sit in the car.” I’m thinking, “Whatever, I’m stuck with groceries. I hate grocery shopping.” Then I’m up at the self-checkout doing my thing and I see Christa walk back in. I think, “She came back in to help me.” She was being led in by a cop. She was arrested as she walked out the door. She was taken to jail in Jefferson County, in Golden, and held there. She was transferred to the prison in Denver. 
AS: When was this?
SP: It started in the end of September in 2015. She was released, went back, got out in May of 2016. It’s your daughter and you’re the mother so what do you do? You can’t say, “No, she can’t be released here.” She doesn’t have anywhere to go. She’s burnt all her bridges. She’s been in fights in Fort Collins where she’s broken people’s bones, very violent. You can see your baby, your little girl. You can see all those other things about her. You let her in and then the same old stuff just starts happening again. I put her out. I told her, “This is it.” I think that to some degree I lost hope. I can’t fix her. I’m not responsible anymore. I’m not the only parent. There are things beyond my control. I’ve always thought that I could fix everything because that’s what I do. I have always done that. Why shouldn’t it work now? I tried so hard. She lives with my youngest brother in this trailer. They’re both nuts. They both have substance use issues. 
AS: Where are her kids?
SP: The kids live with her dad in Fort Collins. He’s got issues too. Not quite in the same way that Christa does. He’s got a young girlfriend. He’s forty six or something. Chrissy, the girlfriend, just turned twenty three in February. She has been the glue that has kept everything together. Zach is twelve and angry. He’s seen a lot. Christa started off really good with Zach when he was born. He got the best of Christa. Then when she was pregnant with Kieran, seven months old, in Tacoma she was in a car accident. Doctor prescribed opiates and Xanax. She was off to the races. Kieran was born and in many ways ignored. Then a couple years later she gets pregnant with Lisa. Lisa’s born with an opiate habit in the NICU unit a month early in Fort Collins. Not long after, she was a year, Bobby and Christa fell apart. Bobby’s had the kids ever since. They spent a year homeless in Fort Collins. They got a place to live. A guy who’s a lawyer and I don’t know exactly how he got involved in there. Bobby was profiled in the Fort Collins newspaper with the kids. The story about Christa abandoning them, which just is fucked up.
AS: A newspaper story?
SP: Christa was just devastated by the story. They could argue it as not being true. It was certainly judgmental of her. 
AS: Why was there a story?
SP: I don’t know. I think Bobby was involved in some helping program. Maybe it was Thanksgiving or Christmas and they want to do that story about people that need help—human interest. I can find out the details and I’ll send it to you. 
AS: Back up to you were talking about Ron and his impact on Christa. Then we were talking about Jim and Kelly was born. You were going to MCTC taking Women’s Studies and then divorced Jim?
SP: Yes. I thought that school was really good therapy. I learned a lot. I think really between Women’s Studies and I was in a Sociology class, “Sex, Marriage, and the Family.” That was helpful. It provided a level of education for me that I needed and lacked, a sense of understanding. I’ve always been a reader. I don’t put a lot of stock in outside sources. I never grew up with a family where you could check things out. I always went to a book. Education meant so much for me. It opened up a world that I could never have imagined. It signaled the way out. I did really well. I had a 3.8 the whole way through. I worked on the project to create Women With a Point. I did some early project management class or something. This is where I keep getting hung up. I volunteered in domestic violence in Minneapolis after the whole Ron thing. Right in there. That’s where I wanted to go. 
AS: I was going to ask you.
SP: With the domestic abuse project. I don’t know if that still exists anymore.
AS: It’s right on Franklin. 
SP: Oh my God. They used to have, there was like Project Neon or something. I volunteered. I went to those groups. I volunteered. I used to carry a pager. I’d do on-site visits with women. When there was a domestic and an automatic arrest then we made contact with the women. That was really, really a powerful experience. It moved me in a different direction. The involvement of it and supportive community and trying to figure that out. Really a level of involvement always in the community. That’s what brought me in, it brought me to it. It was harm reduction before I ever even had heard the term. There was that background in domestic violence. Going back to Colorado, coming back to Minneapolis, going to school, getting involved in volunteering through Minnesota AIDS Project, internships.
AS: Did you finish your bachelor’s degree?
SP: I did, I finished it. I did that at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, in Tacoma. I went back to school to finish it in 2004. It was a writing from life program. I got credit for building…
AS: Did you go there to live?
SP: Yes. I started Women With a Point in Minneapolis and through that I met Dave. You know my third husband, Dave Purchase. 
AS: Back up about Women With a Point. You started Women With a Point in?
SP: In ‘96. In ‘95 I was an intern at the Street Scene Program. I think I mentioned that, through Catholic Charities. I met this man Frank Guzman. Frank, old Latino man, he was something. He brought me to my first homeless shelter. Frank was also working for Minnesota AIDS Project on the Main Line, the first needle exchange in Minneapolis. 
AS: It was called the Main Line?
SP: Yes, it was named after Bill Main. 
AS: Is it M-A…
SP: I-N. Then L-I-N-E. There’re so many things about that that work. Then there was a volunteer or if I don’t remember if she was working part time there, Toni St. Pierre. A labor and delivery nurse. Toni had her own history of drug use, heroin where mine was cocaine. Toni lost her children. I didn’t. She was big into NA and AA in Minnesota. I wasn’t. Certainly during the time of Ron, my family, “Oh Susie, you need to go to treatment. Oh Susie’s not going to treatment.” Worried about my kids. The religious piece, all of those things that I saw as problematic. I could go to school and do other things and just work my way through it. The treatment wasn’t a necessity for me. Really coming to harm reduction that way.
AS: So you met Toni. 
SP: I met Toni and met Frank, met another woman named Gail Thomas. She was working for Seton, which was part of Catholic Charities. She knew about the idea of harm reduction. We would start talking about it. Through Frank and Toni I got involved volunteering for, there was another needle exchange program at the time, called Safe Works AIDS Project. Run by this guy Michael Scavuzzo. Michael was sort of a scandalous guy. But he had this needle exchange. We both volunteered there. 
AS: Why was he a scandalous guy? Just the nature of his life?
SP: Who he was and how things happened. He was kind of slimy. Scavuzzo. People around in the business knew him. Noel Grey knew him. Lorraine knew him. He was a troublemaker. In some way she made really good points. He was a grassroots activist. He wanted to see things happen differently than Minnesota AIDS Project was doing them. He saw the necessity for having a stronger response. This is mid-90s and people are dying of AIDS. They’re getting infected through injection drug use. Minnesota’s slow to respond. Fucked up shit. Michael also had a connection with Dan Big in Chicago with Chicago Recovery Alliance. There’s this small network and I get involved with them. Toni and I decide that we’re doing good work for Michael but we could do something different and really focus on women and get away from him. 
We created Women With a Point. It was incorporated in September of 1996. We had a startup kick from NASEN, the North American Syringe Exchange Network. At the time I think they gave seven hundred dollars’ worth of supplies, syringes, cottons, cookers. We had that. Then Toni put in, she would put in a lot of her own money. We worked out of our houses. We didn’t have an office space. We started on Curry Avenue. People knew me down there because at that time working for a paycheck at the same time. I was working in direct services at Catholic Charities where in the branch they used to have showers and hygiene bags. You can have a locker for people who are homeless. I worked down there. Many people knew me. When they’d see me on the streets down on Curry Avenue they were less afraid to talk to me. 
I had this outreach bag that looked like a big gym bag. It had a sharps container in the bottom. Then we had syringes and all the various supplies that went with that. There were probably less then then there are now. Probably cottons and cookers, condoms, granola bars, socks. Some form of printed information but being able to talk to people and say, “This is what we’re doing. Do you need any of this?” It was funny because people were offended. “I’m not doing that.” It’s kind of a knee jerk response. There’s never been outreach related to AIDS in the same way on Curry Avenue. There had been the van; we can talk for a long time. There’s a lot. 
AS: We might have to have a part two.
SP: There is a van. Frank and Will don’t really get out of the van very much to talk. It parks on Curry Avenue. The Mainline when it opens, Lorraine…
AS: Where is Curry Avenue?
SP: Curry Avenue, you know where the bus station is downtown Minneapolis? It’s back behind there. Target Field is down in that area now. That took away, before Target Field was there. There was Mary Jo Copeland had another shelter down there. 
AS: Was Catholic Charities?
SP: Catholic Charities had branch two down there which was really a shitty shelter down on Curry Avenue.
AS: So that’s gone?
SP: The building still exists but the shelter had been closed for years. That was horrible. That was like a Dickens novel. You’d put men and women, drunk and sober into one room that was poorly lit and you’d shut the door. 
AS: So there’s a van?
SP: Frank and Will, they don’t really get out of the van much to talk to people or provide a level of education. I think Frank used it for nap time mainly.
AS: Who was in charge of the van? Was this an organization? 
SP: Minnesota AIDS Project. The Mainline van. Minnesota AIDS Project was approached by Minneapolis Board of Health because they want a needle exchange program in Minneapolis. Minnesota AIDS Project was the service provider. It’s the main game in the state. They were approached about having a needle exchange. Lorraine didn’t seek it out. I don’t think she necessarily wanted it. She’s from Eaton House and abstinence based education. They’re approached. They held a lot of community meetings. The Whittier neighborhood was particularly contentious. They don’t want this visible presence of junkies, even though AIDS. MAP, they hide the van. They hide it on Curry Avenue. There were three sites at the time. There was Curry Avenue, and then there’s a place on the West Bank down under this bridge it was an awful place, then they had one place on the North Side that they used to park. If you didn’t know the van you wouldn’t necessarily know. 
AS: It’s not marked?
SP: It’s green and white. Oftentimes the doors were shut. Frank liked to nap. Will talked to people a little bit but he just sat in the seat. It was a new program. Nobody really knew it was a needle exchange. There was a research component attached to it. Needle exchange has always been a grey area whether it was legal or illegal in Minnesota. The understanding was that if there was a research component attached to it, it was legal. There’s that. I think that program had maybe been in existence for a year when we started Women With a Point. Women With a Point did not have a research component attached to it. We were not invited by the city of Minneapolis to have a needle exchange. We didn’t ask anybody if we could have a needle exchange. We had outreach bags and we went to Curry Avenue and we did outreach every Tuesday. We did outreach in other parks in South Minneapolis. It’s now a record store, I just went by there today on 26th and Nicollet was a pharmacy. 
AS: That record store right across from that bar and the CC Club. Then French Meadow is right there.
SP: That might be Lyndale. It’s 26th and Nicollet. It’s now a record store that had moved maybe from Uptown. It used to be a pharmacy there. That was sort of junkie central in the Whittier neighborhood. We do outreach in that area. We get the office space on 24th and Nicollet in the Waldorf Building on the first floor in the back. We get static office space there. It’s supposed to just be static office space. We really start creating the infrastructure of Women With a Point. Bill Main, the man that the needle exchange at MAP is named after is getting really sick. He was living with AIDS. He has a seat on the HIV/AIDS Prevention Task Force, the governor’s task force for the state of Minnesota. There’s a prevention task force, CDC mandated group. If a city is getting Ryan White dollars, prevention dollars, they’re mandated to have a state planning body. It had seats; Bill Main was the injection drug abusers seat. I was asked to replace him. I think I was an anomaly. 
AS: Who asked you? 
SP: Somebody through the Health Department. We’re starting to get some recognition. The founding board of Women With a Point is made up of Gail Thomas from Seton. She’s got a good reputation, very involved in the community. There is Frank Guzman, there’s Kevin Sitter. Kevin at the time was working for the Red Door Clinic. He’s got a master’s degree in Public Health and one other master’s. Unbelievable human being. I think Kevin sat on the task force at that time. Maybe Frank. I was getting to know all of these people. Here’s this woman, white skin and blue eyes and presents well and she’s starting a needle exchange. They want some of that. I was good to have at the table. I represented demographics well and all of that. 
There was another woman, Emma Eskell-Singe. She was the founding board of directors. She was a methadone counselor for Hennepin County; they had the methadone program over on Chicago, 1800. We’re building the infrastructure, a board of directors, non-profit status, applying for grants. The Indian AIDS Task Force is in the mix, Nick Metcalf. We had gotten this startup kit from NASEN. It’s all happening simultaneously. We got a small grant. I can’t remember how that was administered, sort of the timeline. We’d gotten a small grant through Hennepin County to do a brief connect or brief services for people who were HIV positive due to injection drug use in the services. That paid my salary as this is changing. Needle exchange is so separate from the other services, the dollars, everything. It was so political which can’t be underestimated, how political it was. I’m doing that. I’m doing needle exchange. We’re building this board. We’ve got these people. I’m sitting on the task force. There is money available, an RFP is issued and it’s clearly defined which target populations, where the money’s earmarked for, and how you want to apply. I don’t know if it was a general category for IDU, injection drug users.
I had been probably at the first harm reduction conference. I had just been back from there. The first harm reduction conference was in ‘96 in Oakland. I’d gone to that conference. I had been in the Mission District of San Francisco. There’s a women’s program that runs on Thursday nights, still runs on Thursday nights. They provided low-level health care in the back. Pregnancy tests, pelvic exams, they did exchange, they had food, they had support. They exchanged eight thousand syringes a month out of that program. I just remember thinking, “Wow, I could do something like that.” I applied for a grant from the Health Department. I think there was three hundred thousand that was available and we asked for two hundred and eighty nine. People would tell me, Kevin Sitter, he just minded everything. At first we’re having the conversation and I said, “I don’t want to apply for that money. What am I going to do? Make bleach kits?” You couldn’t buy syringes. You couldn’t have syringes. You couldn’t fund needle exchange using that money. It was so ridiculous on so many levels. We applied for the money. It was Gail Thomas and I who wrote that grant together. It was all based on the idea that we would provide comprehensive harm reduction based services for injection drug users and really use the women’s program in the Mission as the model. We got it. We got just about every single dime that we asked for. It was something. 
AS: Is this from the Ryan White?
SP: These are prevention dollars that came through the Health Department. They start with the CDC. It was defined as prevention dollars or Ryan White dollars. Ryan White was always for services for people who were already positive. 
AS: Just to be clear, the political part was when you got the money from the prevention dollars you can’t buy needles.
SP: You couldn’t fund anything needle exchange related. 
AS: Why, if using needles prevented people from getting HIV?
SP: There is a federal ban on needle exchange. To some degree it’s been lifted. 
AS: But it remains?
SP: To some degree, yes. I can’t think of the name of the legislation that’s prohibiting federally to fund needle exchange. 
AS: It’s like what they’re doing with Planned Parenthood right now. Right? Around federal funds, they can decide what it’s used for.
SP: Kind of like the global gag rule. It’s all sort of in that same mix. At that point when I was starting there was a federal ban on needle exchange. Even though they hadn’t really certified the science yet. They weren’t going to fund it. My husband, Dave, testified before Congress for lifting the federal ban. He also was instrumental in working with all the programs in New York. Getting all the needle exchange programs set up in New York. Dave worked with Sam Friedman, Don Dejarle, just an amazing group of people. He’d started the program in Tacoma in 1988. The first legal needle exchange publically funded was Tacoma. It’s illegal to fund needle exchange. I get prevention dollars. 
AS: Can this fund your salary?
SP: It can fund my salary and I can hire staff. We move out of the little office on 24th. I have a bookkeeper named Jules Freeman, he’ll be there. Jules used to be a bartender at the Gay 90s back in the day. He’s a wonderful human being. Jules is my bookkeeper. He comes to me through Kevin Sitter. I think through Jules I get a commercial real estate agent, I can’t think of his name. A little guy, he was educated at Pepperdine as a lawyer. He’s doing commercial real estate. He’s looking for a space for us. He’d say to me, “Sue what do I tell people the kind of work you do? What are you going to do in this space?” I said, “You just tell them that we’re going to do a little HIV prevention with women. That’s it.” We got 11 W 15th Street. In between Nicollet and LaSalle. 
AS: I drove by it after I met Rae. 
SP: It’s turning into something else. I drove by it yesterday. It must be something else again. It’s the perfect location. It’s owned by people who don’t really care about what I’m doing. They want their rent money. Chickie was the daughter; the dad’s name was David. David was eighty years old when I met him. He had been a social worker back in the day. He liked me. They never asked questions. It had a back door, it had a front door. We were able to build it out so that there were offices. 
I hired David Hamilton. Before that I had already hired one woman. She came when I was still at the Waldorf, 24th and Nicollet. Laura Collins, she had come from the methadone program. She was working for me part time. When we got this grant and moved to the other space Laura came along and I got David. Then there were a couple funded positions and I got this woman Patrice McCauley. Then not long after we got that space we applied for a grant with the CDC which got funded. We were the first needle exchange in the United States to have a directly funded CDC grant. Not used for needle exchange but for wraparound services for all the other stuff. 
In the time, in the mid-90s if you said harm reduction people automatically thought needle exchange. Needle exchange is only one harm reduction strategy. There’s so much more. We had those wraparound services. Money was just coming to us. There wasn’t another women run program in the United States. We did it. We got unsolicited money. We got money from the Liz Taylor Foundation; eight thousand dollars came in the mail. There was a Public Welfare Foundation initiative. Public Welfare Foundation is out of D.C. to fund seven or nine harm reduction programs in the United States that were exemplary so that we could lead the way. Women With a Point was chosen. 
AS: So you’re serving women. Are you just serving primarily women?
SP: We wanted to focus on women and not to ignore men.
AS: Tell me how that came about.
SP: I would say to people, “Women With a Point, we have a point to make and a point to give.” Toni and I were two women who certainly had a point to make related to injection drug use. Double entendre. There’s so much. I don’t know how long you want to have me talk about this. I can stay as long as you want. I want to be respectful of your time too. The more we talk about this the more stuff I come up with. That I think is important but I don’t know where you’re at. 
AS: I’m enjoying listening. I think just for our sake we should wrap it up by four so that we don’t get a little loopy. Then I’d like to meet again before you go home. To just talk again. What’s going to happen is we’re going to both think of things. I’m going to have questions and you’re going to remember stuff. 
SP: There’s going to be a lot. 
AS: Maybe we can carve out a couple hours before you go home.
SP: Absolutely.
AS: Whether that’s up north or whether it’s before. That’s good. 
What was going through my head was this idea about first of all what you’d been through in having been raised in a very violent family where you weren’t safe. Then you married someone where you weren’t safe and you had to flee from him. Then you help women who you’d walked in their shoes. Then you make this organization that is primarily for women but you’re also willing to not exclude men. To me thinking about that as a historian, by the 90s we’re twenty years past the second wave women’s movement. In the 90s it was considered meaningless. You had taken these Women’s Studies classes. I’m just thinking about how you thought, to me it’s making perfect sense how it came out this way. How you approached it as a safe space for women that didn’t exclude men when twenty years before the only safe places for women who wanted to talk about things was when there were no men allowed. Did any part of gay men’s participation; is there any role that gay men played for the HIV, that whole movement or Act Up or any of that? Did any of that come to play in your thinking? Or is it just that you wanted to center women? Not to the exclusion of men but to center women so they knew that they were safe coming there. 
SP: Absolutely. Based on our own experiences. Certainly knowing enough in terms of HIV prevention that you didn’t exclude people. The focus was certainly on women. 
AS: Women had been dismissed in the early AIDS epidemic as not being at risk.
SP: That’s right. How shortsighted is that. If you look at injection drug use and you look at modes of transmission, you look at women trading sex for drugs. You look at women trying to support small children through sex work or the inability to carry more than two condoms on you at a time. 
AS: They can’t carry two condoms?
SP: I think it’s three actually. I don’t know that I’ve ever known of any city in the United States where it’s expressly written on the books that it’s a crime. It’s commonly known that sex workers can’t carry more than three condoms at a time because that proves that you’re a sex worker. You’ve got to be careful. We could talk all day long. There’s just so much. I think that always recognizing the vulnerability of women.
AS: That’s a very known thing in all global feminism. The whole world round we know that where women are suffering, where girls aren’t being educated there’s a problem. That the society is at risk. When you educate the women, when you educate the girls, you take care of families your society can flourish. 
SP: Exactly. The way that I’ve always thought about it, I’m sure generated out of my own life experiences, men were fine in their place. I was never really sure where their place was and how it fit in. I didn’t dislike them. I thought women needed something more, new. I thought for sure that the creation of Women With a Point was just some hair brained crazy scheme.
AS: But then you got recognition.
SP: I’m sure that my staff thought I was nuts too. We’re creating it as we went along. My colleagues are on the West Coast and they’re on the East Coast. They weren’t in Minnesota. They weren’t in the holy land of treatment. They weren’t where abstinence rules. Where Hazelden is the mothership. The Minnesota Model. Lorraine Teal had given me a stern lecture when she first found out about what we were going to do. I thought, “Fuck you bitch. I am never going to be in this position again.” I hold my own really well. So we open that storefront. We don’t really have a name on the door. You’ve got to kind of know where we are. We’ve had this whole delivery service that had become wildly successful.
AS: With your matchbooks.
SP: Matchbooks and gay men and people were just coming out. They were hearing about us, word of mouth. We were trustworthy. Where was I going with that?
AS: You opened your doors. I was going to ask you to tell me who’s coming in.
SP: One morning in particular, it’s early; three women of color came through, almost one right after the other. The backroom of that little space, it’s like the broom closet. It’s maybe two hundred square feet. It’s got a back door. It’s like closet. We had to do it separately. That space had to be paid for separately. The rent had to be paid for separately. Everything was separate but in the same building. I would see Gary Novating; he was in charge in the prevention department. He’d be like, “Sue, I hope you’re not spending any of that money on needle exchange.” It’s like, “Gary, not a dime.” Separate bank accounts. Being so meticulous. There was no way I was going to do anything that would jeopardize what we had. Understanding the politics, being really savvy to that. These women, they came through. They’d go in the needle exchange room and come out and then they would leave. I remember looking at whoever was working with me and I’d say, “Wow, it is working. Did you see who just came through the door?” It’s important. Demographics, women of color who are using injection drugs, preventing HIV, Hep C, all of that. They found a home. They came in and they found out that the cops didn’t jump out or they didn’t get busted or there was no shame. There was no judgement. They could come back. They could bring their friends.
I got a grant through Minnesota Women’s Fund. I’d had a relationship with them, had been funded. There were some grant funds available through them. They were banking dollars. I can’t remember exactly how that RFP was written. I had this idea, we had a women’s users group. That was the start of the women’s users group. We had a general group, but then a women’s one. I called the potential funder, this is who I am and this is what I want to do with this money. I want to create a financial planning education for drug using women. I talked about what that might look like and my ideas. I said, “You’ve got to tell me right now. If you won’t consider this idea I won’t consider applying because I don’t want to waste my time.” She encouraged me to apply. We got funded. There was a women’s users group. How to manage your drug habit on a budget?
AS: Is that what happens at the user’s group?
SP: This is what happens at the user’s group. They would look at me like, “Sue you are nuts.” It’s never supposed to be that conversation. The conversation is about being sober, paying your rent, not buying drugs or even considering it. This was about banking and how you can have a habit. You can pay your rent. You can budget your money. Drug use is not mutually exclusive from organization. Your life is not chaotic. You can plan. You can recognize that this is part of it and it serves a role in your life. Being able to open that discussion because those are never the messages. “It’s bad, you’re wrong.” Everything about that. “You’re an awful mother. You don’t love your children.” How much stigma can you heap on? Then you work at dismantling that and providing another point of view. It’s perceived as outrageous and over the top. Probably to some degree blasphemy in the holy land. It’s working.
AS: You’re leading them to a place where they might not need to use. 
SP: Yes. 
AS: They can make that decision on their own. 
SP: They can have a little more power and control. 
AS: Which is very different than saying they have to get to rock bottom. 
SP: No shit, right. That’s ridiculous. It’s so punitive. It’s so judgmental.
AS: It’s also death.
SP: It’s death. I had been one of those women. For some reason I have a very creative, innovative, survival force in me. To be able to share that with other women has always been my driving force. Continues to be. Never to ignore, if we just male, female but it’s so much more. It’s huge. My friend Lisa gave me a framed print that says, “Trust your crazy ideas.” 
AS: Women With a Point, ‘96 things start happening. How long are you at the helm? Where’s Toni at this point?
SP:  Toni is out at this point. It’s a hard piece. 
AS: You don’t have to go into it in great detail.
SP: Toni was out before the storefront. She’s out. I learned a lot about perceived boundary violations and other people’s opinions and ideas and rules around all of it. Toni was one of those. So we have the storefront. We apply for CDC funding. That was help. Huge application. It’s the start of it. Through that announcement I start with the project officer. I think I started with Dan Big in Chicago. Dan, looking for a little wisdom, “Sue I wouldn’t even waste my time. They always ignore us. It’s the CDC and they’re stupid.” Just where needle exchange was and all the politics of it. Everything about that. Dan advises me against applying. I call the project officer and once again say this is who I am, this is what I’m doing. I’ve got a needle exchange in Minneapolis and I’m seeing injection drug users. I said, “If you’re not going to think about funding me, if I don’t have an opportunity to really compete tell me now.” It’s like writing a thesis. He encourages me to apply. We do. 
David and I, it’s like a couple days before. We’re having this conversation and David’s the grant writer about where the grants are at and what we might have coming. He brings up the CDC grant. I said, “I wouldn’t ever think about that.” We just did it for the experience; we’ll never see the money. I get a phone call the next day from the CDC from the project supervisor. I was on my way to the theater with a friend and I remember I almost drove off the road. They’d funded us. They had funded us. We went from year one probably a ten thousand budget to within four years we are at seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It was huge. Through that it was testing and case management, I might have some of the documents in here. Rae came along with that grant. Rae had dreadlocks. I had twelve employees. 
We got the building next door expanded as well. We had office space, we had user groups. We were known as the hottest gig in town. We were known nationwide and beyond. It was a big deal. We had a lot of success. We did testing in the jails and in drug court and providing prevention education in prisons. Comprehensive harm reduction in a way that doesn’t happen ever again here. 
AS: Was that part of your HepC, was the grant from the CDC? You started doing testing or was that after you were gone? 
SP: The first CDC grant provided testing. That originally directly funded grant. Then because we had that first directly funded grant it opened us up to other pots of money. That’s where we had the research project that never went anywhere that Noel was part of. HepC testing…
AS: Did you do that or not?
SP: I’m pretty sure but I don’t remember. The CDC grant that was really more about the beginning of HIV testing, rapid testing. You didn’t have to send somebody to the Red Door for a blood test. Before that there wasn’t any swab or anything. HepC, I don’t know if HepC testing started after me or while I was there. It would be good to have Rae and I in the same room together. 
AS: Maybe we’ll do that. 
SP: I stayed there until fall of 2001. I resigned as executive director and went to work for a company out of Australia for Fit Packs. That’s another project that we had. That was replicated in New York.
AS: What’s a Fit Pack?
SP: A Fit Pack is a personal sharps container. It’s a little black plastic container about this big. It’s sort of oval. On one half it holds ten unused clean syringes. It’s got this little divider wall in it. On the other side it’s got a one way flap and you put the used syringes down inside. You can’t access them. Then you can safely dispose of it. 
AS: Of the whole pack?
SP: Yes. It’s a safe disposal mechanism for syringes developed by drug users in Sydney. This other plastics company took it over. I don’t know how I met this crew. I went to the first international harm reduction conference in Brazil in 1998. There’s a man named Peter Galsworthy at the time. He is running ASP Plastics, the company that had Fit Packs. They send a case to me or something. Those guys were nuts. I start using them as a program. It provides a level of safety for the people who are actively using because cops don’t want to stick their finger down inside to get a dirty syringe out. You could be charged with a felony for residue in a syringe. It provided a safety mechanism if you’re a cop patting somebody down you’re not going to get a needle stick. So it was really a win, win. It was an opportunity to talk about them. 
Then there was some leftover Minnesota Department of Health money. Lucy Slater would know about this. It was short term. You had to use it and get rid of it. It wasn’t going to be drawn out over time. The guys from Australia were in town and we wrote it together. It was called the “Better Safe than Sorry Disposal Proposal.” For the Minnesota Department of Health. We worked with four area pharmacies. I can’t think of the name of that one on 26th and Nicollet. That was one of them. Another pharmacy over on the West Side of St. Paul, another of the East Side of St. Paul and then the North Side of Minneapolis. They were chosen for geographic location related to race and drug use. West Side of St. Paul primarily Latino, lots of heroin. East Side is more white people and methamphetamine. The North Side certainly there was a lot of cocaine over there at the time. There was probably some methamphetamine, some heroin. Opiates, I don’t know, pills were probably being talked about to some degree. It’s early. 
AS: This is still in the late 90s?
SP: The late 90s. It was a very interesting project. I know I’ve got that stuff here too. I don’t know how well the research was ever written up and exactly what happened with it. Sarah Riebeckite that’s part of putting on the conference up at White Earth, she and I have worked together. We’ve worked on these projects together. Sarah’s got a lot of history. She knows about this project in particular. The data that came out of it, there was a strong research component with that and there was a kickoff. There was the t-shirt that said, “Be Blood Aware.” There was the Fit Pack. We did a sticker for the Fit Pack. There were a lot of steps involved in it. 
AS: You started by saying you left Women With a Point. But you also married Dave.
SP: Yes, I was married to Dave. We’d been together since ‘97. We got married in ‘99. We had a commuter marriage. Dave had obligations. He travelled all the time. He had obligations to Tacoma. He had the needle exchange in Tacoma still, Point Defiance AIDS Project or the Tacoma Needle Exchange. Then he’s got the larger national organization that is NASEN. 
AS: Was he running that? Did he found that?
SP: Yes. You should google Dave. He’s having a conference every two years, annually. He had a needle exchange conference as well. That was held different places throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. I’m still really steeped in doing all of the work. Always with a focus on harm reduction in women. Never moving away from that and always had various ideas, projects, things that I thought should be happening, always maintained involvement. Dave’s got to be back in Tacoma. I’d made an agreement with him that we would live there at some point. I leave Access Works. It’s morphed into Access Works at this point. Women With a Point was too gender specific was the thought.
AS: That was right on the cusp that was kind of what I was getting at when I was talking about women’s history and the second wave. We were just on the cusp of that where things started to change. That’s when Women’s Studies programs started switching to Gender and Women’s Studies. It’s this short lived moment. 
SP: I never really thought about it like that but it’s really, really true. 
AS: That was really a moment when women had just gotten brought in. We just had this little flash and then gender. 
SP: It’s neutral.
AS: It’s supposed to be neutral. Now they’re calling it Critical Identity Studies. 
SP: I think that’s bullshit. 
AS: You can’t prioritize one over the other. That’s another conversation.
SP: People give me grief about it but I still prioritize. If there’s women identified works for me but the focus is on women. I think that I’ve had regrets about it. It’s like in some ways I caved to public opinion. 
AS: We can’t help that sometimes. You were making a decision that was the best for the organization at the time. 
SP: If you look at what happened not long after that, it is the rise of opiates and women’s involvement. It’s interesting. There’s so much other history tied up within harm reduction or community based public health. However that gets defined. During that time, always during that time, provided a lot of community education and did a lot of work in treatment programs and jails. Talking about why harm reduction matters. 
AS: During which time are you talking about?
SP: All through the 90s. It created a different climate for people in general but women specifically. In Minnesota there are women specific treatment maybe not as much as we would like but it’s here. It’s huge. There’s so much. Trying to broaden a way of thinking. I really think in general people thought I was a little crazy. David Hamilton will tell you that he thought I was a little crazy but good. Really a level of thinking out of the box. I wasn’t indoctrinated. I had success. Really just building on that. I was also burnt out. Things were going on with my own kids. There’s the work side of it. There’s an integration and certainly one supported the other. It’s really, really hard work. The company in Australia, I think I worked for them for four years.
AS: Did you work for them in the U.S.?
SP: Yes, the U.S. and Canada. There was a lot of emphasis around syringe disposal. There was a national movement just related to disposal. Really as the politics are changing and needle exchange is starting to gain some more acceptance—this is where I left off around the federal ban. In 1998 Clinton’s in office, there’d been protests in D.C. for a couple of years related to needle exchange and Act Up. Dave’s having his conference in Baltimore. All this stuff had been going on Donna Sheleyla and Clinton and they were supposed to certify the science. Everybody was so optimistic. Dave was interviewed on NPR. What happened is that between Sheleyla and Clinton they certified the science that needle exchange did not increase drug use. They refused to fund it. It sent the wrong message. 
AS: That illusive wrong message. 
SP: Let me look right now, there is a place in here. There used to be a political cartoonist in Minneapolis with the Star Tribune. His last name was Saxe. He did a cartoon that clearly identified two babies in the nursery, in the hospital nursery. One is a baby of color and then there’s the white baby. It says something like, “Tell us again why they refused to fund needle exchange.” They’re clearly identified as HIV positive babies. The other one says, “It might give the wrong message to the children.” I had it for years, I always held on to it. I might have it in here. Some of this in this folder is just articles that I use for I don’t know. It’s a mish mash. Drug related stuff, women in addiction. Stuff I’ve picked up over the years. I don’t know what all that’s about, I haven’t read it. This was above the toilet in the storefront in the bathroom. I’ve got a t-shirt of this image. This comes from a friend in New York. 
AS: This is great. We’re looking at postcards.
SP: This is Carleton Hogan. This is Noel’s brother. As she says, “Carleton was a New York street junkie.” He got sent to Hazelden for treatment. The work he did here early on with Minnesota AIDS Project, Carleton Hogan, no oral history project would be complete without Carleton. This is myself and Bob Norman in the alley outside the store front. Bob used to be the director of Prodigal House. He should be invited. 
AS: What’s his name?
SP: Bob Norman. This is Edith Springer. Edith is credited as being the mother of harm reduction in the United States. She’s from New York originally. A wonderful human being. She was my mentor. I was part of the original handful of people chosen to be trained in harm reduction out of the coalition. 
AS: We need to get you some labels on the back of these pictures. 
SP: The Women With a Point T-shirt. We’re in New Orleans at a drug policy conference. This is LaNelle Clancy. They’re West Coast ladies. They did some of the original needle exchange in San Francisco and Sacramento with the baby buggies. Hiding syringes in street corners. Carleton Hogan and David Hamilton. These are other pictures. 
AS: David Hamilton is the one in New York?
SP: He’s at Augsburg now. Definitely need to talk to David. I’m pretty sure he’s coming to the oral history project. The last I heard he was working at Augsburg. These are more pictures of Carleton. I just kind of stuck everything in there.
AS: Where is Carleton?
SP: Carleton’s dead. Carleton died of AIDS in maybe 2003. Wonderful human being. This is more related to current stuff. Somethings I just keep in here. This is Bill Main doing street based outreach. He became infected through a syringe I think he took out of a sharps container in prison. These are some other cartoons but it doesn’t have that one. It has an article on the flip side. I think that’s Bill Clinton. 
AS: “The White House Denies Funds for Needle Exchange Program Revealing the Need for Another Exchange Program.” There’s Shaleyla.
SP: Here’s Women With a Point personnel policies. Access Work stuff that might have been the name change. 
AS: Why did we come over here?
SP: We’re looking for that cartoon. It’s close to four I think.
AS: Let’s stop for now. Thank you. 
SP: Here is welcome to the user’s group. Papers that I wrote. 
AS: Don’t judge pregnant drug using women. This is great. 
SP: This I can bring up to White Earth. There’s so much in here. This was a poster we had on the wall. Our grand opening. 
AS: Would you say that again about being a good neighbor?
SP: We were always absolutely a good neighbor. We weren’t going to give any opportunity for anything but a good neighbor, to disregard us, to judge us, stigmatize us, to counteract the stereotype. We were an amazing neighbor and people knew it. We cleaned up the neighborhood. We did needle sweeps. There were people who were hanging out on the roof when we got there, shooting dope up there. Absolutely a good neighbor. We participated in that neighborhood. This is Frank Guzman. This is Trudy Shafer. She is now; I call her a food with medicine chef in Berkeley. She cooks for Green Day and musicians. Trudy’s awesome. She worked at Seton with Gail Thomas. A very original outreach worker. This is the year when the harm reduction conference was in Oakland. That one cartoon I don’t seem to have. 
AS: Did you bring a matchbook? There they are.
SP: There’s matches. It talks about Sarah. A public welfare narrative, women’s foundation. 
AS: How did you pay for the needles if nobody would give you money?
SP: There’s needle exchange grants. 
AS: So you did get money from those?
SP: Always. Needle exchange you hustle for more. MAC AIDS Fund. If I ever buy lipstick, which is rare, I buy MAC cosmetics because they support HIV prevention in drug users. Levi Strauss supports needle exchange. Comer Foundation that was Lands’ End supports needle exchange. Stephanie has been supporting needle exchange; it used to be with a phone call, since like 1988. They sold Lands’ End. The family foundation still supports needle exchange. It’s been formalized a little more. I just got a grant from them. 
AS: You just now did?
SP: Yes.
AS: That’s awesome. Are they based out of Wisconsin?
SP: Chicago. The rest of the family foundation is really environmentally focused. I think Dan Big got Stephanie involved in needle exchange early on. They both live in Chicago. 
AS: The next time we talk we need to talk about what you’re doing. We need to start from when you left until now and what you’re doing in Colorado.
SP: I’d love to talk about that. There is just stuff. It’s helpful in that I was doing harm reduction education. Rae and I were together and we were working with Claire Housing, there’s another name. It’s got a more comprehensive organization. It was for people that were working with housing for people who were positive or living with AIDS. It’s all notes from that. That may be helpful. Stuff from grants. This was MDH, CDC thing. David Hamilton’s resume I think. I think some of these are old research. 
AS: Rae gave me a lot of files from the computer from Access Works. Photos and photo files. 
SP: You’ve got to love Rae.
AS: She’s amazing. She’s a sweetie.
SP: Isn’t she? There’s a bunch of stuff. "

Charles Reznikoff-CR
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I am with Dr. Charles Reznikoff at the Addiction Medicine Center at HCMC [Hennepin County Medical Center] in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is January 17, 2017. 
I am trying to get a whole picture of the people who are involved in what is going on right now with opioids in treatment and recovery and what has happened in the past. That said, I would like to be able to paint a picture of who are the kinds of people who are doing this and what their personal story is. Can you tell me a little about your family and growing up and how you got interested in medicine. 
CR: I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. Both of my parents were professors at the University of Wisconsin. My dad’s dad was a famous doctor in New York City -- he was a hematologist. My mom wanted to be a doctor but because of circumstances in her life that wasn’t available to her. I grew up in a very academic family. Both my parents were geneticists. I grew up talking about genetics and biology over the dinner table every day.
My mom was Catholic. I think she is now a recovering Catholic, you might say. I was brought up Catholic and my mom was very into service. Anyways, I grew up always told from a young age that I was going to be a doctor or a priest. It sounds terrible, but I think my mom meant the best by that. My dad was really mellow about that -- he never told me what he wanted me to be. But, my mom wanted me to be in some form of service. I think she would have accepted if I didn’t, but from a very early age I was told I was going to do one of those things. By the time I was twelve I knew I wasn’t going to be a priest. [laughs] I crossed that one off the list! That led me to be a doctor. 
I think other relevant things in my family was that my sister was the smartest person I had ever met. She was my older sister and she is a mathematician. She was a very rigorous and demanding thinker. It sounds terrible to say this but she was verbally aggressive. I don’t mean that to be abusive. I mean that if you misspoke she would correct you and if you were illogical she would correct your logic. If you used poor grammar she would correct it. I still use poor grammar but the ability to deal with a critical verbal environment came from my sister. She also has a little bit of OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] so I grew up with some mental health issues in the family. 
My brother is one year older than me. He is adopted. He is currently a safety manager at a construction worksite. He is ten months older so we grew up almost as fraternal twins. My parents couldn’t conceive another child so they adopted my brother and then immediately conceived me. We grew up like fraternal twins. He has a much higher risk for addiction and anxiety. At age twelve, thirteen, fourteen I saw him smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking. He was getting in trouble. As soon as he could he was getting tattoos and taking all the risks. The way I think about it is whatever ‘dumb’ is I did ninety-five percent of it and he did one hundred and five percent of it. 
Overall, childhood was excellent. I was very sheltered and protected. It was a safe and wonderful thing. I grew up in this amazing, academic, intellectually challenging circumstance. With my brother I got almost a twin-like experience when we were getting in trouble together. With my sister I got this older sister who was very rigorously demanding and intellectually challenging. My parents were these very smart intellects. 
My elementary school was like lily-white. Very affluent, white kids. There was one person of color in my elementary school. My middle school was forty percent black just by coincidence of the districts of those different schools. My high school was back in the other district with the University brats in Madison, Wisconsin. 
AS: Which high school was that?
CR: Madison West. It was a great school. I don’t know if it is anymore, but at the time it was. 
I would say I was pursuing the doctor thing, but I hadn’t really thought deeply about it. It seemed like a good path, and it seemed like a good fit. It was being put in front of me. Then out of high school I got into a program called the Medical Scholars, which I don’t believe happens anymore. The University of Madison Medical School has one hundred and fifty medical students per year. Fifty of those spots -- one third of the medical school -- is reserved for Medical Scholars. 
Medical Scholars get in coming out of high school. Basically you apply to a program out of high school at the University of Wisconsin. You have to be a Wisconsin resident, you have to go to University of Wisconsin for undergrad, and if you maintain a certain GPA [grade point average], which was very challenging, and do certain prerequisites, they grant you automatic admission into the medical school. What Wisconsin wanted was to capture what they thought were their bright students and keep them in Wisconsin or in Minnesota. Keep their applicants in the state. They did this as a lure. 
I got into the Medical Scholarship program. My pediatrician was on the admittance committee. I don’t know if that’s nepotism or whatever you call it. [laughs] I have really just had incredible luck along the way. It is not like I earned everything I am. I’m not saying I’m incredibly successful, but I am a doctor so I have a lot of things going for me. When someone has all of that going for them I am just so aware of all the little turns of luck I had. 
Within the University of Wisconsin’s forty thousand person campus, Medical Scholars is like a liberal arts school dedicated to biology and pre-med embedded within the undergrad. I had all the benefits of a big undergrad, yet none of the problems of being in a gigantic state school. It was an incredibly focused pre-med education program. You have to get a good GPA, and they would dictate fifty percent of your pre-med courses and you had to get basically all As in your pre-med courses. All of the rest of your course credits -- do whatever you want; do enriching your careers, take philosophy, take Spanish, take whatever. 
The typical pre-med is stressing out about their GPA to get into the medical school spots. I was basically studying to learn. I had to get a good GPA to maintain my Medical Scholar standing, but I wasn’t trying to outcompete my colleagues. It was amazing. I met the GPA bar by like .01. It was literally a miracle. It was like a B plus in organic chemistry instead of a B that did it. It was literally that close.
AS: But you stayed with it. You continued to enjoy it. 
CR: What is really does is it gives you a really enriched education. You can take philosophy and Spanish and history and all these courses that make you feel more like an enriched person. Meanwhile you work your butt off in your biology classes where you can take some risks in your other courses. The typical pre-med is so anxious about their GPA that they will take fluff so they will get good grades in the fluff to focus more on the bio-sciences. I could take more risks with my curriculum. 
That has set this precedent for me with this kind of pay-it-forward thing where a lot of people enter medical school feeling like they competed their way in -- I feel like I entered medical school with this like, You’ve been given this, do something good with it. I had incredible fortune.
I didn’t feel like I was a doctor until human anatomy. The first week of medical school you start dissecting bodies. At that point I was like, Oh, wow, this is what being a doctor is and I loved it. Human anatomy was probably the most important class I ever took. It was incredible. I don’t feel like I knew what being a doctor was until medical school. In some ways that’s the story of an entitled person. Someone affluent who had the silver spoon. I didn’t have to stress out about my career until I was already in medical school. And then when I was in there I was like, Yeah, this works for me. I had it easy. I really did. I had a really good path. 
AS: The important thing is that you realize that. 
CR: Oh yeah. I am very lucky, compared to some of the things our patients and other people have to fight against in their young life. 
AS: How did you get into addiction medicine? Did you have a personal connection?
CR: I think that almost everyone’s got someone in their family that is addicted. My sister had some mental health issues; my brother was alcoholic and later got into cocaine and opiates. 
When I was in medical school there was a scandal in Madison, Wisconsin where some cop caught a news reporter using coke. The news reporter, rather than taking some felony cocaine charge, said I’ve got a good deal for you. He said, I know of at least a dozen firemen that are selling cocaine out of the fire station. I will give you those names if you give me a plea bargain. Of course because the cops and the fire stations usually have competitions, the cop was like, Yes. This guy names thirteen names of these firemen that were using and selling cocaine. 
AS: Do you remember what year this was?
CR: 2000, 2001. It’s in all the newspapers. You would be able to find it. Among those names, he listed my brother who was a fireman at the time. My brother was certainly alcoholic and had certainly used cocaine. Eleven out of the thirteen people were selling cocaine out of the fire station. It was a huge deal and they got fired and went to jail. Two of the people that were listed didn’t have any evidence. My brother was one of them. So my brother was caught in this fire storm of the fire union versus the fire police chief. Someone had seen my brother do cocaine in a bar late at night. No doubt he did; no doubt. But lots of people use cocaine at 2:00 AM when they are twenty-three years old and they just got this new job and they have money. 
All the seriousness of the accusations of the people selling the drugs -- no one ever linked my brother to that. I don’t link my brother to that. I don’t know. He was one of two people that were front page news in the newspaper for a year. 
AS: Even though he was still part of it all.
CR: Ultimately he was exonerated. The charges were all dropped against him. It put him under such stress and scrutiny. He was an alcoholic. He was exonerated of all charges. He was allowed to keep his job. After six months of being on the front page my mother was tortured by it. You can imagine being his mom. In the end, he was wrongly accused of this. Two months later he got his third DUI [driving under the influence] and lost his driver’s license. After that he was fired as a fireman. 
Joe has since gotten sober. After that he got sober from alcohol and hooked on pain pills. Then he got sober from pain pills and now he is married, in recovery, a safety manager at a construction site, and a union welder. I saw this whole process go down. We did an intervention for my brother. 
AS: Were you in medical school? When did you start medical school?
CR: 1998. I graduated in 2002. It was 2000, 2001 when this was happening. That may have been subconscious and it may have directed some of my thoughts but I was not explicitly becoming an addiction doctor to treat my brother. I was actually really clear with him. I didn’t want to threaten him and be like, I’m doing this because of you. I was also not doing this to help you. I’m not doing this because of you, or to help you. I’m doing this because it is right for me. I’m doing this selfishly. 
When I got into opioids and the pain world, Joe, my brother, had not come out as addicted to opioids. When he finally told me he was hooked on Percocet, I was already deep into this world. Going down the opioids path was good for me and it had nothing to do with my brother. Only later I found out he got hooked with opioids. Just like every other person in the county that is introduced to opioids. 
That was a very influential, early thing that happened to me. I think also dealing with my sister’s mental health issues affected how I interact with patients and think about mental health. It’s easy, in this story to be like, Oh, he had an alcoholic brother. But I also had an OCD sister. Both these things had equal influence on how I think about and interact with patients. 
I did an addiction rotation in medical school in that context -- while all of that was happening. I talked to the addiction doctor at the University of Wisconsin. His name was Rich Brown. There was a Randy Brown and a Rich Brown -- both of which work in addiction at Wisconsin. In this case I talked to Rich Brown, and he was cool. 
AS: What do you mean you talked to him?
CR: I emailed him and I was like, I’m struggling with what I should do with my brother. Do you have any advice? He emailed me back and then I did an addiction rotation. I went to internal medicine residency at County Hospital -- here, HCMC. I didn’t know if I was going into addiction or not, I didn’t know what I was going to do. I was just enjoying residency. I did find that working with patients who had addiction wasn’t like Oh, an alcoholic. I don’t want to go into the room. Then when I come out of the room I feel gross and weird. A lot of doctors are aversive to working with addicts. Or they find working with addicts aversive, I should say. That’s a really common thing. Doctors are humans too. Some doctors are like, ‘I feel really weird dealing with the health consequences of obesity’ because they think obese people caused this by themselves by eating too much and gaining weight. ‘They have bad knees because they are obese. I feel morally compromised.’ Some doctors have that thought. Some doctors have the chainsmoker opioid user who has a heart attack. 
For me, honestly, if there is anything, I don’t know if there is a bias, but patients I work with that have diabetes -- I will do it, but it’s not thrilling to me. I leave the room and I was like, I had to do that because it’s part of my job. Whereas other people love that. They go into that field. We all have our things. It just so happened I discovered during residency that when I’m in the room with a patient that’s addicted I’m not stressed out. I’m happy to be there, I feel like I’m delivering care, I can look them in the eyes and relate to them, they seem to relate to me back, and I didn’t question that. During residency I realized that was unique. Most people are avoiding those patients whereas I’m drawn to them. It’s probably because I saw it happening first hand with my brother. I know my brother is a good person, and I love my brother, so I know this person right here is someone’s sibling and I can look them in the eye and treat them as a sibling. I think that contributed. 
The fable I tell about how I got into addiction medicine is when I was a first year resident, I saw this young, black, gang member named Anthony. He called himself Ant. He had a tattoo of the word ‘ant’ on his arm. He had congenital heart defect and he came in for his heart problem. When he was there he confided in me that he was a heroin user and I didn’t know what to do. I was an intern. 
He went home and a couple of days later, as I was walking down the hallway a phone rang. A receptionist picked it up and said, Yeah, actually yes, he’s right here. Someone just called this phone and asked for you, Charlie. I just happened to be walking down the hallway. Crazy coincidence. I was surrounded by people that saw this happen. I picked up the phone and it was Ant and Ant was crying. He said, I just injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. There were people yelling in the background and he was crying and he said, I’m worried, I injected heroin and I don’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to tell him so I told him to go to the emergency room, which probably was not even the right answer. I didn’t even know what to tell him. All of these people were like, What happened and I told them that a patient that I saw three days ago randomly called this phone number and asked for me and confessed that he had just injected heroin. 
In some ways that was my vocation calling. I was like, That’s my future calling. That was a true story. 
The other, more real, practical reason I got into addiction medicine was that my senior year, then as a chief resident, in my chief year, I would always work out in the gym. Gavin Bart, who is an addiction researcher and is my current boss, would work out beside me. He would talk to me and he said, Look, if you want to take this job in the addiction department, we’ll account for fifty percent of your time with addiction work and the other fifty percent you can self determine. 
Sounds eerily familiar, like the Medical Scholars program where it’s like here are fifty percent of your work you will have to work really hard for and we are going to account for and then we are going to give you freedom. Taking a job here pays thirty percent less than a community job, so it’s not like I’m going for the money. 
AS: What do you mean a community job? 
CR: Like if I went to a community hospital and just out of general interest I would have made at least thirty percent more money. He didn’t give me a financial pitch, he gave me a professional enrichment pitch. He just said that if I liked addiction to come do a fellowship and then come to the addiction division and you’ll be able to have a lot of freedom to self determine your job. 
It was just such a great offer. Then when I assembled my dream job it’s this diverse patchwork of different things. Everything balances each other. There is a lot of addiction, but a lot of it is non-addiction. He let me develop myself professionally and he trusts me. I saw this opportunity to work within a professionally enriching setting with a good boss.
AS: When did you start with him?
CR: Residency was 2002 and then chief residency was 2005 to 2006 and then fellowship was 2006 to 2008. I have been here since January 1, 2008. 
AS: When you say fifty percent with addiction medicine does that involve the clinic?
CR: Yes. 
AS: Can you describe what you do?
CR: About half of the weekdays of the year I am responsible for being on-call for the methadone clinic, which could be super mellow or super busy. It allows me to be in my office to take phone calls, multitask, do academic projects. From 6:00 AM until 1:00 PM, six hundred patients might come through these doors to the methadone clinic and we need a doctor on call. It could go smoothly or it could go crazy. About half of the days when this clinic is open I am on-call and then the other half is another doctor. Methadone is a big component of my addiction work. 
Every Wednesday afternoon, I do a tobacco clinic. 
AS: This is one of the other things you do?
CR: This is one of the other components. Well, the tobacco clinic is within the addiction domain and is something I have chosen to do. I don’t know if that counts as my addiction part. What Dr. Bart needed me to do was be on-call for the methadone clinic. That’s what he needed. Outside of that ten percent of my time is dedicated to tobacco work. 
Ten percent of my time I drive to Rice County and work in Rice County and I work at a Suboxone clinic. Ten percent in tobacco, ten percent teaching at the University of Minnesota. Twenty-five percent is general medicine hospitalist work. I work with medical students and medical residents taking care of patients with pneumonia and heart attacks and what not. The rest of it is on-call for methadone. 
AS: That’s busy.
CR: It’s a lot of things. The methadone is so hit and miss that you can have a lot of side projects. So I have a lot of side projects, extra curricular projects. 
AS: What happens when you are in here at the methadone clinic? What do you typically get called out of your office for?
CR: Someone appears oversedated, someone wants to change their methadone dose, someone has been continually been using drugs despite our best efforts and we need to do an intervention. 
AS: When you say other drugs what do you mean?
CR: Could be opiates, could be cocaine, could be alcohol. Any combination of drug use plus being on the methadone dose and whether or not it’s wrong or they appear oversedated. Sometimes they have a question and they want to speak to a doctor. Or they are dissatisfied in some way.
Often the counselor has a question; the counselor feels like they are up against the wall or they have hit a roadblock and they need to brainstorm what is the next best step. 
AS: Have you gotten to know a lot of patients? Do you have patients that have been here for years?
CR: Yes. I think the stereotype about addiction medicine is that it is this series of emergencies because an addict who is not in care is a series of emergencies. An addict who is seeking care isn’t going to the emergency room, isn’t going to the urgent care. They are hospitalized, and in jail, and in detox. 
An addict who is in care isn’t like that at all. An addict who is seeking addiction medicine is in long-term medical management of care. Whether they are getting a medicine or they are at support groups. These addicts that get into care are these long-term patients working towards stability. You get these long-term, incredibly fulfilling relationships with people. There are people that I have seen sixty times within the last eight years -- literally sixty times. I have seen them and fifty plus of those times they are doing great and just checking in. Less than ten of those times they really need help for some reason. They are relapsing or they are worried about relapsing or they are being triggered in some way. 
Taking care of an addict as an addiction doctor is not a series of crises. Seventy plus percent of the time you are managing people in stable recovery and you are just trying to keep them there. In that sense it is really fulfilling. At any given time, twenty to thirty percent are in crisis. Every day there is something new. 
The vast majority of one’s patients are in long-term stable recovery. I think that is a misconception of addiction medicine: that you are dealing with people that don’t want to be there whose lives are blowing up, who are lying their pants off, and who are reprehensible characters. It’s not that at all. It’s people who have accepted that they have a disease, who are working to get back to a relatively normal life, and who are working hard. Most of them are in treatment. We help them get there and help them attempt to have a perfect life. It is really rewarding and that is a misconception of the job that I do. 
AS: Speaking of that, I’d like you to talk a little about the stigma of methadone. In interviews that I have had and other conversations there is a stigma that you don’t want to be on methadone because you don’t want to come to a clinic like this. There are class and race assumptions that go along with methadone, not to mention in many of the support groups such as AA [alcoholics anonymous] and NA [narcotics anonymous], to be on a medicine is to go against. 
CR: It is changing. 
AS: It is changing, and I would like to see if you could talk about stigma and methadone and if you have seen a change and when that started?
CR: I think there are a couple of different reasons why the stigma for methadone is there. I will lay out what I think is the biggest one first. It is basically a misunderstanding about addiction. I am going to come back to that one once I find the words for it. 
Number two: the easier one to explain. In a methadone clinic twenty years ago you would have a lot of black people. A huge number of African-Americans, a lot of poor people, and whatever the other oppressed group in your local community is. For us it might be Native Americans, poor people, black people, and if you happen to be caucasian you probably had a mental illness. The demographics of a methadone maintenance clinic -- the demographics of heroin twenty years ago -- was black, urban, felons. Because of that I think there’s some component of, I don’t want to go to that clinic with all those people I don’t identify with. If you’re an affluent, urban, caucasian person, the idea that going to a clinic that is highly black, urban, poor, with some mental health and felonies mixed in -- racism and classism took over. That was the first thing. 
Now, I entered the field of addiction just as heroin was affecting white, suburban kids. You just roll your eyes: this is something that has been endemic in the North Minneapolis black neighborhood for decades and decades and decades. Now that it is affecting affluent, urban kids people are freaking out. I get it. But I roll my eyes at it. 
I do think how democratic opioid addiction is will force the stigma to change. Opioid addiction is absolutely democratic. Opioids absolutely have no racial, gender, or age preference. This is absolutely a democratic addiction and it is fatal. 
Now, a New York Times article about a Mexican drug cartel looked at a map of America and they said, Where are the regions already controlled by gangs? Don’t go there. We aren’t going to get into a gang war to sell heroin in North Minneapolis. But, Wayzata, and Eden Prairie, there are no gangs there and there is a lot of money there. There was a concerted effort of the Mexican drug cartel to look at a map of America, look at existing gang territory, and go to other regions. 
That came on the tail end of the pharmaceutical opioid epidemic. Obviously the epidemic affected people who had insurance. The pharmaceutical thing disproportionately affected people that had some sort of insurance and didn’t hit the working class as much fifteen years ago. The pharmaceutical thing was more white. The Mexican drug cartel rode those coattails to those same communities that were getting the pharmaceuticals with their three dollar co-pay from their insurance. 
It’s more complex than that, but opioid addiction has been democratized in the last five years and the only good thing about the new demographics of people: women, caucasians, suburban; these groups were less affected by heroin twenty years ago. It was more male, African American, and urban. Obviously it is negative when other groups get affected. The only positive thing about it is that I think it will dramatically affect the stigma going forward. When only urban black men are affected, when HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] only happened to gay, male, IV [intravenous] drug users, you can’t help but to think of it as a gay disease. When it starts happening to straight people you realize it can happen to everyone. 
I think that is what is happening with opioids right now. People realize they had false ideas. That gets back to the methadone thing. The treatment was mistaken for the demographic thing twenty years ago. 
That’s one. Two is that another thing that has bedeviled methadone maintenance, which is kind of a specific point, but relevant, is that methadone tablets for pain can very clearly cause death in pain patients. There have been many very important warning from the CDC [center for disease control] that methadone causes death when given for pain. Recently, there was a Star Tribune article on this where I was weirdly misquoted but then people say, Methadone for pain is so deadly, why are we giving something so deadly to the addict themselves? This is what I was trying to get at. People don’t understand that once you’re an opioid addict, methadone reduces death, prolongs life, improves pregnancy outcomes, reduces incarceration, reduces IV drug use, reduces Hepatitis C and HIV transmission. Once you are an opioid addict, the medicine helps stabilize the addict. Once you are an addict, you have an incredible high death rate. Methadone lowers the death rate in that person in a controlled setting. 
If you are a pain patient -- not addicted, but in pain -- you should have a really low death rate and methadone raises it. If you are an addict you have a high death rate and methadone lowers it. The pain patient in theory shouldn’t be at risk of incarceration and all the other stuff. The point is that in saying that ‘methadone kills pain patients, so why are we giving it to drug addicts,’ they misunderstand that we are talking about two distinctly different groups of people and the addict is at incredible risk of death. They are totally different groups of people. It’s like saying insulin would harm someone without diabetes, so why are you giving insulin to someone with diabetes? It’s like methadone helps someone with addiction, so why would you give it to someone without addiction? The reason is because over and over since the fifties it has been proven to save lives. 
I think that since all the stigma and talk is going to go away when you realize that young, caucasian, affluent kids that are dying, we need to have something to make these kids not die. That is a racist idea that we have let it go so long in the African American community. That is a sad thing. The good thing is that now that it is hitting other communities we are finally going to wake up. 
The addicts themselves who enroll in a methadone clinic, if there is anything they don’t like it is the attendance requirement. The attendance requirement is funny because the addicts don’t like to attend because the first ninety days you have to go six days a week. The community is often surprised to hear how close we monitor people on methadone maintenance. We observe dosing six days a week for up to six hundred patients. There is a doctor on-call every day. This methadone clinic sees more people every year than the emergency room does. Up to three hundred patients a day come here and are observed. It is an incredibly tight monitoring program. We are giving them a powerful medicine, but it has been proven to save their life and it is in the context of very powerful monitoring. 
Totally different from methadone for pain when they give you a bottle of pills for a month's worth and tell you almost nothing and we have almost no regulation on the doctor's prescribing those pills. It is a totally different context. 
Part of the stigma that comes from patients is they call methadone ‘liquid handcuffs.’ It comes in a liquid form. They call it liquid handcuffs because they’re really kind of stuck here. They feel stuck here. This gets me back to trying to articulate what I was going to say at the very beginning. A lot of people think they are on methadone and then will be tapered off and then can be done. Then I’ll be cured. What methadone is not is a cure for addiction. I hope someday we have cures but we don’t. Before you enter the methadone clinic it means you have opioid addiction, which means you have high risk for death, HIV, incarceration, bad pregnancy outcomes, et cetera. When you enter our clinic, we can’t make that go away. We can only manage it with a drug. 
A lot of people enter our clinic and think, Maybe I’m addicted to methadone now. You’re not addicted to methadone now. You are still addicted and there’s no getting around that. They feel like they are stuck on methadone. In some ways you’re stuck with opioid addiction and you need to find the best way to manage it and methadone is one tool. I think a lot of people express their frustration at opioid addiction directed at methadone. They’re frustrated with the fact that they have an incurable disease and there’s no way around it and it has incredible consequences for their life. It manifests as showing up to a methadone clinic six days a week and feeling beholden to that liquid methadone because if you don’t you’re in a lot of trouble and then you get angry at it. 
I think doctors see that as well, for example, for dialysis patients. If you are a dialysis patient you show up for dialysis three times a week, do a three hour dialysis run, and it shifts fluids in and out of the body and pumps blood around and it feels really weird and uncomfortable. You become reliant, dependent on the dialysis machine. If you skip you die in two weeks. A dialysis patient with die without it in two weeks. They are both totally dependent on dialysis for life. Many, not all, come to resent dialysis and what it represents in their life. They can become angry at their dialysis unit, angry at the dialysis nurses and doctors. Not all are unhappy. They come and get it quietly. Many patients become resentful at this ball and chain. They mistake the dialysis for the kidney failure. They mistake the methadone for the heroin addiction. That’s a really common confusion. Long winded answer. 
AS: Methadone has an image problem from all sectors. From society, from the patients themselves, and from the twelve-step recovery communities. 
CR: I’m going to sound like what I’ve heard Obama saying. He keeps saying these things like there are these forces and demographics at play in America that will take us on a path, whether we have steps backwards or not, we are on this path and we can’t stop it. These things are changing. It’s a good change. I think the same thing about treatment of addiction. In some ways it’s bad news because addiction is so democratized now, but it will force us to change. 
The twelve-step programs not liking methadone -- I’m not even worried about it. Just give it ten years. You can be in twelve-step programs, but you can only blame the dead person for their death so often before people will just reject it. You cannot blame the dead person for dying. It just sounds cruel. Unless you have another way to keep those people alive you’re ideology is going to need to change -- and it will change. 
Just like it changed for anti-depressants and all things twelve-step programs went back on. I’m not against twelve-step programs. I think it’s a good thing. We have seen Hazelden Betty Ford begin to backtrack on the opioid thing. All the dinosaurs that don’t believe in the life saving care, they are going to come around because they have to. 
AS: There is accountability now because you also have a whole new demographic of rich, affluent, white people who are not going accept that your program didn’t work because they paid for it. 
CR: Exactly. I think a lot of those things are going to change. I’m not worried about twelve-step programs or Hazelden Betty Ford. They are changing and they have to change. I am happy that I spent those hours in the gym with Gavin Bart who coached me. 
I will say one other thing. People in the government and people in the insurance companies don’t flinch for a second about methadone. They know that methadone keeps people out of prison and keeps people alive. There is no insurer in Minnesota that has done the actual math in methadone maintenance clinics that doesn’t pay for them. Every insurer pays for them. The typical clinic with collect fifty percent of their bills and the insurance companies will negotiate or people won’t pay or that treatment isn’t covered. We collect over ninety-five percent of our bills. The only people that aren’t paid for are people who are clearly abusing the system and still relapsing and they get their funding cut off rightfully so. 
Every insurer is like, Oh, so you’re telling me for five thousand dollars this heroin addict gets six days a week plus urine screens, drug tests, nurses and doctors visits, monitoring, social work; wrap around services for a heroin addict, for five thousand dollars a year. You just need to save one emergency room visit and we’ve made a profit. We easily do that for every patient. Methadone is just one of the best bargains in healthcare, so almost every insurer is going to pay for it. 
That tells you that the monied interests love it because it saves money. The government is very clear-eyed about medication assisted treatment; there is no stigma there. This just keeps you alive. The people who look at this with analytical eyes all really clearly understand the value of methadone and suboxone for the treatment of opioid addiction. The people that get their eyes clouded with their stigma, their ideology, their belief system, and aren’t just being analytical about it throw their ideology about it and get moralistic and they blame dead people for dying. 
One more thing about the stigma of addiction is that [A. Thomas] McLellan published an article in JAMA [Journal of the American Medical Association] in 2001 in which he took four diseases and compared them: asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, and alcoholism. He made a grid and you say, What is the genetic contribution to these diseases? It turns out that asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and alcoholism all have fifty to sixty percent genetics. Fifty to sixty percent of if I’m an alcoholic is due to my genetics.
Second, what is the curability of those diseases? None of those diseases is curable. What is the treatability of those diseases? All of those diseases have treatments, but not cures. What is the patient adherence to doctor’s recommendations? All of them have comparable patient adherence. Whether you tell a diabetic to not eat sugar or an asthmatic to not smoke a cigarette or a hypertensive to not use a salt shaker or an alcoholic not to drink alcohol. When you’re telling a person to change their lifestyle behavior, whether it is in the alcohol or the salt shaker, you get the same results. About thirty percent of patients just don’t follow doctor’s orders -- whether it is alcohol or salt or sugar or exercise or weight loss or whatever it is. Thirty percent don’t follow doctor’s orders and seventy percent try to. Many of those don’t succeed. Alcoholism is just like diabetes, hypertension, and asthma in its genetic risk, patient reaction to news, treatability, and curability. If you forget you’re stigma it looks like any other chronic disease. 
The final line on the bottom of the comparison is access to treatment. All those other diseases are given access to treatments, but alcoholics are not. This was a really powerful, thoughtful argument made by McLellan saying basically in every way if you are analytical and put your stigma aside, alcoholism is every bit the same, chronic disease but for some reason they’re not given treatment. There are treatments available; they are no less good or worthy of patients than the hypertensive that continues to use salt. They have no more curable than a disease. I think that is something we’re still slowly wrapping our heads around.
AS: There is such a moral stigma and judgement against people. It’s been called a disease for a very long time, but we don’t see it as we see other diseases. 
CR: Here is another thing I would point out. In 1975 if you had a heart attack they would put you on bed rest for six weeks and tell you that you are stressing yourself out, you’re an A-type personality, and because of your lifestyle you’ve given yourself a heart attack. In other words, your heart attack was blamed on your personality. Now, if you have a heart attack it’s bing-bang-boom: cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, put a stent in, give them the common cocktail of medicines, and they are back at work in two or three days. Nobody cares what your personality is. 
Ten years later in 1985 if you had an ulcer people would say, Your family has given you an ulcer, you’re worrying too much, you eat jalapenos. Crap like this. Now if you have an ulcer, no one cares what your lifestyle, personality, anxiety level, jalapeno, or coffee intake is. It’s, Do you take Ibuprofen or Advil? Do you have cancer? Do you have an infection called helicobacter pylori? Correct those things and you are back at work in a day and your ulcer will be healed in two weeks. No one cares about your stress level today if you have an ulcer. 
This is human nature. There used to be this disease called consumption. There was a consumptive personality. That turned out to be tuberculosis. Or gout was the king’s disease. Gout has nothing to do with being a king. It has to do with that you eat foods that are high in oxalate, which kings happened to do because they had money back then and it was trendy.
AS: Or hysteria. 
CR: Hysteria! There are lots of examples of this. When we don’t understand a disease fully, and more importantly when we don’t have tools to treat it, we don’t have analytics to measure it, we always describe these diseases to personality. It’s just human nature. When we can’t define it, when we can’t measure it, and when we can’t cure it.
AS: Does it surprise you that we are still there with addiction?
CR: No. Brain diseases are more complex. It’s just a more complex disease. Depression is probably about ten to fifteen years ahead of addiction in terms of stigmatizing it. The difference with depression was when Prozac came out. People say good and bad things about it: the Prozac revolution, the Prozac brain. What Prozac and all the similar antidepressants that followed -- Prozac is actually not as good as an antidepressant as those that preceded it. There were better antidepressants. 
But, Prozac was so safe that any primary care doctor could give it out basically willy-nilly. It’s main advantage was safety, which allowed it to be used in any primary care clinic in the country. By putting a tool in the hands of every primary care doctor, suddenly a primary care doctor could ask their patient about their mood. Suddenly, if the patient had a bad mood the primary care doctor could do something right there to help them safely. Not perfectly effective, but moderately effective. By putting a tool in the hands of the average doctor, you basically began the process of destigmatizing the disease. 
To have depression in 1980 was totally different than having depression today. Having depression in 1980 would have kept a politician out of office. Today we have a governor that has had depression.
AS: And we can talk about it and people know about it.
CR: We can talk about it. Great! I voted for him knowing that and I don’t regret it at all. I think it’s appropriate. When we start putting metrics and tools in hands -- not BS, but things that work and really make a difference for people’s lives -- we are going to see. You need metrics. If we need a blood test or if you can measure and quantify something with a blood test, or an x-ray and you have a tool to fix it and it goes to every primary care clinic in the country it changes everything. It is out of the shadows now. It is quantifiable, it’s visualizable, and it’s treatable. 
Right now addiction is hard to quantify and treatment is still in this shadowy, ghetto corner of medicine. That’s why I think Suboxone should be in primary care clinics, not just to gain access, but to destigmatize. 
AS: Can you talk about Suboxone a little bit? Is the clinic that you work in in Northfield [Minnesota]?
CR: We actually moved to Lonsdale for practical reasons; they actually have a great space. I know have a Suboxone clinic here in Minneapolis at HCMC. I’m not taking any patients at that now, but I have a Suboxone clinic in Lonsdale, Minnesota in a family practice setting. All the doctors that work in that clinic are family practice doctors. 
Every other Monday I see patients in Lonsdale. Yesterday I saw twenty-three patients in five hours. It’s crazy. It’s incredibly rewarding. Yesterday literally two of my twenty-three patients were using heroin still. The rest were sober. I get drug screens, I check their prescription monitoring program, but more so I just know these patients. I meet with them regularly. One of them was given a cruise as the best salesman in their company. She was awarded a cruise to Hawaii. One of them just got offered a major promotion at work. These people are really thriving at work and are really happy. It’s incredibly rewarding work for me. Suboxone is like that thing I said about Prozac. Prozac isn’t a better antidepressant, but it’s safer, so therefore it could be given out more easily in a primary care facility. 
AS: Can you talk about the difference between suboxone and methadone?
CR: Suboxone and methadone when compared head to head have similar effectiveness in keeping people alive, out of prison, stopping injections -- there’s more data on methadone because it’s been around longer -- but every time Suboxone and methadone have been compared they come out about equal. What that means is that on nothing, on abstinence based therapy, you could say twenty percent at best are abstinent still after a year. If you just try to do behavioral, talk therapy alone, the outcomes are approximately twenty percent a year, and some have been ten percent in the studies. Sometimes it’s five percent. To be fair to abstinence based treatment, twenty-five percent is the high end after a year. 
Methadone or Suboxone changes that to seventy-five percent, eighty percent in some studies. You are taking a one year abstinence success rate at twenty percent and turning it into seventy percent. Still note that thirty percent of opiate addicts don’t respond to Suboxone or methadone. This is not a one hundred percent effective treatment. If you do Suboxone or methadone it is not one hundred percent. It is not. Seventy percent are going to respond to either methadone or Suboxone as opposed to twenty percent to behavioral treatment. 
Methadone and Suboxone are comparable in those studies, but there are some differences and I’ll itemize them. Methadone is a full opioid. Both are very long acting and can be taken once a day and will last all day. If you stop taking them you won’t go into withdrawal for three days. In case of emergency or if something happens you have time to get to a clinic if you can’t get it today. They both have very long half lives, and can be taken once a day and last all day, and don’t cause withdrawal for the first three days. 
They both block other opiates. If you try to use heroin you won’t feel the heroin. Therefore, it helps you extinguish your heroin habit. Almost all methadone and Suboxone patients, early on, test it; they try heroin on this drug and they realize they are wasting their money. Suboxone may be a little better at blocking heroin than methadone, but they both block heroin. They are both once a day drugs that last long and block opiates.
Neither of them get you high if you are tolerant. If you have never touched an opiate before and you take methadone -- yeah, you’re going to get really intoxicated. Even Suboxone you can get intoxicated on if you have never used an opioid before. But, if you are a heroin addict, you aren't going to get high on methadone if it is dosed appropriately. They are long acting, block other opiates, you should be wide awake, not nodding off, not intoxicated. In that sense, they are identical. 
The difference comes in in that Suboxone has a ceiling effect in approximately forty percent opiate strength. Even if you really wanted to overdose someone on Suboxone you couldn’t because it has that ceiling effect. Suboxone in some ways is dummy-proof. You aren’t going to get oversedated on Suboxone. If you take Suboxone patients -- I was showing this to a medical student yesterday in the clinic -- if you took Suboxone patients and lined them up with patients who had never used opioids in their life and you took an expert and they had to pick who’s on Suboxone and who’s not, you can’t. I’m very attuned to this -- the size of someone’s pupils, their eyelids, the rate of their speech. I’m very attuned to opioid intoxication and I cannot pick a Suboxone patient out of a line-up. It’s got a lighter touch. You don’t have to worry so much about dosing Suboxone. If you don’t nothing terrible will happen. 
Methadone does not have that ceiling effect. Methadone is a full opioid agonist. Because of that, if you want to be a responsible methadone prescriber you have to work really hard to set limits. There is a dose of methadone which is enough to keep the patient out of withdrawal, addiction managed, keep the patient comfortable, block other opioids, and yet not cause oversedation or, even worse, overdose. There is a dose of methadone that can do that. There is a sweet spot. There is also such thing as too much methadone. If you are going to work with methadone you have to work really hard to set limits on your patients. Some of these are patients that don’t like limits. Part of the job of being a methadone doctor is setting limits. If you can set those limits and keep them in that window where they are getting incredible therapeutic benefits without the oversedation, then methadone behaves exactly the same as Suboxone. Suboxone’s advantage is that ceiling effect and you don’t have to constantly say ‘no’ to people. That is the first major difference because you can overdose and die on methadone much more easily. There’re only a few cases of people dying of buprenorphine alone. You can mix buprenorphine with all sorts of other drugs and die, but buprenorphine alone doesn’t kill you. Methadone alone can kill people. Because it is more potentially lethal that is why it is more highly regulated. That is why we get these clinics and people coming in six days a week. Suboxone is less tightly regulated and can be done out of a primary care clinic. Primary care doctors can prescribe Suboxone and not see the patient six days a week.
AS: I’ve heard that there’s a limit on how many patients a doctor can take because of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. Has that changed?
CR: Yeah. First, there were thirty patients per doctor. Then, if you do that for a year you can apply for a hundred patients. Now the DEA has raised it to 275 patients per doctor. That far exceeds what any reasonable doctor needs. 
AS: When did they do that?
CR: Within the last year -- less than six months ago. That far exceeds what any doctor would need. Right now that limit has been raised to almost too high of a level. The truth is that the average primary care doctor has 1500 patients, let’s say. Of those, twenty percent at least are on opioids. That’s three hundred patients on opioids. So the average primary care doctor has three hundred opioid patients and of those ten percent are addicted. The average primary care doctor actually has thirty patients that are addicted to the opioids they are prescribed. 
The average primary care doctor has a couple dozen addicts in their midst, and they know those patients and they are desperate to do something for those patients. It is incredibly burdensome to their day, to their clinic, to their nurses. They call in all the time, they are running out of pills; they are addicts. Right now those patients are fumbling through with their primary care doctor on Percocet. When the primary care doctor creates a manmade addiction -- iatrogenic addiction -- they created it themselves as a side effect of a prescribed medicine. When that iatrogenic addiction occurs it would be really handy if the primary care doctor had a tool to treat that addiction. It would save everyone a ton of time and heartache. In that sense, the average care doctor only needs fifteen to thirty spots in suboxone. If they wanted to take on community Suboxone patients they would need more than thirty. 
When I’m talking to a person and they ask if they should go on Suboxone or methadone, if you are a very complicated patient: mental illness, socially sick, homeless, legal issues, and you’ve relapsed multiple times and you would benefit from very close supervision, methadone is better. If you need a stronger agent because you have a super sky high tolerance, methadone is better. 
If you basically have stuff together, if your life is together, you’ve got a job, you aren’t seriously mentally ill, you haven’t had multiple life-threatening overdoses and relapses, having a community Suboxone doctor for one month at a time and not get all that supervision; that may be better for you. You don’t have to come into the clinic six days a week because you basically have good mental health, good social stability, good structure because you can take medicines on your own. You just need to get out of this trap you are in in this opioid addiction. That’s the really basic part. The reality is what can you get in your community. Right now you just take what you can get. 
AS: Right. In the ideal world where the primary doctor knows how to deal with Suboxone, but that’s not happening right now?
CR: That’s not happening right now. There’re not enough Suboxone spots. Only these major metropolitan areas have methadone clinics. If you are in the rural clinics you have to drive hours to a methadone clinic. It’s not safe. There is this weird patchwork of availability of these different drugs. If you can get anything they just jump at it and take it. It will save your life. In the future if there is greater availability, that’s what a methadone clinic is for: people who need this high degree of supervision. 
AS: Is there any kind of campaign to get Suboxone out more?
CR: I don’t know. People talk about campaigns but I don’t know what that actually is or if it will actually affect change. 
AS: The only other question I was going to ask was what an ordinary day for you is and what an extraordinary day for you is. You can limit it to one of your places.
CR: There is one other thing I want to say. Another variable in all of this is the research into addiction. There is incredible work being done right now in the NIH [National Institute of Health]. Nora Volkow is at the center of this but there are many great researchers involved in looking at where the addiction centers are and all the neurotransmitters involved. 
There’s a lot of money involved in other pharmaceuticals and treatments. If you can treat addiction more effectively and safely it is a gold mine. There is a lot of interest in it, but it is complex science. I think it’s going to take ten to twenty years. As that science emerges I think it’s a really exciting time. There is a refocus on clinical science and basic science and the development of pharmaceuticals for addiction. It’s exciting. That is another way to destigmatize things. If you can define them in analytical terms it removes a lot of stigma. I’m hopeful that we are on the right path. I really am. I’m not doing any of this science, so I’m really glad someone is out there doing it! My boss is one of them, so I’m glad people are doing it. 
A fulfilling day -- there are two versions of the same day. Either a busy Suboxone clinic or like on Monday I saw twenty-three Suboxone patients. Greater than eighty percent are doing well. One of them was a pregnant mom who was on pain pills and got pregnant and the doctor abruptly cut her off pain pills. She went into withdrawal and she got desperate and she went and used heroin. She called me and I was able to get her onto Suboxone which was life saving for her and her pregnancy -- it improves her pregnancy outcome. 
Another one, similarly; I had two pregnant moms. I just had an incredible mix of patients at a crossroads in their lives. I had this pregnant mom who was at a crossroad in her life. Eight years in I’m confident -- I’ve made errors, I’ve had bad outcomes -- but I’m confident I can help this mom who is snorting heroin and get a good outcome. That is exciting and thrilling me to see my eighty plus patients who are living the good outcome and then have the ten to twenty percent that are trying to get there and I feel a real sense of hope and confidence that I can get these patients to cross the finish line to a good outcome. I want both these moms to have healthy deliveries. 
A similar analogy here is I’ll have methadone clinic days where I’ll just line up the methadone patients and I’ll see maybe ten in the morning talking about dose and side-effects and their life. Some of those mornings it is so fulfilling and wonderful to me even though the majority of them have some problem we are working on, either with their dose or something else. To see these people that were really badly wounded and suffering and sick in a lot of ways, to hear them and their stories and to meet them and understand how they are really leading a meaningful life now. Whether it is Suboxone or methadone having those clinics where I can see these folks and sit down and get to know them. Friend isn’t the right word, but I’m friends with some of them and I really appreciate their presence in my life. 
I had one guy give me a cup of coffee -- he’s a ceramicist -- and I drink out of it every morning. This heroin addict made me this beautiful mug and I drink out of it every morning! Those things are wonderful. 
I think the worst thing for me is administrative paperwork called a prior authorization that is attached to Suboxone administration. It is January so I am getting nailed with them because it is the beginning of the year. The worst things is when red tape gets in the way of delivering care. Then I have to call my patients and be like, Sorry, there is going to be a three day delay until you can get your medicine. They start crying and yelling. They are angry, scared, tearful, and they’ll relapse. I’ll call them and say there is nothing you can do because your insurance requires this paperwork and they’ll blame me, the pharmacy; they’ll cry, they’ll beg, and I’ll say there is literally nothing I can do. It is all work put on me. 
AS: It is red tape but also denying access to care. 
CR: There has been lawsuits settled in other states about prior authorizations for Suboxone. The attorney general has put on notice the insurance companies in the state that she will be prosecuting. A similar thing for prior authorizations on Suboxone. She just put out a memo encouraging this to be a legislative priority. She is hoping that she won’t need to prosecute them because it will be legislative in this session. There’s hope, but it is absolutely the worst thing when an administrative detail prevents the care of a patient and then I feel their pain when I tell them it is going to be days before they get their medicine. 
AS: Is the prior authorization because it is Suboxone or just red tape from the insurance company? It’s not DEA restrictions or anything?
CR: No. Insurance companies made a practical, financial decision that they used prior authorizations for anything that is costly or potentially abusable or when they think physicians aren’t educated about appropriate use for a medicine. When you talk to the people doing the prior authorizations, like me, they catch a lot of doctors prescribing the wrong thing. There is a benefit to it, but it hurts the well meaning. 
AS: Thank you very much. I’m so appreciative. 
CR: Thank you. It was fun"

SRG: A lot of them are actually up here in Ely. We came here all the time as kids. Labor Day, Memorial Day, a week in the summer, and then eventually two weeks in the summer, and then eventually my parents bought this place and it's great. We had so much fun. I think part of it was just who our parents are and part of it is the childcare that we were at, which is on a hobby farm. We both just developed a love for being outside and boredom certainly entered into our lives, but the answers to it were things like go outside and build a fort or wander around a wetland and play an imagination game as opposed to watch a bunch of TV, which we did, too. We were not no-screen kids, but we definitely had that outdoor adventure aspect. 
AS: And just so we're clear, you're younger than Spencer?
SRG: Yes, two and a half-ish years younger. 
AS: So, your whole life is a memory with a big brother. 
SRG: Yes, I have flashes of memory from one time when I was in the hospital because we were at a family picnic at the daycare that we went to and there were sheets hanging up. The older kids were all playing baseball and this sheet was their home base backdrop to catch pitches. I was running with my friends behind it and someone swung a bat and I got clocked in the head from the other side of a sheet, hard. This kid was swinging a baseball bat to hit a ball. I have a memory of my dad and my brother visiting me. 
AS: You would have been like four?
SRG: Maybe even younger. I don't know how old I was when that happened. I definitely remember Dad and Spence visiting in the hospital. I think they gave Spence a little hospital gown to visit me in. Who knows if that's a real memory, but it's there. I remember a lot of Sunday nights we would get our laundry out and we would have to fold our laundry and then after folding our laundry we would put it up on the ottoman and get to build forts in our laundry baskets to watch Sunday night TV which was like Life Goes On and The Simpsons and there might have been one more. Sunday night family time, it was great. That was definitely a tradition. 
Wintertime, the house was built on a hill and so in front we had a more gentle sloping hill, which was great when Dad would go and scoop it out and make this really cool run for tubing. The tube would sail up the sides and we had a back more steep hill and then the wetland off of that. We would play for hours in the winter outside. My dad would do his [whistles] whistle and it would carry across the wetland and it'd be like, ""I guess we've got to go in."" In the den we had this old, old heater. You'd go and you'd turn it up so that it clicked on and you'd go put your feet on it until your feet burned to try to warm up. 
AS: Did your property back up to a wetland?
SRG: Our property backed up to a wetland. You can see it from 494, when you're driving north it's on your right side right before you get to 394. We called it “The Island,” like a hump of land in the middle with a bunch of trees on it. We would always just hike out to The Island, more so in the winter than in the spring or summer because it was often so deep. I vaguely remember being able to canoe out there one time but I was really young, I can barely remember that. 
AS: So tell me about school and your big brother.
SRG: When I was younger I don't remember being like, ""I have a big brother who's in this grade,"" which I'm sure I did. School was just like ""Ahhhhh, this is great. I can just go sit in a corner and read books and have friends.""
AS: So you liked school?
SRG: Yeah, I liked school a whole lot. I still like school. If I could be paid to go to school instead of paying to go to school my life would be perfect. I'm a lifelong learner for sure. I almost went on a tangent about learning. I remember maybe like second grade I have strong memories of playing with friends. He, obviously being older, had already established some friendships. I was actually talking about this last weekend at my bridal shower with one of the other moms. We were trying to remember how all of the friendships got forged. She remembers her son who was Spencer's age, also a redhead, came home from school and was like, ""Mom, there's another redhead."" They started playing together. She also has a daughter who's my age and so then we played together and I think were in each other’s classes, too. Within biking distance there were two other families in the district with sons Spencer's age and daughters my age and then another family with a daughter Spencer's age, but they didn't really play, and a daughter my age. There was a neighborhood full of kids all going to the same school. It was fun because then all of the sudden we'd have four families over at the house and have these romping playdates is the word they use now. We'd just go and be in the wetland. We'd have all these adventure games. In the fall we'd have the tractor out. At one point we had a moped and some go-carts. 
My cousins that were the same age as us would come over and play too. The same thing: we'd always be running around. Of course the older kids would annoy the crap out of the younger kids and vice versa. I'm sure there was lots of, ""It's not fair,"" going on. Just a ton of getting to learn about negotiating as a human being through play, which was really cool. Getting to romp around in the woods and be like, ""Do you think it's a good idea that we're this close to a buck fight?"" Just stuff like that. I think I was in fourth grade and he was in sixth grade, it was the last year we were in elementary together. It was the first year we were home alone after school for a few hours until my parents got home. At least I think it was the first year. Spence and I, he had been working on a fort with his friends out in the woods. We were playing in the fort and we heard a buck fight going on. It was so cool. At a certain point Spencer was like, ""Alright, you have to go inside."" Not inside the house because that was too far and you had to go past the buck fight. He was very much like, ""Okay, this is starting to get dangerous."" Didn't come inside the fort himself. The fort had a fully enclosed area and then a top. I did, and then I'm sitting there and I'm like, ""Wait a minute, why does he get to watch?"" Also, I would much rather be able to see it coming if I need to run instead of get trampled. Very cool, but definitely he was a risk-taker. Playing certainly involved a lot of risk and then later on being like, ""Hm, maybe we should do this thing that will keep us safe."" 
AS: Were you a risk-taker at all?
SRG: I was less inclined to it. I was a ""good kid"" to use really big quotes there, but not also a good kid. I knew how the system of rules worked and especially by the time I was in high school and got over my fear of getting in trouble. I knew how to work the system. Definitely knew how to get around it. I learned how to take risks because of Spencer. 
Up here there's a part of the lake that has this sheer rock cliff and it's perfect for climbing because there's lots of different handhold levels. It was like a Memorial Day or Labor Day weekend. He had a friend come up, but I didn't. I played with them a lot. They decided they were going to go climbing this thing. I was like, ""Okay, I can go, too."" I followed along. Then at a certain point we're out in the middle of this. I'm terrible with judging distance with my eyes but it's like from here to the cars in terms of height. It's not an insignificant height. A couple hundred feet, and it's very wide and we're in the middle of it. I remember hearing my mom or my dad on the dock being like, ""Ah!"" I all of a sudden realize and Spence and his friend were just like, ""Follow us, try not to look down. If you do look down just accept that that's your fate."" 
AS: Did you jump into the water? Was it over the water?
SRG: No, it was over the water but there was no safe way to jump. It was enough of a slant in that there were a ton of rocks below us. It was one of the rare parts of the lake that didn't slant in super quickly. There was rubble and rock at the bottom. It was a terrifying moment that was also a really good growth moment. It was like, ""Oh, hey, you just confront the next thing ahead and you find the next handhold and the next foothold. You do it."" That has been an allegory in terms of the whole experience with Spencer's addiction and death. You find the next handhold and if you look down you just think, ""This is my fate now. This is what it is."" You hope you reach the top. We did that obviously. None of us fell to a rocky death. 
AS: With your parents watching.
SRG: Encouraging, but also like probably half mad. What are they going to do? Follow us and endanger themselves? I think I remember one of them drove over in the boat and was trying to coach from below. They can't see all the nuances of the little holes and handholds. It was literally following Spence and his friend up the side of this cliff and hoping to God that it wasn't some sort of ""I'm going to get you now, little sister."" He never had it out for me. Not at least more than regular sibling rivalry would state. 
AS: I keep hearing the story that he was very, very shy and you were very, very social.
SRG: Yeah, that is true. 
AS: Is there a point where you kind of remember that or where that stands out to you?
SRG: No, because it's just how I've always been. I think more poignant is as the last year and a half has gone by and I've figured this thing called grieving your sibling out I have become less social, and that's different. I am far much more in need of my me time. It's one of those weird skills that you can't learn until something super shitty happens that is ultimately I think a self-care skill. I got a lot better at being like, ""Oh, I need to do this for me."" For at least a week there was a whole like, ""I can't do anything else but be selfish."" 
Then a few months after that figuring out how to function in the world again. A few weeks after Spencer died Prince died. Everyone cared so much and I'm like, ""How do you care so much?"" Removed from the immediacy of Spencer's death I get it, I do, because people become really important culturally. At the time it was so hard. The end of the year posts because a lot of famous people died in 2016 and a lot of stupid crap happened. People were just like, ""Fuck off 2016."" I was like, ""No this is the last year my brother was alive. How could you possibly?"" Then I'm like, “Oh yeah, people are entitled to their life experiences.” Figuring out how to claim that space and exist in the world. I've always been a super empathetic person, too, which I think goes along with the outgoing in a sense that I just get people. I can have empathy with the manipulative behavior of addiction. 
AS: Did you get your brother, or did it go in and out?
SRG: Yeah. I mean especially when we were kids I got him. I think when you have siblings that's where you do the most of your social negotiation and figuring out how to function in the world. It's this whole different relationship than you have with any other human being. You can't treat everybody the way you treat your siblings because you don't know the backstory. Then in terms of one of the hardest things about his addiction—and when he was around, and when we were together and confronting that—was that he would say things and I knew he was manipulating me. He's my brother; he's always known what to say to get under my skin. I don't think it was until my late twenties that I finally stopped just letting it roll off my back and being like, ""No, I disagree with you. You're being a jerk."" These things that at the same time that I need to stand up for myself I'm like, “What if I say something that makes him go use again?” 
AS: That sense that you have some control, that your behavior can somehow impact what he does or doesn't do. 
SRG: Yeah, which it can't. Wouldn't that be an interesting character trait, if we could control other people? You can with manipulation. There are these things, but that's another soapbox for another day. 
AS: Do you feel like talking about your own struggle? Some of your own mental health struggles?
SRG: Yeah, I can talk about that. 
AS: That came up in your parents’ conversations, just trying to deal with that. What was that like for you and how did that play out?
SRG: I think it was ninth grade. 
AS: We're talking about what year? What year were you born?
SRG: I was born in 1984. I'm thirty-three now in 2017. Ninth grade would have been 1997-98 school year. I don't remember if it was the summer before ninth grade or the summer before tenth grade. I just got real lethargic and didn't care about a lot all of a sudden. That was weird. I'm a happy-go-lucky, horns-of-the-bull, grab life sort of person. It was just all of a sudden like not having any energy. This bizarre irrational sense that I would die in my sleep and then I had a really hard time falling asleep. Then would have a really hard time staying awake because I was exhausted but also terrified of sleeping. 
Looking at it now and knowing as much now, it was some really hardcore anxiety and puberty stuff. At the time, I agree with the doctor's prognosis that it was a lot of depression. I was put on antidepressants and did a lot of counseling with a wonderful woman in Plymouth. It was so weird to just go and talk to someone. ""Did you feel sad this week?"" Yeah because I have to go and do homework and I want to go play and this boy and that person. I'm a teenager—of course I'm sad! Then at the same time because I'm a teenager not realizing the impact on my personality that medications are having, just figuring out the nuances of side effects. Now knowing what we know now about how brains develop my brain is still developing. My personal experience was a very bad one with antidepressants. Ultimately, I became a part of the statistic that antidepressants make young people even more depressed and suicidal. In high school we got a really good handle on it. I was just on a maintenance level and then I went to school. 
AS: To college?
SRG: To college. I went to DePauw University and had chosen it because they had an education program. It was far away, but not too far away. A big factor was I got a really big financial aid package, too. I got there and they were like, ""We're disbanding our education program. Get a degree in whatever you want and then do a fifth year program."" I was like, ""Okay, because I just worked my ass off to get here."" It didn't even occur to me that I could be like, ""Well this isn't for me then. Thank you. Goodbye."" That's another soapbox for another day. 
I struggled. It was hard. I thought about coming home. I'm also very stubborn. I built these friends. I'm sure I saw moving schools as a failure. I made it through my freshman year and had signed up for an anthropology class and loved it. I declared in my first week that I would take anthropology partially because I loved the class and partially because my first year advisor for whatever my first year seminar was not a good fit, we'll put it that way. I just didn't want to have to go talk to her about my life and everything. 
Sophomore year I moved into the sorority house that I rushed. I had decided not to rush, but they offered me a snap bid, or something, which is just enough of them knew me and thought I was great and a good fit. Without reconsidering, you decided not to do this for a reason, I just was like, “Oh yay I feel included. This is great!"" I joined the sorority. It was fun and sisterhood and all of those things that is again another story. I moved into the sorority house sophomore year. One night just was at my desk and took a bottle of Excedrin. A whole bottle, which will kill you as it turns out. I was up the whole night, the overwhelming constant fear that I was going to die in my sleep, which was irrational.
AS: You still had that?
SRG: It came back. It came back out of nowhere. I've gone back and read what I was journaling that day. Nothing about it is depressed sounding. It's a journal, so why would I mince words or anything? I'm also a pretty open book much to my mother's chagrin for a while. On paper I attempted suicide but I still don't consider it that. It wasn't me.
AS: Do you think it was the antidepressants?
SRG: I do, one hundred percent. 
AS: Now they know that. 
SRG: Even a year later these ads were coming out. I'm like what the fuck? Why was I on that? Then I got diagnosed with bipolar. They're like, ""Clearly blah blah blah."" That's what they knew at the time. I can be angry about it, but it's also the truth of what they knew at the time. Again I can look down and see all of those rocks below me and I got to the top of that cliff eventually and I'm happy for it. I was on all sorts of stuff. 
AS: That was a misdiagnosis?
SRG: Yes, that was a misdiagnosis. I was on an anti-psychotic. I don't remember very clearly like two years of my life. 
AS: In college?
SRG: Yeah. I remember some big events but I don't have, I can't pull out. I went back later on when I was doing my education coursework—went back to find a paper I had written on something. I was like, ""Oh, I have that book."" I have no memory of writing this paper or reading the book. I have shelves and shelves of books and plays that have my notes in them and I have no memory of reading them. It's a little terrifying. It was hard. I know it was hard for Spencer. He definitely, again, would when he needed things or wanted things and was trying to manipulate me would use that as ammunition, which was really hard, too. 
AS: He would use what?
SRG: Use the attention I took away from him from my parents, with my parents supporting me so much as ammunition. He would say some terrible shit when he wanted to wound me. He could be a really big asshole, a really big asshole. 
AS: Let's pause this for a second. 
[Break in Recording] 
AS: At what point did his addiction, at what point was that clear to you? Did you know about what was going on with him?
SRG: I remember in junior high him getting kicked out or suspended because he had brought booze to school and someone asking me out on a date because of it. The unfortunate part is that I super liked this guy and so I totally went out and dated him the way you do in seventh grade for two weeks. 
AS: Because your brother was cool?
SRG: Yeah, and so therefore I was probably really cool. Fun fact: I was a really big nerd. Then also in high school I got into the things that high schoolers got into. I didn't really drink in high school. I wasn't really a partier. I did get high starting in I don't know what grade. Then my sophomore year that was kind of my year of exploration. That was my first time that I went to a party and lied to my parents that her parents were home. I got drunk and I got high. That spring also my best friend's little sister died from leukemia and I didn't know how to handle that. One of my friends at the time over spring break we just went with her boyfriend and some people that he knew and got in their car and went to St. Cloud and did some drugs that I didn't know what they were with some people. She went home in the middle of the night and left me there. She had a ride home with someone. I don't know why we thought any of this was a good idea. 
I don't really remember much about Spencer's response other than I was sleeping everything off and he came in and was like, ""That was really stupid. You could have died,"" which in retrospect is what it is. We didn't really talk about it beyond that. We would smoke pot together. In college years we would take mushrooms together and would do cocaine together. One day I was like, ""Well this is all very stupid and a waste of my money and I will get into trouble."" I just walked away. I think I called my parents and was like, ""Hey, I have to tell you something."" It was more of a way to keep myself accountable because I get to that point where I'm just an open book. I'm like, ""Hey, I've been doing this really stupid thing. I'm going to change that."" 
AS: Did you tell them Spencer was doing all that?
SRG: I don't think so. I don't know. I don't remember. This was also during college when I don't remember a large portion of things. I don't think I started doing coke until after I was off the anti-psychotics. I was also super terrified about drug interactions. It was more the last three semesters that I was at school. Then again it was like, ""Well, I'm done with this."" When we were in town we'd party. Spencer would become mad that I was becoming too close to his friends. He'd yell at me for flirting with his friends. I was like, ""Then why are you inviting me to hang out with your friends that you think are cool if you don't want me to become friends with them? Your friends are cool."" I have a different opinion about that now. I think a lot of them are actually all pretty cool people. There was that time—I think for me I was able to walk away from it, so I wasn't really worried that he couldn't either. He just needed to get to the point where he made that choice to walk away, too. ""He just hasn't gotten here yet,"" which is a different thing. 
When he and Jamie were dating and living at the old house they were talking about getting married and stuff. Are you going to continue doing drugs and all these things? Jamie was like very much I don't want this lifestyle anymore. Spencer was saying that he didn't and then they got pregnant and at one point during Jamie's pregnancy Spencer was growing in a closet. He was growing pot. I was like, ""This is the opposite of giving this up,"" but also like very much deferring to Jamie. “I want to maybe tell my parents because I bet they don't want this at their house, on their property that they own. You're going to have a kid.” 
It's hard because pot for a lot of people is not problematic. It's less problematic than alcohol. That's just a thing that exists in the world that is a discussion I constantly have with myself and it changes every day whether I think it's a problem or not. I don't know the answer still and that's okay. It's tricky because I've seen it hurt a ton of people. There's also the influence of the DARE program and the whole marijuana is a gateway drug, which I don't really think is true. I also don't know because that's not my field of study. From my personal experience I don't see that as a truth. Anyways, that's that. 
AS: I think for people who were kind of hardwired for addiction it can definitely be a gateway drug, but not for everyone who uses it.
SRG: That's the true thing about alcohol, too. If you're wired for addiction then it doesn't matter if it's beer or scotch or wine. It's there. I definitely, as the years have progressed, have been like ""Am I drinking too much?"" Then I'll just quit drinking for two months just to see if I can. I just don't have that and it's kind of hard to reconcile.
AS: It kind of haunts you?
SRG: Yeah, it's like, “What's up with my brain that I can just walk away?” I was just, ""Alright, I'm done,"" and then walked away. The day after Spence died when we went to the sober house and hearing people talk about how that addiction is always there even when you're sober. I smoked cigarettes a lot. That's the closest I have. It took me a really long time. We'll see if it sticks this time. I really like smoking. There's a lot of things I really like about smoking despite knowing that it's horrible for me and could kill me. That's the closest I could relate to and it just felt so ingenuine to be like, ""I get what you guys are going through."" I don't at all. I walked away with no problem. Then part of it was feeling that guilt. Was us doing some drugs together contributing to that? Maybe and probably. Did it contribute in such a way that it caused Spencer to die? No, there were a hundred factors and the main one of them being that he was severely addicted. 
AS: And to opioids.
SRG: And to opioids, which I never got. I remember getting injured at work one time. He was like, ""When you go to the doctor tell him you can't sleep because it hurts so much and they'll give you blah blah blah."" I remember being at my grandma's, I think we were down there for her ninetieth birthday. He told me he'd found my grandpa's, and my grandpa had died in like 2005 and this was 2009, these pills were dated before he died. Spence found these pills and he just took them. I didn't think anything of it. 
AS: He just ingested them or he took the bottle?
SRG: I think he put them in a different bottle. He left the pill bottle but left it empty. I'm sure my ninety year old grandma didn't notice. I don't remember if I ever told my parents about that. It was that whole “the sibling code of secrecy” sort of thing, which was also hard. If I tell Mom and Dad that he did all of this cocaine then I also have to tell them that I did. It was a silly fear because I told them. I got so wrapped up in what Spence was going through. He was super manipulative and knew how to say just the right thing to get under your skin. He would be vicious, which is just hard to say about a person that you love that is now dead. There were some crappy things about him. There're crappy things about me. 
AS: Addiction can also bring out things in people that you wouldn't really consider it an inherent part of their personality.
SRG: It magnifies all the worst things. 
AS: I understand what you mean. I know that you love him.
SRG: I totally do. 
AS: It does bring out the worst in people. When did you learn that he had a problem with pills? Or did you? Was it not until he came back from Montana?
SRG: I knew that he kept doing them. Aidan was born in September. In the months between then—and it was Oscar night I remember, late January, early February. There were three different occasions when Jamie called me in tears like, ""We have to have an intervention."" I was like, ""Alright, I will support you. We'll go over to Mom and Dad's right away in the morning."" Then she'd call me in the next morning and be like, ""No, things are okay."" Finally the third time this happened and I'd been talking to a really good friend of mine. I was at his house for an Oscar party and the phone rang. He saw that it was Jamie and he's like, ""You go. Do your thing."" It was an Oscar party so we had dressed up. I'm standing outside on the sidewalk on Colfax in Uptown in heels and a dress and my coat probably smoking a cigarette sobbing with Jamie. Just being like, ""We're going to do this in the morning."" Hanging up and calling my parents. She's not going to turn this around on me again. I don't know that I have the strength to stand up to her. So much of it was like, “It's your family and I don't want to tell you.” That's a deficit in my personality is that I have a hard time saying, ""No, this is actually really problematic."" For as much as I'm a teacher, I don't want to be overbearing. 
AS: That put you in such a difficult situation.
SRG: I want the best for him. It was a really tricky situation. I called them and was just like, ""Jamie and I are coming over in the morning because we've got to talk about Spencer."" Usually when they tell this story they don't remember that part of it. They always just talk about how it was Jamie. I'm like, ""The fuck?"" That's a small thing to be upset about so I let it go. I called them so many times in the middle of the night when I was dealing with my anxiety and depression and misdiagnosis. That was a really solid, easy thing to remember. I'm sure I questioned it before then though. 
AS: That's 2009?
SRG: Yeah, or 2010 because it was January I think or February. He went into his program. When someone goes into a program there's a certain amount of admission both on their part and also on your part as a family. Alright this is a problem and we're going to confront this. Then it became really hard because you go through all of that initial, “Why didn't I do anything sooner?” I'm so mad we even have to do this. He would just always be like, ""I just don't believe it. I don't understand why I'm here for pot. There are people who are here for blah blah blah."" Lo and behold we learn all of this later. 
I don't have a strong memory of him using meds. I remember there were a couple times where he would be like, ""Oh you have this thing. You should tell them you can't sleep because of it and they'll give you this."" I remember him getting appendicitis. He would come to every one of my plays. He was my biggest supporter. I have parents who are super supportive. Even the silly stuff, the stuff my parents couldn't get to he would try his best to show up to see shows. I remember him being at a show that I directed and just being out of it and in pain. He had just gotten his appendix out and they were going to move to Montana soon. 
Then that the following year when they had lived in Montana for six months I was doing the Reading Corps, it was Minnesota Reading Corps. It's not Teach for America it's the literacy version of that's under AmeriCorps. For spring break I took the train out. I could kind of tell some stuff was going on just because of the way my parents couldn't give me a real reason they thought visiting Montana was maybe not the best idea. 
AS: So they kind of tried to hide this from you?
SRG: They definitely did. They did. They definitely were trying to hide it for sure. I went out and things were just tense. Aidan's a year and a half at this time. Things were tense. They weren't outright fighting, Spencer and Jamie. They'd squabble and skirmish more than normal. Spence was, he just seemed constantly high. I don't remember that he was necessarily smoking pot. It was just kind of like, it wasn't awful to be around him, but I didn't really want to hang out. This isn't cool. I just played with Aidan a whole lot. He went into the hospital with pain. Jamie and I went out with Aidan one day. It was becoming apparent that something was going on. 
I ultimately at the end of that trip when I was getting on the train, Aidan came home with me. My parents bought Aidan a ticket. Aidan and I took the train back and he stayed here for I don't know how long while that situation was getting figured out. That was the first of the, ""Okay, there's something going on."" My parents still weren't really telling me anything and Spencer was still like the pain narrative with me. Jamie was just like unless I was there in person we didn't really talk a whole lot about it unless it was stuff about Aidan. That was kind of like the beginning of the unveiling. 
I remember many conversations with my mom and dad being like, ""Why aren't you telling me these things?"" ""Well, we don't want you to be burdened."" ""That's very sweet of you, but you're actually burdening me more by keeping me out. Now I feel stupid. I feel uninformed. There are other people in the family who are asking me how Spence is and I don't know why the hell they're asking me. Everyone else knows because you talk to your brothers and sisters who talk to their kids about this."" There was a lot of anger around that. You work through it. 
AS: Do you think part of them wanting to protect you had to do with their experience with your mental health issues? That they felt that would somehow tip you over the edge or something?
SRG: Yeah, like it would trigger it or something. I think that's why I was most angry about it. Why don't you trust me to tell you I don't want to know this if I don’t? I definitely do and there was a lot of anger around not feeling like I was trustworthy. 
AS: By this point you're in your...?
SRG: I'm in my twenties, mid to late twenties. There was a lot of discussion with my mom because she is the opposite of me, or was at that time in terms of being an open book. She was like, ""Don't tell people you're depressed. You don't have to share everything with everyone."" No I don't, which is why I don't. I share certain things that I've given thought to. Less thought then than I do now. It's interesting to see how she is now where she's like, ""We have to talk about these things, that's how stigma happens."" Fighting against that “don't tell anyone” narrative. What's the point? Then you're just sitting there suffering in silence. Then there was a lot of anger around that as well. Her worry that I would just turn around and post it on Facebook, which if you don't want me to and then say, ""Hey don't."" Will I always listen? Not one hundred percent of the time, but I'll frame it in a certain way. 
AS: At that point she was very afraid of people finding out.
SRG: Yeah, and the stigma around it. I get it. It's hard when one of your kids is struggling with something and your other friends have kids who are seemingly perfect. That's just because nobody talks. If we change the narrative and we start talking to each other then we understand that we're all struggling and it's great. Then we can all celebrate when things are great and we can help each other when things suck. It's been a rough period. We've gotten to a really nice place with it. There was a lot of having to ask always. 
AS: Can I talk about this?
SRG: Or even asking, ""Hey, is something going on?"" Like asking ""What's this?"" Then feeling horrible because I'm the last one to know. Then feeling like I can't get mad and confront them about it because they're dealing with a kid who's addicted to heroin. 
AS: So you kind of fall in the shadows a bit even under the guise of them wanting to protect you from the hardest parts of it. 
SRG: Then at the same time being the person who just gets and has that empathy. I get why they made that choice. I get it. While I'm mad about it I also get it. 
AS: You feel like you could have been more of a support to them?
SRG: Yeah, and also if maybe you don't want to deal with it ask me and I will cancel my vacation and stay home and hold down the fort. Give me the tools so it's not only ruining my life. It can ruin all of our lives together, which feels terrible to laugh about, but it's easier to go through a shitty time when you have other people to go through a shitty time with you. 
AS: They did talk about a time when they went to go bring Aidan back and Spencer was here at home or he was in treatment and you were alone at their house and he called.
SRG: He called and wanted to come in. They had very strict rules about it. I was like, ""I'll put this sleeping bag on the porch for you."" He was playing us against each other. Then I found out later in the morning that he had dug up something in the backyard. I don't know if it was stuff he had stashed there to pawn later. I don't know if it was a key to the house so he could get in to grab stuff. He'd stashed something but he dug it up from the yard in the middle of the night. That was crappy. 
Then there was the time when they had come up to close the cabin, this was the fall before Spence died, and I had just moved in out of a really shitty living situation. I was student teaching. It was the Renaissance Festival and I had just met Jeff who I'm going to marry in sixteen days. Spence was also at home. I heard the TV on when I went to go to the bathroom at like two in the morning. It was Sunday night so I had to go to work in the morning. I'd been at the festival all weekend, which was hot and exhausting. 
AS: You were working at the festival?
SRG: Yeah, I'm a street performer. I walk on stilts and I do puppets. I hear the TV on so I look over the banister and I'm like, ""Hey Spence go to bed."" He got really mad at me for telling me what to do, which should have been the first sign. Then he did eventually like two hours later come upstairs and go to bed. At that time he was just like ""It's really hard to sleep."" All the things he says. We had this really deep conversation, which in hindsight I'm like, ""Oh you were coming down."" He was like going through that cycle of feeling, I think, guilty. He was doing a lot of like, ""I just miss when we were kids. I'm really sorry."" All of that. 
Then he's like, ""I've got to go to the bathroom."" He came back and he was a different person. It was a progression but it just got weirder and weirder and he would fall over. I'd be like, ""Let's go to bed."" He was nodding off. Hopeful me is like, ""He's fine."" I should have called the police and been like, ""My brother is super high."" What would they have done? Kicked him out two hours later anyways. I went to the bathroom and I found a spoon on the counter and a needle. The side of the tub had been pulled away, which is a place that he stashed things. It was all literally dirty, covered in dirt. He was like, ""This is just really old. I found it because Jamie is making me super mad so I want to send it to her and show her what she makes me feel like doing."" I stupidly, stupidly, stupidly let him dispose of the needle, which I'm sure he didn't do. I don't remember if I told my parents about it. It was the beginning of when everything was going crazy. 
AS: This was just six months before he died?
SRG: Yeah. They had come up here to close the cabin down for the winter. I think a day or two before he was super sober. Otherwise I don't think my parents would have come up here together to close the cabin. He met Jeff. That's the only time that Jeff got to meet him when he was sober. Then every other time it was shitty. I promise I have all these really great stories, too. It's not only this. It's only been half this. One third this, I don't know. Then everything went back on that rollercoaster of losing hope and finding hope, having hope and everything being in a good spot. 
I saw him super briefly two or three days before he died. He was at the house. I was coming and he was going or vice versa. It was just a, ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Fine. Good to see you."" That's the last time I saw him alive or saw him. I'm glad that was a positive interaction. He seemed pretty sober at that point, too. 
AS: That's what your parents thought. Everybody thought that. 
SRG: It seemed like he was doing so good. The thing that sucks about it is it's even more awful heroin. All heroin is awful, but had he maybe not had this exotically strong heroin that he had shot up he wouldn't have died. Is that useful thinking? I don't know. It serves whatever purpose it serves and then you let it go. It was really weird because I was in a yoga class that Sunday. I had a Fitbit, which I was wearing during class. It was linked to my phone and it started buzzing and it was like the last couple minutes of class. It started buzzing and it was my mom calling. It was the first time since Spencer's addiction that I wasn't like, ""Oh no, he overdosed."" I knew. I just knew. I just laid in shavasana and let myself have that. They called back. 
AS: All these other times your mother had called you, you never thought that?
SRG: I had. All the times she'd call, especially if it was a weirder time of day, I was like, ""Oh is this..."" This time I didn't have that thought, which is how I knew. 
AS: This is the first time you weren't concerned when she called. How long had you been anticipating Spencer's death?
SRG: I think for sure at Christmas I was like, ""God, I don't think he can do it."" That Christmas was hard. Here I have my new boyfriend. Welcome to the family. This is just our life. Then before that I remember having a conversation with my dad where he had admitted to me the hard truth of wondering if that was coming soon. Then again the hard truth if it happens: is that the worst thing? It is at the same time that it's not. It sucks so much but it also sucks so much in both situations. The person he was when he died was an asshole. He wasn't my brother, but he was also. It sucks so hard. 
AS: Is it the worst thing? 
SRG: It is. It's the worst thing, but it's also a really great thing. There're so many great things about it. He's done with that struggle. We're done with that struggle. It's so selfish, but it's so true. You feel crappy for saying it, but it's also like my parents got to go on vacation and they didn't have to worry. It was so good. They went to Ireland and they’ve been to Florida. Now they have to worry about a wedding, but that's a different kind of worry. It sucks and I would change it if given the option, but I also admit that there are things that are better. It is better to not live daily wondering if my mom's calling to tell me my brother died. It is better to not see my brother in that pain and shame and guilt and struggle. It's better that it's over even though at the same time it sucks and I don't want it to be over. There's always that little voice of could I have had him back? Could we have scaled the cliff? Then feeling really terrible that I couldn't show him the handholds on this particular allegorical cliff. 
AS: That's a great analogy.
SRG: It's worked out well for this situation. Then going forward and knowing that addiction is a thing that can tear apart families. Could I do it? Could I do what my parents have done? I've always wanted kids and now I've questioned wanting kids. I do but it's terrifying and is it worth it? I think one hundred percent it is. 
AS: When you have a kid you give yourself over to the unknown in so many ways. That's also how we continue to be a species. We give ourselves over. 
SRG: I think it's really hard to live in that fear of making the wrong choice or having a kid and having them grow up to be an addict. It's not fair to let that change your mind against it. I don't know if it's not fair. I would rather live my life continuing to hope. It was really hard to continue to hope in those last months. 
One of the times he was sober before he died and I was telling him about the trip we were taking to Costa Rica. He was like, ""You've got to hold a monkey and send me a picture of it."" I didn't get to hold a monkey, but we were at Marcos Antonio Park [Manuel Antonio], that's not quite the name. A big nature park in Costa Rica and one of the beaches has a bunch of little monkeys on it. I held out one of my hands and the monkey came and held my hands. Jeff got it on video and I started crying. This is like three weeks after Spence died. I didn't get to send him that, but I did get to do it and have that nice memory. That was the birthday trip—the trip on my birthday. A little gecko wandered into our room that was the exact size of the gecko that he had given himself a tattoo of. That felt like a nice little coincidence. 
I'm not a religious person. I don't really believe that there is a Spencer out there that is sending me things or anything. I do really appreciate all the little things that exist that remind me of him. Then the hard part is at a certain point I'll run out of the things that I said I'd do. I think there's only one left. I told him when he was sober for a year I'd take him skydiving. He's now been sober for a year. At some point I'm going to take his ashes with me and go skydiving. I don't think my mom's very excited. I don't know if I've told her. I think I probably won't tell her until after it's done. The other times I've went she's like, ""I don't want to know. How could you do that? Why?"" 
AS: The other times you've gone skydiving?
SRG: Yeah. It's super fun. 
AS: Thank you.
SRG: You're welcome. I don't know if any of it's useful. 
AS: It's all useful. 
SRG: It's so hard to sum up a person and talk about it. Thank you for writing this book. "

Amy Sullivan-AS
SS: I’m Star Selleck. I give Amy permission to record this.
AS: Thank you. Could you start by talking a little bit about where you grew up and your younger years? Your education, career, and up until you became a parent?
SS: It is hard to do this fast.
AS: You don’t have to do it fast!
SS: I’ll try to give you the abbreviated version. My biological parents came over on a boat from Germany. My father was Russian and his family was all killed—the males were all killed in the war. He was released in a camp from Germany. My mother and my brother and sister were there. It was his dream to come to this country. He came to this country and had a hard life. Eventually the fact that he witnessed the murder of his father caught up with him and he ended up being diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
At that time my mother couldn’t take care of all three of the children so two went to an orphanage and I went to a family at church. That family at the church only ever had me as their child and I was raised at a home where I got to see my natural parents and my brother and sister over the years. Once my father got released from the state hospital.
AS: Was that here in Minnesota?
SS: No, that was on the East Coast in the Boston area. I grew up for the most part in Rhode Island where the dad raised me, settled, and had a good job. They lived through the Depression, so they lived life very conservatively. We lived in a nice neighborhood. I grew up with four other girls in the neighborhood and we all hung out and played together all the time. I missed having brothers and sisters.
The first few years up until either grade I went to a private Christian school. It was a few towns away. Then in ninth grade I got to transfer to public school. I started first grade at five, so was ready to graduate when I was sixteen. I thought, “Hey, why don’t I go one step further?” I rode my bike to my local college and took the test to go to college. I came home and told my parents I got accepted. Could I please do second semester in college? My high school had said it was all right. They acquiesced and let me go. I got a 3.2 grade point average. Got my high school diploma and had my first semester of college out of the way. 
I had a pretty good childhood. We lived near the ocean. Spent lots of time at the beach. Those girls in the neighborhood, we thought up the most creative games. We had free reign back in those days. Our parents would let us go and as long as we came home either before dark or before dinner we didn’t get in trouble or anything. They didn’t care where we could ride our bikes to or how we got there. It was just don’t go with any strangers and don’t take candy from any strangers. Other than that…we would ride our bikes to the ferry and take it over to Prudence Island and it was a tiny island and bring our lunch and ride home. We would ride to various swimming holes. We would ride our bikes lots of different places. Go eat stuff, and—
AS: Until you were how old did you girls hang out together?
SS: I was the oldest, so my entire life. Then even when we all left on breaks we would set up the annual Christmas party and draw names and get gifts. I still keep in touch with them. 
AS: That is so great. 
SS: We never lost—we don’t talk as often as we used to. I can still contact any of them. I still have a rough idea of what is going on in each and every one of their lives. I had friends at church, too. All in all I had a pretty good childhood. I went to camp at this place called Summit in Colorado. They also had a college. I was going to go back to the little college that I started at, but after going to this camp and meeting all these kids that were going to go to this little, tiny school in Oklahoma, I begged my parents to let me go to school in Oklahoma. 
AS: Where in Oklahoma?
SS: Tulsa.
AS: That’s where I grew up!
SS: I think we might of had this conversation.
AS: What college did you go to?
SS: Originally I went to a school that then had a major scandal. I started at American Christian College. Major scandal. Then I transferred to TU [University of Tulsa] and graduated from TU. 
AS: We did talk about this! 
SS: Where did you live in Tulsa?
AS: Not far from TU. I grew up at 15th and Pioria. 
SS: I rented a house through our college on College Ave, which is no longer there I guess. Just down the street from the Arby’s.
AS: College Avenue is still there. 
SS: Last time Priscilla said… I lived on College Ave. that ran right into campus. She said that has been eliminated entirely. 
AS: Probably. TU, you probably wouldn’t recognize it today. 
SS: No. She said our house is all gone. I haven’t been back there in a long, long time. She went back this year, my roommate. We are still good friends. 
AS: You have everlasting friends in your life. 
SS: I do. I remember when—except my husband. He only lasted for five years! He used to tell me when I would cry and we would leave somewhere he would say, “You never lose your friends. They are always still there. You always keep them. You just make new ones. You will just add to the collection you won’t take any away!” Ok. I will try and look at it that way. Although I will say he does stay here about a week a month. We still are good friends. He has his own girlfriend but we still get along. 
AS: What did you major in in college?
SS: Nursing. 
AS: And that has been your career?
SS: Yes. I did pediatric nursing my whole life. Now, running up and down the hospital floors has gotten harder on me now. Starting my generation with [unclear]. I take care—I am just part of a crew they have for her. I do that still for pay. I was MNA [Minnesota Nurses Association] so now I am semi-retired I guess. I can still do some things. Then I do my advocacy work, which rounds out my life. 
AS: Did you meet your husband in Tulsa?
SS: I did. 
AS: How did you end up here?
SS: I went to church in Tulsa with my two good girl friends. One I lived with and one I had lived with. The first time we chose to go to adult Sunday school class I met my husband. We got married in Tulsa and had my first child in Tulsa. Built my first house in Tulsa. He decided he wanted a better job in Florida. I had to leave my beautiful house behind and all my friends and everything. It was thirteen years I had lived there. It was heartbreaking for me. I left and went to Florida with him.
AS: Which son was born there? 
SS: It was my daughter, Jessica. 
AS: Sorry. Your oldest daughter. 
SS: Then a year and a half later he moved me to North Carolina because the bank he worked for got bought out and we had to move to North Carolina. I had Ian in North Carolina. The year and a half we lived in North Carolina I had Ian there. Then we moved here. After we had been here a very short time I found out I was pregnant with Nick. Nick, my youngest was born and bred right into this house. He was born at Fairview Southdale, but not very far away.
AS: Did you work the whole time during those moves?
SS: I worked what they would call ‘casual’ when we were in Florida and in North Carolina. I would work roughly one or two days a week. 
AS: That is a term in nursing? Casual schedule?
SS: Yes. You have more control over it too. If you don’t want to work one week you don’t necessarily have to. I did keep my hand in it, and worked in all those places. 
The first summer we moved here—we moved here in May—and I didn’t go to work until August. I started at Children’s in Minneapolis in August ‘91. I had Jessica and Ian—they were four and nine months old when we moved here. Then Nick came. They were, I don’t know, twenty months apart? Not that far apart [laughter]. 
AS: Can you talk about your mothering style? The way you raised your kids? 
SS: Well, since there was just me in my family of origin and I grew up in that era of not hovering and this particular neighborhood was not a highly hovering neighborhood—there were a lot of kids that came with the same era of my kids. They pretty much…it is kind of an isolated little place. They kind of ran the neighborhood. They were on their bikes all around and there is a little wooded area at the bottom of Oxford, which is a couple of streets over, that they thought was like really far away. There was a pond at the bottom. People have tried to float things and fallen in. The dogs would escape down there a few times. They would climb trees and do things there. 
I did, other than the little ones that I was afraid I would lose or whatever, once you could ride a bike, and they were usually with other kids in the neighborhood, they would just—all of a sudden I would have a herd here and then there would be a herd at the other house and be down at the thing. Eventually someone would come home crying. “So and so hit me! Someone left me in a tree! Jessica did this!” Sometimes it was just “I fell off this or I fell of that. I wrecked my bike.” 
We did have—my youngest Nick was two sitting in a diaper on the front steps cutting up the tissue paper with some safety scissors, which I didn’t care. 
AS: Hospital safety scissors?
SS: Little kids’ scissors! [laughter] I had the back door open and had the front door open. I could kind of see him through the front door. I was talking on the phone and turned my back and he was gone. I came down the steps and out to the street because you got a pretty good view. He is gone. There are other kids around, people around, I’m asking, “Did anybody see where Nick went? Did anyone see where Nick went?” He was in nothing but a diaper. No one had seen him. 
I was standing in the middle of the road my heart racing thinking, “Do I go call 911?” That is my next step. My neighbor that lived in that house—used to be a little house like this—she was one of my best friends. We would wave at each other while we were talking on the phone. She pulls up in her car beside me with Nick in the car. She goes, “I bet you’re wondering where he was!” I said, “Yes! I was ready to call 911!” 
A few nights ago before that we could cut through the bank and walk across Vernon and there was a restaurant side and a shopping center over there. We had taken the family to dinner and then I had let Ian buy a cap gun at the drugstore. Nicholas decided he was going to go over there, get a cap gun. He cut through the bank and went just like we had done going to the restaurant. He knew where that cap gun was. She said, “I found him in the Jerry’s parking lot.” She said, “Nicky, does your mom know where you are?” “No!” “Why are you here?” “To get a cap gun!” She said, “I know this boy’s mother, I know she must be really worried about what happened to him.” She said thank goodness it was in the day. She said, “My name is Barb Trainer. I live across the street from her.” People were still skittish about letting him go with her.
Then she said—she was a Hershey representative, and all the kids went to her house for candy all the time. She said, “Oh, I know I should never do this,” but she said, “Nicky, if you come with me I’ll give you candy.” And then someone came up and said, “Barb what are you doing?” And she said since the person called her Barb the rest of the crowd kind of assumed, okay, she must be Barb. She probably explained she was a Hershey representative and that she gives all the kids in the neighborhood candy, and Nick was willing to go with her for the prospect of candy because he knew she was good on her word! They were always going to her house for candy. So she brought him home. 
That’s not a good—I guess that is an example of my—I mean I was aware suddenly, quickly, that he was missing. But they had a pretty—
AS: It was a safe place.
SS: All in all, it was. I said to Nicky, “Were cars honking at you when you crossed Vernon?” “No, mommy, I was running across Vernon.”  
AS: Oh, wow. Still a good story. 
SS: Oh, there are so many stories of kids growing up. A lot of parents were a little more mellow about stuff. The bigger house over there in the white, she is a teacher and we’ve been friends over the years, and this would have been well after the event, she goes, “I had to crack up when I saw Ian and Carson driving that steam roller down the street!” And I’m like, “Doing what?!” She goes, “Oh, you didn’t hear about that?” “No!” She goes, “Ian and Carson got the steam roller that was parked in the alley. They left the keys in it. They decided to see if they could drive it. So they parked it in front of a friends’ house as a joke!” She looked out the window and saw them driving by in a steam roller. 
AS: And never told you? [laughter]
SS: She just thought it was funny! They parked it, they got out, they left it. She said, “Don’t you know all those workmen who came and said ‘I swear I parked it right here!’” 
AS: That sounds fun. Sounds like a fun place to grow up.
SS: One time I remember my husband and I, I’m not even sure, but he took the boys in the neighborhood and I took the girls in the neighborhood and we were going to take them to a movie, but we raced to see who could get to the movie theater first. Not side by side. “You take your route I’ll take my route and let’s see who gets there first!”
AS: In your cars?
SS: Yes. I loved children. We got the closest in time, but we didn’t do anything excessive.
AS: No. But it was fun. 
SS: Yeah. Lots of birthday parties and various events. Kids all played sports. Played a lot of basketball around each others’ houses. 
AS: Tell me about your kids as they are getting into their teenage years. They are kind of spread apart? The two boys were closer in age. 
SS: Right. So Jessica is the first one. She just gets a little moody like girls get. She was what I would call a very self-regulated child. I guess to some extent I was, too. Maybe I thought everybody was. She didn’t need a curfew. She just really didn’t need a lot of boundaries. She set them tight enough for herself. I didn’t feel like I needed to get behind her and set more. She always asks me why I didn’t do that. I said, “You didn’t need them. You were never out later than concerned me. You were very concerned to stay away from bad things. You were, you know, almost a straight A student. I didn’t need to say anything about your homework. You had friends that I approved of.” 
Although, come to see on her side, she saw her friends were a lot wealthier than we were. She was too embarrassed to bring any of them to our house. All of our kids thought we were poor, and would say that. I’m like, “You guys don’t even know what poor is. We might be poor for Edina, but you have a nice place to sleep, you’ve never gone hungry, you have a mom and dad that love you.” They just see get a new car on your 16th birthday, live in a mansion, have all the money in the world. 
Jessica was the one because she was really bright so she hung out with the brightest of the bright and all their parents tended to be the richest of the rich! She just was embarrassed to bring anybody—except for the one house over. She was best friends with that girl, and a few houses down she was best friends with that girl. So those two were in our house because they were part of the neighborhood. She barely ever brought the school girls over. Although, in elementary years I had birthday parties and she had friends over in elementary years. It wasn’t until she hit middle school that she said the differences in finances. 
No teacher ever had a problem with her. She never intentionally did anything wrong. She got a bus demerit once because she zipped a coat up over her face being silly. That obstructed her view and that was a bus demerit. That really troubled her, but oh well! Was always in the honor role and graduated high in her class in Edina. Went to Emory with two or three other kids from Edina went to Emory that year. 
She was very easy. She didn’t drink, she didn’t do drugs in high school. I know she experimented in college, but that’s all it was was experimenting in college. She realized she couldn’t do what she wanted to do with her education and focus on that. I’m sure she drank at a few frat parties. She was usually the sober driver so it wasn’t [unclear].
AS: It makes sense as a mom. 
SS: It sounded like pretty normal college behavior. Her grades were good. When she first got to Emory she called me up and she said, “Mom, there are people here that are really smart!” [laughter] “From all over the world!” I tried to reassure her, “Jessica, you’re smart too!” “I know but I have to study here, and they don’t!” [laughter] She did fine! 
She was the one that got the TA position in the non-native speaking—to help with the non-native speakers that come to Mankato. She taught freshman English to the non-native speakers there while she was getting her master’s. That was a very sought after position because it also paid and gave you free school.
AS: What did she get her master’s in?
SS: English as a second language. But her undergrad was English and South Asian studies. And now she’ll get an education—
AS: There goes a little guy on a bike!
SS: Yeah they still ride around [laughter] And I remember Jessica couldn’t master a bike until about five. Ian hopped on a two-wheeler at three never having had training wheels. “Oh, my three-year-old can ride a two-wheeler? I’m in trouble now!” That was my first hint right there! 
I would say fairly early age you will see, once they can ride—it kind of was a rule. If you could ride your two-wheeler without training wheels, you could—
AS: Did that go for Ian then when he was three?
SS: I tried to keep him—well the good thing is Jessica—if he was three, Jessica was eight, and Kelsey next door was nine. If he would hang with the eight and nine year old, I was okay. As long as they were going to stay in a clump because I knew I had reporters that would report back. I tried.
AS: Tell me about Ian.
SS: Ian. Ian, Ian, Ian. He was the antithesis of whatever I thought was going to happen in a child from the day he was born. Jessica would nurse and fall asleep. Ian would nurse and say, “Okay, I’m refreshed and energized. What should we do now?!” At just born! At two in the morning. I’m like, “You just sleep like one little nap a day and you are a newborn. This is very difficult!” 
When I was tired I would go downstairs, lay on the couch, put him in his swing beside the couch. Got to be right there, but dozing when I could because he is five weeks and tearing at things. I remember asking his doctor early on, “Is he still hungry do you think? Should we try some cereal?” Nothing worked.
AS: To try to make him tired? 
SS: Or full so he would sleep longer. Jessica sat quietly and played with toys. I found Ian getting around at four months old and methodology and getting himelf around. I put him in this little thing that had wheels on it out on our concrete patio in Charlotte. He ran that thing so fast at four and a half months old and he toppled and it was just a little lip that he would go over. He just ran around and kunk! Knocked over sideways. He hurt himself, and I was just like I can’t believe he made that thing go so fast that he could run it over like that.  
Then, it was, you know, by the time he was eight, eight months old he was toddling around, holding onto the furniture. It wasn’t too long after that—that’s when we made the move. When we got here within a month or two he was walking. I know he pulled a chair up to the kitchen counter, climbed on the chair, climbed on the counter, pulled a knife out of the knife bucket and was like, “Look what I have accomplished.” I’m like, “Oh no. No, no, no. What am I going to do with this boy?”
Needless to say, out of the children he was a bit accident prone. As his pediatrician would say, “His brain is writing checks his body can’t cash.” He would fall off of things. It is a wonder… I was afraid I was going to get looked at for child abuse. I don’t think he was—no, I was pregnant with Nick. He wasn’t two years old. He took the Little Tikes car—we had a deck out here—he took the Little Tikes car and pointed it straight at the steps. He wanted to see what it was like to go down the steps. So he went out the windshield flat and face first into the driveway. He had to go in to get his head examined, but he had two huge black eyes. 
Shortly after that—he was in the process of potty training. Shortly after that I had Nicholas. While he had two, big black eyes he had chicken pox. He had big wet stains on his pants and he has his hands in his pockets and I remember his face with chicken pox and black eyes. I was still at the hospital, or maybe I took Nick home, but the two boys had to stay apart for four or five days because I couldn’t bring a new baby into the chicken pox. The parents that raised me were in town with their RV, so my mother watched Nick in the RV and would just let me know when he needed to eat. And I would sleep with him out there. Nick came a month early. I would sleep out there with him at night. Steve left to go back to work, so two days he would sleep out there with the other kids while I slept out there with Nick. 
Ian was very physically coordinated and verbally gifted. You don’t usually expect the two to come together. He was very charming. Made a lot of friends. Challenged a lot of friends; not in a confrontational way, but I remember getting called to the elementary school about Ian. He would get in trouble for the oddest things in elementary school. He got in trouble because he started a club on the playground that involved doing an obstacle course before you could join. All the boys wanted to be a part of this club and one boy fell and hurt his back doing the obstacle course, therefore Ian was in trouble because he had designed something that caused someone to get hurt, and so he got in trouble for that. 
He and another boy at some point in time put a bunch of smelly lunch stuff in a milk carton in the bathroom, and there was a question about whether or not someone peed in it or not and so there was trouble involved there. One time he did a backflip off the front step of the bus into the grass and he got in trouble for that for being a bus hazard. 
Then in later elementary school I remember he got in trouble because he punched another kid on the bus. He came in all fuming and I said, “Tell me the story.” He said, “He came up to me with his leather mittens and just started slapping me across the face. So I kind of pushed him away with my fists.” I said, “Who was this?” And he told me and the father called me that night upset that he had punched his son and I said, “Well did he tell you that he was slapping him across the face with those leather gloves?” “No! No, he did not!” He said, “Let me call you back!”
It progressed. At some dance in middle school a girl was upset because Ian didn’t like her or something accused him of snapping her thong, so he got sent home from the dance. He got in trouble for punching a boy in school there. I said, “Tell me the whole story.” He said, “Me and Morgan,” who is a good friend, “Morgan said, ‘hit me in the shoulder as hard as you can.’” So Ian hauled off and hit him in the shoulder, and Ian broke his hand. These two fingers here. And Morgan said, “Didn’t hurt! Didn’t hurt at all!” But Ian was in intense agony and eventually someone sent him to the office and they said—
AS: What happened?
SS: They find out from people, “Well, we heard you punched Morgan.” He said, “Well, he told me to.” They said, “That doesn’t matter, Ian. Anytime you punch anybody it is an instant one day suspension from school.”
One day they were snowboarding for the day. He calls towards the end of the day and says, “When you come pick me up from snowboarding we need to go to the hospital. I broke my finger.” I said, “Well, how do you do that?” He said, “I heard it snap.” I said, “What time was that?” “Probalby about noon.” I said, “Why didn’t you call me sooner?” “I wasn’t going to waste a good day of snowboarding because I broke my finger!” [laughter] And sure enough he had broken his finger. 
He was, for the most part, loved by his peers. When it came to the adults they either really took a liking to him or really took a dislike to him. There was not much middle ground. He got sent to the principal’s office in middle school for writing—do you remember Survivor? He folded up a little piece of paper and wrote: Vote Mrs. K off the island [laughter]. That was a send home. I don’t know if—
AS: He had a good sense of humor.
SS: Awesome sense of humor. And he wasn’t afraid of anybody. I don’t know. I gues she got it from me. His dad is not like that. I guess he got that part from me. He got his dad’s athletic ability and my sense of, “They are just people.” He truly loved people, too. He loved people. He was very emotionally wise. The first kid I had that could see right through me. He would say, “I know why you are saying that. Because…” And he would have my ulterior motive nailed. I would be like, “Shoot! This isn’t supposed to happen!” I remember he was ten, and one day he came in and he goes, “Mom! Guess what I figured out! You can’t make me do anything!”
AS: Oh no. 
SS: Shoot! You can’t make me!
AS: At ten! He recognized his own free will. 
SS: He would always stand up for the underdog. Always. That didn’t sit well with the teachers, but it probably made him friends. There was this one really smart boy. He’s a smart boy. He had a bottle of water and he was drinking his water. The teacher was saying, “Maybe you shouldn’t be drinking so much water because you will end up having to go to the bathroom.” I don’t know. Later on in the class the kid said he had to go to the bathroom. She was like, “I told you not to drink so much water. You can’t go to the bathroom.” “Mrs. So-and-so, I don’t think that is the way it works in life. You know, if you told somebody that there was a well on the property and not to go near the well because you might fall in the well, but the person fell in the well, you wouldn’t say just stay in the well because you are in there because they told you not to walk near it. You would get them out! I don’t think you get to tell somebody they can’t go to the bathroom.” I don’t remember exactly how that wound up, but I remember hearing the story from probably more than Ian! That boy went on to be a famous doctor. 
Some teacher told that boy he was stupid, and he stood up for him too and said, “He’s like the smartest boy in school!” He must have had issues when he was young. Those are just glimpses into…
So, then Ian tried Peewee basketball, he liked that. Gymnastics, worked his way up to the boys team, and competed in the state. They were trying to put him in line for Junior Olympics, and he was going to have to be in the gym twenty-four hours a week. My husband was all set that he was going to be an Olympic gymnast. Ian said, “I’m done. I’m done. I may do it for fun again sometime, but I’m done. There are so many more sports out there that I haven’t gotten to try. I am not going to say this is my only sport.” He was like ten or eleven. “I am not going to just play one sport.” And gymnastics had made it clear it is this or—you can’t play any other sports because there’s no time. So he quit. Steve was broken hearted. 
I think Ian played basketball that year. Then he found lacrosse, and he loved lacrosse. He played lacrosse for Edina. He found paintball and snowboarding and he was very good at all of them. Won some big contests. Went on to play semi-pro paintball where he would travel the country—in middle school he would get asked to go on, like to California. He just did a lot at an early age I guess.  
AS: How about high school?
SS: Well, Ian first met trouble I would say right around seventh grade.
AS: Okay, so backing up from high school. You mean trouble with—
SS: Drugs and stuff. Some of the friends he met that summer had older brothers, too, I think that had access. I know they tried smoking pot and I know cigarettes came in around then. I remember they were going to have a sleepover here. The first night I found pot. I sent everybody home and told everybody’s parents why I sent them home. And then he just went deeper undercover. I had never had any experience, known anybody that had done anything like this. I had never crossed any of this with Jessica. I didn’t know any other kids that were having this issue. I was way over my head. I really didn’t know what to do. 
Since Nick and Ian were like Frick and Frack—they were one year apart in school and they shared a lot of friends. Nick thought he had to do just about whatever Ian was doing. He got in on the act too. He was still doing okay in school. 
I’ll tell you when his life really changed. The boy that had asked him to punch him in the arm as hard as he could shot himself in the face with a shotgun and killed himself. 
AS: Oh no. How old was he?
SS: He was fifteen. That really affected him. I remember telling him, “You’ve got a test tomorrow.” And he goes, “I’ve got a test tomorrow. Does that matter in the scheme of things? I just lost my good friend.” All of his group of friends felt that loss. They ran a group for those boys, but sometimes they would leave Ian out and he would think, “Okay, they care about the rest of them, and they care about me.” I believe he probably—I don’t know. When I look back on it I think that was a big changing time in his life. 
When he went to high school I know he started to get involved because he knew everybody, got invited to—everybody kind of wanted him to be at everything because he was a lot of fun. He was sort of electric. He was the life of the party. The girls all liked him, he got along with the guys that mattered in school. 
My husband was gone a lot, and I really was pretty lost is the honest truth. My mother was dying. I took care of my father until right around when he died—9/11—so that was 2001. That was the year Ian was eleven. I sent him to my friends in Georgia for a while and she homeschooled everybody for just a few weeks until I helped my dad die.  A few years after that, in his early, mid-teen years, our basement flooded, my mother was dying, Steve had sort of checked out. I was really overwhelmed in my life. I would count on Steve to be here with the kids, and then sometimes he’d just leave. 
AS: Like on a weeknight, or weekends, or go out of town?
SS: He was—I’m trying—I think it was short trips then. 
[pause in recording]
SS: Sometimes he would leave overnight while I was out of town. Ian got his license at sixteen. I was at one mom’s and he was going to go to their parents for Thanksgiving. Ian called me, “Mom, we are driving to Pennsylvania, me and Nick. I am in Chicago and I stopped to get my girlfriend a sweatshirt and now I can’t find the car. What should I do?”
AS: Where you at work?
SS: I was at my mother’s in New Hampshire. 
[pause to turn off fan]
SS: So he calls me and I’m like, “Oh no. Dad let you drive to Pennsylvania all by yourself?” “Yeah.” I call, “Steve! What are you thinking?” He decided he wanted to fly the plane a day early. He has a private plane. He was going to fly himself and the boys that was the plan. He decided to leave a day early and the boys didn’t want to so he let them drive. Sixteen and fourteen. 
AS: So would you say you two were not on the same page around parenting teenagers?
SS: No, no. Not at all. That was one time. He eventually found the car and he made it to Pennsylvania, and he made it home. 
AS: Was it stolen or had he just lost track of it?
SS: He just lost track of it. Then one time he took the boys and a friend out sailing on a boat he inherited from his brother. They bought alcohol to take out on the boat on purpose. I remember going down in the basement and there was a bottle of alcohol in Ian’s room. I said, “Well, I’ll be taking this.” He goes, “Well, I don’t know why you’d do that. Your husband bought that for me.” I said, “Really?” I went upstairs and I said, “Steve…” He said, “I didn’t buy it for him. I bought it to take out on the boat.” I feel like you’re sabotaging everything I’m trying to do here. I explained, read him the [unclear] as to why it wasn’t a good idea and how we aren’t trying to be friends with them. 
He would do all sorts of stuff where he would just let Ian be the man. He needed to bring the car home from the airport when Ian was thirteen. Granted, he took to stuff like that like a duck to water. He let Ian follow him home on the back roads with a stick shift. Ian was driving the stick shift. Then, a couple of days later, it is funny but a couple days later I get a call from the neighbors going, “Your thirteen year old child is driving the car around the neighborhood.” I’m at work. I’m like, “IAN! You know better.” When I came home I told Ian, “You know better.” “You guys are just plain stupid. You should never get in a car with a thirteen year old driver. You are putting your life in your hands to do that!” He goes, “Well, dad let me drive home from the airport.”
AS: And that’s when you found out?
SS: Yes. And all that kind of stuff I found. I found his Playboy or something that his father has hidden away somewhere. It was happening. I could never stay on top of what was going on with Ian. They tried to keep it pretty low, underground, although I know things went on here that I didn’t—I probably didn’t know everything. 
Then he found his passion—after he tried every sport. Did well at every sport. He found his passion was music. And we got in more trouble. Police would come by our house more for that. On a nice summer night. Put the band on the deck at 10:02 [p.m.] the police would always be at our house. They would come say, “Ian, you can’t be out here after ten o’clock.” It was 10:02 they would be on our doorstep with a noise complaint. 
Then they would get in trouble, accidental trouble again. Nick wasn’t as bad as Ian, but he’d get in trouble accidentally. He was riding his skateboard home from a friend’s house on a Sunday night in the summer at eleven o’clock at night at fifteen [years old]. He says, “I got pulled over and they said, ‘you’re out past curfew!” And Nick said, “It is twelve o’clock on the weekends.” The cop goes, “The weekend is Friday and Saturday. Sunday is not the weekend.” [laughter] 
Ian became really good friends with the hockey team his senior year. If I am going to be perfectly honest, let’s see, when Ian was a junior his girlfriend got pregnant, too. But, her family didn’t want anyone to ever know or anyone to ever talk about it. We offered to take the baby, raise the baby, whatever. So his one and only baby that I would have ever had left. So I hope they are together. Anyway, that’s the trouble of the beginning of high school. 
At the end of ninth grade he really found his passion for music. He dibble-dabbled all along but he started to really excel in ninth grade. I got him really good private music teacher that would come to the house and taught him all the ins and outs of music theory. He ate it up. He loved it. 
Started out tenth grade optimistically and went to the first school social event. Took a girl to homecoming, but he had a hard time really buckling down to do the kind of work you need to do for Edina High School. A mom who is moving to Florida with one of his best friends and she was going to homeschool. She wanted Ian to come, too, so that her son wouldn’t be alone. She would homeschool them both and live at the beach. I agreed because I knew her really well. I agreed and thought maybe it would be a better environment overall. Then, those two boys got into a fight over the same girl, and Ian didn’t go. I had already taken him out of school. School had kind of told me he couldn’t come back in that year. That was very confusing. I signed him up for an online thing and that was useless. There was no way to get him to do any of that work online. We wasted a semester of school. 
We come to the beginning of junior year. He’s got—no that can’t be right. Yeah. That is right. The beginning of junior year things start out good. I went and I sat down with the school psychologist and I said, “He is asking for extra help. Nick has an IEP. He has this resource room. It really helps him do better at school. I really need—here are all the evaluation things. I really need this for Ian.” Well, it is much harder to make this happen when you get to high school. “We had decided that he doesn’t meet the criteria.” I’m like, “Look, he needs this.” I pointed out the criteria to them and they said, “We are sorry but we are not going to approve him. Sign here.” I wrote, “I will not sign this. I believe that signing this is supporting that my son will fail. I really think he needs this help and I am angry that you won’t approve it!” Exclamation point! I turned it back in. 
By the end of junior year he had failed out. I was frustrated, but right about that same time he had gone on the senior trip with one of his best friends. He had gotten, I told that mother before she agreed to let him go with her on that trip—he would get invited to everyone’s vacation—until this time he was always a lot of fun to have on vacation. He was just a fun person. This was his senior trip. It was Mexico, so there was a lot of drinking involved. He went wild. I told that mother, “Are you sure?” I said, “You know, he can be a handful. I’m not sure you want the responsibility.”
AS: You tried to talk her out of it. 
SS: She was like, “No, I know Ian well.” I was like, “You don’t.” But, anyway. Of course the girl was his girlfriend that had gotten pregnant too was on that trip because her mother was chaperoning her older brothers. They were all friends. So then they were re-looking into each other. He was a basket case on that trip. When he came back her son and him that were best friends, he distanced himself from Ian, and I think that was the first time Ian has ever had anybody distance themselves from him. He didn’t understand what had happened. He had no clue as to why his best friend suddenly wanted nothing to do with him. That really set him into a depression. He probably was self medicating with something. Jessica and I found him sitting out on the back steps crying one night. We knew he had needed help for a while. We said, “Ian, are you ready to get help?” And he said “Yes.” Jessica and I drove him to the STOP Program at Fairview Riverside in the middle of the night one night. We didn’t stop to wake up Steve. Nothing. We just left. 
AS: What is the STOP program?
SS: I don’t know what that stands for but it’s where you can take minors for admission for chemical use. It is a five or six day program. 
AS: Is it part of their chemical dependency and dual diagnosis—
SS: Yes. STOP is for the minors.
AS: Yeah. 
SS: Okay. By the time he has sobered up and realized what a mess he has gotten himself into he wants out of there and is mad. At that point I decided I’m not backing down. Jessica was rooting me on. We got him a place at Hazelden. Unfortunately, though, it was the most awful ride of my life. You have to drive your child. That was the absolute worst. That was the hell ride, wasn’t it? I said if I had known it was going to be like this I would have gotten Steve and Jessica. I would have stayed home. I did not need to—
AS: Did he just unleash on you?
SS: Yes. On all of us. It was awful. We broke one rule, you aren’t supposed to eat. We did stop to eat and it was—not that it would make or break anything, we just thought we would have a meal before we went to Hazelden. He still went in July 4th.
AS: What year was this?
SS: It would have been the summer before his senior year. He would have been class of 2009, so this would have been 2008. No, that’s not right. He died in 2009 this was two years—it must have been summer of 2007. 
Then I get the calls from Hazelden. First of all, that first call I get is one of Ian’s roommates. He had helped him see that he was gay and then that guy fell in love with Ian. They had to separate them but they wanted me to know that that had happened. Then I got the call that you had to wear a shirt for basketball because they didn’t want the girls to see them without a shirt on. Ian had taken his shirt off so they told him to put his shirt back on, but he had it around his neck. 
AS: In true rebel form. 
SS: The next day he cut big holes in his shirt and they said, “Ian, you know what the theory behind this is. If you do anything like that again, you’re going to get kicked out.” 
AS: Was that the ticket?
SS: No! 
AS: He stayed in?
SS: Yeah. They recommended long term—a program out in Utah or Wyoming or somewhere that I wish maybe I had given a try because all the kids that went away to those one year programs are still alive. Not that they’re done using necessarily, at all, but some of them have been totally—some of them went to what I would consider strictly recreational use. They might drink, they might smoke a joint, but that is the extent of it. 
AS: But they are not using heroin. 
SS: No. And Ian was not using heroin at that point either. Ian was—any kind of pills. Not even necessarily pain pills. Like Ambien or Xanax. He liked psychedelics, mushrooms, but he wasn’t using heroin. I don’t think he even ever tried it at that point. He got out of Hazelden and agreed—we reached a compromise. He wouldn’t go away but he would go to Sobriety High. It was a sobriety high school in Edina. He started his senior year at Sobriety High. The Discovery Channel was doing a special called Cocaine Nation where they basically accused Ian of using coke and he never did. Of course, he’s got friends all over the country. 
AS: You mean the way they presented it on the show? That he used cocaine?
SS: That he relapsed and used cocaine. Which, he never had really participated in at all that I’m aware of. If he ever did it was a sample. It was never his issue. He got calls from all over the country about that. I still have it. I have a copy of the show. 
AS: He got calls from people…
SS: Friends! He’s got friends all over the country. “Saw you on Cocaine Nation? I didn’t know you had any problems with Cocaine! Ian was like, “I don’t!” He got accused of something by a girl there and thrown out somehow. That is still a little fuzzy. Nobody was ever very clear with me on how that happened or what happened with that. I thought, “Now what do I do with you?” Because he really wasn’t exhibiting any signs of any heavy usage at that time. So, he went to Eden Prairie Alternative. 
Somewhere in there he had started a band. He had a little band he was playing around town and he was really getting into his music. They weren’t at my house a lot, they were at another lady’s house a lot. I know there was probably alcohol involved, but I guess I wasn’t really thinking and I would put it back—it is hard to know what to let go and what not to let go.
AS: Yeah. I know. I totally understand. 
SS: Their band was playing little gigs. Anyway, he didn’t finish school. He was still short a few classes to graduate. So then a decision had to be made how to get those done. So, now we are up to summer of 2009. He picked back up and he always had this one friend that was over that he played paintball with and they played hockey together. He was about five years older. He was very mad with Ian whenever he used any substances. They had a big falling out after that. He started hanging out at his house a lot that summer. I was very relieved. I thought, “He’s hanging out with this sober friend. This is a good thing.” He was teaching him how to work on cars and guy things. Things where he was sleeping over a lot. He was going to finish up school in the fall.
The band fell apart and I never really got to the bottom of that. The sober friend and Ian and another guy, a friend, on spring break, they all hopped in Ian’s little Saab and they drove through the Rocky Mountains to Vegas, down to southern California. They surfed, went back through Vegas because the food was so cheap, did this massive, fast road trip and came home. Then, the family where they were always at to do band practice, invited Ian to go on a cruise with them. They thought the world of him. He wasn’t home thirty days because he was on that cruise with that family. Had a really good time. That all went well. I told him this time I said, “Ian, do not be excessive. This is probably what got you into trouble.” They said he was well behaved and didn’t give them any trouble. 
When he got home from that was the end of April. He was still hanging out with the guy that he took the road trip. They went to the Grand Canyon. They did lots of stuff. He was playing tennis, swimming, and working out at the club. Then he called me—no, then one night an old friend came over for dinner and Ian was acting weird. I said, “You’re altered.” He said, “Why do you say that?” “I can just tell. You are altered. Something’s off. What are you doing?” He wasn’t straightforward with me. I just said, “You are off.” I said to his friend, “Curtis, don’t let him talk you into doing things. This isn’t good for either one of you. You guys need to fess up and tell me what is going on.” 
I had to call another boy that was the drummer of the band’s mother and tell her that he had come into my house at two in the morning drunk, retrieving a piece of musical equipment, but it stirred up the whole house, him just kind of walking in at two in the morning. I tell her, “He can’t just walk in the house at two in the morning drunk.” In the process she said something about, “Well, I heard on the street that Ian is doing heroin.” I’m like, “Really? Well thank you for passing that on.” Ian at this time was working at the UPS store across the street. I had talked to her before he was altered, that’s what it was. So then I said to them, “Word on the street is you’re using heroin. Is that true?” Didn’t get anything. 
But, the next day, because Ian and I had a very close relationship. I don’t mean—we had our fights, we had our disagreements, but he was very demonstratively affectionate with me. He would tell everybody how much he cared about his mother. I got so many—like his roommate at Hazelden and all of his friends who said, “He loved you so much.” He would lay on my bed and just talk to me for hours. None of my other kids were that interactive. The next day he came to me and said, “She’s right.” I didn’t want to overreact, I didn’t want to do anything stupid. But he said, “I want you to know that I already decided that it’s not a good thing to do and that I’m done with it. I’m not going to do it anymore.” I knew nothing at this point. Zero knowledge in this. I’m way out of my league. Still in shock. He said, “I’ll give you everything. I’m done. It’s not where I want to go with my life. It’s not doing anything good for my life. I just kind of wanted to see what it’s like, and it’s not something I want in my life.” I said, “Do you want to go back to Hazelden?” He said, “No.” I said, “If you feel like you need to will you let me know? I can make that happen. Let me know.” I remember saying, “If I told you it was Hazelden or the street what would you pick?” He goes, “Hazelden.” I remember thinking, “Why don’t you just go back?”
Anyway, that was right around Labor Day. He went to school that week. He went back to Eden Prairie Alternative and started to finish his classes. His birthday was the 10th of September. The four of us, Steve, Nick, Jess, and me went to Benihana’s for his birthday. Next day was the 11th. He had gotten his paycheck and he was walking up the hill from the bank and he cashed his birthday money and my neighbor who lived one house over’s birthday was also on the 11th. We were going out early at 4:30 to celebrate her birthday. He came up the hill and I said, “Hi!” He said, “How much should I save out for going to dinner with Nate tonight?” That was an old friend that wanted to go out and celebrate Ian’s birthday. I said, “Take about 40 bucks” and that should cover both places they would go. He was supposed to be heading out with Nate at 6:30 I think. I was thinking, “Okay, I know he is going to be some place and doing something. We came home at 7:30 and his car was still in the driveway. He had a habit of falling asleep. Sleeping through things. I mean, not even prior to any heroin use. It was just Ian. He would just wake up and be late for whatever it was and be in a panic. I came in the house yelling, “Ian! Do you know what time it is?” He was lying on the kitchen floor by the door. I went into the emergency code mode, being a nurse. I taught CPR, did all the things that you teach in CPR class. Gave him his breaths, called 911, and then it all kind of blew up from there. Steve was at his girlfriend’s house. What makes it worse is—
AS: Had you and Steve separated at this point?
SS: Steve and I divorced December before that. That was December—he didn’t move out until June, but he had had a girlfriend for the whole previous year. He didn’t officially move out until June. Then he had come up for his birthday and was still there the next day. Must have stayed overnight. I said, “I’m going out tonight. Will you stay until I get home?” His girlfriend lives in Mankato an hour away. “Would you stay until I get home? So I would know someone was here. Or at least, would you stay until Ian leaves to go out to dinner with Nate?” He said, “No.” 
He left and when I called him he thought I was just trying to get him to come back for no reason. I remember yelling in the phone, “They think Ian is dead can you please come up here?” The police took the phone away and said, “We don’t have any answers yet.” They pretty well did. “But you should probably come.” He was at least kind to me over that. He stayed for the next week.
AS: Was Ian dead when you found him?
SS: Most likely. I didn’t find a pulse. I had missed him by minutes because was pink and warm. I still, one of these days I am going to go get the medical—not the medical examiner's report because it’s not helpful, but I am going to get the EMT report. 
AS: What would that tell you? Why do you want that report?
SS: I was just curious whether it would have estimated how long he was gone. My story partially starts with when I called 911 the first responder was a policeman who had known Ian since he was very young. They had chatted lots. They knew each other. They would sit and talk, which was very hard on that officer to walk in and see Ian. I looked at him and I said, “He needs Narcan.” He looked at me and said, “Star, I don’t carry Narcan. I can’t do that.” 
AS: The police officer arrived first before the EMT?
SS: He recognized my address and he was at the Holiday. He was here in a second. That police officer. It happened at 7:30, which is apparently Edina’s change of shift and a lot of them were at the Holiday so they came fairly quickly after that. The EMT’s were not very far behind. My sense of time perception after that was useless.
AS: I know the feeling. 
SS: Apparently one of my dogs tried to grab his arm when he came in so the neighbor girl who had been out to eat with us grabbed my dogs and took them over, they were two golden retrievers they would never hurt anybody but they were probably desperately trying to defend the house from this onslaught, and protect Ian. The rest of that night is a blur and sort of inconsequential at this point. 
[pause]
There is a part of the story that is missing. Tons of kids. Word spread all over the place. Ian was a very loved young man. Six months later I get a call from the third guy on that trip to the Grand Canyon and all of that. He goes, “You don’t know the whole story. I’ve tried to get Nate to tell you the whole story but he won’t so I’m going to tell you because I think you deserve it. That summer Nate’s mortgage was underwater and he was very depressed…”
AS: Is Nate the older guy? The one who is five years older?
SS: Yes, and had been sober.
AS: He was on the trips?
SS: Yes. This is the third guy on the trip. He goes, “Nate was really depressed. I’m not proud of it but I got involved. I tried heroin. Nate decided he would try it to see if it would help with how depressed he was feeling.” This other guy’s name is Lance. Lance said, “You’ve got to promise me you’ll never let Ian know because this would be the death of Ian. Ian cannot see anything like this. He has that personality that he just can’t.” With Ian being there so much eventually he found the paraphernalia and put two and two together and figured out was going on said, “You guys are treating me like a baby, that’s not fair.” Eventually Nate could never say no to Ian and let him do it. This is what they tell me. This is the best of what I know. That would have been late that summer. I believe almost any time that they did it, which was just more recreational, was over at Nate’s house. 
Nate finally talked to me. He said, “Ian would always want to push it a little further, a little further and I was always telling him that’s enough, that’s enough.” Here I think he gets this birthday money and his paycheck and I don’t know why—he went out and bought that night himself. But as to why he’d do it right before going out to dinner with Nate? I read the texts between the two of them. It was apparent that they were trying to support each other in having stopped and how crappy they were feeling and so on and so forth. 
Nate must have really had something to do with it because he was pallbearer at Ian’s funeral but he didn’t tell me. I still to this day never told Nate’s mother the whole truth. She is a nice lady and I question it would do any good. 
AS: Do you know if Nate is sober now?
SS: Nate and Lance are both sober now. Nate got married a few years ago. They enjoy lots of outdoor activities, which is hard to handle a bit. Lance had to go on methadone. He said coming off the methadone was terrible but he did it. Nate was able to do it cold turkey. So, that’s the beginning of my dealing with addiction. The beginning. Because then you got the fallout of the child that was the brother—that was the closest. Parenting doesn’t stop with the one kid. My mother’s still dying, Steve’s gone, Nick’s flying of the rails. 
AS: In addiction? Nick?
SS: Yeah. I didn’t see it as—Nick wasn’t doing heroin. He was partying. I didn’t really know how to separate the two out. Ian was way more—except for the heroin—he was way more cards on the table. Nick was way more sneaky, so I didn’t know half of what was going on with him until it was passed. He was very zip lipped out what had happened in his life. Hearing I am back at my mother’s, Ian hasn’t been gone that long. My mother started to really go down hill. I get a phone call from the Edina police department. “We had an emergency call to your house tonight.” Steve was here with Nick. “There was a report of someone stopping breathing.” He just stopped. Didn’t say anything else. I about died. He goes, “A young man was transferred to Fairview Southdale and he’s fine.” I said, “It wasn’t Nick?” He said, “No, but you needed to know. What is going on here?” And he lit into me. I said, “Well, to the best of my knowledge, my ex-husband was at the house tonight and was responsible for the party. I’m in New Hampshire with my mother.” “Can we have his number?” “Absolutely.” 
So he came up and those guys, they ordered one of those designer drugs off the internet and had taken it. One of them is called R23 or R2 something. Whatever. The kid that had gotten into trouble I guess I think lithium that didn’t mix well with it. Everybody else was okay, but it affected him. They had to start CPR—the kids started CPR on him. Nick had to make the decision to call 911. The first thing they did was come in and yell at them all. This plays into my advocacy too. They just got angry at them, they found pot, they charged Nick with possession of pot, they were insulting and whatever, and the minors that were there were taken—I think Nick was eighteen so these were seventeen and eighteen year olds. The minors were taken to the police station to be picked up by their parents. Adults were left here. Nick got charged with possession of pot and an open house party. 
So, I go, “Steve! You said you’d be there! It was a weekend night! Those are the most important nights to be there!” 
AS: And you just lost a son.
SS: I told him I’d just be in Mankato. I’m like that’s just where you were the other time too. I could never count on him. He was just not reliable. I tried so hard to make that marriage work. Anyway, that boy was fine. Down the road he ended up becoming a heroin addict. And he is battling it right now. I believe he is sober at the moment, but he has battled it hard. He has a lot of mental health issues. 
My mother—I was back and forth a lot.
AS: How were you holding up at this time?
SS: Barely. Plus, I had a job. 
AS: Your son just died, your mother is dying, you just had a divorce…
SS: My other son is in his senior year of high school, trying to graduate. Jessica had graduated Emory and was living in New York with her fiance at the time. Then her roommate died thirty days before Ian. I had flown to New York to go to her roommate’s funeral with Jessica. Thirty days later we had to make sure her fiancee was home and call and tell her Ian died. Then the two of them flew out the next morning. I don’t know. I was in survival mode. Trying to keep a job [laughter] 
Nick is—then he got mono really bad. Then they were trying to have him get an F in a class because of absences. I’m like, “Really, really? Who wants to stand in front of me and tell me that Nick, who lost his brother the 4th day of school, got severe mono, you are going to give him an F in the class because he missed too much school?” I went before them and they voted that he could not get the F. After, Nick and Ian both suffered through that rule. The third year after that they made it…
AS: You could get an F for missing too much of one class? Regardless of how well you were doing in it? Wow.
SS: Then I guess it got enough push back. A year after Nick they did away with it. That’s one of the biggest reasons Ian ended up having to be at school was because of absences and being forced to take an F. I say, half of his teachers really wanted to work with him and said he could do a project on the side, you know, his American History teacher said, write an awesome essay about the Civil War or—anyway, I will say the Edina public school principal came, after Ian died, and he did say we really dropped the ball on Ian. 
AS: Wow. 
SS: Must have read my note. 
AS: Must have gone back through the file. 
SS: Because I said he is going to crash and burn. If you guys don’t help him, he’s going to crash and burn. I’m here to be his advocate and I’m mad at all of you basically. I was trying to—they all really tried to pull for Nick at least. Too much story.
AS: No, no, no. I was just adjusting my glasses.
SS: So, Nick, he’s doing his best to hold it together during high school. He hung out with his friends he had always hung out with forever, maybe socialized a little less. Wasn’t particularly wild, and graduated. Which I am highly thankful that he graduated. After he graduated he was going to go to Normandale [Community College] and he just kind of—he graduated in 2010. My mother got sicker, he got left alone more because Steve didn’t come up much and I had to leave. 
Jessica was around more because after Ian died her engagement—she couldn’t. She ran off the rails for a little bit and did some wild and crazy things. Not with drugs. I told her she should just come home and get her feet on the ground. She moved home. She was fed up that Nick wasn’t really headed anywhere, doing anything. She and I were having a hard time being two head women in the same house. My mother was closer to death, things are complicated there, Steve was all la-di-da and in love. Trying to keep the job, going back and forth to New Hampshire. Eventually my mother died in September of 2010. She died the year after Ian. It was just that year in between. I couldn’t get the house sold immediately, so I had the people that were taking care of her live in the house. I flew back out the next spring to get the house ready and sold the house and moved everything out. 
Somewhere in there Nick decided to go through his heavy duty party era. Then he was having problems with a girl that he was in love with. He made suicidal threats. I had him placed. I had arrangements that nobody was to pick him up. Nobody was to pick him up. That girlfriend picked him up. I said, “Well, you can’t come here.” The agreement was he was going to go to treatment because he was having issues too, not with heroin but with other things. They went to her father’s house who was an abusive freak. Nick says I don’t know if he pulled a gun at her or something and they showed up at my house at 3 o’clock in the morning. So what do you do then? You let them in. 
Then, they stayed with me but the partying started to get out of control. I thought, “I can’t deal with this.” I told Nick—she left him, then he was really bad. I had to place him again. Then he came home, and now I am starting to become a little knowledgeable. I said, “Here is the situation. You can live here but you have to be in therapy and you have to have a job.” He complied with those things and things were doing better. I’m trying to think what the trigger was. I could tell that he had a lot of mental health struggles. He had been to psychiatrists. 
He started at Normandale. His first English assingment was writing about his family and he ended up writing about Ian dying, and it was about the third anniversary of Ian’s death and he starts spinning out of control. Luckily I’ve got little connections, but one of Nick’s friends from elementary school told his mother there was a post on Facebook I don’t feel comfortable about. That Nick is downing a bottle of vodka and taking 6 Xanaxs and saying, “F it if I die tonight.” So his mother, “Star, this is Mary Lou. Don’t say where you heard this from, but there is a post on Facebook. I am sending you the screenshot.” I called the police without even telling Nicholas and I had him placed again. They took him to Fairview Southdale this time. That doctor said, “Your mom has placed you. This is the third time. It is obvious that you have struggles. You can decide to go to rehab or I will place you some more. You need some help.” “I think it is time for me to go to rehab, mom.” He said, “Could it just be somewhere warm?” And I said, “Absolutely.” It was January. So I sent him to Palm Springs, Michael’s house. With the big bad boys. It was an eye opener for him I guess. I mean—but he retained much of what he learned from there. 
He came back and he physically couldn’t make it to meetings. I’ve come to realize over the years that he has intense social anxiety. I don’t know whether it started—I think he had it even before Ian died, but after Ian died it got really bad. 
AS: Well he had Ian, right?
SS: Right, the larger than life…
AS: To be the social—to be the leader. He could be in the background. He wasn’t by himself. 
SS: Quite a few of his girlfriends were hand me downs. [laughter]
AS: Of Ian’s?
SS: Yes. So, I thought as long as he keeps a good relationship with his therapist and he goes. He had a crappy job. I made him get a job after school failed. That’s when I said you got to have a job and stay with your therapist. He got a full-time job. It was a crappy job but he was a hard worker. That took almost all the party out of him. It is amazing what a full-time job, how much party that will take out of you. I am really realizing that. At least he did keep the job and go to therapy. 
He did take to heart a lot of the things I think from treatment. They sent him home with pretty heavy duty meds. He said, “They make me feel terrible.” That is where we reached the agreement. He said, “I would like to do a ninety day agreement with you. I would like to get myself off these meds and see if I can’t maintain with pot the same way that these meds are.” And they were nasty meds. I said, “All right. I’ll give you ninety days.” I mean really, I have less fear of that than of the other stuff he was taking. They are potent things he was taking. He has done really well with finding herbal things to—
AS: Does he get it medically?
SS: You can’t get it medically in Minnesota until July 1st. It has been legal for a certain number of things. Now on July 1st it has some added benefits. Except anxiety is still not one. You can in other legal states. When it comes down to that fine of a line as a mother are you really going to say, I’m not afraid when Nick smokes at night if he is going to wake up tomorrow morning. I wouldn’t necessarily feel that good if he had pills in his possession that he could—you can’t abuse pot to the point of death. He could take his medications to the point of death. That is the way I look at it. 
AS: Because you had suicide issues with him before. 
SS: Yes. Yes. That’s why I felt this was the better option for us. 
AS: How is that for you as a mom?
SS: It is a little conflicting but it is getting less and less so. Society seems to be changing and especially my friends with children that are addicted. Most of them are all, “If they can survive with pot and not go back to anything else it wouldn’t hurt me.”
AS: Right. Because you aren’t dealing with death. 
SS: And it’s not like alcohol. It’s not like an alcoholic. It’s not like you are abusing your body so bad your organs are going to shut down. Anyway, Nick works very hard. He got a better job. He shows up, he has kept it for over two years. He has benefits, vacation, a 401 k, his own business on the side where he makes e-fluid for people that use electronic cigarettes. It is really good. He is like, “The FDA gets into my business whatever I’m doing. Now the FDA wants to regulate what you put in the e-cigs. Just because the tobacco companies are upset and they want—they are feeling the pinch so they want to put us private guys out of business so they get all the business. It has nothing to do with the safety for consumers.” 
He has chronic back pain and he has found a controversial herb that helps with that chronic back pain, it is legal in Minnesota, but now they are trying to make it illegal in other states. He thinks that that’s creeping in—he thinks big pharmaceuticals are creeping in on that too! He says it is kind of like an herbal form of suboxone. But it will relieve his back pain when it gets really bad. He is a Bernie Sanders fan, he is very upset about—
AS: A lot of things right now!
SS: Yeah but this is the first time I have ever heard him sit and listen to the debates. He has outside passions. He has got friends that are screwing up. He sees people that are—he is trying to talk to people about, you know—
AS: Addiction?
SS: Yes. He’ll come talk to me because for a while he was drinking. Not everyday, not horrible, but enough to bother me. He is an adult, so I was just watching it for a little bit. Then he said, “I tried drinking for a while. It does nothing more than lock you down into the basement. Nope, not going to go that way.” I said, “Well, I was thinking that in mind, but I figured it wouldn’t do me as much good to tell you than for you to figure that out for yourself.” He goes, “Mom, I did figure that out.” So, you know, it is around every now and then he’ll decide to have one but it’s not like—
AS: How old is he now? 
SS: Twenty-four. 
AS: Tell me about the Narcan before we get too exhausted. Tell me how you got involved in advocacy.
SS: I went and was just looking at that when you came in. In my memories on Facebook today was the TPT—the local public broadcasting did a thing on heroin. 
AS: How long ago?
[pause]
SS: Four years ago today I went to do this Heroin at Home program. Here’s how it all started. 
AS: Send me that, too. If you would, please. Oh you met Maria [unclear].
SS: Her son died one year after Ian. How did I meet her? Half of Ian’s friends, or a portion of Ian’s friends and Tony’s friends crossed over. Her son and my son’s friends were friends. I don’t know if I met her just because Tony died. I think that is how I met her. Or maybe she was at that. Anyway, somehow I met Maria. Maria had a guy from Fox News looking to do a story on someone who had lost a child to heroin. She asked if she could give them my number. They came out and they did a story. It was a very touching story on heroin slipping into the suburbs. Then she connected me with Mary Kay [Barstrow] who headed up the opioid coalition. And she is the one that invited me to this. Heroin at Home. I went down and I had met a few more people at that. Then I got referred to Lexi, and met with Lexi. That is when we started formulating the plan for going to the capital. For Steve’s Law. There were four of us meeting at the Dunn Brothers coffee
AS: Right. And I got in on those emails. I never could quite make it to those. 
SS: We met reguarly and then we went to the capital. It wasn’t that long ago. My memory was the law passing and pictures of us at the capital.
AS: Yeah that was two years ago, last spring, like in March. 
SS: That was probably one of the most memorable projects I ever worked on in my entire life. Just to throw this into my story: I lost Steve at the beginning of 2009, I lost Ian in the middle of 2009, I lost my mom in 2010, and I lost my job in 2011 because the last trip to my mother’s they just decided I had missed too much work. Even though I filed all the appropriate, union approved paperwork, I didn’t ever not show up, I got all my absences approved. I walked into work one day and they turned to me like I had come in on drugs. 
AS: I’m sorry.
SS: We fought it. I said, “Isn’t that something where you would get a warning or a verbal warning and then a written warning prior to termination? I didn’t injure anybody or hurt anybody. Have I ever had any complaints? Have I ever been counseled ever in twenty-one or two years of employment here?” They were like, “Fight it if you want!” I did and we reached a settlement. And I retired. It was a lot. During the time while we were fighting that, I almost lost my house, I learned where the food shelf was for me and Nick. Nick was probably struggling. There were times when I thought, “I don’t know if I can handle this anymore.” I started with a therapist, sometimes twice a week. 
AS: And you got through it. You are a strong woman. 
SS: Sometimes I ask, “Why such a challenging life?” But then I also say, “I have been blessed to know the most awesome people.” I guess with difficulty comes reward. The Narcan started because of that police officer saying, “I don’t have Narcan.” That was the big push for me. And I really, even more, I saw how they were trying to treat Nick, the more I have become. I have had to come off some medications myself that are really horrible to come off of. They are really [unclear].
AS: When you say how they treated Nick what do you mean specifically?
SS: They had him on drugs that you had to sign releases, that it could cause it permanent damage for taking them.
AS: These are just anti depressants and stuff? Or other…
SS: Yes. Did you know that there are some of them that can cause you lifelong side effects? 
AS: Like lithium?
SS: Like Zyprexa. And those booster ones. It can cause tardive dyskinesia where you just can’t sit still. It can even be when you will be like yelling out and—
AS: Turrets type stuff? No, I didn’t know that. You start the advocacy work and what is that doing?
SS: I see—
AS: Both of your sons you are doing this for. 
SS: Yes. And I know how bad it hurt and continues to hurt to have lost Ian. And I didn’t want any other mothers to have to go through that. I wonder if that police officer had had the antidote or if I had had the antidote would Ian have had a chance? He might have had a chance. I mention that in the most recent—did you see the most recent news story I did?
AS: No, I don’t think so. 
SS: Kare 11 did a special.
AS: Oh, yeah I saw those KARE 11 stories. 
SS: At the end they said, “So you think if that policeman had had Narcan that night?” And I said, “Well at least he would have had a chance.” 
A cool thing: one of the boys that is on Suboxone but doing okay, I gave him a kit to have because I know he is around a lot of people. He sent me a note back one day, saying, “That kit that I got from Star Selleck and I used it on somebody and I saved their life. They are in treatment now. Just wanted to let you know.”
AS: You go around—tell me what you have done.
SS: With what Steve Rummler has, the Steve Rummler Hope Foundation. I became what they called a ‘train the trainer.’ Like, the doctor that is currently overseeing the medical part, Dr. Satterly. I sat under his teaching so that he could teach everything he wanted taught in a class so then I am deemed able to teach class for Steve Rummler. When asked, I will teach a class for them. I usually have been able to keep small amounts of naloxone here at the house. However, now the drug companies decided they gave out all these samples. Now they’ve like quadrupled the price of it and won’t give more samples out. During the time where we had those extras, if there was a panic, an emergency—a parent that was just finding out—I mean I had people come to my house, all different times, just hurting mothers, not people I was scared of, that I would teach them and send them onto mom’s groups. I have two state Facebook groups that I participate in, and I’ve had trainings for both of those. I used to do it for the Addict’s Mom but that kind of fell apart. But they know about the other groups, most of them do. 
AS: Your training is to train people how to use naloxone in a situation where there is an overdose, right? How many people do you think you have trained? Do you have any guess?
SS: Mine’s not as much in numbers than it is in emergency. I have done—
AS: You mean helping people in an emergency?
SS: Doing emergency training for panicked parents at all hours of the day and night.  
AS: Oh, more informal, word of mouth. 
SS: Emergently available. I did do St. Paul Sober Living, Pride Institute. These are people that asked us to come in and do the training. The Pride Institute—the rehab is, too? Whatever it is, I went there to teach their staff. Same with St. Paul Sober Living staff. I’ve done a couple at the Lunds and Byerlys open to the public. I have done one with a group of women in Duluth, mom’s in Duluth. I have done one with moms down here and ones at my house. 
AS: Just wherever and whenever. 
SS: I have given out kits to people that I thought were in highly vulnerable situations. Like that one boy who took the time to write back. Most people the word gets out that if you are in a jam, or they hear somebody asking they will say, “Star Selleck, can you help this person?” So they will show up in my little thing—
AS: On Facebook?
SS: Yes. And I will make contact with the individual. 
AS: Thank you. 
SS: I just don’t want to keep—it feels like too little too late. 
AS: How do you feel as a mom now?
SS: [laughter] I realize how ignorant I was at the time that Ian started. I didn’t realize how serious it was. I looked and thought it was more that because he was that personality type, he was going to have a lot harder time. He had to try everything. I remember talking to him about drugs and pot and alcohol when he was young because you had to talk to Ian about everything way ahead of everybody else. He said, “Mom, did you ever try pot?” At let’s just say eight or nine. I thought, “Ian is the type of kid you cannot lie to because he will figure out a way.” I said, “You know Ian, I did try it in college. Then I realized the type of major I had and what I was going to do in life, that I couldn’t really keep that up. I couldn’t be serious about studying or doing anything with my life and do that, too. So, yeah, I tried it. I actually, a couple of times, ended up in a dangerous situation where I could have died. It’s a good thing I didn’t. My roommate and I  drove the wrong way down a one way street. So, I’m trying to pass on to you mistakes that I made because I don’t want the same mistakes to happen to you. Because you just never know what could happen.” He said to me at this young age, “I don’t think that is the way it works. I think each generation has to work it out for themselves.” I thought, “Nobody gets a child like Ian to parent.” He just stopped me cold there.  
I had to look these all up for Channel 11. Here’s the wedding with Jessica. This was one of our very first meetings when we were getting the whole Steve’s Law thing off the ground. 
[pause and look at photos] 
It never got to the point where he ruined other people’s lives. I don’t have to see him rot in jail. He didn’t kill anybody else’s kid. There are things worse than death that I can think of to live with. That sounds weird, but it’s true. It would haunt me day and night to know if he were going to get locked up for good. 
AS: Or if he had drove and killed someone
SS: Or if he had sold an overdose to someone. Not that he wasn’t dealing that I’m aware of but he could have. 
AS: We know what the road is.
SS: Now, in retrospect, I can see how it could have wound up worse than it did with him ravaging or damaging other lives too. And a lot of kids use Ian for a reference point. A lot of kids have told me Ian taught them so many valuable lessons, not by his overdose, but by the way he lived life. To look out for the underdog. To always look for the joy in life. To always listen to your friends’ problems. To always be there for other people no matter what. To never think that anybody is more important than you, and to never think you aren’t important enough to fit in with anybody else. He could talk to college professors and he could talk to the guy that was homeless on [Lake] Calhoun and they would both enjoy his company.
AS: Do you think he learned that from you in some way?
SS: No one ever asked me that before. I mean, probably. Out of the family, probably. 
AS: You are easy to talk to. You seem like you would talk to anyone. 
SS: You’re right. I don’t say this to my kids, but Ian was the kid I related to the easiest. He’s the one I understood the most. It was very difficult to lose him. The others, like I say, not that way. Nick has a big heart. I see his big heart. I see him growing more that way. He’s very kind, he tries to help people that need help. He says after the third or fourth time when they do stupid stuff I have to learn to distance myself because I want to go someplace. I don’t want to be dragged down with people who don’t want anything good for themselves. I am being choosy about the top five friends. They have to want something out of life. 
AS: He’s maturing. 
SS: He is. He’s growing up. So, am I going to have a cow over the pot? Nah. Would I rather him do that than drink a lot? Yeah. 
AS: And you’re not his savior. 
SS: And I’m not going to sit there in judgement. In reality, if I had to compare alcohol and pot I think pot is probably less dangerous than alcohol.
AS: Yeah. You are letting your child live his own life. 
SS: Even though he lives in my house. But we have a respectful relationship. Open and honest relationship. There aren’t any secrets that I’m aware of. There could be. I’m not stupid enough to think—but he makes it up on his own to work. You said she got As on heroin. But I really don’t think he is on heroin. 
AS: There is no comparison. No no.
SS: Right, but now I’m sitting here thinking could I be majorly fooled? I don’t think so. That was not ever Nicholas’s drug of choice. 
AS: I can’t imagine after losing his brother that would—that seems—
SS: He had a Xanax addiction. 
AS: He does or did?
SS: Did. 
AS: Thank you, my dear, for so much time. "

MS: I'm Marv Seppala and I give you permission to record this interview. 
AS: This is January 23rd, 2019 and we are at my house in Minneapolis. Alright, let's go!
So, when we left off last time, we were talking about how you went to Drake University and then you had just gotten in to medical school and one of your mentors from Mayo, was it Dr. Shepard? 
MS: Oh, yeah. 
AS: You were talking about Dr. Shepard and I was making a joke, ""Oh, yeah, of course you got in because he was there..."" Or I made some kind of comment. I was just listening to that.
MS: [laughter] It's true. 
AS: Why don't we open there? You guys had been in Iowa and you were going to move back. 
MS: Yes, and Linda needed to do one more year of college when I started medical school. So, she stayed at Drake one more year and I started medical school in Rochester. And immediately, I told all of my peers, it's a small class, just forty people at Mayo per class. It was really nice and intimate, so you get to know everybody well and all the good and bad with that, I guess. So, I just told all my peers that I am in recovery from addiction, which the first week of class, I am just meeting these people on Monday and Friday night I was living with two other guys. One, who I had known from freshman year of college at St. Olaf. We both left St. Olaf and we both got into Mayo, so we roomed together and another guy from Minnesota roomed with us as well. We just decided, well, we had a big apartment. A friend of mine owned a house in Rochester and rented it out as apartments, so he let us use it. 
Well, we threw the party at our place on Friday night and I made sure there was not alcoholic drinks, right? But there were all kinds of alcohol. And I am standing by the drinks and a guy who is now my best friend from medical school, comes up to me and says, ""Here, have a drink."" and I say, ""No, thanks."" and he says, ""Have a drink."" And I said, ""No, thanks."" And he said, ""How come?"" and I said, ""I'm an alcoholic, I don't drink."" And he walked away dumbfounded because he'd never met an alcoholic and he finally meets one and it is his medical school classmate and he doesn't even drink. [laughter]
So, it turns out that he now works... he is an anesthesiologist, but he does the whole drug diversion program for the Mayo system because he took a real interest in addiction over time and was really involved. 
AS: Interesting. 
MS: And then right before Christmas, that first fall, I decided to tell the dean that I am in recovery. 
AS: What made you do that? 
MS: Well, all of my peers knew, and I was really open about it and I thought I might as well just tell him, you know? In case anything comes up about it, which was... And I knew... 
AS: Which was what?
MS: I'll tell you the story. It was really problematic in an odd way. So, I thought that they would hear so I might as well just get it out there. So, I went to his office. I told him I'm in recovery from addiction. I was told not to let anyone know when I applied to medical school, that I was in recovery. I'd never get into Mayo. And I didn't tell anyone, and it was a little hard in one interview, and only one. All of my volunteer activities from college were addiction related. And the family practice doc who I knew, actually, asked me how that came to be? And because these two docs I knew at Mayo told me, they said don't mention a thing or you just will not get in. So, I didn't. I lied to this guy and said, something like ""Oh, we had a family issue."" Which wasn't a total lie, I was the family issue. [laughter] 
And he let it go at that. So, I got through the interviews. So, that was one of the reasons I thought I should tell the dean. 
AS: So, that was your conscious that was like, ""I better tell."" 
MS: Yeah, better to just get it out there and let him know that I am in recovery. So, he was this really gregarious Irish guy and I told him, and he just didn't say a word and he had this terrible grimace on his face. He just kind of said, ""If we had known that, we would have never let you in here."" 
AS: Really? 
MS: And he never talked to me again. That was it. 
AS: Why? Why do they not...
MS: There was just this tremendous bias against it. 
AS: That you would someday be a doctor with an addiction problem? 
MS: I guess so, that I could be an embarrassment to the school. That someone would find out or that I would relapse or have some sort of... 
AS: Did you ever hear of that book called, this is a little off topic, but called ""Thirty Rooms to Hide In""? 
MS: No. 
AS: About a doctor with really severe alcoholism. Okay, it's by one of his children. 
MS: No, I don't know that book. Really? 
AS: We'll just move on and I will give you a reference for that, because that makes me really curious about why Mayo, in particular, would have that stigma? He was a pretty famous surgeon. He was pretty well known. 
MS: It's interesting because during medical school, the Chairman of the Surgical Department was a known alcoholic. And when I was on a surgical rotation, so I am around all of the surgeons. We're going down the hall on Monday morning and there he is, and he's got this bandage across the whole side of his face. And I am with a whole group of residents and we are with our attendant, who was a peer of the Chair of Surgeries in that department. And he says hi to him, and the chair says, ""Hi."" And he says, ""Wow, what happened?"", you know because he's got this huge bandage. ""Ah, the garage door was going down and I just had to run and jump under it and I just kind of fell and scraped my face."" It made no sense at all, you know? I mean who scrapes their face jumping under the garage door? 
AS: Yeah, that was quite a leap. 
MS: Yeah, it was. And it was known as a really angry guy. 
AS: What was his name? 
MS: I am blocking out his name, maybe it will come to me. But anyway, he was well known as an alcoholic and I knew of other situations like that, and I was told that one of chairs of the board of Mayo at one time, went into treatment at Mayo for his alcoholism. When he walked in, the whole staff lined up and shook his hand as he walks into treatment. Which didn't really set up a good situation for him or with his peers. 
AS: Because everybody knew?
MS: Yeah. So, it was just really odd some of the stuff that went on there. But, nonetheless, that was my introduction to my dean and he never talked to me again. But, other than that, school went really well. And the second year, I am planning on being a cardiac surgeon, because of that lab and because of my experience with that. You know, the guy who influenced me most was a Brazilian (?) surgeon and I wanted to be like him. And, so that was the plan.
AS: So, you enjoyed surgery? 
MS: I loved it and I was really good at it because of my experience in the lab. And they let me do things that they never let students do, because I could do it! [laughter] Yeah, it was really neat. So, I was just psyched about it, but I noticed on clinical rotations, all of these people with alcohol and drug addiction underlying the reason that they were in the hospital. Or, coincidental to it, but often underlying their hospitalization. And we weren't diagnosing it, we weren't writing it down even. We were not giving referrals, we were not giving consultations. Nothing that you would normally do for an illness, did we do. So, I was going to this AA meeting in town and the same two doctors who told me not to say anything about being an alcoholic or addicted were at this meeting, they were in my home group. And that's why I asked them, because I knew them from AA. And they said, do not say a word. So, I'm going to the meeting and every weekend complaining about this situation on clinical rotations all over the hospital. There are people with addiction and alcoholism, and we do nothing about it. It is awful. And one night those two took me aside and they said, ""Marv, you've got to quit bitching about this and do something about it."" 
And it was at that point where I kind of opened my eyes to the possibility that I didn't have to be a cardiac surgeon. As much as I liked doing it, I could do this instead. And shortly after I had a psychiatry rotation, and they are all like one-month rotations, I enjoyed it, a lot. I found an attraction to it that I didn't expect, and it was a gate way to work in addiction. So, that's what I did and that is why I changed my mind. All because of that statement and that experience. So, then I needed a place to do that and I wanted to do an addiction fellowship. There were only a few around the country at the time. 
AS: A few as in only for a few people or a few different programs that were larger? 
\
MS: Yeah, only a few where you could do fellowships, that you could do an addiction training fellowship. So, I wanted to do a psychiatry residency and then an addiction fellowship. So, I wanted to, ideally in the same place for whatever reason I thought I would want to stay in the same place. This is a funny part, but I applied to program on both the West Coast and East Coast for psychiatry because I didn't want to stay in the Midwest. [laughter] For whatever reason, I thought that I might as well go to one of the coasts and Linda agreed. I made all of the applications and got rejections from every West Coast school and acceptance from every East Coast school. And I didn't have enough money to go to both coasts to interview in both places, so I was kind of seeking direction and I got it. I went to the East Coast to look at all of these programs. And they either had nothing going about addiction, and or, when I said I was in recovery from addiction and that's what allowed me to go down this path, they were like psychoanalytic programs. So, they just couldn't even tolerate this idea that I would be... 
AS: That someone in recovery would want to be in addiction medicine? 
MS: Yeah, one guy actually started to do psychotherapy with me in the interview when I mentioned that. It was just bizarre. 
AS: Okay, so let's put a time on this. What year is this? Do you remember? For my history of medicine pursuits. 
MS: [laughter] It would have been 1984. I graduated from medical school in 1984 and it was that winter and spring leading up to that, that I was doing those interviews. 
AS: Would that happen today?
MS: No, not to that degree. But also, this is the basic understanding. I told all of the attendants on the rotation that I was on, I can't remember if it was internal medicine or neurology, but I said ""Hey, I'm going to go into psychiatry and specialize in addiction."" And he said, ""You're throwing away a good career in medicine."" And that was the basic feeling about psychiatry in general, but also, even more so about addiction, which nobody did. Like, who would do that, Marv? Why would you even consider it? So, it was like really... 
AS: I've heard that story before, from doctors that I have interviewed. 
MS: Okay, so it was like really going against the grain. 
AS: Yeah, it's like, why would you want to do that? Like, think of who your patients are going to be, was the underlying message. 
MS: Exactly. ""It isn't even an illness"", you know? 
AS: Oh right, you had that even. 
MS: Yeah, so I get back from the East Coast and I am just perplexed and disappointed because there wasn't a single place that I wanted to go. And I applied to the best programs in the country, you know? It was awful. So, I am walking past the secretarial pool in the medical school...
AS: At Mayo?
MS: Yeah, and I knew a lot of these women because I had worked there and I grew up in the area, right? So, I always talked to them and one of them says, ""Marv! Are you going to finish your application to the University of Minnesota?"" And I said, ""I haven't started one."" And she said, ""Well I think you have."" So, I said, ""Sure."", because they helped us with it because we didn't have to do our own applications. Which was really wonderful. 
AS: Are you kidding me? I mean why as a secretary? Oh my gosh, you guys were so spoiled back then.
MS: So, spoiled. [laughter] We were. We were just treated really well. So, she said, ""You want to?"" and I said, ""Yes."" and she sends it off. And they call me, and I get an appointment for interviews and I am driving up to Minneapolis and I am half way here and it hits me. And I don't know what this is, or what happened, but I'm like, ""This is where I belong."" It is just overwhelming. And I get to the University and I have to park at the Medical Center and my parking spot overlooks the Mississippi there and eagle flew down below me, because you are on the cliffs, right? This eagle goes by. And I'm like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" It was funny because I get this sense that this is where I belong, and then I got anxious like, man, now I really got to perform this interview. But then, I realize that this is where I belong, so it doesn't matter! [laughter] However, it was just like, this is where I belong. And then the eagle. And I go in, and the interviews go fantastic, they've got an addiction fellowship program. If I perform well in the residency, I can do that in my fourth year rather than adding a fifth year. Because the whole fourth year they have are electives at the U. Which is like, oh my god, that is amazing. I can get done in four instead of five years. So, it was where I belonged and it's where I went. And they had great people at the time, and a really robust program and a lot going on. I mean, it was fantastic. So, I had a great experience. 
AS: So, who were your mentors there? 
MS: Joe Westermier was one. He oversaw the whole addiction department at the U, at the time and later became the Chair of Psychology at the University of Oklahoma and then came back and was Chair of the VA here in Minneapolis. And he was a true academic and over three hundred publications and books and stuff. We had a Southeast Asian Mental Health Clinic and a Southeast Asian Opium Clinic at the time, because the church sponsored a lot of refugees after the Vietnam War and that included a lot of Hmong, and with those folks, a lot of opium addiction. And they basically brought it here and there were opium dens all over the Twin Cities. 
AS: There were? 
MS: Oh, yeah. There probably still are.
AS: In the Seventies? And Eighties? 
MS: Yeah, Eighties now, but starting after the Vietnam War, so late Seventies into the Eighties. And so, he set up programs during the Vietnam War. He was a family practice doc and later went into psychiatry. He spent a lot of time over in Southeast Asia during the war. And he actually spoke Hmong, Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodian. I mean, he was an amazing guy. And so, he was a true mentor and really knew addiction and really Twelve Steps stuff and had a really great program at the U. 
AS: I suppose he's passed? 
MS: No, he is still around, here in town. 
AS: Oh, my goodness, wow. 
MS: He'd be worth talking to. He still does some stuff at the VA, so that would be a place you could easily get a hold of him if his number isn't available. I don't have a home phone number, I just call the VA to talk to him. So, he was tremendous. And then, Mark Willenbring. Do you know Mark? 
AS: I've interviewed him. Twice! I had to interview him twice, too! [laughter] I was going to ask if you knew him. 
MS: Yeah, Mark was at the VA. Yeah, we're good friends. We get together a couple times a year and have supper to talk over stuff. But he was closer to my age than Joe. Mark was early in his career and at the VA and was my attending when I did my addiction rotation. And for just a couple weeks oversaw some of my work during psychiatry rotation, too. 
AS: That is fantastic. I love that... for my storytelling. It is! To have that connection is really incredible. 
MS: So, it was those two, primarily, who really mentored me in remarkable ways, really beneficial. And John Brantner was a psychologist at the U who did die some time ago. But he was part of the group that developed the MMPI. And John was in recovery but also just this really brilliant, eccentric psychologist and his main focus was thanatology, so death and suicide. 
AS: Wow. It's called thanatology? 
MS: Yeah. And he, because he was in recovery, but also a really well-known therapist. I mean, really, really well respected. Joe Westermier was one of my psychotherapy supervisors. You would do that for a year. Every hour of therapy, I had to have an hour of supervision, which never happens anymore. And one year, I had John.
AS: So, what are you saying? Repeat that again, what you had to do with the program. 
MS: If I did an hour of psychotherapy with someone where I was providing the psychotherapy, I'd have to go do an hour of supervision about that hour of psychotherapy. 
AS: You mean, you would have to go and talk to one of your supervisors about what had happened in that session? Hour to hour? 
MS: Yeah, and some of them required that I record the sessions. Some required that I write every single word down during the session. Just writing away and trying to talk at the same time. I learned how to do that really well, because it was so frequent that I had to do that. That's hard. [laughter] 
AS: That's really hard. You can see, I'm not doing that. 
MS: No, the recording is a lot easier. Yeah, so those two both did that for me for a year. The addiction fellowship, more than anything else, well first... I was in my training during a time when psychoanalyses were still really a major aspect of psychiatry, but the biologic psychiatrists who were coming in, and the University had hired a biologic psychiatrist as a chair, Paula Clayton, and she was trying to change the department. So, they were both still there though, and they were waring with each other basically. Which seems like that kind of conflict could be a difficult time to train, but it was wonderful because you got to hear everything. I got both sides of this whole issue and training from both sides, and the understanding of things from both sides. And there was still an emphasis on psychotherapy and biology. So, I thought it was awesome. Some people didn't and they thought it was difficult that way, but I just loved it. And, I got both, which is what I wanted. I wanted to be a therapist more than handing out medications, anyway. 
AS: So that is also just on the cusp of when medications took over psychiatry? 
MS: Yeah, oh yeah. 
AS: So, that's the mid-Eighties? 
MS: Yup. '84 to '88 I am in my training and while I was there... While I was in medical school, just to kind of put this historically, I guess, someone in infection disease came to give us a lecture one day down at Mayo. He said there that there is a new illness that we had just been informed about, and it was HIV. It didn't even have a name when he told us about it. It didn't have a name, we didn't know anything about it, not sure what is going on. 
AS: This is when you were in med school? 
MS: Med school. Then in my residency, I saw the second patient with HIV at the University because the first patient attacked a nurse and just got psychotic and took her pin off her shirt and tried to puncture her with it and infect her basically. He was just psychotic. So, they decided every person with this disease, again, I think they were calling it AIDS by then, but I'm not sure. I can't remember when it kind of transitioned. So, they said that they had to have a psychiatric consult before anything else happens, because of this first episode. Because no one knew this disease. And so, I had to go in. Well, they made us wear space suits basically, because no one knew what this disease was or how it was transmitted. So, I had to cover myself with, you know, protective garments and gloves and a helmet type thing. I mean, everything. Not a breathing apparatus, but you know... I'm a psychiatrist walking in like that. And after a couple times of that, I just said screw it, because no one was getting sick that I saw. But still, no one knew, but it was so disruptive. But at the same time, the pathology department at the University of Minnesota, refused to take the blood samples from these people. Refused to study the blood samples because they didn't know if they were at risk or not. And so, in medicine, isn't that your job?  I mean the essence of risk... shouldn't you be the ones wanting to figure this out? They didn't want anything to do with it. They refused. So, there was so much controversy going on about this. 
AS: That is such a powerful story. 
MS: Isn't it? It is really bizarre that that went on. All kinds of weird things like that. And so, what else? I was mentioning something else. 
AS: We were talking about... I was asking you about when the shift to medications in bio-medical psychiatry? I was going to ask you, when did Prozac enter your story?
MS: During my residency. It was released for use. So, it was the same kind of story. All of the sudden, there is a new... all we had were the old tri-cyclic antidepressants basically and the old anti-psychotics. They all had a lot of side effects and people hated taking them. And they worked, in fact, even now, sometimes those old antidepressants are used as the backup in nothing else works. But that was all that there was. And then suddenly, there was this new medication, Prozac. So, I just happened to be on a rotation working with the psycho-pharmacologist in the department at the time when Prozac was released. So, I'm like right on top of it and get to learn all about this new medication and stuff and its potential. 
AS: But you were at the same time also being trained in therapy?
MS: Yeah, so it was wonderful. Because to me, that is still what a psychiatrist should do, both. And yet, a lot of training programs have put psychotherapy behind. It is really weird. 
AS: Or completely separated them. 
MS: Yeah, or just biological. Just let the psychologist do it or something, I don't get it. They want to just do psychopharmacology which... It is really a wonderful and useful tool, and necessary. And I suspect... The brain is a new organ of study, right? There was taboo against even opening the skull and studying the brain, and yet, the rest of the body, you can open and look at and study and do whatever you wanted. And so, it' been only recent that we've really had that opportunity. It is really complex. And so, we are way behind in a way, but it is also a brand-new field, which is one of the things that did attract me to psychiatry, it's like wow, this is... there is nothing known about this whole field. It is really wide open, and I had thoughts about academics at the time. Which, because my parents didn't pay for any of my education, I had so much school debt that I couldn't go into academics.
AS: You thought about academia for a minute and then realized that you had to be more practical? [laughter] That was a good decision probably.
MS: Yes! I just couldn't do it. Well yeah, the school debt was enough that I had to make decisions in terms of income to pay that off. [laughter] 
AS: So, at this point, do you have any children while you are in residency? Or what's happening? 
MS: Yeah, well, during my internship, I had to do a rotating internship in St. Paul Ramsey to start with. So, my first year was at St. Paul Ramsey with all of the internal medicine and family practice people doing internal medicine feeds, ER, all of that stuff, just in case you'd decide to bad psychiatry and... but it also gave you a really solid foundation in medicine. It gave me that. And, during that, I was on all every other night in the hospital and our daughter was born. [laughter]
AS: Oh, that is so much. 
MS: I know, and she didn't sleep well. So, I'd be up all night and get home and be woken up regularly. I think I was just... 
AS: And then Linda on the nights that you were gone, not sleeping, she was really not sleeping either.
MS: I know. It was probably tougher than I noticed at the time. 
AS: Yeah, you were both sleep deprived. 
MS: Yes, terribly. And then later, Adam was born in my third year of residency. It was down to every third night then. But it all worked out, you know? You just do what you have to do. 
AS: It's true. You look back on it and you can't believe that you did it. It's good that when you're in it, you just have to keep on moving forward. [laughter] Okay, so your residency is over. 
MS: So that's my background. My background is in... 
AS: It's also on the cusp. 
MS: Yeah, it is on the cusp of all these new medications, all of this promise, but you know, from my own bias and my own recovery, I think psychotherapy is really important.
AS: Right.
MS: So that's my background. My background is in... 
AS: It's also on the cusp. 
MS: Yeah, it is on the cusp of all these new medications, all of this promise, but you know, from my own bias and my own recovery, I think psychotherapy is really important.
AS: Right.
MS: And I've got this experience when I got sober of the spirituality of the Twelve Steps and the science of working in that lab, and then my college and medical school experience and residency. So, there's these somewhat diverse influences going on. But I think they left me in a remarkable position because I was open to all of that, and not, in a single lane, kind of. And I think that allowed me to do a lot in my career, that I would have maybe not otherwise been able to do, like Core Twelve, actually. And when I finished training, I was looking for a job and had hoped to work for Hazelden and they didn't have any openings for a psychiatrist...
AS: Because they didn't have a psychiatrist? Or? 
MS: No, they did have a psychiatrist. They used consultants, just like a few hours in the evening and they were guys from the VA that I knew. 
AS: So, the preeminent addiction treatment center in the state did not have a psychiatrist on staff? 
MS: No, not on staff. Yeah, they were using these consultants. 
AS: Can you explain why that is? Just for people reading this? 
MS: Oh, sure. So, they had a pretty big psychology department and a lot of full-time psychologists. So, it was still a psychotherapy oriented mental health program. But there were still plenty of folks coming in that had medication. So, they had these psychiatrists come in the evening, you know, it was a consulting job, so you work all day at the VA and you head up to Hazelden for a few hours in the evening, see a bunch of patients and make sure they are okay on their medications or look at the psychotic books or someone that is suicidal and do what is necessary. So, that was the bulk of the job. Then, I knew that the guy who was running the addiction program at the VA was Dick Heilman And, I don't know if Dick is still in St. Paul or not. I don't know if he is alive. I think so. But Dick was long term recovery guy, really committed to the VA and to Hazelden. So, I worked under him during my fellowship. So, he was actually a mentor too. I should have mentioned him earlier. And he was a mentor in that... really about recovery itself and what people needed spiritually and interpersonally to get there, you know? He... I remember telling me that group therapy was just as important as surgery and you cannot interrupt it. 
AS: Wow. 
MS: Yeah, which I thought was a really nice way of describing just how important the work was, that you are doing with people. 
AS: Yeah, it is. That is profound. 
MS: It is, yeah. And he was always really interested in my life beyond medicine. Like, how was I leading my life and that sort of thing.
AS: Like who you were as a person?
MS: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. 
AS: That's a good mentor. 
MS: It is. [laughter]
AS: I agree. 
MS: So, I couldn't get a job here, and being born in Seattle, I somehow must have somehow imprinted on the Northwest. And I thought, let's move to the Northwest, it would be fun to go out there. And Linda was game [laughter] and so I was looking for jobs in these psychiatric throw away journal things and there was a little ad for Portland. This little hospital there that was a dual diagnosis hospital, which was unheard of at the time in 1988. But they had a program and they needed a psychiatrist and when I went out and interviewed and everything and they not only wanted me to do in-patient work there, they would set me up in an office right next to the hospital to have a private practice and they could be, like the medical director had this little adolescent program about twenty minutes away. 
So, I had all of these, like three different positions in one job, basically. I didn't understand... I had to bill you know? To get paid for all of this stuff in the hospital which was all new to me. It all worked out fine because the other guys told me how to do it and who to use if I wanted to or do it myself. 
AS: So, were you... was the adolescent part of the job a surprise to you? Or had you been drawn to it because of that?
MS: Yeah, it was. But that wasn't described until I got out there for the interview. It was the dual diagnosis, but the dual diagnosis hospital had both an adolescent and an adult program. So, it was right up my alley. That's how I was trained. I knew psychiatry, I knew addiction and I got the job.
AS: What was that little hospital called?
MS: It was Pacific Gateway. It no longer exists. 
AS: It got eaten up?
MS: Yeah, by a bunch of condos. 
AS: Oh, the hospital is even gone? 
MS: Yeah, it's gone. It was this great program when I was there, run by people who really recognized the necessity of treating both the mental illness and the addiction in concert, you know? In an integrated manner, way back then before people were doing that and they were like writing about it and stuff and teaching all about it all over. And doing some great stuff. So, I just had a ball there, but the hospital was for profit, which I didn't understand at that time. I just wanted a job and didn't know the difference, really. 
AS: So, what did that mean?
MS: Well, it got purchased by another hospital system and then they started to change what was going on, and then was purchased by another on and it got even.... and the program kind of slowly deteriorated, and people started leaving as a result. Staffing diminished and then it got purchased by another. And I had left, to do other things. First, we were only there a year and a half, and we came back here for three years and we lived in Hopkins because I got a job at Hazelden as one of those consultants, but at the adolescent program. So, that was my first job in the system, but it was like twice a week for three hours maybe. 
AS: And you moved back for that?
MS: I know!
AS: For a six-hour a week job?
MS: It was crazy because I had this great situation going, I moved back to this and I had to pull all of these other jobs together. So, I had a job out in Waverley, a treatment center called Waverley. It was Hubert Humphrey's old home. 
AS: Yeah, I think there is still one out there.
MS: Oh, yeah, yeah, there is. I got a job doing consultation there and at Wayside Women's, I was doing consultation for them. A couple half way houses and a bunch of programs. I was just doing like five or six different consulting jobs a week to get forty hours.
AS: You were like a traveling salesman. 
MS: I was! I would go and I would do my psychiatric evals for them and help them out and provide medications and therapy.... and I was the only one doing it in a lot of these places, you know? Because there are no mental health services at a lot of them, and I was it. So, I got... the good news is as a result, I got a really broad experience, really fast. And I went back to Oregon and just kept doing that kind of thing. I failed to mention, one of the jobs that I got. I moved to Oregon in summer of '88 when I finished training. January '89 a treatment center opened there, called Springbrook. Which is now Hazelden's Springbrook. 
AS: Right, I was going to say, is that the same place?
MS: [laughter] It is! So, it opened and they tried to just treat physicians. And within a year and a half went bankrupt doing so. They didn't treat anyone else, only physicians, right. And the doc who was running it was just spending all of this money and not getting enough patience. And so, went bankrupt and one of the businessmen who had invested initially, owns the biggest dental supply company in the world, in New Borg, Oregon, right next to Springbrook. He was involved from the start. Then, he bought everybody else out and reopened it and had it as a treatment center for anyone, with a specialty for physicians. 
AS: Oh, right. 
MS: And it did much better. But, so when we.... I finally realized that I'm not getting anywhere with Hazelden, it's just this six hour a week at most. So, we decide that we love Oregon and that we were going to go back, and we went back.  And then I did the same thing there, multiple jobs. Springbrook was one of them, I did Pacific Gateway for a little while, I worked at that adolescent place for a little while, then I worked at a women's program, I worked at a Native American program. I did consulting for the Board of Medical Examiners and you know, on docs who have addiction and stuff like that. And then I did some for the nursing board, too. Just throwing all of this stuff together, again, trying to get a forty-hour week or whatever. And, [laughter] there still really weren't full time jobs in addiction for docs. Hazelden still didn't have any and even Springbrook. Springbrook and a couple of full-time docs. They had a detox area and they liked more of a medical model, because it was started by a doc, you know. So, they had a couple, but not psychiatrists. 
AS: Did they also focus on other professionals like pilots or? People who need like licensing?
MS: Yeah, they did. Yes. And it was really kind of a natural that way, because all of the stuff in medicine with licensure issues was similar in the other professions. It worked out really well. And those groups got along well too. There were a lot of similarities. A bunch of attorneys. 
AS: Yeah, I had another doctor say that pilots and doctors, like they would rather die than lose their license. 
MS: Oh, yeah. Man, absolutely. 
AS: That it is so meaningful to their identity... that threatening that, usually gets people into treatment. 
MS: It does, it really does. 
AS: Or that the idea of losing...
MS: Both are so highly trained in one thing, that... 
AS: Right, what would you do? 
MS: Yeah, what would you do? I know docs who have been working in restaurants and all kinds of stuff, because they have no other skills, really. Although, I also know some who did do, that were like techy guys on the side and they had been able to, during a period without a medical license go work for, you know, a tech industry doing something. 
AS: Right. 
MS: But, there's not much. 
AS: Okay, so are we in the Nineties now?
MS: Yup, early to mid-Nineties. 
AS: And you're still on the West Coast?
MS: I moved back here, this is a horrible tale, in some respects. Hazelden, right after we moved back to Oregon, six months later I get a call from one of my friends at Hazelden and he says, ""Marv, we finally decided that we want a medical director for the company."" And, I said that I would be interested. I foolishly said that. I just had this struggle with myself and with Linda, you know... 
AS: Because meanwhile, how old are your children at this point? You have two daughters? 
MS: A daughter and a son. 
AS: A daughter and a son, okay. 
MS: And so, they are in grade school. Second and fourth grade, maybe. And, so '95 I move back. It took nine months for them to decide after I interviewed, and they finally gave me the job. Then we moved back, I only moved back for nine months. The job was so undefined, and I just hardly did anything. I had no oversight of anything and no responsibility for anything. 
AS: So, you just sat around? [laughter]
MS: I saw patients a lot, like a psychiatrist, but nothing else of use to them. It wasn't what I had in mind, and so, I just left and took the family back. They came for just four months. Luckily, the four months was a fall from the start of school to Christmas, and we were back. They were both in grade school at the time and they both just finished the first year of a two year with the same teacher, same classmates. So, they missed just one part of that, and they came back to the same classmates, the same teacher and everything just fell right into place. It was really a tough time. 
AS: So, would you say that Hazelden wasn't really ready at that point? 
MS: Yeah, I never... the president at the time, Terry Spicer, I think he talked to me once. 
AS: So, they didn't really understand why they should have a medical director?
MS: So, I was the first full-time doc hired and I left because they didn't have anything really going. And it was really hard to do, to leave. Because I had given up so much to get there and drag my family around the country for a second time. 
And all because, probably because... and there is still some of this. I'm sure that, because of my own treatment at that place, there was a commitment to it, you know, that otherwise I probably wouldn't have. And a connection to it. And some, perhaps, even a feeling that I owe them somehow. 
AS: Interesting. 
MS: Yeah, so...
AS: And you were still feeling that twenty years later. Right? 
MS: Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
AS: That is pretty powerful. 
MS: I mean I didn't get sober right after treatment, but they opened my eyes... and they kind of gave me my life. 
AS: No, but... right, right, the place. 
MS: So, yeah it is really powerful. And so now I get to live in Oregon and work for Hazelden. 
AS: So, how did that happen?
MS: So, in '95, nine months in that job. I am the medical director of Hazelden. And at the time, just a couple sites. Minnesota, Center City and Plymouth, and St. Paul, and then we had a place in Florida at the time, as well. And I was the medical director of all of that. So, basically the same job that I have now... 
AS: Wait, that was the job you left that was so.... unfulfilling? 
MS: Yeah, yeah. Cause they had no idea what they were doing, at the time. With a doc, you know? So, we go back to Oregon, same situation. 
AS: You go back to doing all of the consulting, piecing...
MS: Yeah, piecing all of this together, and the private practice that kept growing. It got really big which was kind of neat. 
AS: Yeah, well I bet by that point you were also a special kind of psychiatrist, if people weren’t able to get... 
MS: Yeah. That's true. People started to recognize their needs, yeah. 
AS: But did you continue that model of talking, spending more time talking with your patients, than just prescribing them medicine. 
MS: Yeah, so, about half of my time I was spending doing psychotherapy and the other half doing medications and still, talking more than my peers were, with patients on medication, so it was really nice.
AS: Right, right. So, I can see why that would make you popular. 
MS: Yeah, yeah, and people come to me and say ""I go to my doc and he sees me for five minutes and just gives me a prescription, and you talk to me. So, I'm coming back."" I heard that repeatedly. 
AS: Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. 
MS: And I also did psychotherapy for real, you know. 
AS: Right, it wasn't just trying to be nice and listen patiently for a few minutes. 
MS: So that went well and then, I was kind of involved behind the scenes, telling folks at Hazelden, that same guy who asked me to come back for that job, he became like a COO at Hazelden. They didn't call him that. And he and I were talking, and I said, ""You know, the guy who owns Spring Brook is kind of interesting in selling it."" He doesn't... It was that guy who owns this big dental company, and he just kind of lost interest. He was in recovery, that's why he did it, but now he just wanted to get rid of it. And no one was buying it. So, I said, ""You guys outta consider it. It's a great program."" So, he came out and looked and then they never did anything about it. And then a new president came in, who was just there a year. It didn't work out well, and the board, you know, kind of got rid of him. I don't know the details, but he came out to visit. I talked to him a lot about it and he thought it was a good idea. So, he decided to buy it. And we're a non-profit and they were a for-profit, so it required all of this juggling about that, legally. But, while he was there, he brought Linda and I out for supper with he and his wife and he asked me if I'd consider coming back as the medical director. I said that I will if I can stay here and do it from here. And he said sure. And he came out of hospital administration, so he really knew docs and medicine and he had a whole different perspective on how to run Hazelden and we had never had a person like that. 
AS: And you said he only lasted for a year at Hazelden? 
MS: Yeah, only a year. But it was mostly interpersonal stuff that didn't work out. It was problematic stuff, not because of his perspective. Yeah, unfortunate stuff, but sometimes it happens that I can't mention. 
AS: That's fine, I understand. 
MS: But so, he asked me one day if I would be interested, and the next day, I have the job. So, it went from nine months that first time, to overnight and I had the job. 
AS: And that's 1990...? 
MS: And they didn't replace me when I left in 1995. This is 2001 when they purchased Spring Brook and they get me. 
AS: And they hadn't replaced you in that whole time from 1995... they didn't have a medical director? 
MS: No. 
AS: Marv, that is just a crazy story. 
MS: It is! Isn't it? So, I become the medical director, well now I am the chief medical officer. They changed the title, but it is the same job, it is just bigger now. So, I'm going back and forth. The day I start my job, they invited me out to a board meeting, and that was my start day. And I get to Center City and walking toward the board meeting I run into a board member, Ellen Brier, and we're just talking, and I've never met her, we're walking to the meeting, and the guy who hired me is not there. And they announced that he is no longer at the organization. This is my first day on the job. And Ellen Brier, the woman who I just met walking in, is the interim CEO. Ellen Brier has never been a CEO of anything, has no health care experience, comes from Godiva Chocolate.
AS: [laughter] Oh my gosh. 
MS: So, I start when she starts. So, this goes on and she is... one of my neighbors in Oregon, I did a lot as a neighbor and then we did a lot of fishing together, and he was a CEO of an international computer firm out of LA and then they had moved to Phoenix. He was doing basically what I was doing, working elsewhere. I asked him if he would help me out as a business mentor and he did, and after a couple of years, probably three years, he told me that I needed to get out of there because she was going to run the company into the ground. And I couldn't do it, I just held on until 2007, really trying to emphasize quality of care and outcome measures of our patients. We gotta know that what we are doing work and we gotta prove that it works and be able to stand on that. 
AS: How was that received? 
MS: It was well received by the clinical people, you know? But, not necessarily by her and her ideas for the organization. She was more focused on the money and didn't really want to put money into doing something like that. 
AS: She didn't want to put money into you all proving or trying to study whether what you were doing was working? 
MS: And we were already doing some outcome studies, but I wanted to really enhance that... 
AS: You wanted to do that because you were trained in science. 
MS: Yeah, yeah. And so... 
AS: But you're saying that it was the leadership at the time, not the culture of the 12-Step Minnesota Model? 
MS: Correct. Yeah, and I will admit, the councilors in general... I'm blocking out the word for it... It was like an apprenticeship program. 
AS: Right, the peer training. Alcohol and drug counselors, that's their whole history. 
MS: Yeah, they had a whole certification program at the time and you just kind of come and become an apprentice for a year and then you could be a counselor and get licensed and everything. It was an oral tradition. 
AS: Right, like a peer coach. 
MS: But there wasn't much in the way of academics associated with it. Nothing like the grad school now, but the training program started in the mid, I think '64. It's old and established. But, without the academics, there was not a learning culture at Hazelden. Coming out of Mayo and the University of Minnesota, I mean, there are lectures every day, all day long you could go to on all of these different specialties, diseases, all this stuff. And that sort of culture wasn't in place, and they were kind of just resting on their morals and starting this Minnesota Model and all these remarkable things that they had done, but they weren't really pushing anything that was new. I was wanting to do that. I thought about... I left in 2007, and before I left, I was thinking to myself that we really outta consider this medicine, the only one for opioid use disorder. 
AS: You mean methadone? 
MS: Suboxone. Methadone was available, but that is so highly regulated and [not-audible] and Suboxone was just coming around and I thought maybe we should consider it. I had already been involved in really driving medicine for alcohol use disorders, only Naltrexone and Antabuse and then Acamprosate were used. 
AS: Acamprosate? 
MS: Yeah, it is another medicine for alcohol. It hardly ever works, maybe ten percent of people? When I say that, just today we had a lecture by video by one of the leading researchers down at Mayo. A cancer researcher who now is a genetics researcher actually, really an internal medicine doc. For cancer research, he started using genomic and metabolomics to try and figure out responses to medications and who would respond to what. So, he did that for antidepressants and now he is helping out in the psychiatry and addiction department. And we applied with them to [inaudible 58:33] alcohol abuse and alcoholism for a grant to study Acamprosate for alcoholics to see if we can define biologic markers that would predict response. So, we're doing this... 
AS: Wow, that is so interesting. 
MS: Because if ten percent respond, and they respond well of those that respond, it works. But, say you were an alcoholic.... 
AS: But why would you? Here try this, you have a ten percent chance.
MS: It probably won't work, but if it works it will work great. Who wants to do that? It's expensive and you gotta take it three times a day, well that's not going to happen. 
AS: No. 
MS: But, if we could define who it works for, and you could just do a blood test and you can go, ""Hey, this will work for you."", that's a big deal. It'll take four or five or six years. We just started... 
AS: Wow, that's great. 
MS: Yeah, it's really neat. 
AS: Okay, so 2007 you leave. You were already thinking about why don't we use these... because at that time, we're already seeing the consequences of overprescribing of opioid pain pills. And you were on the West Coast. 
MS: I was doing lectures about it. 
AS: Right. 
MS: And ASAM even, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, I described the stuff that was going on. And no one was listening. Yeah. Cause you could see in the national data trends, we were starting to see it within Hazelden with the number of people with opioid use disorders is increasing. People at Hazelden and people on the ground, they were recognizing it. We're talking about it. I'm trying to bring attention to it and give them lectures about it and writing, not articles for research or anything, but just writing about it and doing interviews about it. People were not paying any attention. So, I go out to Portland. I needed a job, and a couple of nurse-practitioners I knew had just started to work with a woman who ran a home health service and they were going to do detox in people's homes. Which is done in the UK and in Australia, it's really common. And so, I thought that'd be really interesting. I'll work with them and we can also start an out-patient program, because those people will need treatment. You can't just detox them. So, we'll do out patient, help with the detox, figure out how to do this and see if we can prove it useful and convince insurers to use it. It'll be cheaper in the home, if we do it right. So, we got all of that going, but I decided in the out-patient program that we would do Suboxone, Vivitrol wasn't available, Naltrexone hadn't been approved for opioid use disorders yet, it had for alcoholism, so I started prescribing that, and convincing the councilors who were all from Spring Brook, basically. 
AS: They were your councilors that you had worked with at Hazelden? 
MS: Yeah, we stole them kind of. And they came to work for us. They decided it would be more fun to try and get a new program off the ground and I convinced them that we should do this thing where we provide a real 12-Step, abstinence-based treatment programming, just like you normally would, just like background in treatment is, with the use of suboxone, this new medication for opioid use disorders because it looks really promising. I think we should try this. And initially, they were just aghast that anyone would want to give that medication to patients, but after a few patients, and the whole excitement of getting it going, they just got totally supported. 
AS: Because they were seeing really good results? 
MS: Yeah. Yeah, people kind of settled down... I mean it wasn't all good. There were problems and people didn't keep coming and abused their Suboxone or whatever. There was a whole gamut of things happening, but most people did well. And so, we established that program and I did it for two years. And unfortunately, the woman who had that in-home health company that owned this whole thing, basically was going bankrupt. And not telling us and trying to just... she was just a mess kind of. All of the sudden, it was in dire straits. At the same time, Mark Mishuck had been hired at Hazelden. 
AS: Who is he? 
MS: He is our CEO. 
AS: Oh, okay. 
MS: Yeah, sorry. [laughter] It's okay! You shouldn't know. 
AS: Sorry, I didn't study up on that! [laughter] You never know what I remembered and might have picked up. But that wasn't one. 
MS: So, I get a call from his assistant, Karen Colander. Karen is an old friend, I've known her for fifteen years or something. And she says, ""Marv, Mark is coming out to the northwest and he wants to meet with you. So, he and his wife want to take you and Linda out for supper.""
AS: Here it comes. 
MS: And I'm thinking, why does he want to talk to me? And she doesn't know. She says, ""I don't know."" And I'm thinking well maybe he just wants to know the history or something that I know. Honestly, that's what went through my head. And cause when I left, I forgot to tell you this, when I left, the woman who was CEO, Ellen, was absolutely furious with me for leaving. And, I also told the board why I was leaving, I wrote them a letter that, she's doing this, and my thoughts are quality. If we're going to make money, we have to, but we gotta have a quality program. 
AS: Right. 
MS: And I'm being roadblocked for trying to accomplish these things. So, that of course wasn't the brightest thing to do. I had never left a job and I didn't know how, and I did that. 
AS: Right, and then she read the letter. 
MS: Right, of course. She withheld my mail, she told people they couldn't email or call me. 
AS: Wow. 
MS: Oh yeah, she was really upset. But, within a year, she was fired by the board. And then they had an interim, and then they hire Mark who comes out of hospital administration, and he is in recovery. And so, he is coming out and I am working in this program, but it is going bankrupt and I am trying to figure out what I am going to do next, but I've got a bit of a private practice starting and I can't keep things afloat. And he comes out, and half way through the meal after we have just been talking about addiction and treatment and Hazelden and all of that, he offers me my old job back. [laughter] 
AS: You can't get away from the place!
MS: I can't! Actually, one of my peers, Val Sleighmaker who oversees the grad school and research and stuff, she tells me it is my Hotel California. [laughter]
AS: Seriously! [laughter] That's really good actually. That's very poetic of her. 
MS: It is! So, I tell them that I'll do it and I'll move back to Minnesota, because I think I better in order to get this done right. But Linda says, ""Okay, I don't really want to leave Oregon."" 
AS: For the third time...
MS: We both love it there. I know! So, she kind of stays at home and fixes up our master bedroom and master bath, which the realtor said we should do. It's 2009 and the downturn has already started. And she does that, takes about six months and she's going to sell the house, while I am already out here, and the house is worth even less than before we did that. So, we say the heck with this, this is okay, it's not that bad living apart, we'll just do it a little longer and see what happens. So, she stays in Oregon and I was here in Minnesota first living in Center City and then in White Bear, just renting. First, I was living in a friend's house, they just let me stay there because they moved to the Southwest. Whenever they visited, I would just get out for a week or whatever. And then, it went on for almost four years living like that. 
AS: That's hard. 
MS: And finally, I just told Mark, my boss and CEO, this is just too much. I have to do something different. And about at the same time we were starting to negotiate with Betty Ford, so we would have a bigger presence on the West Coast, and he agreed that I should just be able to work out there and work out of the office there and come here regularly. And that's what I've done since. Before I left in 2000... yeah, before I left, we hired our first full-time psychiatrist. 
AS: Oh. For here in Minnesota.
MS: Yeah, Steve. Here in Center City. Springbrook had full time people. And I had worked there full time for a period of time before I was hired by Hazelden that first time, or that second time. [laughter] 
AS: That's okay. We'll try to make a timeline or something. I'll get your CV. 
MS: [laughter] So, basically, when I was talking with Mark about coming back, I said that I have been doing this in-home detox stuff which is exciting, but more exciting is that I have been dealing with opioids and I think we ought to consider this and go down this path with Suboxone. And he says, ""That makes sense to me."" And he comes out of hospital administration. Of course, it makes sense, a doctor tells me, ""Here is the research and here is my experience.""
AS: And here's what we need to do!
MS: And it was still not getting attention nationally. I mean it was, but it wasn't. 
AS: This is in 2009? 
MS: Yeah, 2009 I come back and finally, it's kind of exploding, and I am still talking about it. And we haven't done anything yet, I gotta do all kinds of other stuff as well, getting back involved there and getting some things taken care of. And then, I decided let's do it. And I had to convince the board because it is really controversial for our group.
AS: I'm sure. 
MS: I would bet about half of the board or more were older alcoholics in recovery and had biases about medicines, like buprenorphine. 
AS: Right, any medicine. 
MS: Yeah, oh yeah. But we already had full mental health services with full-time psychiatrists now. 
AS: So, people understood that there was a need for psychiatric-based medications. 
MS: Yeah, and they'd already gotten the medicines for alcoholism in place before I had left. 
AS: At Hazelden? 
MS: Yeah, so... 
AS: Oh, I didn't know that you guys were doing that. 
MS: Yeah, so the foundation... Yeah, we did that around 2003 maybe. So, Naltrexone came along, we decided to do that, with rare use of... Oh god, what's the stuff that makes you puke if you drink. 
AS: Anifuse. 
MS: Anifuse, yeah. We hardly ever use it because it is so dangerous in a way, and then Acamprosate came later, so we added that. We had already established that. I came back and started to talk about this. The board chair at the time was a catholic priest from inner-city Minneapolis. He had been a really high-level administrative priest and then kind of got that out of the way in his career and then kind of went to real street level type work. A lot with the homeless and with other organizations like that. Father Michael Connell. And he was wonderful. Because of his experience with all of that, he had seen the opioid crisis. He was also in recovery, but he had seen it for what it was in inner city Minneapolis. He thought that we should do this too and was really supportive. So, I had the support of the CEO and the support of the board chair, spent a bunch of time educating the board, and then they voted unanimously to support doing this and going down this path. 
AS: In 2012? 
MS: It was probably 2011 when they actually supported doing it. So, I started my plan in January of 2012 and pulled that team together and we took people from all parts of clinical from all sites on that team to kind of get this figured out for the organization. Initially, one of the councilors who I asked to be on this team, he said to me when I asked him, ""Is this a good career move, Marv?"" Because no one knew. 
AS: For him or for you?
MS: For him. Yeah, should I even be on this team if I am going to be suggesting that we use this medicine in this organization, what's going to happen to me? And others, I got a four-page, single-spaced email from one of our councilors in St. Paul. Because it had leaked out, this was about a month and a half project with the team. We we're communicating about it, we were just planning to figure it out. We were actually just reading the literature. 
AS: Right. How could we do this? 
MS: Right, and I had already done it in that outpatient program. Basically, the whole model was already established in the outpatient program and we're just going to put it into Hazelden, kinda. And yet, I had to convince people of it's worth, so I thought I would just use the literature. It made a huge difference, because I had everybody read a couple of papers about the early research on Suboxone and how it was working for people and they came back and had to present their two papers and everybody did their two papers, or three or whatever. And they were all like, wow, this is kind of hard to refute when you read this stuff and you hear all of this. So, it made it huge difference.
AS: What was the four-page email? 
MS: Oh, sorry. It was why we should not do this and about, maybe two and a half years ago now the woman who wrote it came up to me at one of our leadership meetings, basically the one we are having tomorrow and gave me a big hug and actually, with a tear in her eye, said ""Thank god that you had us do this. It works so well."" [laughter] Yeah, so it was wonderful because I didn't pick people that I thought would support it, I picked people I thought could get it done and decided that the research itself and my experience should help, you know win the day of whether we should do it or not. We already had the board approval, so we were going to do it. We're doing it. We're going to do it. 
AS: Right, and... it's happening. And are you going to be... 
MS: Are you going to get on board or not? And I had one of our main kind of national speakers, Fred Ulmquist, ran the renewal center at the lodge at the time and Fred is like an AA, Twelve-Step professor. 
AS: [laughter]
MS: Also, his parents were professors and he wore bowties and he teaches like a professor, you know, he just does. And he's wonderful and really bright. I've known him a long time, we're old friends and we've worked together on the alcohol medication thing. I asked him if he would help because I wanted to have his AA-cred for the staff, of course we're doing the right thing. So, Fred comes along, and he get on the team too, for the Suboxone, and Fred's wife, I'd known this but forgotten, Fred's wife Paige was in recovery from heroin use. And Fred was also in recovery, not from heroin. So, he knew that whole side of heroin and he said ""Absolutely, I want to be involved in this. I want to help."" And Fred, there's a book ""The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions"" and the third tradition, there is a description, a full paragraph, of all of the people who really early kind of established when they went to AA who should not come to these meetings. And there is a whole list, includes ""fallen women"", whatever that is. 
AS: Yeah, that's classic. 
MS: And then on the next page or two, it says we realize that to limit anyone from coming, could possibly sentence them to death and they decided against any limitations. And Fred had brought that to our team, which we used throughout anything we did.
AS: When people would start to push back? 
MS: Even before, we just had Fred get up and describe that and say, ""Hey, we are going to do this, and we need to. This is a precedent set by the founders of AA."" [laughter] And there's no limitations to medication that are described in AA. 
AS: Why do you think that that myth persists? Because I hear so many stories of people who've struggled with whether they tell their sponsor that they are on Suboxone or on Methadone, because there is still this idea that... Why does this myth persist if it is in the traditions? 
MS: There's even a pamphlet from AA about medical care and the use of medication and it says that it is between you and your doctor. 
AS: So, why would this...? 
MS: I think it's because historically, the medical profession has addicted a lot of people to a lot of different medications and sold a lot of medications as if they were not addicting. 
AS: So, there is basically a distrust of the medical profession, which I understand in the history of medicine very well. 
MS: Okay, that's it. That's the main reason, that's why it has nothing to do with the treatment of addiction and alcoholism. 
AS: Not for a long time. 
MS: Yeah, and finally they start to. But during my residency training, one of the other faculty members in psychiatry was studying Xanax for alcoholism and saying it was a safe mediation. 
AS: Oh. 
MS: Yeah, and people back then thought so. Not that long before that, TIME Magazine's cover was ""Cocaine is not addictive"". So. And I knew it was, I used cocaine. 
AS: Right, it's like smoking cigarettes isn't bad for you. 
MS: My god! It was really addictive. And, you know, all of us within recovery knew this stuff was so terrible. So, I think that that was what it was. A distrust. And there was a real distrust in Methadone, even though it was remarkably useful. 
AS: Well, because it got associated with crime and inner-cities and people of color. 
MS: Yeah. But also, most of that was because of the for-profit methadone maintenance programs that were established and still are all over the place. Because once you get someone on methadone, they keep coming back and you get money from them. 
AS: Oh. And they are for profit? 
MS: They are. Most of them. There are some that are not-for-profit, most of them are for-profit. And they don't provide all of the services that are supposed to be done in methadone. Yeah, so all of these wrap around services, well not in those programs. They hand out methadone all day long and that's it. 
AS: Well, that's another extreme that is just as, I think, just as problematic as just saying ""Twelve Steps are going to heal you."" ... from opioids.
MS: It is. Absolutely. And every time they have looked at people that are on long-term methadone and they stop, they relapse. Well, if you've got nothing else but methadone, of course you are going to relapse! 
AS: Right, right. If your life still is horrible... things are the same. 
MS: It's the same! So, I've always... that was the beauty of suboxone. Is that, it's not under the same regulatory requirements as methadone, so you can do it right from your office, which was fantastic. 
AS: Right.
MS: You don't have to have all of the licensure for methadone either, which is really onerous. And our board, there was still bias about methadone and I had had experience in a couple of different methadone maintenance programs. One, my training at the VA and one, I consulted at and did psychiatric work for in downtown Portland. So, I knew that there was a real utility to methadone, and I had seen the research. It was kind of like... but I also knew a lot of people who had a history of heroin, who were sober in NA and either had used methadone for a period of time and stopped or had never done it and now were sober. So, I had that experience too, that it is not absolutely necessary. But in our setting, there was no way that we would have done methadone.
AS: Right, I totally understand that. 
MS: Partially, because of the onerous nature of the regulatory system. And we do this in people's offices, and we knew that they could get the care later, easily. So, vivitrol had been approved so we said we were going to do both medications. I didn't have experience with vivitrol from that practice, because it wasn't approved when I was there, so this is new, but it makes so much sense to use both. So, we decide that's what we're going to do right from the beginning. 
AS: You mean to offer both? 
AS: Yeah, so people could have a choice. It is always nice to have a choice among medications, for any illness. And for docs, that's better to have the opportunity for more than one or two... but the guy who asked me if this was a good career move, and Fred, who was our AA professor and I, decided that the three of us would do training forums around the organization about this whole program that we are putting together. Doing that mainly. And the first one we did was at Center City. It was in our biggest room in the grad school, and there were over one hundred people there, standing along... and we're thinking, in preparation we were thinking that we need flak jackets because... [laughter] everything, this is going to be awful. And it wasn't. But we each talked briefly, about five to ten minutes each and then we opened it up for discussion because we wanted a forum, we wanted an interaction, we didn't just want lecture about this. So, I went first and talked about the medication, which, you know, I just had to get it out there and describe both medications and why, and a little information about the research. And then Scott the councilor talked about, you know, how it would affect treatment and what we would do that way. And then Fred talked about why we should do this, even in a Twelve Step based program. 
AS: Right. 
MS: And he used the stuff from the Third Tradition. [aside] My phone has gone off a couple of times.... It's Linda, it is probably nothing. [laughter] But so, the first run, all of these people, Scott in his section right after me, I led the meds, he says, ""How many people here have had a patient here die of an overdose after treatment?"" Three quarters of the room raised their hands. Now, there was a lot of overlap among those. One patient could have been ten people, you know. 
AS: Right, but it was a person who they had touched... who they had been working with. 
MS: Right, three quarters of the room. And you could hear a pin drop. It made our whole argument, in one question. Then Fred talks, and we open it up for discussion and I'm thinking, okay, here it comes. We get softball question after softball question and support for this program and that we need to change that people are dying. You know, ""This makes so much sense."" Somehow, we're going to do it, type questions. And then, we're ten or fifteen minutes into the questions and one of our most conservative councilors raised their hand and I am thinking, now it's going to start, this is the flapjack. And she stands up and she says, ""My daughter,"" she was twenty-eight or something, ""went to residential treatment three times for heroin, relapsed after each treatment right away, could not get sober until she started taking suboxone. And now she has been sober three years, she's part of my family again, she now takes of her children and I don't have to anymore, she has a job, and she is doing wonderfully."" And no one knew. She hadn't told anyone. And she just got up and gave this testimonial and it was like, we couldn't have asked for anything better to say and it was just from the most unlikely person in the room, just this big book thumping woman who, who no one ever thought would ever support this. And it was the most incredible description of the utility of this medication that you could ever hear. And her daughter went to AA, right? And took the medicine. It turned the entire conversation... there wasn't any griping, let alone absolutely anarchy. There were certainly pockets of people who didn't agree, but they didn't talk in that meeting and they kind of got silent as we went down this path and just silently just tried to disrupt things. It was amazing. It was the absolute opposite of what we were expecting. 
AS: That's incredible. 
MS: Yeah, and it told me, once again, the passion of our counseling staff, our clinical staff-- our docs and nurses as well and councilors --- is so tremendous. They just want to do what is right for our patients. And we finally said, here's what we should do for this particular group of patients, and... [aside conversation about incoming phone call]. 
AS: So, what would you say... So, I know that you did, just in the interest of time, you did a webinar, this is how I started to reach out to you, because you did a webinar about what has happened in the few years since you started. Okay, so I could watch that and then get a lot of your answers. 
MS: Okay, yeah, that would tell you how we did and what our early results were. 
AS: Okay, that is good to know. What would you say...? I have a couple things. What would you say to people who still say, ""Hazelden is a dinosaur.""? 
MS: [laughter] I laugh, nowadays because man... 
AS: You must have heard that. 
MS: Oh, yeah. 
AS: And this is in the context of the opioid epidemic. 
MS: We were talking about it this morning actually, because a couple of our folks who are out on the East Coast, I don't know if they are in Rhode Island or in Connecticut, and they are talking with the executive director of the AAA, the American Association of Addiction Psychiatrists. And this person in this group that we are talking to, they think that we are a dinosaur, that we're just living in the past. They have no idea what we were doing. They had no idea about Core Twelve, they know nothing about our treatment, they just made all of these assumptions based on twenty years ago and what we were like. As if somehow, we had never changed. You know? And they were able to tell them all of this stuff, and when they left, they said, ""Oh my God. We had no idea."" Thanks for coming. 
AS: Yeah, thanks for showing up. 
MS: [laughter] Yeah, so now I tell them about Core Twelve, about the research project that we have completed that we are trying to get published. We still haven't heard from the publisher. We submitted the paper and asked for the edits, we submitted the edits. 
AS: To which publisher? To a scientific journal? 
MS: Yeah, Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment. The right one, right? [laughter]
AS: Yeah, you picked the right one there.
MS: Yeah, so we're hopeful. It was a naturalistic study, so it didn't have double-blind controls with the medications, which it a bit unfortunate for a study because you don't have the controls that you might want. But we were told when talking to several researchers that both medicines have been adequately approved to be effective, we just need to see what they are like in practice. So, that's what we did!
AS: So, what does that mean, naturalistic? 
MS: That the patients get to choose which medicine, we don't force that on them. 
AS: You don't demand that? Because that's what I... reading that short piece from 2013, that patients can continue to choose, if they want just abstinence or if they want one of these drugs.
MS: And that's still the case. And we recommend that they take one of the two medications. 
AS: But how much... okay, okay. 
MS: Every single person with an opioid use disorder, we recommend the medication. They can refuse it. That's the deal. 
AS: Because we have... 
MS: You can't force it on them, we can, and we do continue to try and convince them, because this conversation is right when they get into treatment during detox it starts. And we're continuing to try and tell them to try the medicines. We will their family, not necessarily successfully because a lot of the times, family are not involved at all and they don't want anything to do with the person anymore, or, they just... ""We didn't bring them there for that."" Especially that suboxone stuff, because there are real biases about it. And we have to do a lot of education about it there, and even then, they might say that we're not going to support that. ""We just want them sober."" 
AS: Have you noticed a difference between what happens at Plymouth versus Center City, in terms of opioid addiction? 
MS: To a degree. One of the main things, the one big difference we noticed right of the bat, is that some of the younger people especially misused suboxone on the street. And some of them, to me that's not a big deal, if it's just that they are using suboxone... 
AS: But they are trying to use it between?
MS: Yeah, detoxing themselves... But if they are injecting it or something, that would suggest that we're not going to give it to them. Because people certainly do that. 
AS: How do you inject suboxone? It's a liquid? 
MS: You could. It is a liquid, well you can turn it into a liquid really easily. 
AS: Because it's the little sublingual...
MS: Yeah, it's either a tablet or a film. You just put some warm water on it, and it goes right into a solution. But also, you're not supposed to be able to inject it because it's got Naloxone in it, it's supposed to block your receptors and put you into withdrawal. Suboxone is really tightly bound to those receptors and might not let that happen. It's really a weird thing. Yeah, so some people actually do inject it and get high off of it. Most people don't try for that reason. 
AS: What are you guys doing with Naloxone and Narcan? 
MS: We give that to every patient that has an opioid use disorder. 
AS: When they leave? 
MS: Yeah. 
AS: When did you start doing that? 
MS: At the latter part of installing this whole system. So, it's been going on for quite a while now. What else? Shoot. 
AS: Sorry, I interrupted you. 
MS: I can't remember what I was going to say, that's okay. 
AS: That's bad oral history. It's a violation. 
MS: [laughter]
AS: I'm in trouble now. 
[Aside, moving cat away from interview]
MS: I can't remember what I was going to say, but when we went public about this, we got just lambasted by other treatment programs and, especially, Twelve Step program type treatment. 
AS: By saying that you were going to use medication? 
MS: Mm hm. They said we were... We heard form a real kind of prominent AA person in the Twin Cities that were ruining AA. We were told we were turning our back on our entire heritage and ruining the treatment field, that we were, and me in particular, were ruining Hazelden. 
AS: Is this a public document? 
MS: There was some in the media, but I don't know. You would have to ask Jeramiah. He might be able to dig some of that stuff up. 
AS: Who is Jeramiah? 
MS: Jeramiah Gardner is our PR person. 
AS: Oh, okay. Well because that is kind of the opposite of what I was... That's the opposite of some of the things that I have heard. 
MS: And now it's changed. Now it's really switched. 
AS: No, but I mean that you weren't doing enough. 
MS: Oh, sure. 
AS: And when you do it, you're criticized by people for not doing enough.
MS: It was both, we were getting both. 
AS: But, let's talk about that for a second... Oh, go ahead. 
MS: In the same month, I was told that we were ruining addiction treatment of this type, you know Twelve Step, abstinence-based treatment, and it's not going to work what we are doing, by one person from a different treatment program. And a couple weeks later, told by a doc in St. Paul that we weren't giving enough people Buprenorphine and we shouldn't even be giving Vivitrol to anybody. And neither were true at the time, he just was making assumptions and of course, the other one wasn't true either. It was ridiculous. And that was just constant for a while, that sort of stuff. In spite of the fact that we were doing... We were the first of the major addiction treatment programs to do this. We weren't this first program to do it, but we were the first to write about it and the first to get it out there in the media, to really bring attention to that issue. I have trained all kinds of people who were from other treatment programs, some of whom couldn't even tell their treatment program when they were coming to visit us and learn about this. Yeah, they didn't dare. Some who were trying to convince their board that we should do this, but you know, they couldn't and still wanted to learn how we were doing it and stuff like that. It was really weird. I didn't really care, because we were doing what we needed to do, and it was so exciting. 
AS: For your patients. 
MS: Yeah, and patients were getting better, and it was really useful and wonderful.
AS: Does your program support people staying on Suboxone for some amount of time or are they encouraged to get off before they leave? 
MS: Well, initially we said we only wanted to use it for some period of time, like a year and a half, two years or something. Until you get into good solid recovery, and then if you want to get of the medicine, just fine. I still think that is a useful tool for most people probably. Not all by any means. And yet, the Federal Government doesn't agree, and a lot of researchers say, ""I can't take people off of their medication."" But the truth is, medication adherence study shows us that two weeks of an antibiotic, less than half of people do that without stopping it early. It's terrible. And all of the suboxone studies, those early studies we used in that literature review, show that less than fifty percent of people were staying on it. And they were really quitting early. So, our goal became... We want to keep people on it, keep them engaged in treatment, and that's where we shifted our model because we wanted people to stay engaged with us long term who had opioid use disorder. Not in residential, we wanted residential to get into out-patient in St. Paul and stick around in this program, getting the medicine there, living in a sober house, you know, stick with this long term. And, we will help you figure out if you should stop the medicine or not, and we will support you all along the way. So, Core Twelve became this really kind of long term out-patient program. Now there are over two hundred people in St. Paul in this program. 
AS: Oh, wow. 
MS: Yeah, it's great. And that's where we ultimately resulted in... in our whole model. We saw the utility of a residential stay for stabilization, followed by long term out patient, during which the people could transition from professional care to self-care over months and years, if it was necessary. And it gave us the opportunity to maintain involvement and support ongoing use of medications, and ultimately, if they wanted to get off, we could be there to help them with that and insure continued support. Because so many people stopped anyway, to me, that was just an essential feature of this. And I knew that the craving of opioids goes on so long, I didn't want to say, ""We're just going to do four weeks of treatment,"" or whatever, now our average is about three, and then say...
AS: Oh, really?
MS: Yeah, in residential. Our average in out-patient after that is now like several months. And for our Core Twelve folks, our initial Core Twelve group was going two years later with all of the same people still there. I mean, they didn't want to stop. And they were all going to Twelve Step meetings and doing all of this other stuff, but they still really appreciated what they were getting there. And so, my bias was... There's literature on physicians with addiction and a lot of them are opioid addicts, and a lot of those are fentanyl addicts, so even more powerful drugs that what they have on the street. They are taking pure fentanyl. And a high death rate for those folks as well. But, in most states, they were not allowed to use Suboxone and go back to practice medicine. But also, they had the highest recovery rates recorded in any literature because of all of the long-term monitoring. 
AS: Oh right, so you could use that monitoring model...
MS: It was two-fold. I must be getting tired, I can't remember anything. 
AS: That's okay, I understand. You have been talking for two hours. You should be running out of words. 
MS: [laughter] So, contingency management is an evidence-based practice for addiction. The biggest contingency, the easiest to understand what this means, is if a physician or a nurse or anyone that requires a license, like a driver, a semi-driver or a pilot, if you're going to go back to your work, you can do that as long as you do this, this, this, and this, too, and we'll let you maintain your license. If you don't do any of these things, we are taking your license away. If you relapse, we are taking your license away. So, that's a contingency management, that's an evidence-based practice. Sometimes, a different type of contingency, and when we used this at St. Paul, if everybody shows up for group today, we'll have a pizza party next time we meet, and we'll supply the pizza. And the thing is, when we did that, they were all supporting each other. ""You gotta go to group we want that pizza party."" Right? They are calling each other and texting, ""Get to group!"". So, it supports abstinence, it supports continued involvement. So, we were using that. So, for the docs, its contingency management, they could lose their license to practice medicine, as well as that long-term monitoring that I think results in the really high outcome rates. And even for those with opioid use disorders, although a lot of the data is a little skewed because some people drop out, ones with opioid use disorders and they weren't used in the final analysis, but still, they've got seventy-five or eighty percent abstinent in five years.
AS: Really? Wow. That's great. 
MS: It's incredible. Yeah, but most of them can't use suboxone and go back to work. There are a couple of states that allow it, but most states won't. 
AS: You mean for doctors? 
MS: Yeah, these doctors cannot go back to work on Suboxone. So, I knew of that literature and I knew all kinds of people in NA, who, like I said earlier, have either never used methadone, or used methadone and stopped and now are sober. So, I know that people with opioid use disorder can stay sober without medication. And I don't know who is who, so that's one of the reasons that we recommend everyone take one of the two medications, but it also is one of the reasons, initially, that I thought we should support people who want to stop medication, at some point. That only after their really good recovery, because the risk of relapse is associated with the risk of overdose and death. So, it can't, we can't, be undisciplined about this. We've got to really make sure that we are only supporting that, if they are in solid recovery, and even then, there is still a risk. We've had all kinds of people stop the medications and we've had some stay on the medications. 
AS: Right, it is just so personal. 
MS: Right. We don't know who is who. 
AS: And you haven't been able to test that. 
MS: No, and I would like to. That would be a great research project, but it would be really hard to do and take a really long time. It would still be worth it. 
AS: Okay, just one more question. Do you need to go?
MS: No.
AS: So, if you could change something for the better right now, if you could change something right now regarding addiction treatment, what would it be? 
MS: If I could just suddenly change something? 
AS: Is there anything? 
MS: I guess the main thing would be to allow access to anybody to have addiction treatment and as long as they needed addiction treatment. 
AS: To have it for as long as they need it? 
MS: Yeah, and in a system like our own, where they start with residential if they need it, they go to day treatment, they go to out-patient, intensive out-patient and have long term follow up. 
AS: And that's if they have the insurance or the funds. 
MS: Well, if I get to change anything the funding is somehow provided so anyone can access treatment and they can have the treatment they need. 
AS: Okay, that's what I knew you were getting at. 
MS: Which is hard to get. It's hard to get the treatment you need. 
AS: Well, and to have it be consistent based on people's insurance situations. 
MS: Yeah, it is. It's still hard for us. 
AS: It depends on who your insurer is whether you can even go to Hazelden or not. 
MS: I know, yeah. Now most, all of the major national insurers cover us now, we're partnered with. Ninety-two, ninety-three percent of our patients use their insurance. 
AS: Is that recent? 
MS: That's the last couple years now. 
AS: Yeah, that's what I wondered. 
MS: It's a big change from... Oh, this is what I forgot earlier. So, Betty Ford Center, so we merged with them shortly after, in like 2014, we initiated this program in 2013. Some of the most vocal folks against us were Betty Ford Center. It was mostly, if you could say if we have competition in the addiction field, it was the people who thought they were our competitors were the most vocal against us, trying to get patients to go there instead of going to us, basically. But also, they just didn't agree with us. 
AS: I was going to ask you how the Betty Ford merger happened, and how well that went.
MS: Well, so, the first meeting... 
AS: Like philosophically. 
MS: Yeah, the first meeting of the Betty Ford center board with our president and CEO Mark Mishick, he told me that I needed to go along with him because they were so concerned about this new program Core Twelve. 
AS: They needed you to explain it? How did that go? 
MS: Yeah, and on their board was Tom McClelland, who is a major addiction researcher, now semi-retired, who has been supportive of medicines all along, but he couldn't convince them or the rest of the board about it. So, I go in and told them what we've done and why.
AS: And he's like, ""See what I've been telling you!"" 
MS: Yeah! And basically, we did it because people were dying. People were dying of addiction and in overwhelming numbers that we have never seen before, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help and that's what convinced me more than anything, and what convinced our staff more than anything. And the medicines work, and they work well, and that helped a lot in convincing. But the Betty Ford folks, their board actually agreed and still went through with the merger. It took over a year before their staff would even consider it. And it required a lot of them coming to visit to see what it was like in action and to meet our patients. 
AS: So, they're very new to the Core Twelve Program? Within a couple years. 
MS: Yeah. It might be three now or so for them, but it took a while. And they were really biased initially, but now they just love it too. 
AS: So, what was the impact, and you might not know this, but what was the impact on staff at Hazelden when these deaths started happening and how were you finding out about them? Were you finding out through the grapevine or how was it? 
MS: Well, it depended on how long they had been out of treatment and probably circumstances with their families. If they were still involved with us, we were absolutely finding out. If they weren't involved and patients who were still in our system were involved with them, we would find out through the patient once and a while. The family would tell us regularly. We have a quality review committee, which is like a peer review committee in a hospital that has to review every sentinel event. It would be like a death, a very bad outcome, an injury, a medication error, stuff like that. And so, I oversee that, and I am the liaison to our quality committee to the board, and so I was seeing everyone we were aware of, we reviewed. Which is really hard. 
AS: Was there a time when there were a lot of them? 
MS: It didn't suddenly peak, it just kind of slowly got to become more and then it kind of leveled off, but it's been... before that, before this opioid crisis, we hardly had any deaths. I mean there would be a suicide now and then, I mean we were not reviewing regularly deaths all the time, no, and now we are, which is horrible. But I can't prove this. But the numbers are so much more now, in terms of the numbers of people with opioid use disorder than it was at the start of all of this. And although we have more death, I think we would have way, way more without the use of the medication. I can't prove it, I suppose I could try. 
AS: Well, hasn't evidence-based medicine already proved it? I mean, do you have to prove that it is you?
MS: It has, there is proof. There is proof in the literature. However, in our research study of Core Twelve, there were two-hundred and fifty-nine participants and they basically, almost a third in each group, a third on Naltrexone, mostly vivitrol, a third on Suboxone, and a third who refused medications. There were three deaths over the 2013 to 2017, in that two-hundred and fifty-nine people. One used buprenorphine and two used naltrexone, nobody with no meds. It goes against anything that we would have thought would have thought would have happened. 
AS: Nobody with no meds? 
MS: Nobody. We don't have all of the deaths because somebody could have died and not told us. I am intending to do... we lost a couple of people in our research department, so I haven't been able to carry this out, but I want to study like a thousand of our patients with opioid use disorder and look at all of their deaths through the social security death index, because they have gotten really much better by defining death by overdose. And then I could look back and see who was on no meds, who was on Suboxone, who was on vivitrol. I won't have the detail of how long they took it after treatment or anything, so I am not sure how much it will be helpful, but I will at least... No one has published anything like that, looking at death following addiction treatment, and that is so important. Because every single treatment program in the country is experiencing this. When we first started talking about this, I was talking about death and overdose at every single discussion that I had about it, because it is so necessary to the discussion if you are going to change your whole model, you have to have a good reason. There is no better reason. And nobody would engage in a conversation about that. No other treatment program, no other providers. They wouldn't even bring it up with me. And I would ask sometimes. 
AS: And when you say treatment programs, you mean those usually based on Twelve Step programs? You weren't talking to addiction medicine doctors who were already using it. 
MS: Any, any. I was. Yeah, to all. 
AS: They didn't even want to talk about the death rates.
MS: No. No. 
AS: Why do you think that is? 
MS: At ASAM there was more and more discussion about that over the years, but I think people were so used to a field that barely ever had deaths that they just didn’t know what to do about it. And the other thing is that most treatment centers do no outcome studies. They do no follow up of their patients. 
AS: Well, that's what really shocks me in my whole process of what I have been studying for this. 
MS: Yeah, it's horrible. 
AS: I don't even understand how that is possible. 
MS: It's amazing. It's ridiculous. And so, if you assume that everyone is doing great and put on your website that ninety-percent are abstinent at one year, you can't look and see who died. Man. 
AS: Right. Well and how can you even prove that people were abstinent. 
MS: You can't. Yeah, you can just call them and ask them... [laughter] or don't even. Or just take that, say it's ninety-percent. 
AS: Just say it, right. 
MS: Because you can't know and there's no group that is ninety-percent, ever. [laughter] Even in treatment it might not be ninety-percent. 
AS: Right, exactly! 
MS: [laughter]
AS: Even when they are in the building. 
MS: Yeah, yeah. 
AS: Anything else that you want to say?
MS: Ah, man. Oh, just a little bit more about... you know, so I was talking about how we switched from basically a programmatic model and it wasn't all Core Twelve, there was other influences going on, but Core Twelve was the major influence in switching this through-out the whole organization. Part of it was going down a path of insurance, you know, and trying to work with insurers. 
AS: Oh, okay. 
MS: So, changing from, you're coming into treatment for four weeks whether you need it or not, right? Four weeks is it. Maybe you can stay for six, but four weeks of treatment and then you are leaving and there won't be any follow up. And that's what I had in 1974. Betty Ford was still doing that when we merged. Yeah, and there are some longer-term programs for the people that could afford it, because it was purely private pay, but hardly anyone could afford that. And there are still all kinds of programs doing that nowadays, private pay and long-term treatment. And some of that probably gets better outcomes because it is long term treatment.
AS: Because it is long term, right. 
MS: It's just that no one can afford to do that, or like the one-percent can, I guess. And so, so now our model is that residential is for diagnosis and stabilization, and not just diagnosis if your substance use disorder, it's all the mental health too. 
AS: It's about all of the mental health, right, right. 
MS: And then, we want you to go to day treatment with sober housing in IOP, intensive out patient, prior to sober housing and then we want you seeing a counselor or somebody once a week, or every couple of weeks for a while. It's a chronic illness, let's be sure that you are really stable and that you've got a foot hold in recovery. So, that's how we started and how, because of the long-standing nature of the craving, like I said earlier, and other factors, and the high relapse rate with opioids, I wanted long term involvement. And insurance of course doesn't want to pay for that. 
AS: Right. 
MS: Shortening residential reduces the cost dramatically and allows for longer out patient. 
AS: Oh... Right, right. 
MS: Yeah, cause then you can shift your cost to the out-patient and get it really long. 
AS: So, you were part of that, that thinking? 
MS: Oh yeah, that's Core Twelve, that's was our thinking. We've got to keep people... 
AS: Oh, that came out of Core Twelve? That has now been applied... you've seen the benefits for people who don't have opioid issues. 
MS: Yeah, yeah, it's become our model as a whole now. Long term care for people. And there were other influences. It wasn't just me, but I was doing it both for Core Twelve and suggesting we do it because it is a chronic illness. [laughter] 
AS: I know, yeah. So, what are you...? 
MS: I mean my own experience was four weeks of treatment in 1974 and relapse in five days, no care of any kind, told to go to AA... 
AS: No support groups, right.
MS: Which I didn't go to. 
AS: And you were also a teenager. 
MS: Yeah, yeah. 
AS: You think of all of the risk factors. 
MS: There was no professional...
AS: There was nothing for you. 
MS: No, there wasn't anything available. 
AS: So, what would you say your most proud of in your work? 
MS: I would say Core Twelve itself. I am most proud of that for my entire career. Although, one thing I am doing right now comes as a close second. 
AS: What's that? 
MS: And over the long run, may be more important, I don't know but I've instituted a program that we can FIT. It's Feedback Informed Treatment and it is in our electronic health record where we have a portal for our patients. And they can go into that portal and we want them every week to fill out these objective tools about how they are doing. And they are in the literature, the research literature, all of these tools, well, not all of them. Three of them are in the research literature and are associated with positive outcomes from treatment. They've been used individually, never in combination. And then we added two tools that are used in primary-care. One for anxiety and one for depression and the new understanding of addiction as a disease is one of... initially it is all about positive reinforcement, ""it feels good, I am going to do it again"". Then it becomes negative reinforcement, ""I feel so bad but when I get high, it's relieved"". And that negative reinforcement is a release of negative stimuli. And so, the whole kind of new neurobiological theory of addiction is that it is negatively reinforcement associated with a combination of depression and anxiety and angst that is sort of driving continued use and driving relapse. And so, no one has ever measured to see if anxiety and depression are high... do people have more relapses? Or if they are low, do they have less? 
AS: Right. 
MS: And it is not necessarily anxiety and depression that are true anxiety disorders or mood disorders, it's just that negative affective state that is associated with addiction. And so, we added those two so we can do that and see, but also to see if they are predictive by themselves. So, now we have all five of these, we're asking our patients to fill out weekly. 
AS: Woah. 
MS: And they fill it out online, it goes into their chart and we're working with our electronic health record provider so it'll come up as a graph so you can see it over time, but then the next thing is we'll be figuring out interventions based on certain scoring. 
AS: Things that they say? That they report? 
MS: Yeah, to see if they are doing great, not going to change much, if they aren't then we better do some changing and what exactly that we change and what makes a difference. It is going to take a decade or more. That may...
AS: That might overshadow. [laughter]
MS: So those two I am very proud of.
AS: What's interesting about that though is that also has a really hopeful... 
MS: It does! [laughter]
AS: That's a very positive... I don't know how to say it. It has a positive overlay to it, versus the intensity of the opioid epidemic which is that you are trying to prevent death. 
MS: Exactly. 
AS: This is a program where you are trying to like, keep people supported and feeling loved and cared about, right? Whereas with Core and with the opioid epidemic, we're just trying to keep people alive so that they might get better at some point. 
MS: True. In fact, one of the medicines... 
AS: It makes sense to me why would you excited about this. Sorry, you were going to say?
MS: But still, Core Twelve is currently the best thing I have done in my career. [laughter]
AS: Yeah, that's really good. 
MS: Although, I did really like individual work with patients. This is probably more important in an overall scheme of things and probably has already effected more people than I ever could have by myself. So, yeah. 
AS: That's great. Thank you so much. 
MS: Oh yeah, thank you.

Minneapolis, Minnesota
Marvin Seppala            -MS
Amy Sullivan           -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan interviewing Dr. Marv Seppala. It is November 6, 2018. We are at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation in Center City. Dr. Seppala, do you give me permission to record this?
MS: Yes, I do. 
AS: Alright, thank you. So tell me—you might state your name, your birthday, where you grew up.
MS: Okay, my name is Marvin Seppala. I go by Marv. My birthday is July 22nd, 1956. Born in Seattle, Washington to Finnish parents. I am 100% Finnish. My mom immigrated from Finland with her brother to Tacoma, where a second-cousin sponsored him after World War II. My dad, his parents were both born in Finland and he grew up in Northern Minnesota in Virginian after it got logged out. My grandfather was a lumberjack. He moved out to Tacoma with the family to the other Finnish community. 
AS: Oh wow, so you had roots in Minnesota too.
MS: Oh, yeah. So ultimately, we moved back here and I grew up in Stewartville, Minnesota. 
AS: Stewartville. How old were you when you moved back here?
MS: So, I would have been eight when we moved to Minnesota, but we lived in Eden Prairie for just a few years. Before the start of sixth grade I moved to Stewartville. 
AS: And what do your folks do?
MS: My dad was a chemical engineer at IBM and my mom was a housewife. 
AS: Mmhmm. And you’re, are you… tell me about your siblings, or...
MS: Sure. I am the oldest of five and I have three brothers and the last sibling is a sister. She is ten years younger than me.
AS: Oh lucky girl [laughter]
MS: [laughter] Yeah. So, that ten-year gap was big because it was at seventeen when I was kicked out of the house for my addiction. She was just seven years old, so we never really bonded very much.  
AS: Oh, right, right. Right, you wanna talk about that? [laughter] You kind of jumped to it. 
MS: [laughter] I know, I did jump to something
AS: Seventeen, being kicked out, it seems like an important place. You want to go a few years before that? What happened in Stewartville, you got there in sixth grade?
MS: Yeah, just before the start of sixth grade. 
AS: What was that like?
MS: You know, it was funny because I think about it... Seattle, San Jose, Bloomington, Eden Prairie... and then Stewartville. For me, as a kid, at that age, I didn't notice the difference really, in terms of being in a big city and then being in a really small town. My focus, this was the fourth move already, and every four years, which is kind of funny when I start college and medical school.... training is every four years! 
AS: Oh yeah, your life is in four years, that’s interesting
MS: [laughter] Which seemed kind of nice is a way, it was weird. 
AS: So, every four years you’re like hmm… is it time to go somewhere now?
MS: [laughter] So, what my difficulty was being a somewhat self-conscious, anxious kid and now I've got to make new friends and start a new class, and I don't know anybody.  
AS: Yeah, and in sixth grade that’s starting to be awkward.
MS: Yeah, it was really awkward. But also, in a small town, I think it may have been easier. I don't know that. I met people pretty readily, in class of course, in the only school [laughter].
AS: One school, where all the kids are in the whole town [laughter].
MS: Everyone in sixth grade is there, so it worked out that way [laughter]. 
AS: So, who’d you meet? How’d you start getting in trouble?
MS: Sixth grade was nothing like that. It was that summer though, after sixth grade, so twelve-years-old.... I'm just trying to get this right. Yeah, so twelve years old, it must have been the start of seventh grade and I am at a farm with two friends, Kim and Rick, both guys, at Rick's family farm, right outside of Stewartville. And, I don't know how this idea comes up but all the older guys that we looked up to, are like the athletes and the sports teams. You know everybody. So seventh grade we were in the high school. There was no junior high. It was seventh grade through twelfth. So sixth grade I was in grade school and seventh grade I'm with everybody. All the older guys are drinking and they're all the really popular guys and the guys on the athletic teams. My mother was a cross-country skier in Finland growing up and was on the Olympic team but broke a leg and never got to compete. Her dad, my grandfather, was a world-champion cross country skier. So I grew up with athletics being a really big deal. So was academics. But in my mind as a kid, athletics was certainly more important. So, these athletes are all doing something that we're not supposed to but it seems like fun so I am attracted to it. So the three of us are at the farm, we steal some whiskey out of the kitchen and we go out to the barn, which we had to clean [laughter]. It was just part of the deal. It was a little dairy farm. And we drank. I can still remember it. At one point in my training, I was at the VA hospital and the councilor there, this ex-chief-petty-officer in the Navy, six-five, big guy. Chief Petty Officers are known for being very deliberate, really strong minded. So he was this incredible guy, remarkably passionate about what he did for these veterans. He had them all describe their first drink. And they almost to a person, they could. 
AS: Really? 
MS: It really captured them somehow. As if something really important had happened. That was me. 
AS: What is that called, in addiction medicine? There’s a name for that.
MS:  I can't remember that. So I'm not sure if I should do it really, but I'm all in.
AS: But you remember it feeling good?
MS: I remember I just could hardly understand why anyone would swallow this stuff. It tasted so bad. It burnt my throat and then all of the sudden, feeling like I belonged. Like I was part of these other two guys who had grown up together and I no longer had these worries or fears about that or anything else really. It was like I was suddenly part of the world or something. I don’t know, it was like my whole life changed. It was really remarkable. And I knew I was going to do it again. That's for sure. I was going to do this again. I didn't get to for months, but it was like a goal. I wanted to feel that way again. So, ultimately, the following summer, I did again. Then I started doing it more frequently that summer. 
AS: Do you remember if you got drunk the first time you tried it, or you just got the buzz? 
MS: I didn't get sick or anything. We just took a few sips each, you know, because we had to replace the bottle. [laughter] So it was mostly just this remarkable feeling.
AS: Yeah, that warmth, and... 
MS: Yeah, and there was more to it. It felt like I was part of something for the first time, and that is a strange thing to describe. In the midst of my addiction, it seemed like it was almost a quest to feel that way. It was almost like this spiritual quest because it felt like that almost, at the onset. And almost every new drug I took was that same sensation of ""Wow. This is what life should be like."" or something. It never would last. I never really could get back to it. There was a sense that I am missing something and I am looking for it, and seeking it, and never finding it. Except for those first couple of times with each particular substance. Other people have told me that as well over the years of my work. And even I've heard some speakers describe the same thing in regard to their substance use. It certainly was for me. It was just like, ""Man. This is what I thought life would be like."" or something. 
AS: Yeah, and to be twelve or thirteen... how old were you? 
MS: Yeah, twelve the first time. So a year later, drinking again with some friends and then an older brother of one of my friends that was a year ahead of me in school had just returned from the University of Minnesota after his freshman year. He was a guy I really looked up to, both an athlete and a really good student. He was on the honor roll and everything. Also went to the same church as I did, and overall, just a really good guy. So, he comes back and tells the two of us that he is smoking pot at the University and describes the importance of it and how fun it was. And I remember saying, ""I would never do that."" That was my initial response. I am really young, and then, a week later, I'm doing that. [laughter]
AS: That was short [laughter].
MS: [laughter]. It's funny because I have certainly read about peer pressure and thought about peer pressure in regard to its influence on people. When I look back on my own life in regard to substance use, I was always pushing the envelope and seeking more substance use and I needed to find people who were doing the same, so that I wouldn't stick out. There might have been some peer pressure to start something… once I got going, I didn't want people to know how often I was using, how much I was using, all of the different drugs I was using. 
AS: Right. So you looked for those people…
MS: I had to hang out with people who were doing the same so I wouldn't feel as bad.
AS: Right. So it was more like peer support. 
MS: It was. It was. All of this shame and guilt about doing it at all. At least I wouldn't have to be around people who would elicit that in me. [laughter].
AS: Right, right. That’s really powerful, that’s a really interesting take on it. Because other people get blamed a lot—the “bad kids.”
MS: Yeah, they do. And I was probably one of those bad kids because I did try and convince my friends. You know, ""You gotta try this now! I smoked pot and it is so much fun. You have to do it too!"" It was only a couple of people, less than a handful of people that I would do that with. It was the late Sixties, early Seventies. It was one thing to do it quietly, it was another to get other people involved. There were a few friends that every time I tried something new, I would go tell them just how great this was too. You know, ""You gotta try this."" [laughter] So I was probably pressuring other people for sure. 
AS: So you’re smoking pot, at this point you’re thirteen, fourteen…
MS: Yeah, thirteen or fourteen and once I kind of broke through smoking pot when other drugs became available, I didn't have that same resistance or hesitance. I just tried it. So speed was available, and not that much else. There was LSD. Sometimes. 
AS: Who were you getting it from? These college kids, when they came home?
MS: You know, there would always be someone in town, usually an older guy. [laughter]. And there was just a group of people who used drugs and a larger group who didn't in the high school. The people who did, they just somehow got it from somebody, I don't know. There were dealers that some people knew. When I was younger, I didn't know who or what and they would just kind of share and sell to each other basically. By fifteen, I am using just about anything and almost everyday. So, it just really quickly went to daily. I would say it wasn't absolutely every day but pretty much every day.
AS: How was it at home? Did your parents know?
MS: My parents really didn't notice initially. I don't know how that is. I did everything I could to avoid them knowing and to prevent them from knowing, that's for sure. I didn't want them to know and I lied a lot. When you are that age and you are staying out late with older people, you gotta have a reason to be out every night after school. And I was still on sports teams, so I was usually gone anyway for that and I wasn't missing most practices and I wasn't missing school at this point. But I came up with all of these other reasons and things that I would be doing later in the evening. Early on that wasn't that hard because I wasn't staying out past curfew or anything. Then I did later, as a junior or senior start to do that. And there wasn't much in the way of them controlling that. I just kept doing it. 
It was usually a combination of things. Once in a while you would get caught and just drink or just smoke pot, but in general, it was a combination of substances and again, just kind of in small groups. And every now and then we would get up to Rochester, of course a bigger town where more drugs are available and probably more dealers. But it was usually still within this same, well-known group that that occurred. And with that, I had summer jobs, but until I was over sixteen I really couldn't drive. So I couldn't really get a job. We had a minor allowance. I had to start finding a way to get drugs or get money, so illegal stuff fairly early on to do so. 
AS: What would you do, like steal stuff?
MS: Yeah, steal stuff or sell it. The first time we took the whiskey from the parents' supply in the kitchen. That next summer I had gotten a job loading trap at the local gun club. The guy who picked us up to go to the gun club had this really old rusted out station wagon and he always brought the booze out to the gun club. So he would carry in the cases of beer and cases of whiskey, whatever, into the gun club. It was part of the job. It didn't occur to me at the time because I was younger, it was like the seventh or eighth grade. At this later point when I started drinking, thirteen or fourteen, was when I realized that.... 
No, so this is what happened. I was hiking... this would be early spring, late winter. I am in boy scouts and there are three of us out on a hike. We're out on the root river and we've got one 22-caliber rifle, a single shot. Once in a while we were shooting something. We're just hiking along the riverbed and it was a really unusual day. The river ice was breaking up. There were these giant chunks of ice floating down the river. This is the same Rick that I drank with the first time. So he and I tell my brother Brian, who is also with us, we give him the 22 and we hang out from this oak branch that’s out over the river waiting for a big chunk to come off and we dropped on top of it. The two of us-- Brian stayed on shore. Brian then threw us a big stick so we could control it. [laughter] This is a big chunk of ice, probably not quite as wide as this room but pretty close. At least how I remembered it. We picked it because it was so big. The river of course was swelling because of the melt-off and I had never seen this before. I haven't seen it since. It was really a remarkable day. We're going down the stream, not fast, but we're moving decent. We realize that every time we move the ice chunk with our stick to try and control it, we just go slower than in the current. So we toss our stick, so we eliminate the only control we have for navigating this thing. We're going along... it was a long straight section where we started, so we're just thinking, ""This is great."" 
We come around a bend and there is this chunk of ice, a dam of ice chunks across the river. They look kind of smaller than ours. Ours is just big so we thought that we'll just hit this and we'll go right through that dam. That was our discussion. It was limited to that. We're right in the middle of the river at this point, the river is wider than this room. We hit that dam of ice chunks and ours starts to go under. I can still remember these little ice chunks going out from under our feet as we're trying to run across them to get to shore. We went towards the shore that Brian was on, I think it was just closer, it wasn't that far. Maybe here to that wall, ten feet at most. All of the sudden it all breaks through, just as we're reaching a four foot bank of mud. Luckily, there were tree roots in that bank of mud and both of us managed to grab those roots. We're soaking wet, we crawl up the mud, we get out, and it doesn't even occur to us that we almost died. We're just like, ""Wow, that was exciting!"" [laughter]. 
The reason for this story is that we get up... We were meeting my mom, who dropped us off, and we were meeting her at Low Water Bridge to start the hike at the Gun Club. That's a nice spot for pick up. We were just going to go down the river, but we're on the wrong side now. Usually there is a place where we could cross near the gun club. It's maybe a third of a mile across a field from the gun club. It is usually really shallow. But because of the swelling it was much deeper. Brian is up above his knees, we're all really cold. It is melting. It is not warm out. So we're probably close to hypothermia, soaking wet. It is getting towards late afternoon, so we're briskly getting up to the gun club. Because I'm freezing and we're there early... My mom wasn't going to be there for some time. We didn't have cell phones or anything. We were just counting on a specific time. 
I remembered that when I worked there, the back window by the backdoor, this tiny little window, little tiny back porch, a few steps up to this 3 x 5 back porch where the kitchen was, this window was unlocked. It was broken. I remembered that for some reason when I worked there. So I say, ""Let's see if that thing opens."" We can go in and get heated up, we can warm up. So I try the window, which is up above and it was open. So I crawl through, open the door for those guys, we all go in and we turn the heat on and the ovens on. Everything we could to get heat and warmed up. We took our clothes off and hung them over the deep fat fryer. I realized I can break into the gun club, but this is meaningless to me at that time besides that we got warmed up and my mom comes and we're all dry, basically. She didn't even notice. We don't tell her the story of course. Why tell her this story? [laughter]
AS: “We had a great hike, mom” [laughter].
MS: I know, we did. [laughter] So at this later point, I had met this older guy. He was a year older than me, not that much older. He was more worldly, let's just put it that way. He had drank, at least more than I ever had, and he was on the varsity football team. He knew all these older guys. So, we're hanging around. I don't even remember how this all even started. But we're hanging around together. He lives in a trailer home, only with his mom. His mom works every day. So, it was just us. We're trying to figure out how we can get some alcohol and it suddenly strikes me that we can go out to the gun club and break in. Which I've done before! And it doesn't even occur to me that this is really stupid and illegal, and I shouldn't do it. It was more just like, ""Oh, we can get some alcohol."" My family had a canoe. So, we grab the canoe, bring it down to Lake Forest right down in Stewartville, paddle up the river to behind the gun club. This is summer now. The same sort of spot where we were going to cross that day. We stopped there and got out. We worked our way up through some trees into this final open field to get to the back patio at the gun club with the broken window. It's open. It isn't locked. So, I do the same thing. I crawl in, I open the door, I let Al in. We each grab a case of beer, close the door, race across the open field. It was easier for him than it was for me, running across this open field with a case of beer as this tiny little, skinny kid. We hide in the trees and go down by the river where the canoe is and we each have a beer or two, I guess. Then we decide we're going to save it all for that night because he's got a plan to get all of these older guys together and we'll drink beer. I think this is fantastic. So, we paddle back into town and we hide the beer back in the bushes by the football field and get the canoe back to my folks’ house. 
There's a little traveling carnival in town. This really funny little carnival. It was a hot and humid summer night and the carnival is in town, so we meet all of these older guys. He and I go and get the beer and bring it there. They have cars. Neither of us do. So they think this is wonderful, free beer. Not only is it beer, it’s free beer. There are two cases. So, they grab that and they grab Al and ditch me. Because why would you want this little kid along anyway? So I am devastated and just go home. But it kind of cemented in me that I did drink enough to have that same feeling again. And it was like, why would you have to pay to feel like this?
AS: So you justified it, in your brain.
MS: Oh yeah. And it kind of remained that way. I mean I did pay for drugs and alcohol when I had to, but as much as I could, I didn't. It became this really strange pattern. Anyway. I was on the basketball team. It must have been in eighth grade and I was playing well enough that I could be on the junior varsity. Practice was going really well, and I did a lot of basketball in the front yard. I was in a car accident. I was with a friend... it couldn't have been eighth grade, I would have had to have been older. I'm jumping around a bit… 
AS: It’s okay, that’s what memory does to us.
MS: My friend was driving. He was older than me. Wayne was older than me. We went to a party and there was a keg and sweet corn, which is not that uncommon. We had one beer each. So just one beer. It was his car. We had heard about another party where there were more kids our age that we knew. In particular, there were some girls that we knew. So, we decide, let's go there. Wayne is driving on a country road that neither of us know. We don't really know where we are when trying to find this party. We come over a hill and it is dark. When we come back down there is a T in the road, right in front of us. He tried to make the corner. It was gravel roads. He didn't and we rolled through a really steep ditch. I broke my collarbone. And no seatbelts, so we bounced all over as we rolled and then we landed on the wheels. I didn't notice it initially, I was just in shock I think. And then all of the sudden I realized, ""Man"", I didn't realize it was my collar bone, but it was really painful. So, we get back in the car. It was a really steep ditch, it had to be six to ten feet that we were down in this thing. He is rocking back and forth, rocking back and forth and then he just guns it and we somehow... he tried a couple times and we didn't get out... so suddenly he just really guns it and we fly up on the road, right over the road into the other ditch right on the other side. [laughter] 
AS: No way.
MS: This time, the car goes in and it is stuck. It is not coming out [laughter]. So, we walk to a farm house and we get a ride into town from the family who drop us off downtown in Stewartville, but I am in need of medical care and there is nothing in Stewartville. None of these older guys agree to bring me to the hospital. It's pretty late at night at this point... 
AS: And where are your parents?
MS: I've been drinking, even though I had just had one beer… 
AS: Oh, you didn’t want your parents to even know you’d had one beer.
MS: Right. Right, I didn't want to tell anybody. And finally, I am desperate, so I tell a police officer. He must have smelled beer. He is really strict and angry about it. He agrees to take me up to Mayo, St. Mary's Hospital. He just dropped me off at the ER. Doesn't ever mention the beer or anything, but he just brings me there and drops me off. So I get the collarbone X-rayed and set, and then my parents get involved because I am at the hospital. I end up at home. The beer never gets mentioned by anybody. [laughter] But that fall, between the start of school and Christmas that year, I was in six car accidents. I was driving in two of them. By the end of it, I was absolutely frightened to go in car, except for my father's. 
AS: Six car accidents?
MS. Six. Yeah. 
AS: With people your age?
MS: Yeah. All people my age.
AS: Were they impaired while they were driving?
MS: A couple of times. A couple completely unimpaired.
AS: Wow, that’s incredible.
MS: Yeah, It was awful. Yeah, so my girlfriend at the time, he parents said that she could not date me. I was just a ""whatever"", I don't know, I was dangerous. And I couldn't even go in a car, I really couldn't. Actually, Wayne, the guy that was driving in that episode, he convinced me that we gotta go skiing. We were going to drive over to Lake City to Frontenac’s Ski Area, this little tiny place, and I just said, ""I can't do it."" I had been putting it off for a couple weeks because I just couldn't get in a car. I was too scared to get in a car. And finally, I said, ""Okay, if I drive, I'll go."" And I drove like thirty miles per hour [laughter] even slowing down around corners and hills. He was like, ""We're never even going to get there."" He finally just got mad and said he had to drive because I was going so slow. So, he drove and I managed to somehow get there without being too freaked out by it. 
So then, that is right in the middle of getting high all the time, which kind of relieves some of that. At that age, all you can do is go get high in a car. That's what we did. We would just go drive around the country and stop some place and drink and get high. It was always in cars. 
AS: Right. And therefore, accidents.
MS: Well you would think so, but it was just that one four-month period. No more after that. Even though I was way more intoxicated... yeah. That's my life basically. And ultimately, one Christmas vacation my senior year, somebody I knew... I can't remember who. But they were dealing speed and he asked me if I wanted to help him out. So, I said, ""Sure."" I had no money again, like usual. By doing so, if I sold it for this price, I would either get a little bit of money out of it and pay him this amount, or I could have some of the speed. So, I did both, kind of somehow. I paid him what I owed him. But I was doing speed consistently for Christmas break, so for maybe two weeks. Which I had never done before. I would do it once in a while, but... 
AS: But now you had a steady supply.
MS: Yeah. And I ran out the day before school started and I didn't think that was a problem. I didn't know there was such a thing as amphetamine withdrawal. So, I get to school the next day and I am crashing. That's what they call it, crashing. I had no energy, I actually pretty much passed out in my precalculus class with my favorite teacher. I'm on my desk and I am just asleep, and I hear a yardstick slam on the desk and I just kind of look up momentarily and I just went right back out. So, he got me to the school nurse, which they still had. She sent me to the local doctor, Dr. Risser, who immediately sent me up to St. Mary's hospital again at Mayo. And they think I've either got encephalitis or meningitis. No one asks me anything about drugs or alcohol.
AS: No one asked you anything?
MS: Not a word. Not a single question. 
AS: So they do a spinal tap?
MS: Yeah, they did a spinal tap. And I don't know what is going on. I probably would not have said anything if they had asked, but I didn't know that amphetamine withdrawal did this to people.
AS: Right. And why would you tell them?
MS: So, I am just like, ""What the hell is going on with me?"" I thought it was the amphetamine, but I didn't know. So, I go through this whole thing. The spinal tap leaks, which was probably because I was so debilitated. It meant that I got these horrible headaches every time I sit up or stand up because it was dripping out, not a lot, but it was. When you get a spinal tap, if you lose a little bit of fluid, which because of the pressure differentiation, it causes really bad headaches. It stuck around for a while because of the leak. It should have gone away within a day or so. So, I can't sit up, I can't stand up, I gotta lay down or I'll get a terrible headache. And they sent me home because there was nothing wrong. They couldn't figure it out. Now I'm fine, except for the headache, which they caused! Right? [laughter] 
So, I go home... My mom would go out for whatever, go visit friends or go to the grocery store or something. I would call my friend Dave and have him pick me up. I would lay in his old Chevy and I would go out and get high with him and then try and get back before my mom got back and pretend that I had been there the whole time. This goes on for a little while, and then the headaches went away. But I told my mother that the headaches went away and I told the school that I was still at home. Then I just didn't go to school and it was great, until my folks figured it out and then I had to go to school. So I go to school.
AS: So at this point, you’ve never been caught by your parents?
MS: They... my dad gave me his old Volkswagen when he got a new car, and they found in it that fall, before this Christmas break, some kind of a pipe for smoking pot and some papers. So, they assumed I was smoking pot. I don't know what else they knew. 
AS: But did you get in trouble?
MS: I got in some trouble for that, but not much. It was like, not that big of a deal. So, yeah, they had no clue the extent of it. But they were getting increasingly concerned, I know that much. But it's a Finnish family, so they're not talking a whole lot. And I want nothing to do with talking, with them about anything, but certainly not about this. 
So, I am playing this game and I go to school finally, but I'm still getting high every day. But I'm attending at least. I had a physics class and I really enjoyed that, too. The teacher asked me to go to the board to do these problems the day before we had a test. I was the only one in the class who knew how to do them. And I'm up there writing them out... they were easy to do because I had done my homework the night before. I had done some speed the night before, it was the first time since this happened. I am at home, for some reason, I don't know why, so I did my homework. And I'm all prepared! I'm up at the board writing it all down the next day. 
That night I went out and got wasted smoking pot, no speed, I don't know if there was alcohol. I get to class the following day for the test, and the only thing that goes on my paper is my name. I cannot remember how to do the problems that I was up at the board doing the day before, because of the pot, you know. So, I am just ashamed of myself. My grades haven't really shifted much. I was always kind of bored at school, it wasn't that difficult. I didn't study, but I was always able to maintain them [grades]. Well, I couldn't. I couldn't even answer one question. I walked out of the class and I walked out of school and I was so ashamed. I just decided I wasn't going back. I didn't think it through that way, what I thought was ""I'm going to go get high and I am not going back."" 
AS: Right. You didn’t think you were ashamed.
MS: Yeah. I just left and it was over. I quit school that day without a declaration or anything. I just didn't go back. I told my parents I wasn't going to go back. I moved out of the house for a little bit, like two doors down at this older guy's basement. I had no money. 
AS: But did you have any fight with your parents, did they tell you you had to stay in school?
MS: Not really. 
AS: So, you were just like “I’m quitting school and I’m moving out.”
MS: Yeah, I think that was part of it. If I left, they couldn't do anything about it, right? So, I
just left. And this family had very little money and they let me in. But I had no money and I'm just a freeloader, so that didn't last long. So, I moved back home, but I am now adamant that I'm not going to school. I think that's when they realized that this is really trouble.  But it still goes on for quite a while before anything happens. And I am just dawn to dusk now. Until late at night, I am just getting high all the time and hanging out with people doing the same—like I said, I had to. But the shame and guilt is just massive. I can't stand myself. 
I don't know what's wrong. I don't know that it is the drugs and alcohol. In fact, I think that is the only relief I get. I really don't think that it is the problem. I think there is a big problem. I can't understand why I keep doing these things that I am so ashamed of, you know, stealing and lying. I've quit school, which I loved. I've been kicked out of sports by this point, which I really loved. And I don't know how to change any of this. I can't do anything about it, and that, I do not understand. I'm not really even able to have plans, I couldn't figure out how to do it. I didn't know. I didn't have a clue and I couldn't tell anybody. I didn't want anyone to know how awful I felt. 
And then I got home at four in the morning one night and my mother wakes me up with the local doctor, Dr. Riser. All I remember him saying is, ""Yeah, he's on something."" and then I passed back out. And I ran home from a friend's house that night at like four in the morning because I had been drinking and smoking pot and I had done some speed and I was scared I would not fall asleep if I didn't run home. I drank a lot to be sure that I could pass out, which was kind of what I had become. That was my pattern, to try and pass out so I wouldn't lay there and think about myself, because it was so painful. So, I get home and I pass out. At six, they wake me up. I am barely conscious. I go back out and I don't know when, but I wake up and the local minister and my mom wake me up and they say, ""We're going to the hospital."" And I... I was just out of it. It doesn't even occur to me that this is unusual. I just put my clothes on, like, ""Okay, we're going to the hospital."" I wasn't going to talk to them or ask them questions. [laughter]. So I get in the car and we drive, Stewartville is just south of Rochester. We drive to Rochester, thinking we're going to Mayo, that's where we always get our healthcare, but we don't. We go pick my dad up at IBM. And then, we go north towards the Twin Cities. And that's just weird. 
AS: And you’re like, what’s going on?
MS: Well no, not really. I am in this debilitated state. Just kind of intoxicated and wiped out. I learned later that the minister was right behind me in the car, thinking that if I jumped out, they would be able to grab me. Which at the time, hadn't even crossed my mind. I'm not even thinking, let alone acting. So, we get to Minneapolis/St. Paul and I'm thinking, ""I wonder why we are going to a hospital in the Twin Cities."" Those are the only thoughts I'm having. Yeah, I was not thinking clearly or much. Then we get passed the Twin Cities and that's when I got really frightened. Because in my understanding of what was going on with me, I just thought I was going crazy. That was my high school understanding of my behavior. I am just going crazy and that they finally figured it out. And now they are taking me to a sanitarium in the North Woods.
AS: Oh right, you think you’re going to a mental hospital?
MS: Right, yeah. I don't know what it is. I've never been to one, but I am just assuming that must be what they do with people like me. But they kind of did! They brought me here! [laughter] Not really, but you know. 
AS: No, but in your mind—yeah, what is this place? And here would be Hazelden.
MS: Yeah, I had never heard of Hazelden when we drove down the driveway and I saw the sign. I was like, ""What the hell is a Hazelden?"" 
AS: And the year is?
MS: 1974. Yeah. Right before Easter.
AS: And how old are you?
MS: I am seventeen. Yeah, they put me in a room with a counselor, who is the first person who I have ever met in my life that actually knows what is going on with me. It is just uncanny to me. I am shocked by this. He knew addiction, right? And I didn't. So, I am just wondering who told him this, because I never tell my parents any of this, they couldn't have told him this. No one could have told them this, I know that much. But he knows me somehow. He knows what I have been going through and what I have been doing, in this really unusual way. And he is really pleasant and likable. And he kind of knows me. So, I tell him some things that I have never told anyone. Not much, but at least a little bit that I am clearly an addict in his mind. And he said, ""Okay."" and we finished the interview and we go out to meet my parents and there are a bunch of other people and they say that I've got to sign these papers, so I can stay and get treatment for chemical dependency, which was the terminology of the day. 
And I say, because I am not staying here because I realize I am not going to do this, I probably thinking that I wouldn't get high today, I think I was. But it was mostly like, I do not want to stop getting high. I certainly don't want to stay here. I have never even heard of this. And it's a threat in a way. 
AS: Oh, absolutely.
MS: In a big way. So, I refuse. And this is when my bluff was called because I don't think they could have done this, but my dad says, ""If you don't sign the papers, we're all going to meet in court and you will be forced in here."" I don't believe that it could have happened, cause when I got into training later, that wasn't even possible in the Eighties. No. No, but I'm thinking when he said that, the last thing I want is to be in any legal situation, in court. You've got to be kidding! I'm a drug addict! 
AS: Right. What else could they find out about you?
MS: Right. I can't admit to this. So, I can't go to court. So, I say ""Okay."" and I sign the papers and I stay. And I am put on the men's unit, in the original farm house that Hazelden started in, in 1949. 
AS: That little white house?
MS: Yeah. That was a unit. This building wasn't here, but the parts that were left of the other buildings were built in 1969. So, I am here in 1974, but they were still using the original farm house as a men's unit. That's where they put me. And I find out later that, that unit, called ""The Old Lodge"" was for people who had multiple treatments and really hardcore addicts. And they put me there because they didn't know what to do with a seventeen-year-old. Because, five years later, I find out I was the first adolescent to ever be treated here. And that's where they put me. So, I am with all of these older guys, I am the youngest by a long shot. And I argue that I don't belong there at all.  
AS: You spent time doing that?
MS: Yeah, well, two weeks. It wasn't a lot of time.
AS: Oh, you were only here for two weeks?
MS: I was here for four weeks, but the first two I argued. You know, ""I do not belong here, I don’t have this chemical dependency."" I still have the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous that they gave me, and the Twelve by Twelve, the twelve steps and twelve traditions. In the margin of the first step in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, I have these little cryptic notes about why I don't belong here, why I'm not an alcoholic. 
AS: That’s incredible. [laughter].
MS: Yeah. [laughter] It is. So, every day we would have to fill out something called a significant events sheet, just something we learned today or something we had experienced today. And every day, mine was why I don't belong here. I am making my argument day in and day out, based on the books and my experience and what people say. And I am fairly bright guy, and I am writing this up every day. And every morning, there was an intercom system that would say, ""Marvin Seppala, please come to the unit office."" [laughter] And It's my councilor, who sits me down to talk over my argument with me. It was never a bullying thing or us butting heads, he is just suggesting that my argument is not right. And he is doing it in a way that makes sense, but I just don't care and I don't belong here anyways, so I'm not going to listen. 
This is the wonderful thing about group therapy for addiction, actually, is that in the midst of this resistance on my part that I might be an addict, that I can't even see, I can absolutely see it in everyone else in the group. I mean they are describing it. Even if they believe it or not, I can see it. I mean, they have given all of these examples, you know? They've described their life and they should be here because of what they have been doing. And they're a lot older, but they have lost their jobs, they have lost families, and all of these things. And I can see it in them. And then it finally starts to dawn on me that all of these examples that I am using about them are the same examples in my life, you know. Whether they have pointed it out or my councilors have pointed it out, or that I have thought it through, which was not much. It is exactly the same. It finally occurred to me. I go to my councilor and tell him that I finally believe that I have this chemical dependency, whatever that is, and that I have to do something about it, and he kicked me out of his office. He said, ""You finally realized the only way out of here."" [Laughter] Which truly wasn’t the case. 
AS: But he thought you were pulling one over on him, he didn’t believe you at that point because you had been arguing so, so smartly.
MS: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was like that one day and then the next day it was like, ""Wait a minute."" So, I talked to my peers and they were like, ""Well it does seem like you kind of changed your tune about this."" So, they just took me in, and they had all along. Which was the most amazing thing about being here, is that they accepted me, which wasn't happening much in my life. They understood what I was going through, which I wasn't telling anybody. Not even my closest friends understood me. And they valued what I said, which wasn't happening with anyone I knew. And they validated my experience, which I couldn't even understand because I didn't know what I was doing or why. They understood that and validated that for me. They cared about me. That is what got my attention. 
In addition to that, the other counselor on the unit was Ed Jergins. He was this really big, bald, Scandinavian. And my dad and my grandfather are both bald Scandinavians, so I wanted nothing to do with Ed. He scared me. My father and my grandfather were pretty mean, stoic, Finns, right? So, I assume he is exactly the same. He is bigger than those two. So, I stay away from him. Then, I'm in group, and this was before that I even figured out that I had this. Ed is sitting there and his eyes are closed and I assume this old guy is sleeping. He was all drooped. He is supposed to be the councilor and he looks like he is fast asleep. This guy is talking about his marriage and how he wants to get a divorce, and all of the sudden, Ed starts talking from this position. He raises his head and starts to open his eyes and he has heard every single bit of this. He wasn't sleeping at all. And he expresses this most incredible statement about this guy. Just this really supportive statement and then talks to the whole group in this incredibly loving manner and then he starts talking about love, which I have never heard a male talk about in my life. And that got my attention. It was unbelievable. 
Then after witnessing him do this a few times, and I realize that he talks about spirituality and love all the time, and that, I wanted that. I didn't want to get sober, but I wanted that. Then I wanted that and I wanted to get sober. And I was also starting to experience whatever that was from those guys who were really serious about getting sober too, at least the small group of guys I would stay up at night with and talk about things with. Which was just amazing. We’d talk about life, really, for the first time in my life. I had a few friends that I could do that with on occasion, but it almost wasn't even real. It was during this period in my life where I was just getting high all the time, so I'm just a mess anyways. I don't know what I was saying or thinking. Sometimes I felt like there was really a bond there with Ed and with this group. So, I really decided that I've got to do something. But that wasn't enough. 
I was scared to leave, because four weeks really isn't enough. It goes by quick. And it was four weeks, whether you needed it or not. It was twenty-eight days back then, and that was it. There was no follow up of any kind for a seventeen-year-old in Rochester, Minnesota. They told me to go to AA. This is the only thing, this is it. There wasn't anything else. There really wasn't anything else in 1974. So, they told me to go to AA, and they would have anyway, but that was the only thing. And there is no AA in Stewartville. So, I get back. They get me back into high school and back into my house with my family. I wasn't really out of the house, that was part of the deal, I would live at home. I went back to school and they told me not to hang out with my old friends because they are all using. So, this is a long time in the early part of my life... 
AS. That’s okay. We’re good if you’re good. 
MS: Good deal, okay. So, I go to school and it's a small town and a small school. One hundred in my graduating class. The people who I am not supposed to hang out with, I just stay away from. I am trying to do it. And the people who don't use drugs, especially, they want nothing to do with me. And there were all of these rumors about where I had gone and what I had done. Just wild rumors. People had told their kids to stay away from me. You know, it was a small town. So, I am kind of ostracized. 
AS: You are alone.
MS: Yeah, I was alone. And it hit me rather quickly. I was already sensitive to such things anyway, and I never really felt like I had belonged that much. I had some friends that were kind of close, but very few and they were all using, so I couldn't hang out with them anyway. But on the weekend before I left, that prior week before I left treatment, I really worried about going home. I don't know that I am ready. I am just really scared but I just really want to leave. Both are going through my head. And I see an ad for a Marshall Tucker Band concert in the Twin Cities. So, I decide, that is a great idea, which is really the last thing I should be doing because I had never gone to a concert without being wasted. Somehow, I don't know how it happened, I think it was after I got home, I convinced my best friend using Dave, that we should go see Marshall Tucker. And this is after these few days of trying to be alone, I decide I am going to go to something with Dave and go see Marshall Tucker. So, we get tickets. 
As we are driving to Minneapolis/St Paul, he is driving, and smoking pot and drinking. And I am sitting there and telling him all about treatment and why I can never use again. I am like lecturing the whole way to Minneapolis/St. Paul and I tried also to convince him, because he is my best friend who is doing exactly what I do, that he has to stop as well, right? So, he doesn't buy that at all. He doesn't argue with me because most of what I am saying seems to make sense to him, just not for him. It does for me but not for him. So, we get to the concert, we meet some other people there. And there's pot being passed up and down the row and a joint comes by and I took it and smoked it. I took some, and then more, and then had some beer, and I don't know what else. I was just right back to where I was, just like that. Not any thought about it. Didn't even feel bad about it until later. When we get in the car and we're going back, I finally realize what I have done. I think I was trying to convince myself in telling Dave not to let anybody know that this has happened. That was how I was all along anyway.
I tried so hard to not let anyone know about this, so I could live this double life of getting good grades, at least when I was in school, until I quit, and getting still high. So, I'm telling him that he can't tell anybody. And I am kind of thinking that I won't keep doing this. But it was over. I was right back at it the next day with him. And everything I had told him on the way up was like a distant memory. I was just off and running. I got to go through the graduation ceremony with my class but I didn't get a diploma. I did go to school until graduation. I showed up. They even let me on the track team and I was pretending to.... I was smoking cigarettes and pot and drinking. I was a mess. 
AS: Did your parents ever clue in that you were using again?
MS: They really figured it out and they disowned me and kicked me out. They told me they wouldn't pay for my education.
AS: When was that?
MS: Just a few weeks after the graduation ceremony. So, in June. They got me a job with our next-door neighbor who was a contractor and I quit going. I never quit a job and I never got fired, I just never showed up. So, I had some other job after they booted me out at Crenlo that built tractor cabs in Rochester. When they kicked me out, I took my Volkswagen, threw my stuff in it and moved to Rochester. You can call that a move when you drive eleven miles without a place to land and just bum from friend to friend and live out of the car. I got this job at Crenlo and then I quit going there. Every time I would just some money and get high and not go back. I had no thoughts about a future, really. I just assumed I was going to die really young. I didn't think I would survive. Not graduating from high school was kind of meaningless, in spite of the fact that I had been to treatment. That was the only thing-- like I said, I hated lying in bed without being able to fall asleep. Well, it was even worse now, because I knew there was another way for me. Morning and evening were really bad. 
I failed to mention that my girlfriend at the time, Linda, came to treatment and visited me. And so did Wayne, the guy in that car accident. They were the only two people. She was the only girl who came to visit, besides my family. And she and I were dating afterwards as well. She didn't know what to make of all of this. She thought I shouldn't use because of what I had been told, but she didn't know anything about it either, except what I told her, basically. Which when I was in treatment, was pretty accurate. So, I'm kind of living with her more than the other people at the time. My dad was at IBM, so I knew they wouldn't give me a job. Mayo and IBM were the two primary employers. So, I go to Mayo and I apply to be a janitor and they sent me away. They didn't have a job. I lied and said I graduated from high school. 
Two weeks later, they called my mom and got a hold of Linda who found me, and they said to go back in for an interview. They sent me over to a cardiovascular research lab where I am hired by David Donald, who is this world-famous physiologist, as a lab technician. So, the way I look at this, I said I was attracted to Ed and his discussions of love and spirituality, and the same discussions I had with people in treatment. I look at it as even before I started to care for myself, I was being cared for in really miraculous ways. I get into treatment when I was seventeen, when I shouldn't even be there. Then, I get this job. I stayed sober for five days after treatment. That was it. I get this job and I stayed sober for two weeks. And my intent was just to stay sober. I tried as hard as I could and it lasted two weeks. 
On the first day on the job, it was an animal surgery lab, so we were studying a lot about hypertension and its causes and cardiac function and stuff. People from all over the world came to work under Dr. Donald and John Shepard, who were the two leaders of the lab that I was assigned to. Dr. Donald is this eccentric old physiologist. He was trained as a veterinarian, but he became a physiologist and helped invent the heart-lung machine. John Shepard was the president of the American Heart Association at the time and he was on the board of governors and the board of trustees at the Mayo Clinic. He was really one of the top administrators, the top docs in the whole place, and famous world-wide for research. So, suddenly, there is this drug addict working in their lab. On the first day that I was there... 
AS: Who’s eighteen?
MS: At this time I had turned eighteen. At the end of the day when they were orienting me to the job, it wasn't them, it was the other technicians, one of the technicians said, ""And there's the drug cabinet and you have to make sure that it is locked at the end of the day."" [laughter]
AS: That was your job to make sure it was locked?
MS: Yeah, it was one of my jobs. Yeah, and I'm thinking, there's no one that is going to pay more attention to that cabinet. So, I last two weeks and we were studying cocaine. I was weighing out cocaine for experiments. Cocaine is a vasoconstrictor and it does it in a very specific manner. We were studying how veins and arteries constricted and cocaine helped us to understand that process, physiologically to figure it out. So, I took some. Then I just took more and more, and over a few-weeks-period, I am just addicted to cocaine, in a way that I have never been addicted to anything. I am using a lot of it because I can just grab it out of the cupboard. It's right back to something that isn't being paid for.
AS: And it’s not being monitored?
MS: No one is monitoring it. I am the only one monitoring it. There is no monitoring of any kind. 
AS: Did you ever find out how you got this job?
MS: No. I have no idea. Dr. Shepard was out of the country when Dr. Donald hired me. So, he hired me.
AS: But you had applied to be a janitor?
MS: I did, I applied to be a janitor. So, actually, the day I started is when they told me about the drug cabinet. The next day, second day at work, I realize that I have got to tell them that I haven't graduated from high school. I didn't tell Dr. Donald, I went to the HR department and said, ""I haven't graduated from high school."" I didn't say that I lied, but I did. I made up another lie about why I didn't, this big family problem of some sort of why I missed half of my senior year. I don't mention that I went to addiction treatment or anything. They still give me the job. They didn't even balk. They we're just like, ""It's okay."" 
I don't have a clue how this happened. I knew no one who worked at Mayo, no one in my family. I can only say again that I think I was being taken care of. So, I just plummet with my addiction and I miss a week of work. Which doesn't seem like a lot, but I knew they warned me that I had a three-month probationary period. They could fire me or I could just leave, no questions asked. Which I kind of liked, because that is how I left jobs anyways, but I didn't know that I was going to like this job. It turns out from the first moment I walked into that lab, I loved this job. It was like unbelievable to me. I was stimulated in a way that I hadn't ever been in my whole life. 
AS: And you were just mostly cleaning things up, and helping? But around things you were interested in.
MS: Well, yeah. I had to assist in surgery on animals, mostly dogs but sometimes cats. I would stand right across from the doctor or some fellows from all over the world. I was either assisting a fellow or Dr. Donald. One or the other. And they would tell me about the experiments and they would tell me what we were doing and why. It was just fascinating to me. I wanted to learn about it. Physiology, I found really interesting. It explains things, right? I just found it incredible and I really liked these people too. They cared about me. It was somewhat similar to my experience in treatment, but remarkably, there wasn't really anything at an interpersonal level, but it was in a way because it was more about knowledge. But they also cared about me in other ways, like how come I'm not seeking college? And what do you think about going on to school someday? Even at the very beginning. 
Dr. Donald in the interview asked me how long I would commit to the lab. I remember this question because that prior summer, I had gone to a recruiting thing in the Twin Cities with a friend to join the army. I was so desperate. The Vietnam War was over, but it was still a mess. They put us up in a hotel and of course we just drank and goofed off. I had a physical the next day and in the physical, my hearing was inadequate. I had hearing loss that I didn't know about until that moment. So, they told me that I would have to sign a release if I wanted to be in the army because they didn't want to cover my hearing. So, I just couldn't imagine that. For some reason, that stopped me. I didn't want to sign this release. But Dave went into the army. My best friend. So, I tell Dr. Donald that I just recently looked into going into the army for two years, so I'll stay two years. That was as far as I could think about my life. You've gotta be kidding me, how long am I going to stay here?? Two years. I told him the story even, I just looked into going into the army but I couldn't because I have a hearing loss and I couldn't do it without a release and I didn't think that was wise. So, it turns out that he was in the Royal Airforce. He didn't tell me that then, I learned it later. 
Way later, at that talk that you said you were watching, after I gave that talk and I walked behind the stage, and a woman from Mayo's development department, a young woman, came up to me. I had just seen Saturday Night for the second time ever. And she tells me that my father and I have just bought Dr. Donald's old house, that he had died and had donated his house to Oxbow Park in Biren, Minnesota, just outside of Rochester, because it was right adjacent from the park. He is a really eccentric guy. He just lived out in the woods and he was really odd that way. She said that we're going to turn it into a halfway house. She said because my father is in recovery and he wants to do that and I am going to help him with this because it is really important to me as well. And Dr. Donald was in recovery from alcoholism. Well, he wasn't in recovery when I met him because on rare occasion, he had a terrible tremor in the morning doing surgery. I noticed it just a few times, but somehow, we connected. Most of these fellows came there to work under him and John Shepard, but none of them could really get along with him. And I got along with him fantastic. 
Somehow, he hires me. I have no clue. I always tell people that I think he was playing a joke on John Shepard because Shepard was out of the country. I never saw him out of three-piece suit. He's like Mr. Clean. Dr. Donald wore a white lab coat and had white athletic tape around his shoes holding them together. He is just this eccentric, brilliant guy. So, I always thought, ""What the hell, he just hired me so he could give Shepard a hard time with this hippy drug-addict kid."", that he didn't know was a drug addict at the time. I had long hair, I didn't look like anyone else in the lab. [laughter] And there I was. 
AS: So, you miss a week of work?
MS: Yes, I miss a week of work and I am so scared to lose the job, I am getting desperate. 
AS: Were you taking cocaine home with you?
MS: Yeah, I had a big supply that I grabbed. So, I was gone but I still had a supply. My folks had disowned me. I didn't get back into the house for two years.
AS: Really? That’s hardcore.
MS: Yeah. After a while, it was both parties’ kind of contributing. Like, I wasn't going to go back there either. There was no invitation either. 
AS: That’s hard.
MS: Yeah, it was. It was also probably good for my siblings because I was stealing from them too. I was just a disaster. And I was certainly not being the role model of the kind that they needed. I never talked to my father, but in this desperation, I called him, which still kind of surprises me when I say it even. I tell him exactly what is going on. I am stealing cocaine from the Mayo Clinic, I am scared I am going to lose this great job and I don't want to lose it, and I don't know what to do. He had, in the meantime since I had last seen him when he kicked me out, helped start this adolescent counseling center in Rochester and he was on the board of it. It was for kids with drug and alcohol problems. 
AS: Really?
MS: Yeah. It was called Sunrise. He says, ""I'll meet you tonight and we'll talk about this."" I tried to put it off because I didn't want to talk to him. I would call, but that was as far as I was going to go. And I am thinking, if I meet him tonight, then... I can't use. So, I don't want to meet him tonight. Somehow, I agreed. We meet and then he brings me to Sunrise and he says that I can talk to somebody there about this. And he knows that he is not the right person, too. I meet Jane, a counselor, who talks to me and I go back the next night and I don't do any cocaine. And I go back the next night, and I don’t do any cocaine, and I realize that this place just opened and that she was a social worker. I learned that later when she worked at Hazelden and so did I. [laughter] But I realized that I know more about she does about addiction. More than anyone there does, just from my one month of treatment, I know way more than they know. And, in treatment, they told me the only thing that is going to work is going to AA and I have not done that. So, I go there one night that first week and I tell them that this is not going to work for me. I don’t think this is going to work for me. I didn't tell them that I think I know more about it than they do… I felt like I did. I think I actually did, honestly. I am going to go to AA like they told me to when I was in treatment. 
[End of Part I, beginning of Part II]
MS: So, I say that I am going to go to AA. And I am sure they are thinking that this guy is not going to AA, right? They think that I am just going to go get high again and then he is gone. And I didn't go back, so they never found out actually, until I met her much later. 
AS: So, did you start going to AA? 
MS: I did. I went to an AA meeting that Sunday morning in this club house, the only one that I was aware of at the time in Rochester. I don't think there was another one. It was on Third Avenue. There were three guys there over seventy. 
AS: That was their group? 
MS: That was the group I walked into. Yeah, and I don't know what they said, I cannot remember. But I went back the next Sunday.
AS: There was only one a week? 
MS: That's all that was recommended. Once a week. That’s what people did back then. 
AS: So, we're in the state of Minnesota in 1974... 
MS: 1974... No, 1975... 
AS: And there is one... 
MS: No, it was '74 still. 
AS: Okay, still. 1974 or 1975, here we are... 
MS: And people went to one AA meeting a week. That is what they did and that is what they told me. Come on back next week. That is how you went to AA then. 
AS: Interesting, that is a new thing for me to know. 
MS: That was reinforced over time too. If things are really, really bad, maybe you go to another one. Maybe you call your sponsor and talk to people. But you couldn't really go to another one. 
AS: This is something that I will have to look up again, to understand when did it become that you should go every day.
MS: Because I moved around with school, you know, so all the sudden I was in places where people went a lot. I didn't know about that transition. 
AS: Yeah, me either. I'll let you know when I find out. [laughter]
MS: So, I go back and these guys... I mean, I felt really connected with these guys. It was that same description in treatment. They understood me, they accepted me, they validated me, they valued what I had to say. I hardly talked, but they listened. They supported me and cared for me in ways that I was completely lacking. I hadn't had experience with it, so I went back. And whatever I wasn't getting at Sunrise, I got at AA that morning. I know I got it. I got there out of pure desperation. I called my dad, I went to this Sunrise place. I walk into AA, which I was supposed to do after treatment months before. 
AS: Right, but how would you have been able to do that given where you were? You went right back home. You were set up to fail. 
MS: Right. Right back to the home where everything went on and school where everything went on. So, AA was like an oasis or something for me. These people really understood me and really cared for me. The meeting grew rather quickly, so it came to be men and women. There were several women in this meeting. It never got big, twelve or fourteen people maybe. But there was a police officer, a real-estate agent, and a teacher. A couple of docs started showing up, a nurse was there. There was nobody my age. Nobody even close. So, I was going to AA, staying sober, working in the lab, and then trying to figure out what to do with myself. I was living with Linda by this time. I learned how to fly-fish with a guy who worked in a different lab. I always wanted to fly-fish for some reason. I was doing that a lot in the spring and summer, because I could. I did it by myself because I had no other friends my age, really. There were two other guys, one worked in the lab and one worked with the animals in the kennels and stuff that were close to my age. One was about my age and the other was a little bit older. So, they kind of became friends, but beyond that, I was mostly by myself and with Linda, trying to stay sober, going fishing or whatever. And the meeting grew and because I was so young, there was a lot of parenting in addition to everything else that goes on in AA. 
AS: For you? 
MS: Yeah, just because... because, I was a kid. 
AS: Group parenting. 
MS: Yeah, it was. It was great. I know in a lot of treatment now, it is important to separate adolescents from adults, but there's something to it. I really got a lot out of it. So, I am going weekly and I am going on six months. I am feeling better than I have in my life. My job is great. I am just having a ball at work, in a lot of ways. I am getting close to a couple of these fellows and I really enjoy my work and I really got it down. I am able to learn some stuff too. One thing that Dr. Donald did, two things: At the end of an experiment, after animal surgery, you know it is just a mess. So, my job is to clean it all up, right? And wash all of the instruments and prepare for the next day, for the next surgery. But, if he did the experiment or if it was in his lab, he stayed and did all of that with me or with the other technician. If he stayed, the fellows stayed. So, it was this whole group of people gets done really quick and everybody goes to their offices except us and we stay in the lab to go do other things, because there is a lot to do. And when he didn't stay, the fellows all disappeared too. There were no rules about this of any kind, but it was absolute. If he wasn't there, they didn't stay. He was remarkable that way. And then we had a Monday morning lab meeting, every Monday morning. And they would present their research and they would present their speeches they were about to give at conferences. They would just talk, have these remarkable discussions about physiology and about what they were doing and ideas. What else we can do? How can we solve this problem? For me, it was just fantastic. It was just fascinating. In one of the early meetings that I attended, Dr. Donald presented a talk he was about to give at a major medical conference. It was something about cardiac physiology. So, he presents the whole thing and usually when they presented, then everyone there, the six or seven people in the room, would start asking questions and commenting about the topic. He immediately stopped and then said, ""Marvin, what did you get out of my talk?"" And I'm like, ""What?"" I'm still... I have no self-confidence, I am really shy. I don't want to answer this question. But I do, I tell him what I got out of the talk, you know? I am wondering, why would he ask me? In the process of asking me, he engaged me. You know? I am a part of this team, which was amazing. I felt that, too. And after I said my answer, he said, ""That's good, I'm glad because I am going to be talking to a group of physicians that are not physiologists and I gotta be sure that I can explain it in a way that they will understand. And if you do, they will!"" [laughter] And I'm like, ""Wow. This is incredible."" I was valued in a way that I didn't expect. It was just an amazing experience. 
So, I am being influenced by science in the lab, but also by people and caring. And in AA I am being influenced by the Twelve Steps and love and spirituality, I think. My life grows in all of those spheres. I am six months in and, like I said, I am feeling better than I ever have in my life. I miss a Sunday morning. I just don't go. I didn't consciously decide not to go, I don't even know why I didn't go. I was just feeling so good I didn't go, thinking that I didn't really have to. Sunday, I miss. Monday, I open the cabinet, grab some cocaine and walk to the bathroom. And it wasn't even on my mind. There was no deliberate plan of any kind. What I didn't recognize in that moment, is that those three guys at the first meeting, had died in that six-month period. They were like these angels. They just disappeared. They died. And I didn't even think of it, it didn't even occur to me that this was an issue or a problem for me. I was so self-focused, so self.... I didn't go to funerals, I didn't even think of them, I didn't do anything because I didn't think it bothered me a bit. 
AS: But you knew that they had died? 
MS: Yeah. And There I was using. I didn't think that had anything to do with it. It took me years to figure out... which is weird to say that. 
AS: No, I think that is perfectly normal. 
MS: [laughter] Yeah, maybe that has something to do with it. So, I had been meaning to ask this guy John to be my sponsor. And the reason I hadn't is because I hadn't done anything besides just show up at the meeting. I didn't read about it, I didn't socialize with anyone, I didn't do any of the steps. 
AS: Was John one of the three?
MS: No, luckily. John was like thirty-five, I guess. He had five years sober and I always liked what he said. I just liked listening to him. He kind of talked from a similar spiritual perspective that I thought of. And so, I did the cocaine and I walked back into the lab and... this is the worst day of my life. Six-months and I am no longer sober, and to me, I tried treatment and that didn't work, my own efforts got me two weeks, and AA got me six. That doesn't work either. And they didn't tell me anything else that I could do. There is nothing else that works. There is nothing else. I don't know of anything else. I was never exposed to anything else. I think that I am hopeless. I did as much as cocaine as I possibly could, more than any other day in my life. I didn't even notice it because the pain was so bad of losing that, of what I had. So, I call John from the lab and he worked just a few blocks away in downtown Rochester. I didn't know that, but he said that he was just three blocks away from me. He said, ""Come on over to my office."" I lied and said, ""I can't, I have to stay and work until 5. So, I am doing as much cocaine as I can and this doesn't work. The pain doesn't go away. So, I go to his office at five o'clock. He has to coach his son's pee-wee football team out in Biren, so he asked me to follow him. So, we talked just really briefly and I just sit on the sideline and watch him coach football. Then we go to his house. I tell him what I just told you. I went to treatment, that didn't work. AA doesn't work either. And thank god, John says, ""You know Marv, AA works fine, you just haven't started."" And he said, ""You come to the meetings, but you're not working the steps, you're not reading the books, you're not talking to anybody, you're not sharing yourself with anybody. You need to start doing that. AA works fine. I'm proof."" 
So, I said, ""Okay."" And I did exactly what he said. I mean, when I say exactly, he gave me this worksheet. He went to Hazelden, too.  Which was also partially why I was attracted to him as a sponsor. This sheet was a ten-step inventory sheet. So, it had thirty-one days across the top and all of these columns and rows that had on one side, a list of liabilities, and the other side, a list of assets. The liabilities were like laziness, dishonesty.... they were listed there, like twenty or twenty-five adjectives. And then the assets were their opposites, basically. He said, ""Fill this out every night."" in addition to everything else that he told me to do. And I filled it out every night for five years, because I was so scared that I would relapse. And then it got so wrote I had to change it around. But, early on, in those first months, I had a black and white description of my behavior to look at. I was putting a ""X"" by dishonesty every single day, day in and day out. And lazy, and other things. I could see it. I didn't have a sense of my own behavior and that gave it to me. 
AS: What were you being dishonest about every day?
MS: Everything. I just couldn't be honest. I was so dishonest for so long that it was almost a ritual. Most of the time it didn't even make sense to be dishonest anymore, but I did. So, John, he kept telling me, ""You know Marv, this is an honesty program."" And that's all he would say. It wasn't done in a confrontative way, it was just, ""Marv, this is an honesty program."" And I would think, ""Well, why would you tell me that?"" [laughter] And he kept doing it. And finally, I realized, because I am looking this end, hearing this question, that I am always dishonest. It's time to do something about it. He was an ideal person for me. He never confronted me. I would tell him something going on in my life, like I'm having trouble with my girlfriend Linda, or whatever. And he would just tell me some story from his life. It would always have some connection to what I was talking about. But he wasn't analytical. You hear that a lot of people in AA are always just really, ""Go work Step Two."" or something, or go do that. It was never like that with John, it was just like, ""Well, this is what I did."" [laughter]
AS: That is really great. 
MS: And I think for an adolescent, if he would have been telling me what to do, I don't know what I would have done. He had kids just a little younger than me. He had a daughter that was maybe two years younger than me-- the oldest. And then maybe two sons after her. I don't know what he was like at home really, but I wasn't that much different that his own kids. 
AS: How long did you stay with him?
MS: I don't even remember. A long time.
AS: So, you stayed in Rochester? What did you end up doing? 
MS: So, I stayed in the lab and then these docs kept asking me what I was going to do with my life, suggesting that I go to school. Especially the fellows would talk like that with me. I got this envelope in the inner-clinic mail, you know? Those yellow envelopes. It was addressed to Dr. Marvin Seppala. I still have it actually. Someone just made a mistake and put that on there. And I had already been thinking that I liked what these guys do, and so I started thinking that I wanted to be a doctor like them. So, I go to John one day and I tell him, ""You know, John. I gotta go to college because I want to be a doctor."" And this is within my first year of recovery. Most recommendations are don't do anything big in your first year. But I'm not paying attention to that, I really think that I should go to college. I've wanted to go to college in some points in my life but I didn't think it was possible. During my use I had just given up on it. It was not going to happen. Now, it was like, maybe I could go to college. And if John were to have doubted me in any way though, or doubted my ability to do it, I would have just crumbled. And he knew me as a high school drop-out. That was it. High school drop-out, works at Mayo, comes to AA, that's it.
So, I don't know what he was thinking when I say that I decide that I want to be a doctor. But he said, ""You know Marv, if it is God's will, it will happen."" That's how he answered me. Those are his exact words. And I thought, wow, I guess that it is true. If it is God's will, it will happen. So, I just hung on to it. I started looking into schools and trying to figure out where I wanted to and how I was going to do it. My parents, I didn't even ask for money. I hadn't even seen them. I had talked to my dad that one time and that was it. And I assumed they wouldn't help because they said they wouldn't help. And my younger brother was off at college at the University of Minnesota and we didn't really have a lot of money, so I kind of thought that there was no use even going down that path. I hadn't had any contact with them. I assumed they would stick with what they said. 
So, my kids are in their thirties now, and they both applied to multiple schools, right? Like eight schools or something. And I decided in the end... I talked to one of the fellows a little bit about applying to college, but I didn't really talk much about it. I just decided that I was just going to do it on my own for some reason. Just stupidly, you know? So, I apply to one school. I apply to St. Olaf and I decide if I get in, I get in and if I don't, I don't. And I got in. So, on my one-year anniversary from that six-month relapse, I walk into my first classes. The neat thing is that I was in this dorm with all of these guys and they are all coming to college like it is some free-for-all, and I'm trying to stay sober.
So, I go back to Rochester on a lot of weekends because I want to go to AA on Sunday morning, which I don't tell them, but I might have told some of them. I went to an AA meeting in town, in Northfield, too. I was still dating Linda. And those guys, like one time, I was studying in the library all evening, which I did a lot of because my memory was just kind of shot. By the end of the first semester though, it was beginning to be quite good. It took a lot of effort. And I walked back to the dorm and in the entry was a big lobby and they were having a Christmas Party. I start for the punch because it is supposed to be a dry campus. That's laughable. It wasn't a dry campus at all. There were drugs and alcohol everywhere. But five guys come out of all corners of the room as I am walking towards the punch and grab me, ""Marv! Marv! We spiked the punch! We spiked the punch! Stay away from it!"" 
One time, the second semester, I was somehow... I don't know what was going on, I can't explain it, I don't remember what was happening. But I am in the room known for people who smoke pot all the time, right? And there are about six guys and they are handing a joint around. And I am sitting in there and I am not thinking about using or planning on using, but I am there, which makes no sense of all. So, I must in some way be thinking about using. My next-door neighbor in the dorm, Jack, suddenly shows up in the door and says, ""Marv, come here. I've gotta talk to you about something."" And he gets me out of there. Jack and five or six of these guys and I still get together. [laughter] And he got me out of there, somehow. And I had told these guys my story. 
AS: It probably made an impression on them. 
MS: Well they just said, that makes sense Marv, you shouldn't do that. That was their response! You just shouldn't do that! It was true. So, they were just really practical. And they had no experience with addiction of any kind. So, that's how that all went. Linda and I had decided to get married after freshman year, just stupidly. We're twenty-years-old, we get married. Neither of us have money. She was working but she wasn't in school. She was taking some classes at the junior college in Rochester at the time. We decided that we would go to school together. [laughter] Which sounds just crazy, and it was. But we go off to Drake University in Iowa and went there and it all went well. Neither of us get any help from our parents. Her folks really can't help her out, so we're just getting grants and loans and I'm doing work study and she is doing some work study, which was just basically just a job at the school. And we were able to make ends meet. We both went to school and then I graduated a year before she did and got into Mayo. Dr. Shepard, while I was in college was named Dean of Education of the Mayo Clinic. When I applied to medical school, well, the Dean of the Medical School opens a letter from his boss... [laughter] I had done my part in college. 
After that first semester was rough, I got mostly B's and then it was almost all A's. 
AS: Did you and Linda stay together? 
MS: Yeah, I started medical school a year before she graduated, so she was still at Drake and I had an affair with a classmate. We almost divorced. It was just horrible. I mean... It hurt both of us equally. It was just awful. Somehow, we stayed together, and we've been married forty-one years. 
AS: Oh my gosh, that's incredible. 
MS: I know! And we love each other! 
AS: That's really great. And we love each other! Not only are we together, but we love each other. [laughter] That's always a good thing to add.
MS: It is!
AS: Cause, ""We're still together"" can sound like you're in some kind of marathon. 
MS: It's true. But it's just getting better. 
AS: That's really great. 
MS: So, I don't know, it's almost 5:30pm. We should probably meet again. 
AS: Should we meet again? Then we can get into the weeds about opioids. 
MS: Yeah, cause that's the trouble talking about my story. 
AS: No, it's not. Often, my time with doctors has always been longer, because there is the story of the life and then what are you going to tell me about addiction medicine. Okay, so let's just pause for now.

Interviewer
December 19, 2017
Bloomington, Minnesota
Yussuf Shafie-YS
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. It's December 19th, 2017 in Bloomington, Minnesota at Alliance Wellness Center with Yussuf Shafie.
YS: Yes, that's correct. 
AS: Would you state your name and say you agree to be interviewed?
YS: Yes, I have agreed to be interviewed. My name is Yussuf Shafie. I am the CEO and the director of Alliance Wellness Center. 
AS: Thank you. Tell me a little bit about your family, your childhood. Where were you born? How did you get to Minnesota?
YS: I am an immigrant. I came from Somalia with my family here back in 2001. I came in with my brothers, sisters, mom, and dad. Grew up in Burnsville, Minnesota. Believe it or not when I came here I didn't even know how to speak English. I've come a long way. Education was very important in my family. My mom made sure we all studied and went to college. I graduated from Burnsville High School back in 2006. Although I had been passionate about social work and mental health and addiction since I was a little kid, I don't know why. In our community there are people that have addiction or mental health issues and are stigmatized. I wanted to create awareness and educate folks. In order for me to do that I had to go to school. I went to Inver Hills Community College for my Associate's Degree because I'm cheap [laughs] and it went really well. My first semester actually was horrible. I didn't do so well. I failed all of my classes. I was young, playing basketball, chasing girls. An immature eighteen-year old. I didn't do well. It messed up my confidence a bit, which was good. I think it's the best thing that's happened to me. 
So that happened. I got a letter from financial aid saying they were going to take my financial aid away if I didn't get my grades up next semester. I thought about all the hard work that my mom has done for us and my family and how hard we worked. My second semester I worked really hard. I got my act together and got all As and Bs, and I graduated in 2009. I went to Metro State for my Bachelor's in social work. 
AS: How old were you when you came from Somalia?
YS: I was about ten, eleven years old. 
AS: What was life like before you came to the US?
YS: It was kind of a blur. I was young and I don't remember much. It was a good life. We didn't have much, but we had enough. I've learned that we have a lot of privileges here in the US. Health care, education, safety. It depends on where you're from. There are parts that are really great in Somalia and there are parts that are—even before the civil war—there were a lot of great things. 
AS: Where were you born?
YS: Actually I was born in Kenya, but I was raised here in the US. I was born and raised in Kenya, and then my mom and dad are from Somalia so it was like a next door neighbor. When the civil war broke down all the people went to the neighboring countries. I speak Swahili as well. I speak Somali and Swahili even though my Swahili is only eighty percent now, or seventy percent. I'm kind of losing it. So yeah I was born and raised in Kenya but my parents are Somali. My mom traveled between Somalia and Kenya. It's like here to Wisconsin kind of a thing. A little bigger, but you get the picture. People drove back and forth, and my mom was a businesswoman. 
AS: What did she do?
YS: She ran a trucking business, which is not common for women to run that kind of business back home, but she was a hustler and that's where I get this working for myself. I've never believed in working for someone, or I've always been a risk taker and things like that, and that's where I get that from. That's a little bit about my childhood. Came to the states, worked really hard, learned English in ESL. I did go through a lot. 
AS: Was that all during high school that you learned English?
YS: Middle school and high school. 
AS: So you got your bachelor's from Metro State?
YS: I got my bachelor's from Metro State back in 2012, and then I decided if I wanted to do something I should go get my master's. I decided to go to the U [University of Minnesota] and get my master's. When I was going to grad school my sister called me one day and she said, ""Hey, we should open a Somali restaurant in Burnsville,"" and I'm like, ""You're crazy."" I hung up the phone. She called me back three times and I knew she was serious. In 2013 we started the restaurant and it did really well. It took off. We had a Star Tribune article, and some big publications in Minneapolis St. Paul magazine, and the Dakota Tribune, which was a big article in Dakota County. We did really well, and that's how I got the money to start what I was passionate about with Alliance. I did that for about two and a half years, and I thought, ""I don't want to do this."" I'm passionate about mental health and chemical dependency. 
Back in 2015 when I graduated from grad school I worked in Minneapolis Public Schools [MPS] for about a year in CUHC [Community University Health Care Center] clinic for about a year in Minneapolis where I learned a lot about addiction and mental health. It's an FQH, federally qualified health care center. It's owned by the University of Minnesota technically. 
AS: When you said grad school did you get your MSW?
YS: Yes. My MSW [Master’s in Social Work], LGSW [Licensed Graduate Social Worker]. I did my internship at CUHC, so I did a social work triage position for about eight hundred hours or whatever the internship was. After that they hired me as a mental health practitioner, so I was working there for about a year. I was in the process of starting Alliance as well. Kind of a lot going on at the same time. 
AS: Is the restaurant still open? 
YS: It is. My sister manages it. It's about ten, fifteen minutes from here right in Burnsville. If you look up African restaurant it will come up. I did that, and that's where I learned the business aspect of things. I'm a social worker, I can't do math. [laughs] But I learned all about managing budgets and things like that. I learned a lot from the restaurant and starting and being patient and things like that. 
AS: And restaurants are still communities. 
YS: They are. They really are. Food brings people together. I did that, graduated, and started Alliance. I've been in business for about two and a half years now and we're doing really well. Things are going really well for us. We have a day group, Alliance Wellness, that works with the East African population that is culturally specific. We have twelve beds where we lodge them, so they go into treatment and then they go to the house too. 
AS: So you bought a house?
YS: A couple houses, yes. 
AS: Tell me about the stigma. Stigma around addiction is huge in many cultures. I had a Muslim student from Kenya I think, and she was in my history of addiction class a few years ago. She said that the stigma was very intense. Could you describe what that would mean in a family?
YS: Of course. I think in our culture people are always skeptical about alcohol and drugs and any addiction. I think in our culture we have black and white thinking, which is never a good thing. Either you're crazy or you're not. Either you're a drunk or you're not. Either you're a good person or you're a bad person. There's no in between. That's my biggest frustration. The religious aspect doesn't help. Because you're a Muslim you're not supposed to drink alcohol; it's forbidden. And I'm like why do we have fifteen clients in a group right now that are talking about alcoholism and addiction? And they're Muslim. It's like the elephant in the room. The worst thing you could do is drink. It's like being the priest's daughter and getting pregnant. It's like the worst thing. 
AS: Yeah. It almost means you're not practicing your religion. 
YS: No, you're not. It's horrible. People are shunned, and it's pretty bad. Especially for women. You're a woman, you're a person of color, you're a Muslim, and you're an addict. It's like it's the worst thing. You're down on the bottom. I think education and awareness are the most important. These things are not going to go away. 
When you move to a culture—America is giving a lot of immigrants a lot of opportunities, but also you pick up the bad habits to some extents. 
AS: There are a lot of bad habits I think. 
YS: Kids having sex before marriage, kids partying. Back home it's more family oriented. You respect the elders and things. Kids are just not that bright to be honest. With cell phone technology and things it makes things a lot easier. The stigma piece—I think people are just not educated and so they tend to judge and be judgmental. I think people don't even know what to do as well. They don't know how to deal with addiction—the families. And the clients, too. All this happens, you're in detox, you're miserable. And pride. We're very prideful people. Like, ""Do I want to get help? Now Yussuf will know my problem now. And he might know my mom or my dad."" 
AS: So even as an insider in the community you still struggle. 
YS: Oh yeah. There are people that want to come help here. People might say, ""Well, you're a Somali. What's the big deal?"" Yeah, but sometimes it might not be a good fit. Just because you're Somali doesn't mean they'd be a good fit. I always make that comment when I do conferences or talk to people. The assumption is that if you're from the same culture—
AS: People who aren't Somali assume that.
YS: I think education across the board is important. I'm a big advocate for that. 
AS: Can you tell me a story, without using their name, about someone who has struggled with addiction and what has happened to them and their family?
YS: Well, I know twenty people I can tell you about. A lot of them don't get support. In a Western, white, American culture it's easier for someone to support you, or to come to AA with you and things like that. It's a little more socially acceptable. If your son or daughter is using you could kind of assist them and get them help. 
AS: So there's not even that for parents?
YS: For us, no. You're not helping at all. She doesn't even speak English. How's she going to help you get into treatment? Or she doesn't understand it. 
AS: And she thinks, ""Why don't you just stop?""
YS: Yeah. ""Why don't you stop?"" And they always tell me that. ""If Amy just stops drinking, she's really a good person."" Well, yeah, but why is she drinking in the first place? Let's find the underlying issue. Amy didn't just pick up prescription pills. Maybe she had a back pain issue and the Vicodin wasn't enough so now she's buying street drugs. Because there's always an underlying cause. There's always pain under that addiction. I think people don't understand that and it's hard for them to fathom. 
AS: Is there also a mental illness stigma?
YS: Oh yeah, huge. Mental illness is more accepted than addiction. The interesting thing is that ninety percent of my clients are concurrent. A lot of them have mental health issues. They self-medicate themselves to cope with their mental illness. The addiction starts because the mental illness is not met. Mental health issues are not being treated so they self-medicate by using drugs and alcohol. 
AS: When you were talking about the black and white of being crazy or not that's almost doubly stigmatized. If you actually do get a diagnosis and your addiction was the cause does it matter to the families?
YS: No, it doesn't matter. To some extent if you have mental health issues you are the crazy one and it's not acceptable. They will kind of feel bad for you. Rather than if you have severe mental health issue and then you come home drunk or high now it's a problem. In the reality you're treating your mental illness and that's what the issue is. Oftentimes we find that when we treat the mental health issue and get you get people stable on medication and they see the psychiatrist things are a lot easier to deal with. The addiction can be treated because you're stable. If the mental illness is like up and down and you're not medicated or you're not seeing a psychiatrist and you're not stable then it's not going to work. You cannot treat your addiction. We try to tackle both. 
AS: What's the environment like at the sober house? Do you call it a sober house?
YS: Yeah, supportive housing. 
AS: I like that name better than 'sober house.' I just think about language a lot. 
YS: Yeah, of course. Language is really important. 
AS: Yeah, so what is life like there?
YS: It's really good. Some do well and some don't do well. We teach them some life skills. They all have some chores. They all have to go to AA. They have to learn how to make appointments for themselves. They learn life skills. Some of them might not get along. They fight about pickles and ketchup, who knows. There's always something. A lot of them are homeless, so in the winter we are more busy. So right now we have twelve beds and we're full. In the summers it's a little bit slower because people tend to go outside and have a good time. 
AS: And you help them find the services that they need?
YS: That's one of the daily commands. We apply for GRH [group residential housing] or apply for some type of long-term housing for them. So that way by the time they graduate here they can find something. 
AS: Can you tell me about any success stories you've had?
YS: Where do you want me to start? [laughs] 
AS: Well, you never know. It's a tricky business. 
YS: That's true, it is. We have a couple clients that have graduated, a couple that show up at least once a month out of gratitude, thankful, have two jobs. This guy came from jail. He had like four DWIs. Chronic alcoholic. Everybody disowned him in his family. His wife, his three kids. Now he's back with his wife and kids and working two jobs. It took six months of hard work with him. He did some outpatient too and is doing AA. 
People lose hope when they are at rock bottom. Sometimes when you lose hope people are incapable of doing anything. Hope is a big thing. I think a lot of people are like, ""Shit, what do I have to lose?"" I'm in jail for a year now, I have four DWIs, my wife left me, my three beautiful daughters left me. My mom won't even talk to me. What do I have to lose? They throw in the towel. I think when you give people hope—it makes a big difference when you give people three meals a day and a place to stay. It makes a huge difference. You educate them and you give them opportunities and you believe in them. I think you see a difference in people. 
AS: Do you have a personal connection to addiction in your family? You said you've always wanted to do this. 
YS: Actually I don't to be honest, which is actually kind of interesting because I would say sixty percent of my staff are in recovery. That is always good because we need people with that experience. Personally I don't. Nobody in my family has addiction. I do have highly addictive behaviors as some of us do. I don't have any addiction issues. I've always been passionate about it. I've always understood it, and I was always curious. I'm very passionate about helping people that are underserved. I thought that my community needs me, and why not do my own thing. It took me a lot of years to think about this and to plan and go through all the DHS and all the stuff. It's not easy. It's a lot of work. 
AS: How many clients do you have right now? How is it growing?
YS: In the day group we have about twelve to fifteen. We also have the evening group that is mostly white or black—it's not culturally specific. Then we have a Sunday group. In total I would say we have about thirty to thirty-five. 
AS: Those are clients?
YS: Yes. 
AS: Has it stayed at that level?
YS: It is so up and down. Winter is a little more busy. People are more depressed. Summer is down. The numbers are more like fifteen to twenty. 
AS: That's pretty common in the field, isn't it?
YS: Yeah. That's how it is for the big people with the clients too. 
AS: When it gets cold and dark people are ready to go. 
YS: Absolutely. 
AS: What is your treatment model here?
YS: We have many models. I think the most important thing is to meet people where they're at. That's the first important thing. We need to figure out if they have toothpaste. Let's go to Wal-Mart and get them some toothpaste. Let's not worry about the alcoholism or the opioid addiction right now. He needs a towel and some toothpaste and we'll start with that. Let him get some sleep tonight and make sure he brushes his teeth. Dignity is very important. He showers and tomorrow morning he comes and we will treat the mental health issue, the addiction issue. Meeting people where they're at—I'm a big fan of that. 
AS: Do you see that as part of a harm reduction model? 
YS: Oh yeah. Harm reduction is so important. That's my frustration sometimes. You have to understand the client and where they're at. A lot of people don't understand. There are big companies out there that have their own policy. ""Our policy is we cannot buy a client toothpaste."" Well, yeah, that doesn't help anyone if he can't brush his teeth. He's probably afraid to talk to you. Do you see what I mean? I think motivation is a big thing that we use here. EMDR [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing] is something we use, CBT, and DBT is big. I think the most important thing is just treat people like human beings. That's the most important thing. I think a lot of people struggle with that. 
AS: That's a big part of the history of treatment in the US. There's the moral component that's really big. How do twelve-step programs work into your program?
YS: Yes, we invite people. I have been trying to establish a Muslim twelve-step based—there's a lot of need for that. I wear so many hats and I've got so much stuff to do. I just need to find the right person to help me with that. It's just really important. 
AS: How would you change it for a Muslim based twelve-step? Because twelve-step is always about how the higher power can be anything
YS: Yeah, the higher power, God—I don't know how it would look. I actually should sit down and think about it. 
AS: You might not be the first person to think about it. There might be someone else out there. 
YS: Yeah I know they did something in New York, but I don't know. I want to do more research and figure it out about NA or AA for a twelve-step model, but I think there's a need for that. Again, the same token, the whole ""let's hold hands and sing kumbaya"" is all a Western, American cultural thing. We have to find a way. In fact, I had a client that has graduated and is doing really well that talked to me about wanting to start a support group. That's his thing. He's a big fan of that. So, I've got to support him in doing that. I got him a space he could do. We maybe do a weekly meeting or something. 
AS: What do you think about best practices? Meeting people where they're at, but when you think about the future of treatment where do you want it to go, where do you see it going? Is that the same thing or not?
YS: I'm just a small, tiny guy. I think we need more counselors, number one. LADCs [licensed alcohol and drug counselor] in general because there's not many in the field. Also, people who are culturally competent are very important. Culturally competent is kind of a broad word, but people that are sensitive to other people and other cultures are really important. I think also it's important with policy. They keep cutting budgets and all these things. It's just going to keep getting worse. It's not going to get better. Whoever is in charge, the big boss, and they read this book we need more funding. I had a professor that used to say, ""Funding drives practice."" Which is true. You have to make sure the bills are paid. 
AS: And that it's that important that it can determine how you practice. 
YS: It costs so much money, Amy, to put you in jail and prison than it would cost me—like ten dollars a day. That's just hypothetically speaking, but it's a hundred dollars in the county jail a day. With these ten dollars you get three meals a day and treatment. You're learning about how your mind thinks. You're not just sitting in the cell for twenty-three hours. That's not going to do any good. For you and for me because I'm a taxpayer too. 
AS: The whole incarceration—incarcerating people with addiction and mental illness because they 'committed a crime.' 
What can you tell me about your clientele and opioids?
YS: We have been seeing a lot of that recently. 
AS: What are they using?
YS: Heroin, prescription pills, benzos. I think a lot of them especially in the Somali community there are a couple cases. We had one guy that OD'd and passed away. I have clients that say—we talk about it in group. A lot of the guys are more alcohol than opioids and they call it the rock. 
AS: They call heroin 'the rock'?
YS: Yeah, like rocks. It's a street name I think. What they do is basically they're saying, ""I'm an alcoholic, but alcohol will not kill me."" So they're discriminating against each other. It's very interesting. 
AS: There's a whole hierarchy of it. The pain pill people think they're better than the injection drug users. 
YS: I'm like really? I tend to challenge them. 
AS: So you're seeing an increase in heroin. What about meth?
YS: I don't see much meth. Somali women I see it. 
AS: That makes sense because it gives you energy. If you have children. 
YS: Child protection cases, yes. We see a lot of alcohol. Opioids have increased. Our numbers have been increasing. A lot of them it starts with a car accident and back pain, or an accident in football, baseball, or basketball. You have to be mindful of this. My mom had back surgery and he gave her a prescription for ninety pills of oxycontin. I was like, “Dude what the hell are you doing?” My LADC—that kind of thing. I'm not LADC but my treatment director in me was like, ""That's a lot of pills."" And that stuff is highly addictive. We have to make the doctors responsible. 
AS: There is some work being done on that here. Do you know Chris Johnson? He's an MD. I'll connect you with him. He's doing an opioid prescribing task force to try to cut that. He got really frustrated as an ER doctor in St. Louis Park. 
YS: How does he feel about Suboxone or methadone?
AS: Oh, absolutely. How do you feel about that here?
YS: I love it. I'm a big fan of all avenues of recovery. What works for you might not work for me. I've challenged people that say, ""Well..."" Whatever works for you I'm a big fan of that. 
AS: All seven of the doctors I've interviewed—because they're science based. Their evidence based and they know that it can work. 
YS: Yes, if you do it right. 
AS: Can you get your clients to their clinic everyday?
YS: Yeah, or we have people that have [unclear]. I was looking into establishing one actually. 
AS: Oh really? It's the time. It's the moment for that for sure. I've worked closely with people from Valhalla Place. Well that's where I met you!
YS: Yeah, what was his name?
AS: Chuck [Hilger]. That's where I met you was that MAT [medication assisted treatment] training. It's fascinating that we have a medicine that can actually help people get their mind on track, but we still have a stigma about even the different medications. Methadone is for the hopeless cases. It's not true though. 
YS: Yeah, Suboxone is really good. I know. 
AS: What's your dream for this place? Five years from now. 
YS: I think my biggest challenge is housing. I want to house people and it's important—because what happens sometimes to be honest is we find someone, treat them for ninety days and they do well, and then after that we have to, not kick them out, but insurance will only pay for so many days. We have to form them back into the community. Apartments are usually good because they have [unclear] or they didn't pay their rent. A lot of them don't have a job. If we can get them into the GRH. I need some type of long-term housing. Even if they can get a place to sit for another four, five months until they figure things out. What happens is they go back to the streets, they relapse, they come back to treatment. Resources are not there and it's a waste of money if you ask me. You give people three months and a place to stay they will likely get a job, or at least a place to take their meds. So housing is my biggest challenge. If I could find a place to house people I think it would be good. I think that's one of my goals is to find long-term housing for people. 
AS: How are you thinking about doing that?
YS: Getting a contract with the county. Or figuring something out. 
AS: That would be under Alliance Wellness?
YS: Yeah. Or anybody. It takes so long for us to get someone discharged because they can't find a place to live. I have a couple guys right now that are ready to graduate and we don't know what to do with them. We give them an extension for thirty days. Sometimes I honestly do a free service for them because they have nowhere to go honestly. 
AS: When you say the homelessness—you mentioned this a couple of minutes ago—but the homelessness is usually a result of being shut out from their families, right? 
YS: Oh yeah. Obviously when someone is using they steal, cheat, and lie. It's not the person so much as the addiction. A lot of families don't understand that. They say, ""Oh, Amy, she's an asshole. She stole a hundred bucks from me!"" Well, yeah, you left a hundred bucks on the counter and she's an addict. What are you going to do? The families don't understand that. We have to educate the family. Don't leave the hundred bucks. 
AS: Do you have a family group? Have you been able to do that?
YS: I do. They don't come. I don't blame them. One is transportation. I think a lot of immigrant families are working two jobs and trying to support them, so time is of the essence. I think they're also skeptical about me to do their dirty laundry. Because of pride and ego. 
AS: Because is there an understanding of trust?
YS: No, honestly I think a lot of them are skeptical about me and I don't blame them. If I was a Somali guy who was an alcoholic I probably wouldn't go see Yussuf too. To be honest. 
AS: Why?
YS: Because of the stigma. It's a small world. Everybody knows everybody. It's a small community. I think pride and ego are a big thing, too. I think a lot of people are skeptical sometimes. I think an important thing for a lot of families is they don't understand it. They have no clue. They love their kid and will do anything for them, but the kid or whatever, the person, the client, has cheated on them, or yelled, or lied, and they've bailed them out twenty-five times. ""We are just tired. Stop it. Shut up. Leave us alone.""
AS: That's a common thing in every culture. 
YS: Absolutely. But if you don't have a lot of resources and I bailed you out with the three thousand dollars I had in my savings it's not going to look good if you go back using again. I had a client that was telling me that thirty-three thousand dollars her dad wrote a check to Hazelden for a month or whatever for the treatment. The day after she came out she relapsed. She said, ""My dad was pissed."" I said, ""I would be pissed, too."" But things like that. Addiction is a disease and we have to figure out a way to treat it. I think a lot of people don't understand that. 
AS: Yeah, seventy-five years later we are still talking about that. We are still trying to convince people it's a disease. 
YS: If you're a diabetic and you see a doctor you take your insulin. And it's like, ""Oh, you're a diabetic. I'm sorry. Make sure you take your blood sugar."" Whatever. Make sure you eat. Addiction is kind of the same idea but nobody feels bad for you. Those comments on Facebook—my blood pressure goes up. I get into fights with people on Facebook all the time.
AS: Your Alliance account or just your personal one?
YS: Just my personal one. People are idiots and I educate them. Some times I say, ""Enough is enough,"" and I just start. I'm like, well that worked for you, and you got lucky maybe and good for you. And others are like, ""Boo hoo. Feel sorry for me."" And maybe by the grace of God you did well, but it doesn't mean that you can look down on people that are struggling. You struggle for five years before you get out, or whatever. I think it's important that we do that. Education is very important. 
AS: And community education. 
YS: Absolutely. 
AS: What is your place in the community? That's a broad question.
YS: No, it's okay. I know that a lot of people like me. I think a lot of people respect what I do. I've been recognized. I think if you just Google it you'll find a lot of articles and stuff. Some people are skeptical about me still and you'll have people who doubt you, and that's okay. You can have it both ways. I graduated from the U as I told you, and the University of Minnesota did a story about Patty [Shandy], one of my former professors. [takes out the article]
AS: Is that her?
YS: Yeah, she's great. She is well known for trauma care. 
AS: I was going to ask you about trauma. 
YS: Oh yeah. We do a lot of EMDR. I think a lot of people, over ninety percent of Somali people are victims of torture. It's a high number. Because of the civil war. Have you seen the movie Hotel Rwanda? The Hutus and Tutsis. It's kind of the same thing. 
AS: I studied a lot about Mozambique and southern Africa. 
YS: Same thing. Same thing. 
AS: One thing I've been reading about it the idea of epigenetics. That parents who experienced trauma their children or grandchildren might have a proclivity towards higher anxiety, depression. 
YS: I didn't know that. 
AS: I'll send you some stuff. I think you would find that as an interesting approach to think about how to help explain it to families. 
YS: Yeah, please do. 
AS: There's a lot of research connected to the Holocaust. 
YS: Wow. There's this video I want to find for you. Yes, send it to me. I want to read it. There's something called Inside War. I'm thinking about it on YouTube right now. It's like an eight-minute video. You should watch it. The Inside War. 
AS: Who do you have here that does EMDR?
YS: We have an LICSW [licensed independent clinical social worker] that we contract out. The War Inside, sorry. Treating Somali's mentally ill. It's like a nine minute thing. Abdulrahman Ali. Actually we have Skyped him many times. 
AS: Anything else?
YS: No, that's all. 
AS: Oh, is this the first—
YS: It's the second. 
AS: That has an East African focus?
YS: Yeah. 
AS: Where's the other one?
YS: In Minneapolis. They do things different. They might not welcome you. 
AS: What's the name of it?
YS: South East Homes.
AS: They might not welcome me?
YS: No. 
AS: What's their approach?
YS: I don't know, maybe you should call them and find out. The lady that owns it is very different. She doesn't believe in networking and stuff like that. She sees me as a threat. There's not enough clients for all of us. That kind of thing. 
AS: Oh, so it's not like, ""Great there's a second person that I can work with!""
YS: No. And there are like three or four after me that have established and helped. 
AS: How many are there now?
YS: Four or five outpatient. Maybe one other one inpatient. So there's enough clients for all of us. 
AS: What about other immigrant groups?
YS: I've helped the [unclear] open one with the Wilder Foundation. CLUES [Comunidades Latinas Unidas en Servicio] is doing the Hispanic community. The Hmong community? I don't know much. 
AS: There's one. 
YS: Okay, that's good to know. 
AS: What do you think about the culturally specific—obviously you think it's important but as a practitioner?
YS: It's still different. You don't—here you just have your own forty minutes and then you have to bill for services. You get thirty minutes session and boom you're out. We do way more than that. We have to educate families. I feel like it's not fair sometimes with insurance companies or the state. They just want you to check your damn boxes and bill for it. But we might spend an hour and a half explaining something to a family but you can only bill for thirty minutes. 
AS: There are things within the institutions and the structure that are not culturally sensitive. 
YS: Absolutely. That's a nice way to say it. You should run for office. 
AS: [laughs] I might. Once I finish my book. 
YS: Let me know. I'll support you. 
AS: Well, thank you.
YS: Yeah, you're doing great work. I think we need more awareness and we need more education so I'm glad you're doing this. Whatever support you need let me know. "

At the Home of Amy Sullivan
Minneapolis Minnesota
Kathie Simon Frank       -KSF
Amy Sullivan                 -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan, it’s a beautiful sunny morning, March 15th. We’re at my house in Minneapolis interviewing Kathie Simon Frank. Kathie do you give me permission to record this interview?
KSF: Yes, I give you permission Amy. 
AS: Thank you. Let’s just get started with your early life. Whatever you feel like sharing. 
KSF: My parents, my mom was twenty-nine and my dad was twenty-six when they got married. I was born when my mom was twenty-nine in 1942 in Berkeley, California. My dad was working on a project; he’d gotten his PhD. My mom had a master’s in political science and I don’t know if she was working. We lived in Berkeley. My grandmother lived in San Andrea which was by Oakland south of Berkeley. My mom had family in that area. Six months after I was born my dad got a job at Illinois Institute of Technology and they moved to Chicago.
AS: Was he in science?
KSF: That’s a hard question to answer. He has his PhD in political science but he was at the University of Chicago and he never really considered himself a political scientist. He worked in city management and things like that. He kind of worked in political science but was really interested in problem solving and decision making kinds of things. Eventually in his long life, he lived to be eighty-six, he taught first in a graduate school of Industrial Education at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh where I moved when I was seven. Then he had an appointment jointly in psychology because he was doing cognitive psychology and computer science. He did a lot of work with the early creation of artificial intelligence. You can look him up his name is Herbert Simon. 
He played a really big part in my life because my mom, and this is relevant, was really wanting a boy. She was the oldest of two girls and was very close with her younger sister. She’d grown up in the Bay Area. She wanted a boy she had decided. I wasn’t a boy. She was quite disappointed actually which I learned because there was a letter in my baby book which she had written to my great aunt, her aunt, it said that. After her initial disappointment with not having a boy...Then my next sibling is a brother named Peter. Exactly two years younger and then exactly two years after that my sister Barbara was born. It was always clear to me that Peter was favored because he was the boy my mom wanted. My sister was favored because she had red hair like my mom. Beautiful, beautiful bright orange hair, which of course she hated. My mom loved it because it was kind of like her hair. I was close to my dad. I always had quite a troubled relationship with my mother. She was extraordinarily critical and she was a mom who liked things to go the way she wanted them to go. She was a very positive woman, very creative, very talented. She did a lot of sewing and tailoring and was highly accomplished in what she did. She did not work when I was growing up. In those days people didn’t. Did I say I was born in 1942?
AS: Yes.
KSF: It was always very difficult but my father always came to my defense. I could always count on him. My brother as it turns out had some kind of issues. I’m not sure if that was ever diagnosed as a child but he was extraordinarily defiant and really difficult, very, very bright. Like he had read millions of classics by the time he was ten years old which I hadn’t even heard of. He also was extraordinarily jealous of me because I got along really well in school and didn’t have these issues. We did not ever really have a good relationship because he had decided that our chemistry was wrong or something. I could never figure it out so I could never do anything to make it better. In that sense our home was quite dysfunctional because Peter was always an issue. Like in families where there is an alcoholic that person becomes the focus. Peter was the focus. My parents did the best they could. My brother as he got older, I was his target. He beat me up a lot. He was a lot bigger than me. I was often in physical danger. He wouldn’t beat me pulpy but I always had bruises on my shins from being kicked and on my arms from being punched. 
Christmas Eve was always a horrible time in our house because Peter with the increased sort of tension of everybody focusing on Christmas Peter would act out more and more. There was always a crisis on Christmas Eve. I’ve gotten over now but it took me a number of my adult years to not be really apprehensive on Christmas Eve that something horrible was going to happen. My sister was four years younger. The fact that my mother was sort of in the middle trying to legislate relationships, always triangulating, made it really difficult for me to ever really get to know my younger sister. It wasn’t until my parents were in their, I guess my mom was just turning eighty, and they decided to give up their big old house in Pittsburgh where they had lived for fifty-some years. My sister and I went to help them clean out their house and move to their condo. We were left together a lot and we just had the most wonderful time. We found out how much alike we are. We could just laugh about things. It was wonderful and we’ve continued to be close. That was in the mid-90s. My brother, I had little touches of him. 
Let me jump back. When he was twelve or so, maybe eleven, physically he was getting bigger and he being his violent self and taking it out on me. My parents would try the best they could to keep him from hurting me. They finally decided they were getting some psychological help for him and for themselves. They eventually decided that Peter should go to a residential treatment program. He went to Connecticut from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Madison, Connecticut to a treatment school where he was all year round except for four two week periods spread evenly throughout the year. He got very sophisticated. He would come home at the age of sixteen or seventeen smoking a pipe and wearing a tweed jacket. He was tall, way taller than I was. He had these kind of sophisticated airs. I hardly ever saw him. These visits home were not particularly easy because instead of being physically violent towards me he was verbally violent towards me. They still weren’t pleasant and I couldn’t really develop a relationship with him. At least I wasn’t getting beat up anymore. 
Then he disappeared. He ran away from the school when he was about seventeen. No one knew where he was. He was just gone. That was a difficult year for my dad. I remember there was some other stuff going on in my dad’s life at the time. I remember him sitting in a chair. Even though Peter wasn’t present he was still a huge presence in our lives by being absent. As an adult learning what was going on at the time when he finally reappeared. He actually showed up in Malibu, California having gone for help to some friends that were many yearlong friends of my parents whom we had grown up. We knew their family very well. Peter had found them. They lived in Los Angeles. They befriended him and notified my parents. Eventually Peter went back to school for another year. There really wasn’t a time in my life for any extended period where my relationship with Peter was very good. I considered him the addict in my family. Although my dad in some ways had an addiction to work. A workaholic. It was very clear that his order of preference of his focus was his work, my mom, and then us. More me because to talk to my brother and sister now they don’t really know my dad the way I knew him. 
Our views of our parents are totally opposite. They’ll talk about my mom and I’ll think to myself, “I don’t know who they’re talking about.” They don’t know my dad the same way I do which is interesting. We were all growing up in the same house. I remember once when my dad took me to visit a couple of colleges when I was in high school. I said once to my dad, “How come Peter is so different from me? From us? We were all raised in the same family.” My dad said, “As parents you have one chance with each child and you do the best you can.” That I thought was great wisdom. That stuck with me. You do the best you can. As a parent I’ve realized it isn’t just what I do with my children it’s who they are as well. I have some influence but they color where I start. 
That’s addiction in our family. My parents hardly drank at all. They didn’t really say anything about it. They’d have parties and they’d pour a little bit of wine. I don’t know maybe there was a couple bottles of alcohol in our house. My dad I don’t remember ever seeing him drink. My mom would have beer. My mom smoked also. Actually both my parents but my mom really smoked. My mom developed sort of an addict’s way of dealing with it. She would smoke a cigarette under the vent in the kitchen with the fan going so all the smoke was taken out of the house. This was before smoking bans. She would empty the ash tray in the garbage outside and come back in and wash the ashtray.
AS: She didn’t want the house to smell like it.
KSF: I don’t think she wanted any evidence that she had been smoking. It was kind of the denial that she was smoking even though she was smoking. A friend of hers died of emphysema. That was my mom’s wakeup call. This was way after I was out of the house. When she gave up smoking she’d been an incredible letter writer. She would write a letter to the family once a week. She would send copies of that with little notes attached to each individual. These went to my great-aunts who she was very close to and her mom and me. Barbara was still living there. I don’t know exactly who all was getting them. Her mom and her sister and me for sure. When she stopped smoking that was a trigger for her. She apparently would sit down to type at the typewriter and then light up a cigarette. When she wasn’t lighting up a cigarette she wasn’t writing these letters. That was a loss. You think that things change when somebody gives up an addiction. 
My mom sort of drank beer in the same way. She’d have a beer before dinner and then she’d wash the glass and put the glass away. It was like there was no evidence that this was happening. She really wasn’t an alcoholic. She had one beer. I don’t ever remember seeing my parents drunk or even high on anything. My dad very disciplined person. He developed an ear ache. He had been smoking a pipe and occasionally a cigar. He one day decided that the ear ache had something to do with, after seeing doctors, the ear ache had something to do with smoking. He gave up smoking and his ear ache went away. He never smoked again. That was years before my mom stopped. That’s kind of our history of addiction. My sister doesn’t have any addiction that I’m aware of. Mine if I can identify it is probably chocolate and paper. 
AS: You mean like fancy paper?
KSF: Like accumulations of paper. It’s hard for me to get rid of paper. If those are two things I really don’t have a lot of control over and continue to be issues in my life.
AS: Talk about your early adult life and parenting and your kids.
KSF: In terms of growing up and the sort of people in our house. We lived in a big old house in Pittsburgh where we moved when I was seven. My brother was away at school. There was just me and my little sister. When I graduated from high school my mom and dad went to Santa Monica. My dad worked summers for the Ram corporation. He went out that year and Barbara went with them as she was like a sophomore. Really dreaded going back to school, the school I had gone to in Pittsburgh. It was a public high school but in our neighborhood, a good school. For some reason Barbara dreaded it. She ended up going to a private school in Lenox, Massachusetts. 
I kind of in a certain way grew up as an only child with this noise from my brother whether he was at home or away at school and with this little sister who was totally annoying. Little sisters are always annoying. Once I graduated from high school when I went home often she wasn’t even there because she was off at school and Peter was off at school or wherever he was once he graduated from high school. That was kind of my upbringing. My grandparents lived one grandma in California and one grandma in Milwaukee. We didn’t see them more than two or three times a year because we had to travel. We didn’t have any extended family in Pittsburgh. 
I do know, this is relevant, that I was really aware in high school that our family was somewhat different. We were an academic family; we were Jewish but not really practicing Jews. We lived in a Jewish neighborhood and so the rule was that I could stay home from school on Jewish holidays if I went to synagogue but I couldn’t if I didn’t. My Jewish friends were all staying home from school and not going to synagogue. There was always this kind of identity thing that was always a little weird. I always identified as a Jew but we weren’t practicing until in high school I did go to Sunday School. From sixth grade on I went to a Sunday School at the temple that was near us. My parents really didn’t participate in that community very much at all. We were different in that way. My parent’s values were; my parents were very green before that was even a known entity. They were very, very interested in nature and the outdoors. My mother was a recycler before that was an issue. She cooked really healthy meals, a lot of wheat germ and natural grains and vegetables and not much sugar. That was sort of a point of teasing. My mother had what we called a cookbook lady which was Adele Davis: Cook Right to Eat Fit. I hated her because even in the chocolate chip cookies which my mother would make had to throw wheat germ in it. That was kind of my parents. We were different in that way and in terms of how we spent our money. I was kind of challenged a lot by friends, the friends I went to school with, about why we were doing this differently. My parents were devoted, not devoted, they really truly deeply believed, they had values that they really stood by. I understood those values and respected them as well and adopted them. It was awkward to kind of defend myself. On the other hand, I felt I had the backing of my parents. In that sense I kind of felt different but I did have a good group of friends that we were very close, did a lot of things together. I’ve remained friends with many of them. We’re not in touch a lot but when we get together it’s like there’s no time that’s passed. They’re really good friends. 
Then I went to the University of Michigan because my dad being a college professor. My dad was a college professor and taught lots of graduate students. He had really small groups of students that he knew and they were all doing interesting research and they were often at our house. I would hear them talking. I went to the University of Michigan because I couldn’t imagine not going to a big school. I had been at a big high school my high school class was almost six hundred people, students in my class. I went to the University of Michigan, what a shock because here I was one of a thousand in my freshman psychology class and one of five hundred in my freshman geology class. I hated it. I really hated it. I couldn’t understand what this college experience was. It wasn’t what I knew of as college. I did okay my first year. 
At the end of that year I went to Santa Monica because that’s where my parents were that year. During the summer I spent a lot of time, I play the piano, I spent a lot of time walking down the street to Santa Monica Community College where I could find a practice room. My parents didn’t have a piano in their rental that they had in Santa Monica. I would go over there every day and play piano. I spent a lot of time on the beach. I really didn’t know anybody there. At the end of the summer my mother sort of tentatively said, “So what are you planning for this fall?” When I came home in June I wasn’t going to go back to Michigan but I hadn’t done anything to do anything differently over the summer. I said, “I’m going back to Michigan.” I had decided I would just take courses that I wanted to take. I was interested in communication and in language and psychology. I thought I could take some sociology and things like that and I wouldn’t pay any attention to what the graduation requirements were. I would just take classes I liked and that would be more like what my dad was doing with his graduate students. In a certain sense I did that. I paid attention to what I would have had to take if I were a sociology major for example or a linguistic major which were the two things I had thought of. I had a really good year. 
I’d had a kind of difficult roommate arrangement when I was a freshman. It worked out fine and I made lots of friends but not with my roommate who had asked for a Christian roommate from the Midwest and she got a Jewish roommate from the East. That really made her very upset. I didn’t care. I didn’t care who I had as a roommate. Being a Jew was a little bit unusual. A lot of the people that I got to be friends with, one girl I remember from central Michigan told me I was the first Jewish person she ever knew. They found out maybe from me that Jewish people are like everybody else. My friend Mary Barrel who told me that, it was a compliment. She hadn’t known any Jewish people but she was accepting me. It wasn’t a big deal but the next year I had a room by myself in the same dorm. You eliminated that stress. I continued to have good friends. 
At the end of the year a friend of mine suggested that maybe I wanted to come to New York for the summer. She knew someone who was looking for an assistant in a New York State Training School for girls. It kind of fit in with my interests. I applied and was accepted. My parents were okay with that. I went home briefly and then I went to New York and lived in this residence in the Lower East Side. I was an assistant to the girls who were in that program. They were sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, pretty much they were runaways. They were difficult kids because they kept running away but their home situations were really, really difficult and that’s why they were running away. I’m totally unaware, I don’t think there were any drugs involved. This was 1962. There was pot on campus at Michigan. I was aware of that. Things were really tame. A few of my friends would spend the night with their boyfriends but life seemed, compared to now, so uncomplicated, so simple, so easy. These girls just needed a lot of love and a lot of attention. Some of them were in school and some of them had jobs. They lived at the residence and they had rules. One of my jobs was, we had sort of a student council and I was the leader of the student council. I did some activities with them. I was responsible for being there to sign them in and sign them out in the evening. I met a group of friends at Columbia through the friend who connected me to this job. I spent a lot of my free time, this job was probably ten to twenty hours a week.
AS: Was it just a summer job?
KSF: It was just a summer job. Then because I had extra time I also got a job in the women’s prison that was down in Greenwich Village. I was doing research for someone who was doing a research project on recidivism. I was privy to the records of the women in jail, the idea being that if we checked out certain factors, like stability factors, how long had they lived in the previous residence, had they had a job. A lot of these women had been picked up for prostitution and things like that. These were not violent crimes. I don’t remember that there were drug related crimes either. If they had a good rating on their stability measure then they were released on their own recognizance from this jail, awaiting trial. We would follow up and make sure that they showed up. If they didn’t there were big consequences to pay. It was a big study, national. I used to know the name but I can’t remember now. I worked for them collecting data and making phone calls to previous landlords and things.
AS: To see how they had turned out?
KSF: To find out so that we could decide whether they could be released on their own. I did those two jobs during the summer. I was nineteen years old around New York. I developed these friendships with the three women that I knew from Michigan who were in New York for the summer. Then a group of boys from Columbia who were our same age. We hung out with them at their apartment around Columbia on the Upper West Side. I fell in love with one of them. 
When I went back to Michigan that fall I made plans to then transfer. I applied to the New School for Social Research. From what I could see it looked a lot more like what I thought of as college based on what I knew from my dad. I transferred in February after the end of fall semester I transferred to the New School. I finished up there in June of ‘64 which is when I would have graduated. I went to summer school one summer at Barnard. That worked out. Very shortly after I moved back to New York I broke up with that boyfriend and met someone else, David Frank, who is Rachel’s dad and Matthew’s dad. We graduated and basically went to Pittsburgh and the next week got married. I had just had my twenty second birthday. We were on our way to graduate school at Berkeley. 
AS: You both were going to grad school. What was your undergrad in?
KSF: My undergrad turned out to be in Sociology with kind of a minor in linguistics. The New School didn’t really have a lot of linguistics. It was at the New School; I’d been interested in pottery for a long time. I’d also sewn all my life and made all my clothes in high school. I had lots of things that I loved to do with my hands. We went to Berkeley and I had applied to the graduate school in linguistics and was admitted. I had to take Latin and some other baby course my first semester. When we first got out there it was June of ‘64. I found that in the student union which was a few blocks from where we lived there was a wonderful pottery studio. I started doing pottery over the summer and stopped when school started. 
By that time, we are already very much involved in politics. We were demonstrating against unfair hiring practices at Jack London Square in Oakland and in San Francisco. Then things developed and it’s a whole other long story which you may know parts of. The whole issue of whether or not we could solicit to get other people to come demonstrate with us on campus. There were some very conservative people on the Board of Regents at Cal. They made a big stink about our doing anything political on campus, it being a state school. That escalated and became the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. All of that was going on and I was now transitioning from this wonderful summer of doing pottery to graduate school and baby Latin and I decided I wasn’t into school, I was into politics and pottery. I dropped out fairly shortly after school started to do that. My husband and I were very involved in the Free Speech Movement, not in the administrative part of it. Not in the leadership part of it but very dedicated to the cause. We were arrested with the other six hundred in Sproul Hall in the administration building. Then in January when we were having various meetings with our lawyers I got involved with helping out in the office of the lawyers. 
Over the next six months or so was sharing a job, unpaid, with another person. We were basically working for the lawyers focused on this case. We were doing some fundraising, writing a newsletter, keeping in touch with all the defendants, collecting things that needed to be collected, carrying things over to the courthouse. Those kinds of things. It was really a kind of gopher job. When Albert left, he was the person I was sharing the job with, I took that over and I was ultimately paid one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month to do this job. We eventually closed that little tiny office and moved the file cabinet into my kitchen. I did that job as long as I was in Berkeley. David continued his PhD and finished in ‘67. We were there for three years. Did I say he was in mathematics?
AS: No you didn’t.
KSF: I was doing that job and continuing to do pottery. Then I was pregnant with Matthew. At the point where David got a postdoc at Oxford University. We left Berkeley in May or June of ‘67 and went to England. Matthew was born in August. We were there for a year. We came back in August of ‘68. We did a lot of travelling in Europe and that sort of thing. For me it was a really, really good year. I was home with Matthew and not having to do anything in particular but have lots of interests and read a lot and got to know some other new moms. I put Matthew in a backpack on my back and hiked around the footpaths and went to little neighboring villages with churches and stuff. Then David and I travelled a lot with Mathew too. 
Then he got a job as an instructor at MIT. We came back to Boston. We moved to Boston. Shortly after that, Matthew was one when we moved back. Then not too long after that I got pregnant with Rachel. She was born the next summer in July of '69. In that time, I knew that when we were in England that David wasn't really happen. He's always been very quiet, very introspective. When we came back to Boston I'm not sure what his process was but he eventually decided that he didn't want to be married. I was pregnant. That was a little complicated. We had an almost two-year-old. Matthew turned two about a month after Rachel was born. David was actually moved out and was gone a good portion of that year. From probably Christmas until Rachel was born. We saw each other. He kind of came and went. I wanted to be married to him still. He was trying to sort whatever it was in his mind, trying to sort that out.
AS: And you're pregnant and you have a toddler by yourself?
KSF: Yes. Then Rachel was born in July and David did move back in for a little while during the summer and helped me with Rachel and Matthew. Then he knew his instructorship was coming to an end and he had to find a job. He started applying for jobs. I didn't know what was happening. I would see him but I didn't see him all the time. He'd come over to spend time with Matthew, particularly Matthew. He was interested in Rachel too but less so because she was so tiny. Eventually I was thinking, ""Find a nursery school for Matthew, he's going to be three. What am I going to do with my life? Am I going to keep this?"" We lived in the bottom of a duplex. ""Are we going to stay here? Am I going to move somewhere else?"" I had to think about myself and these children. David wasn't in our lives really. He was looking for a job somewhere else. We talked a little bit about that but one day he showed up and he had gotten an offer from Stony Brook. I think I went with him on one of these job interviews. I went with him to Penn State and thought, ""I don't want to live in this kind of place. There's no chance for me. All these academic wives, everyone wants to do their professional thing and too much competition."" The one other option was the University of Utah. I wasn't going to live in Salt Lake City. That was later, those were later. He applied to Stony Brook and he got this job. He invited me to come down to visit with him to look at it. I did. I thought I was just coming along. We were on friendly terms.
AS: You weren't divorced?
KSF: We weren't divorced. We had no arrangements. We were still married but we were living in two different places. He was very clear that he was doing his thing and I was being a mom to these babies. I had a job doing some data analysis for some little company. I'd get a pile of papers and go through them and process the data and take it back to them. All of a sudden one day he said something that sounded like he was assuming that I was going to come with him. I said, ""I don't know about this."" There was a several week period where he was surprised that I wasn't just falling into place and I was surprised that he was making all these assumptions. We did. We did move with him and bought a house and got there. We were there for five years. He didn't get tenure which was disappointing to him and me. That's when he had these offers from Penn State and University of Utah.
AS: Did you live together during those five years?
KSF: We did. It wasn't easy because he had these big swings of moods and he was clearly not totally happy with his life. We had this semblance of a life together. I wasn't unhappy. I just was kind of watchful. Years later, skip to when Rachel's fifteen, a therapist asked me if my first husband was an alcoholic. I said no. In fact, he like my dad hardly ever drank. However, unlike my dad, he when he drank got really, really mean. That, I've heard, is a sign not of an addiction necessarily but of an alcoholic. This huge mood swing. He didn't drink very often to his credit. He had these huge swings of moods. You could never, I'd always feel like I was walking on eggshells. I never knew what I could say or couldn't say because I'd always get this verbal attack. In some ways it kind of replicated my mom's criticism of me and my brother's verbal abuse of me. It was something I was used to. I hated it. I always said, I'm pointing right behind my eye, I felt there were tears right here. That I was always on the verge of crying because I really hated the way I was being treated. I realized also that he was the only person that treated me like that outside of my mom and my brother. I came to that realization way later, after David and I were separated. I wasn't happy but I had so much good in my life. I had good friends. I had things I was liking doing. I loved my children. I loved being a mom. I loved Stony Brook. Here I was on the water. We didn't live right on the water but a mile away. I could be at the water all the time. Those things were positives, way strong positives. I had some really good friends that I made at Stony Brook.
AS: You were there five years.
KSF: We were there five years. That's when David was applying for jobs for the future. I wasn't going to go to Salt Lake City and I wasn't going to go to Penn State. He got an offer from University of Minnesota. I agreed to come here. It looked like a good place. In my mind it was, ""I can have a life there whatever happens with David."" I don't think I ever said that but I knew deep down that here were the elements, I would be in a big city with lots and lots of opportunities and that I could thrive. We did move here. Within a year we bought a house. Then a few months later David announced, he had a trip to the East Coast and he came back and there was some weird stuff that I was picking up on. He eventually said that he had reconnected with somebody that he had known in college and he was going to be moving out the next day. Instead of giving him free reign this time like I did when we were in Cambridge, I said to him, ""Okay. Where's the key?"" He was a little surprised that I was setting that boundary. I'd learned a lot over the years. I wasn't going to do that again. I was quite clear that he needed to do what he needed to do for his life and I needed to do what I needed to do for my life. 
We moved here in 1975, to Minneapolis. This was probably '77. Matthew was ten and Rachel was eight. David moved out. We got divorced two years later, two and a half years later. David was always, he was attentive to the kids but he didn't spend a lot of time with them. I don't know how my kids really feel about their dads. They learned once we were living in separate houses, I was aware that they learned to deal with him perfectly well. He had some ideas that were the kind of things you rolled your eyes at. The kids kind of rolled their eyes at those things. I never spoke ill of him. I didn't want to have that be a battleground for them. I learned to set some really strong boundaries. Life was not easy but I felt I had a really strong base of friends. 
Rachel was the younger of two by two years. Matthew was kind of shy which I guess, I'm the oldest and I was pretty outgoing. I kind of thought Matthew was but when push came to shove and you'd ask Matthew if he'd go to a neighbor he wouldn't do it but Rachel would. Being two years younger. I was always sort of surprised about that. She always had a sort of presence about herself. They both had very clearly defined personalities. They were obviously quite different people. Neither of them were very difficult. Rachel had spent a lot of her really early childhood being very attached to me. She cried all the time if I wasn't there which was a kind of pressure. I don't know whether that, we never knew what was causing that. She was physically fine. I had her tested and stuff. She grew out of it when she was two and could talk. She just kind of climbed down off of me and was her own person. Matthew was always more quiet. You couldn't read him as well as Rachel. 
Then in 1980 in the end of the year we had our final divorce hearing. On that very day I went out to dinner with some friends of mine. I had been dating a little bit. I didn't feel like I needed to be dating. A lot of the dating was very boring. I had been introduced by a friend of mine who knew me and her boyfriend knew Richard. Months and months before they had both said that we should meet. We couldn't find a time to do that. Judith and Fred couldn't. Finally, they were both in town at the same time. We were invited for a dinner to Judith and Fred's house. I took my kids to a babysitter who's going to keep them overnight. I went to this party and met this man. The other people at the party were department of engineering people. Richard's department. I didn't know any of them. The only person I knew there was Judith. During the evening I was aware that when somebody made a joke or something instead of turning to Judith to laugh I would turn to Richard. At the end of the evening I felt fine. He seemed very nice and I wouldn't mind seeing him again. I didn't give him my phone number. I figured he could find out how to get in touch with me. I knew he was going to be travelling on business. Then a couple weeks later I went out to dinner to celebrate or to have some dinner with some friends. It happened it was the night of the end of my divorce. I'd been in court. 
AS: It's okay to celebrate your divorce.
KSF: I was really glad to celebrate it by this time. I had said to my friends on the way home, they were driving, I said to them I'd met this man at a party and I wouldn't mind if he called again but I hadn't heard from him. I got home and he called me and invited me on a date. That was in early December. We went out on that date. We saw each other at Christmas. We started seeing a lot of each other. He was travelling for a committee he was on. He was gone in January. By the end of January, we were engaged to be married. The only real complication was I had Matthew and Rachel who were by this time nine and eleven or ten and twelve. Richard had three daughters who were twelve and a half, fourteen and a half, and sixteen and a half. How old were the kids? They must have been by this time, eleven and thirteen. Susan was thirteen and a half. She's a half year older than Matthew. And fifteen and seventeen. At the end of the summer, their mother was very much in their lives. At the end of the summer Richard and I got married in August of 1981. We had these five teenagers. 
We had a schedule where the kids spent half the time with David and half the time with me. We had worked that out. It worked most of the time. David would get a little frantic from time to time and would just say he couldn't handle it. I'd take the kids. For the most part that worked. The girls had been with their mom about half time. Their mother was livid about me even though I had nothing to do with their divorce. They were already divorced when I met Richard. She decided that I had broken up their marriage not knowing anything about me. I'm sure Richard told her we were going to get married. They had to talk to each other when the kids were going back and forth. That set up a really bad tone for us because Susan, especially Karen and Susan the two younger ones were indoctrinated by their mother that I was a horrible homewrecker. They would spend a week with her and they'd come back to us. It would take us a half of week to get that calmed down a little bit, it never got sorted out until way later. Then Richard and I figured out we could have a schedule where we were with my kids alone one week and his kids alone the next week and the third week we would have by ourselves. The kids were all together for a week, my kids alone, his kids alone, we were alone for a week. We worked this schedule out. People were kind of coming and going a lot of the time. 
Rachel was a teenager and I don't remember that she was so utterly horrible to me. She had a couple friends that we really didn't like. She disappeared a few times. I don't remember exactly what ages. She was around fifteen. She would not come home at night when she was supposed to. I knew there was a lot of manipulation happening. What I did was pick up the phone and call the parents of these kids she was hanging out with. I didn't know any of them. All of them had gone to different schools in high school. I called a meeting. I guess that when I’m anxious about something I want to get together with people and solve the problem. I invited these parents over to my house, I don’t know what they thought of me. They all seemed willing to come. We had dessert and Rachel and her friend Nina were totally upside down upset at what were we going to talk about. I said we weren’t going to talk about them we were going to talk about what kind of rules we had in our houses and who did what and did kids get allowance.
AS: You’re just going to get on the same page.
KSF: We weren’t going to blow their cover. Not talk about them. We were going to talk about us and how we were trying to run a home and a family. I said to Rachel and Nina, “You can come back and have dessert with us afterwards but you’re not here for this part of our meeting.” It was really productive. We really did talk about it. We went around the circle. Like eight pairs of parents, something like that. It was this little group that was running together. Yes, everybody had to be home for dinner. Yes, everybody got allowance and some got allowance for doing chores and some got allowance just because. Were their restrictions on how they used it? What time did people have to be in? What was their curfew? Did that vary by school night versus weekends? All that stuff. How that helped me was later when things were really crazy, I could stand in my kitchen and laugh because I knew that whatever was going on in my house was going on in these eight other houses in the Twin Cities. That didn’t solve the problem but it sure made me feel better. It wasn’t just Richard’s and my divorce’s from our previous spouses. We had a teenage girl. They had teenage girls and boys. 
Rachel would say as she walked out the door to school, “I won’t be home until tomorrow morning because I’m going to spend it at Elsie’s house overnight.” I’d say, “Who’s Elsie?” Never having heard from her about her before. “No you’re not.” It helped me to set some rules, boundaries about what was appropriate behavior and what wasn’t. Meanwhile what was going on in David Frank’s house was he didn’t know how to stand up to any of this. She would say, “I’m moving out.” He would call me up. I would say, “No she’s not. We’ve already decided you’re eighteen or you’re graduated from high school before you can live on your own. It’s clear to me.” I was quivering inside too. It wasn’t hard for me. I’d get back to my parent’s values. I felt like if it seemed right to me and it was respectful to other people and not hurting anybody that it was okay to be really strong and stand up to those kinds of rules. 
Besides that, my kids probably would say we had rules, they were based on let’s be respectful to each other, let’s be considerate and thoughtful, let’s live with good values. Matthew and Rachel will both tell you that I was worried about them. I’m happy to be accused of being worried. I’d rather do that than just let you go to the winds. That didn’t work out too well. Matthew was a little rebellious. Rachel in the scheme of things was probably not as rebellious as a lot of kids. Rebellious enough. I had to call the police a couple times. We went down and got her out of Uptown, that mall of Calhoun Square. We found her and brought her home.
AS: This is in the 80s?
KSF: Yes. People were buying alcohol for minors which I guess they still do. Worse maybe they’re buying heroin for minors now. She hung out at Uptown a lot. In there is another whole history, we acquired a foster daughter. It was someone Rachel knew slightly who came and spent a night at our house and the next day went home and found that her mother had moved overnight and was gone. Jennifer came back and lived at our house for the next year and a half. We had custody of her. That’s a whole other story. Jennifer was part of that group too. I had two kids, Rachel and Jennifer, who were dressing punk and going to Uptown whenever. They had to be home at certain times and if they didn’t there were consequences. I was also taking a couple of courses in youth studies at the time and working full time.
AS: Where were you working?
KSF: I was working at the University of Minnesota in the Sociology Department as the coordinator of advising in Student Services. This is where I worked for twenty-two years. I was working with college students. I had watched Karen and Susan and Helen grow up and they had their own ways of rebelling. In our house those rebellions were really minor compared to a lot of things. Rachel was the most adventurous of them all. Very creative. They were all good students. They’ve all done their own thing in their own ways. Helen, the oldest, was with us most of the time because her relationship with her mother was not good at all. She preferred not to ever go to her mother’s house. She would see her mother from time to time. She was a mainstay in our house. She left for college the August that we got married. It was her freshman year. She was home but not all the time. She would come home some weekends and she would be home for holidays and school breaks. 
A few years after all of that was going on with Rachel in high school she actually wrote Richard a letter which just to this day brings tears to my eyes. About how she thanked him for having stayed in there with her and hung in there with her. She just appreciated that. She did finish high school. With all these older siblings that all got along well together. She saw them all leaving the house and going off and doing college or whatever. She was determined to not be there anymore. She didn’t want to be the baby. She did summer school and took extra credits in school and graduated when she was seventeen and moved out and moved in with her friend Jessie. They had an apartment over in South Minneapolis not too far from Lyndale and Franklin near the Art Institute. I didn’t know a lot about what she was doing. She was initially interested in getting involved with things like massage therapy and that kind of thing. She had danced a lot through high school. Parts of high school. We’d gone on a trip to look at schools for massage. 
She decided to go to the Southwest. I don’t remember all the details of it. She fell in with a woman. I can’t remember her name. She was living in the Southwest and I went and visited her in a little town just outside of Santa Fe. They lived in a little shack up in an arroyo. I don’t know what they did for a living. I went and visited once there and stayed in Santa Fe but visited the hut. It really was a hut. I truly don’t know what they were doing for a living or how they supported themselves. I probably don’t want to know. Eventually they moved to California. Then there was a trip Rachel and I made to the East Coast to visit her grandma, her dad’s mom. I stayed friendly with her even after my divorce. Rachel told me then that she was pregnant. She was pregnant with Brianna. I hadn’t met the dad but he was living in this part of California where she and this woman had been. 
I started making some visits out there. For a while Rachel, when she was in California, was living in the mountains not too far from Reno and Tahoe in Nevada City back in the hills, not in the town. They were in a yurt and had an outhouse. I have no idea how they were making money. She was living with Kent. First they had lived in Seattle. That’s where Brianna was born. Once Brianna was born they lived in a garage that was kind of falling down. At one point Matthew said to me, “How come Rachel likes to live like a homeless person?” I said, “I don’t know.” She always was sort of seeking these creative, interesting ways of living, very challenging about how you really survive on a very basic level. Brianna’s dad was twelve years older than Rachel and had a dad who was in the framing business, picture framing, and had learned those skills. He and Rachel started a framing business in West Seattle where they lived. 
When Brianna was born, I knew something was going on but I didn’t know what it was. It was crazy. Sometimes she’d communicate well with me and sometimes she wouldn’t. I did worry a lot about her. I was working still full time and didn’t have any children at home. I tried to get out to Seattle as often as I could which actually turned out to be at least a long weekend and sometimes a week every five or six weeks. Then Matthew and his fiancée got engaged and married. Kent and Rachel and tiny little Brianna came to the wedding. Brianna was born in March and that was the following July. She was really little. At that time the behavior was just so erratic and kind of crazy. Rachel seemed her own self. She seemed a little quiet. She’d go off by herself from time to time. I loved Brianna. It was no problem for me to be in charge of her and let Rachel and Kent do their own thing. On the last day of that wedding they were needing to get to the airport and we were going to take them. I couldn’t raise them. I couldn’t get them up. They were supposed to be meeting us downstairs to get a ride to the airport and they weren’t there. They weren’t up. I couldn’t get their attention. Banging on the hotel door. I was getting frantic. Finally, Kent came to the door. Their room was a mess. I almost said to them, “If I didn’t know better I would think you were on drugs.” I didn’t say it. I thought, “How can I say such a thing?” It seems so disrespectful. It was so true. How could I even think such a thought? They bustled around and they got their things together. I don’t know how we got them to the airport but they got everything. Meanwhile Brianna was fine. She was staying with us. She was all ready to go. I was putting her on the airplane with these two people who I couldn’t even wake up. 
They went back to California and not too long after that Rachel called David and told him that she was on heroin and that he couldn’t tell me under sort of penalty of death, “If you tell mom I will never speak to you again.” 
AS: Why did she tell her dad?
KSF: I think she just had to tell somebody. I don’t know why. He struggled with that for a few days and realized he had to tell me. He did. I was just devastated. In a certain way not particularly surprised. Rachel had in high school, the time I went and picked her up at Calhoun Square...then there was a call when she had been discovered with her head in the toilet at McDonalds in Uptown having drunk a whole fifth of gin. She was totally out of it and they took her to 20-20 Franklin which is at Franklin and Cedar, the detox there. I think it was for teens. Then we put her into a program to assess her situation. This was when she was fifteen. They said, “She isn’t addicted but she has the potential for being addicted. She has some characteristics. She needs to be careful.” There was a program at South High for kids with drug problems and alcohol problems. She participated in that, a support group. I never knew very much about it. 
The following summer when she was sixteen she and a friend travelled to Europe together. She was very punk. Black leather and white makeup and black hair. She was very insulted on the way back because the customs people insisted on patting her down. She had been all the places that one goes. She’d been to Berlin and Amsterdam, all the places that one would be suspect. She and her friend were straight and she was surprised that everybody was surprised that she wouldn’t take any alcohol. In Europe you drank wine with all your meals because you don’t drink the water. She had explained to them that she had an allergy and she couldn’t drink the wine. They found other things for her. She sounded like she was completely comfortable with that. I do think she was sober on that trip. The friend she was travelling with—they were seeing a lot of family friends. To my knowledge she wasn’t drinking through high school. She had that history. To get back into that in a certain sense wasn’t completely surprising. 
She saw a counselor in Seattle who was really good. Her name was Cathy. I met her a few times. That was an important touch for Rachel. I would go out there and very often she would be sort of acting like she had flu symptoms and was really sick. Somehow she’d get herself together. I’d be there mostly taking care of Brianna and fixing some meals in this primitive kind of garage they lived in and helping with the shop. Then Rachel would go out to do an errand just before I was about to leave and she’d go and get high. She was trying while I was there to get off of her drugs. She couldn’t maintain it. I wasn’t there long enough. She did go into a treatment program for a while. I went out to try and be supportive. It was while I was there that I realized, I’m paying the rent for this shop while they get on their feet. The money that I’m paying for the rent is freeing up them to pay money for their drugs. I cut that off while she was in the program so I could tell them and they could give her the support she needs. That was really hard because I knew that was their income. They were going to lose their business if this happened. I couldn’t in good conscience continue to pay for the rent if I knew what it was going for. Basically I was buying the drugs. Rachel got out of the program and she walked across the street and got drugs. She and Brianna were in the program. 
Then she and Kent moved to central California and lived in a commune, a sort of Eastern philosophy commune. Kent’s dad was involved. They lived there for a while. I don’t know what drugs she was using. If she was off of heroin by that time or not. Kent was not. I know there was a lot of pot. I didn’t ever stay in their garage. I stayed in a motel not too far away. I would go over there in the morning. There were all these people sleeping on their couch. 
AS: Were you worried about Brianna?
KSF: I was always worried about Brianna.
AS: Are you talking about times you went out there before she had called her dad to say she was using? You’re seeing all of this behavior but you’re not aware of what it is. You’re just kind of observing.
KSF: Right.
AS: What made you not confront her when you saw, you mentioned earlier having respect for people, was that what you were trying to do? Or do you think you just didn’t want to look so hard? You didn’t want confrontation? 
KSF: I think I didn’t realize. I didn’t think about it. It didn’t cross my mind until she admitted to it. That’s when I started going, there was Nar-Anon. I forget this. At the age of fifteen when I learned that she had been drinking and she was in detox. Richard and I were seeing a therapist to sort through all this family stuff. That therapist had asked me about David and whether he had been an alcoholic. He said, “I think you might benefit from Al-Anon.” I didn’t know what he was talking about but I’ll do anything to get out of this chaos. I did start going to Al-Anon. I had been in Al-Anon not when Rachel was first discovered but shortly thereafter when there were times when she wouldn’t show up at night. I would realize there’s nothing I can do until tomorrow morning. The Al-Anon really helped me. Maybe I had been going to Al-Anon just before Rachel’s incident with detox. I remember thinking, “I don’t need to rush over there. I know where she is. I don’t need to go out looking for her.”
AS: You already had the tools.
KSF: I had the tools and I was focusing on living as healthy a life as I could. I don’t know, I can’t remember now. I don’t know if I was suspicious of her. I would worry if I wouldn’t hear from her for long periods of time. She always seemed pretty put together. I believed this flu thing. Rachel would say she had the flu and I worried about that. I didn’t ever put two and two together. I have also thought drugs are not part of my life and I think I’m very scared of them. I chose never to really read a lot about them. It’s not my life. That is an element of denial. I didn’t know that flu symptoms were an indication of someone trying to withdraw. I never saw Rachel. I would show up to help with Brianna later. Whatever they were doing with heroin earlier in the day it would have worn off. 
AS: At what point did you start the Nar-Anon in St. Paul?
KSF: When Rachel finally told her dad and her dad told me.
AS: Were they still in Seattle or were they in California?
KSF: They were in Seattle. I then waited a full twenty-four hours before I called Rachel to think how it would be best to talk to her. When I did I just started off having a conversation with her. We talked for a while, half an hour or something. Finally, I said to her. She hadn’t said anything to me. I finally said, “I understand you have something maybe to tell me.” She said, “I’m not ready to tell you.” I said, “Okay. Let me know when you are.” We talked another ten minutes and then she told me lots of stuff. I don’t remember what exactly. We had a long conversation. Then when I went out there I looked to see if there was anything. I don’t remember how I found out about Nar-Anon but I found that there were several groups. I started going to meetings every time I was out there. 
AS: While you were out there?
KSF: There was nothing here. Then because there was nothing here, this was 1996. This was when my parents were moving out of their house. I was still trying to work full time which I did until 2001. Then I took early retirement. By that time Rachel had moved back here. Rachel and Brianna were living with us. Richard had retired. He’s six years older than I am. He’d retired to do photography. I was—in 2001 I was ready to leave the U and do my own thing. I had kind of a plan for myself. In 1996 that’s when I started to go to those meetings in Seattle. In 1997, in March, I guess at the very beginning of 1997 I started looking around at the possibility of doing something here. I continued to go to Al-Anon. The legal issues which fortunately Rachel never had that I knew of, I don’t know maybe there were some. Just the impact, the intensity of it and the health risks and the death risks and the extreme money were all way greater than anybody I knew who was an alcoholic. There was some hint of something that went on at the First Unitarian Society downtown in Minneapolis. Apparently there was some man who every week, I don’t know because I never managed to get there. 
I thought why don’t I start a group? I’m finding it’s really helpful out there. I already had many years in Al-Anon. It would be helpful to me to know other people who were dealing with drug addictions. Maybe it would be helpful to others. I was in a good place myself. I looked around at possibilities and found that the Y was willing to give us a room for no charge. With two other people from my Al-Anon group, one of whom was a woman who was in recovery from an alcoholic addiction. She never really participated in the Nar-Anon but she helped us get it started. Another woman that I knew from Al-Anon and I sent out letters to therapists and churches and tried to publicize it. We put something in the Phoenix newspaper. We ran a little ad in the Southeast News. We used our own money. We picked a date and had this room at the Y reserved for us. We showed up and for about five years it was very small. The word was out but it wasn’t very out. We did the best we could to publicize it. We would have between one and five people. In the summer often I would be the only one who would show up and bring my books with me. I’d sit and read the daily reading and wait until seven thirty. If nobody showed up, I’d go home. It was a time for me to center myself. When we first going to Al-Anon we had sent the One Day at a Time Al-Anon book to our family members. We bought a half a dozen copies of it. My mother had read the whole thing in one week. 
AS: That’s funny. The day book she read in a week. It’s a yearlong day book.
KSF: Her response was, “This is a philosophy for good living.” I found that in my own life. This had helped me turn from a shrieking meanie into a person who could deal with things of great import in a thoughtful way, not denying my emotions but not letting my emotions control me. It allowed me to be in normal relationships with people in healthy ways. Having come from where I was from my childhood there was tons of stuff I didn’t know. It gave me so many options. My first Al-Anon meeting that I went to there were people who were actually laughing. Someone would say something that I could identify with about the dysfunction that I’d grown up with and people could laugh about it. For me it had always been you don’t talk about it because my house is the only house where that happens. I thought, “Wow you can get to the point where you can laugh about it.” I would listen really carefully about people would give ways that they had dealt with situations. I’d think, “I never thought of that.” I’d go home, some things I thought never would work, there were lots of things I heard and I thought, “Gosh I could try that.” 
I remember one time on the phone with my mom, we talked on the phone even though we didn’t have a very good relationship but still she was my mother. I remember on the phone once she laid into me some criticism or the other and I said to her fully expecting to be struck by lightning, I was in my breakfast nook and I said, “Mom, when you say things like that to me, it hurts my feelings.” I thought I was going to be struck dead by lightning and I wasn’t. In that conversation my mom revealed to me some things about how her relationship with her family when she was growing up. I thought, “Oh my God.”
AS: Just because you said, “When you talk like that it hurts my feelings.”
KSF: She revealed she had said that to me because whatever I had been doing made her feel insufficient somehow. What an eye opener. Those little incidents, not so little, they seemed little at the time gave me courage to practice what I was learning from my friends. I still do. I still learn from my friends every day. It has so changed me.
AS: Your Nar-Anon friends?
KSF: My Nar-Anon and Al-Anon friends. I used to spend so much of my life with the most terrible sore throat from shrieking because things weren’t going my way. I thought yelling about it would change it. I’ve apologized to my children for having done that when they were growing up. I didn’t know any better. I was doing the best I could with what I had which was lacking. Part of my amends also is to continue to live as well as I can. That’s my way of apologizing, making amends to my kids for having made their lives less than comfortable by yelling about things or trying to control things or thinking that I was doing a good job by being in their business. 
AS: Did you repeat a lot of the things your mother did? In terms of control and managing things?
KSF: I did it in a different way. I don’t remember her yelling. Yes, the control. Trying to keep things in order and make sure people did what they needed to be doing, that they were where they needed to be at certain times. That may be what my kids talk about when they say that I worried too much about them. I would express concerns about what they should or shouldn’t do to stay safe. We ate meals at pretty regular times. Even if you didn’t feel particularly well you needed to get up and go to school. That was a problem for Matthew. For years I didn’t know that he had bad stomach aches in the morning. Whether those were psychological or milk allergy we never really knew. I’d make him go to school. If he was throwing up he could stay home. And not realizing that. Eventually I think he didn’t even tell me about it because he kind of just knew he was going to have to go to school anyways no matter how he felt. I have regrets about that kind of thing. I knew what I knew and I didn’t know what I didn’t know. 
Al-Anon and Nar-Anon have been so amazing. Just hearing. Even people from extraordinarily dysfunctional situations, everyone does things differently. I can learn from them. I can apply them to a less than dysfunctional situation. There can be a lot of truth and health in what they’re doing, even trying to deal with something that’s totally nuts. I guess, deep down there’s still this little element of trying to help people and this program is helpful in trying to help people. If we continued to have meetings of one or two people, I don’t think I would have been able to. 
I am a rather stubborn person and I like to think that that stubbornness can be translated in a positive way into persistence. If I find enough satisfaction and rewards in continuing to go then I’m genuinely invested when I’m there. It’s not hard to keep being connected. Over the years, in the early years when I was seen as the leader I was the person who was there every week. Now that we have a good core of people who are there week after week I rarely am the trusted servant or the speaker or the reader. I try to sign up every once and awhile. I signed up for three weeks from now to do something on a topic. 
AS: Can we pause for just a second?
KSF: Yes.
[Break in Recording]
AS: We were talking about Nar-Anon and the benefits that it had on you. You said you started Nar-Anon in ‘97?
KSF: It must have been ‘97. I think this is the twentieth birthday at the end of this month. 
AS: So ‘97, when you started it where is Rachel and what’s going on?
KSF: When I started it Rachel’s living in Seattle. I can’t remember the order of things. In that time, she did go into treatment. Didn’t stay as long as I would have wished she could. I had no say and I knew that. She and Kent were still together. I don’t know if this was because of my Al-Anon, Nar-Anon practice or what. I love this girl and her baby and I trusted her to do whatever was best. It was her life. By this time, I had been in Al-Anon or Nar-Anon for ten years, starting when she was fifteen. This is a lot of long practice. Sitting here today I can’t tell you. I knew she was seeing a therapist. I knew she was trying her best. I don’t think she was going to any support group. I don’t know a lot about what she did because it wasn’t my business. I truly believe that she would do what was best for her. 
AS: You really took that to heart because of what you had learned in a 12-Step Program?
KSF: I think so.
AS: As a mother you were…?
KSF: I was always worried how things were going. She wasn’t living in a way that I would have dreamed for her. There was nothing wrong, it wasn’t an unhealthy way she was living but it was way difficult. Things seemed to be okay. The only I guess jumping, after they moved to central California from...I’m confused about it. In Nevada City they were living in a yurt. I also think they were connected at that time to this community. Right now I can’t put that together. They were involved with this sort of Eastern philosophy community. I don’t know what I thought, whether it was drug free. I think they went there thinking that that would be a way to get away from drugs. I don’t know if it was. I don’t think it was when they were living in the backwoods in the yurt. I’ve gotten myself off track. Where Rachel was. Then they moved to central California. Things seemed to be okay. It was more after Rachel came back here that I noticed how hard things had been on Brianna. Having parents who were not able to be fully present because of their drug use.
AS: How did she end up back here? Can you tell me that story?
KSF: Yes. They were living in Nevada City. Rachel got Bronchitis or something, she got sick. I had been continuing to go out there. They were living in a yurt and then they bought a trailer. It was stuff that was falling down. I knew how primitive they were living. Rachel got sick and was getting sicker and sicker. I was worried about them and worried about Brianna. Rachel had told me she was in a program. What’s that federal program called? Not first start. 
AS: Head Start?
KSF: Head Start program. I knew Rachel was in some kind of a program. I don’t know what my thinking was or how I got to this but decided I was going to try to talk to, I don’t know if it was something Rachel said to me. I think she gave me the name of the person of Head Start. She gave me the name so I thought I’ll call her. The woman said to me, “I’m so glad you called because you hadn’t called we were going to start Child Protection proceedings.” It wasn’t that Rachel wasn’t doing anything. I think they were starting to notice that Brianna was suffering from not having the kind of parenting that a child that is not even two years old needs. She said, “Something has to be done.” 
I got on an airplane and went out there. I told Rachel I would come out. I said, “I’ll send you airline tickets.” I had lots of miles. “Come home. Do you want to come home?” Yes, she did. “I can’t get packed.” That went on for a few days. She wasn’t making any progress getting packed. I said, “I’ll come and help you. Is that okay?” She said yes and I got on an airplane and went out and packed her up. We got on an airplane. We didn’t really tell Kent. We left a note or something. I don’t know what Rachel had told him. I didn’t kidnap them because they went willingly. I don’t think Kent knew.
AS: You retrieved them. 
KSF: We stayed one night in Reno to get our airplane back and then got on the airplane the next morning and came home and we had our friend who is a pediatrician come and look at Rachel and Brianna who were both suffering from something. It was treatable. We basically let Rachel sleep and she had been trying to get off of, I think maybe she was using marijuana, I don’t think she was using. I don’t know. In my mind it was, and I told her, “You’re welcome to stay here as long as you need to to get to a state that you need to be in and make your decision about whether to go back.” The thought was that she would go back. We had no ticket for her to return. I did say, “If you use drugs you’re out of here but Brianna’s going to stay here.” That was very clear in my mind. If Rachel decided to go back or if she decided to use that Brianna needed to be protected. That wasn’t based on anything that was true legally. I don’t think I had a leg to stand on but I said it. I believed it and I would have fought for that. When Rachel spent day after day in bed sleeping I could take care of Brianna. Brianna was quite traumatized, not quite traumatized but she was traumatized. She would get into these frantic screaming rages.
AS: Is she two or three?
KSF: She’s barely two.
AS: What year is this?
KSF: She was born in ‘95. This is ‘97 going into ‘98. I said to Rachel one day, “We think it would help if you saw a therapist.” She said, “Yes.” We’d been seeing somebody just for normal day to day things. Trying to work out my relationship with my mom who was nearing the end of her life. My craziness with my brother. I was spending more time with my parents because they were needing more help. We set up an appointment for Rachel to see Ellie. She went to see her. At some point, I don’t know the order of things, she had contacted a number of her high school friends. As she once told me they were either in treatment, in a recovery program, or dead. The people she had been in high school with. She started seeing some of her high school friends and got involved in at least two NA groups over at Fairview. One in some kind of a church in Northeast Minneapolis. I knew about my 12-Step Programs. People would call her if she wouldn’t show up for a meeting. Someone would call her, “How are you doing? Are you feeling okay? Can I come over and help give you a ride?” That sort of thing. She continued to do that. Physically she got healthy and with the therapy and NA. Then she also wanted to go back and finish her degree. She had some credits to finish. She started to look into that and eventually did that. Slowly, slowly things changed. She lived with us for I think two and a half years. Then in the meantime she had met Ed who is Malaysia’s dad. They started being together. They decided to live together. Rachel moved out. That was traumatizing for me. I was so sad. I was so attached and bonded to them. 
It was interesting because Rachel and I had had a kind of tumultuous life together. When she was really little she had certain ways of communicating that she always wanted to correct what I was saying. She had these overtones of my mother’s control and my brother’s stuff. It just drove me wild that I can’t even give you an example. Rephrasing what I had just said. It just drove me wild. I was in my shrieking mode at that point. We had a hard time when she was really little at some point, and David also pushed a lot of let’s do some psychological tests on Rachel to make sure. I didn’t think they were psychological problems. At one point we went to see a therapist at HCMC and the therapist did a workshop test. We were in separate rooms totally separately talking about what we were seeing in this particular blot and they were almost identical stories. The therapist could hardly stand it. It was so spooky. Did you talk to Rachel about this? Have you ever seen this before? It was my moment of realizing how much Rachel and I see things similarly. How alike we are in many ways. Some of our abrasion had to do with that. It helped me appreciate how close we could be if we made an effort. We spent a lot of time working on getting along. At one point I had to set a boundary for myself when we were seeing somebody. 
She had run away once and we were seeing somebody over at this place, The Bridge. We were seeing a therapist there. Rachel said something and I said, “I can’t see you for a while.” It was about being super critical of me. “I can’t see you for a while.” We had said we’d take her to work. I said, “I have to stop this now.” “Can’t you just take me to work?” “Nope. I can’t.” She was living part time with her dad. I said, “I can’t see you for a while.” That started right then and there. I just wept for hours. I remember I had an Al-Anon meeting that night. I didn’t see her for a week. I kept a journal of all the things I was thinking about. I invited her to go to a movie for me and out for chocolate afterwards. While we were having our cocoa she started in on her criticism. I said, “I’m going to take you back to your dad’s now.” It didn’t take too long for me to establish that if she was going to be critical of me I wasn’t going to be with her. We could spend really good time together. Whatever she thought about me I wasn’t going to make her not think it but I didn’t want to hear it. We worked on our relationship. 
As she got better and better, she and I both said that there were moments where what the other one was doing was driving us crazy. We knew enough to just keep our mouths shut. We knew there was enough positive there that it could get us by. Whatever was different about it was of no consequence in the big scheme of things. She’s going to do that, it’s different from what I would do and that’s fine. I guess I’ll be in a different room right now. Recognizing that it was totally appropriate of her to move. She was getting healthier all the time. She was living in this recovery community with all these wonderful, amazing people. Brianna was doing way better. I had things to do with my life. I didn’t need to be her mother all the time. I was glad she was still nearby and I could still be involved in Brianna’s life to the extent of helping with her after school care. 
That’s continued. She’s not afraid to give me feedback. From time to time she’ll say, she always prefaces with do I want to hear this. I’ll say yes. It gives me something to think about. Recently I had a little run in with Brianna. We were doing a decorating job in her house which I own. Brianna’s house. Brianna said I was making all the decisions and just asking for her opinion to be placating. I thought, “This is not true.” I sat down and wrote all the decisions we had made and ninety-nine percent of them had ended up with Brianna’s decision. One big one where I said, “It’s fine with me. It’s not at all what I would have done but let’s change this to be the way you want it. You’re living there after all.” I was feeling badly about that for quite some time. I mentioned to Rachel that I was having some communication problems with Brianna which was putting it lightly. She said something about how she could relate to that. I said, “How so?” She said to me, “At times when I was growing up I had that feeling too. That you were just placating me. You come across pretty strong. You’re a force to deal with.” I have thought about that. That was probably a month ago that she said that. I didn’t take it personally. I mean I do take it personally but in a constructive sort of way. I’m strong enough to be able to hear that about myself. I know myself well enough to know that that’s true. I’m not happy that I appear to scare people sometimes if I’m being very certain about my ideas. I come across as kind of scary. That is how I am and I need to pay attention the more that I do to how I say things. How I present things so I don’t come across as scary. 
AS: Thank you so much. Anything else you can think of? How’s your Nar-Anon group now? What’s changed in twenty years?
KSF: It’s got a nice size. If it could be helpful to more people I’d be happy about that. It seems to be some of settled at about fifteen to twenty people max who come at any given time. There are people who come back. There are lots of people who are new who do return. Some who’ve been with the group for a very long time. That’s a positive I think. I don’t know if we were in a way bigger room I don’t know if more people would come. 
AS: What changes have you seen in the kinds of situations that people are faced with?
KSF: Way more scary drugs now with fentanyl in drugs. Five deaths, three of them in Nar-Anon in the last year. Two in family friends. That happened because of drug overdoses.
AS: That wasn’t the case twenty years ago?
KSF: One family in seventeen years whose son had some serious mental illness and was in the service and was under suicide watch in the service. They didn’t pay attention enough to him. He killed himself. 
AS: You’re saying in the past three years then?
KSF: In the past two years, five people in my life. Three of them who are Nar-Anon connections. I think that it’s hard to know over the years the majority of the people in the program have had adult children that they’ve been concerned about. Just recently in the last six months we’ve had more people in relationships with their partners, husbands or boyfriends or girlfriends. Right now at our meeting the other night out of twelve people there were four who had either boyfriends or girlfriends or husbands that they’re concerned about.
AS: Whereas it had been primarily parents.
KSF: I’m comfortable however that takes it. I sometimes thought in the olden days that it might be that there were so many people in their forties and fifties and older who were concerned about children or grandchildren. That might have discouraged some of the younger people from coming. I truly don’t know whether there’s anything about that. Some of the issues are different and the option to get out of it, not that it’s easy, but the option to remove yourself from a relationship that isn’t birth related is very different. 
AS: Thank you Kathie.
KSF: You’re welcome. "

Interviewer
May 9, 2017
St. Louis Park, Minnesota
Lorraine Teel-LT
Amy Sullivan-AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan. I am Rustica Bakery in St. Louis Park with Loraine Teel. It's May 9th, 2017. Lorraine, do you give me permission to record this interview?
LT: Yes, I do. 
AS: Alright, thank you. If you could just start by telling me a little bit about your life story. 
LT: As you said my name is Lorraine Teel. I'm not from Minnesota. I was born and raised in New York just outside of New York City. I moved here last year of high school with my parents. Given that I'm now sixty-seven years old I think it's fair to say I'm from Minnesota. But I still consider myself part New Yorker. I started at the University of Minnesota very, very young. I was only seventeen. I only had done three years in high school. I immediately got caught up in all sorts of unusual activity. 
AS: How old were you when you started, or what year were you born?
LT: I was born in 1950, and I went to the U for the first time in the fall of '67. Within probably a week I was chair of the committee to end the war in Vietnam. A lot of escapades at the U. I met and fell in love with a man, and winter quarter dropped out, and got married. So I am now married forty-nine years. I will now be married fifty years to that same person. A lot of people say when they meet me, and I saw I have a forty-seven year old daughter they're like, well you don't look like it. I always say, well, she's my husband's daughter from his first marriage. That always kind of gives me some space. We got married. He was a machinist at the time we got married. 
He himself—he's very open about it—had had a drug problem as a teenager and a young adult. Back in those days in the early sixties there was really nothing, and he wound up going out to California to a program called Synanon. He was in Synanon for a year and a half in San Francisco. He came back to Minnesota to see his mother and started back at school, and that's where we met. From the very first days that we were married he talked about wanting to start a program like Synanon, and to work with people like himself who had addiction problems. I like to consider myself the original Nancy Reagan, because at the age of eighteen I remember quite distinctly saying to him, ""I don't understand. If people don't want to use drugs why don't they just stop?"" I mean I was into kind of the sixties psychedelic sort of scene, but never into any kind of heavy drugs, and I've never used anything—any kind of substance like that. 
But we were married for about two years, and a program started up here in town that was basically a bad trip center for kids that were taking psychadelics and wound up in a bad way. 
AS: Do you know what that was called?
LT: Pharm House with a 'PH'. It has morphed and changed. I think it's still in existence; it has nothing to do with substance abuse. It wound up being a residential program for adolescents with mental health problems. When we were there it was a bad trip center, and we wound up moving in. It was being underwritten and supported by the Johnson Institute, which was the originator of what is called the Minnesota Model of treatment. So the Johnson Institute, which was backed by a wealthy family, the Whitney family, Eli Whitney and his wife Irene. Irene had started this bad trip center, and they wanted to open a treatment center and eventually they did. They hired my husband and myself to work there. It became apparent that they really wanted to work with adolescents from well to do families. 
My husband didn't really want to do that. He wanted to work with street addicts. And I didn't really care. I was twenty years old. I had a brand new infant, I was like whatever. I'll go along for the ride. Ultimately he hooked up with another guy and the three of us started Eden House, which is now R.S. Eden, which is about a fifteen million dollar a year operation that started with me keeping the books on my blue jeans. Earlier it was a program solely for people addicted primarily to opiates coming back from Vietnam. For the first nine months that was who we got. We started in September of '70. April of '71 we got two inmates released from St. Cloud [Minnesota Correctional Facility]. It was the first time that the Department of Corrections had done that. They took a [unclear] of thinking, well, we'll take a chance. One of those individuals is now the president of R.S. Eden who has been clean and sober since that day that he came to Eden House. 
AS: What's his name?
LT: Dan Cainn. He would be a great person for you to talk to. He also ultimately went on to be chair of the Sentencing Guidelines Commission. He is a very well respected expert on addiction and corrections. I was his boss when I was still at Eden House. So I was at Eden House and we expanded. We had a number of different programs because it was like today with the Federal Government's response to opiate addiction where it's like, oh my God! People are using drugs! The same thing happened under Nixon. And in 1974 the National Institute of Drug Abuse did something called Rapid Expansion grants because all of a sudden they noticed, with all due respect, that white people were using drugs. And who cared before that, you know? It's identical. I've lived through the '74 thing; I've lived through the crack epidemic, and now the opiate use. It has all of the same exact hallmarks and it's just like deja vu all over again. 
So I stayed at Eden House for eighteen years. Seventeen or eighteen years, and I always argue when I left. I finally felt I had done everything I could do in drug abuse. I was very well recognized in Minnesota, and sat on a number of commissions and led a number of different initiatives, and I thought, ""I want to do something different."" I really wanted to work with people with HIV. It was late eighties. We were just coming to terms with what HIV was, and the link between HIV and substance abuse especially injecting drug use was quite [unclear]. And I thought, ""Well, what am I going to do? I'm not a direct service provider, I'm not very good.""
AS: Can I back up. So did you go back to school after you had your daughter? Can you talk about your education?
LT: Oh, yeah. After my daughter was born we were at Eden House. I didn't want to go back to school, and I didn't know whether or not I could quote unquote ""do it."" So I took a flyer on going to the University of Minnesota. They had a chem dep [chemical dependency] counselor training program—they don't have it anymore, but I went through that and became a chem dep counselor, which was when I realized I could not be a direct service provider. 
AS: Meaning you didn't want to counsel people?
LT: Right, it just wasn't my thing. In 1977, Eden House went through some real turmoil. There were three of us who had founded the organization, and I was the Program Administrator, and my husband and Chuck Beady, who was the other founder, were the co-directors. They had a split. The whole thing started to come apart at the seams. The board chair at the time was a graduate of the University of Minnesota program in Hospital and Health Care Administration. Basically, my husband said, ""I don't want to run it. I only want to work with people. I don't want to be in charge of pushing paper. I just want to work in the program."" The board said, ""Who wants to run it?"" And I raised my hand, and the board chair said, ""You need some learning."" [laughs] I went back and got my graduate and undergraduate degree at the U. I went through the programs in Hospital and Health Care Administration, and at the time it was in the School of Public Health. Then it wound up over at the Carlson School [of Management], and now it's back in Public Health I think. I got my undergraduate degree in a self-designed program through what was then University Without Walls. It's now a program in Independent Learning and also in Hospital and Health Care Administration. 
So, yes, I did finish my education, which was really wonderful. I can't say enough about that program at the U in hospital and health care. At the time it was perfect for what I needed. So when I wanted to go back to work, or after I left Eden I set up a consulting business, actually not far from here. I consulted with a lot of, at the time, a lot of—chem dep was the word—so a lot of CD programs doing their licensing, and policies. I'm an excellent paper pusher. This is my strength. [laughs] I understand all the bullshit that the government wants you to do. I know how to put it in their language, and yet have it be understandable by counselors and clients.
Myself and my business partner did lots of training in vulnerable adults, federal confidentiality. This is before I started AIDS work. I had this consulting firm, and I was very successful, but it was very isolating because my business partner worked half time as a clinical director of Wayside House. She wasn't really in the office that much. It just felt really, I was still young, and it felt really kind of lonely. I thought, ""I've got to get a real job."" Plus, at the time health insurance was becoming an issue. My husband had left Eden House after I did, about two years after I did. 
AS: How long were you at Eden House?
LT: I was there from 1970 until '87. Or '71 to '87. So a long time. By then it had expanded. It had a residential component, and then an outpatient component. We also had other things. We had a coffee house for a while. We had a program for Native youth that were inhalant abusers at Phillips Junior High. We had some programs at the women's prison in Shakopee, and the men's prison up in Stillwater. We were doing lots of stuff. At this point, Eden House had really four divisions. Substance use, which is the old Eden House, which is inpatient, outpatient program, and they have about five hundred units and supportive housing. And a corrections programs. That's where the R.S.—it's now R.S. Eden. They merged with a St. Paul corrections program called Reentry Services. The R.S. was for the Reentry Services. I know, and I hate their logo. [laughs] And everyone thinks I have so much power because I was a founder and all this. I'm like I can't get Dan to change anything. It's amazing. He and I are very, very close, and he's a wonderful person. I don't work for him, and the final thing they have is a lab, so they do a ton of UA [urine analysis] testing. 
I work in the substance use division for the individual who runs the substance use programs as a consultant. I basically told him, ""I like to think of you as the executive director,"" because he's—the administrative offices for R.S. Eden are on the north side, and he's over on Portland on the south side kind of by himself. I said, ""And you need an assistant."" And I had a lot of executive assistants. I know what they do. So, that's what I do. I write policy manuals, I develop training, I do client handbooks. I do all the stuff that he doesn't have anybody to do. So, right now I'm doing the PREA—Prison Rape Elimination Act policies for them because I can read through all this bullshit. 
I did the consulting work for a couple years. And like I said it was kind of isolating, so I thought I wanted a real job, but I didn't want to be in direct service, and the only thing—because Minnesota is a low-incidence of HIV state—there aren't a million programs. And the only thing that I would like to do is run the Minnesota AIDS Project, but somebody's doing that. And guess what? Right when I thought that, literally, he quit and went to Washington. So, I thought, ""Wow, I'm going to apply for that job!"" So I applied for the job, and in all honesty I think they were really intrigued with me because of all of the things I had done, and the fact that at the time I had also, through my consulting work, was the associative administrator of an agency called the Institute on Black Chemical Abuse, which later became the African American Family Services; now it's gone, but it was an organization founded by Peter Bell, who is a local, well known individual. Peter was a rarity: African American Republican. During the tail end of the Reagan and Bush administration, Bush won, and they sent Peter all over the world, literally, as a spokesperson on chem dep. And there was nobody left to run the shop. So I was kind of the invisible, behind the scenes person that Peter hired, because I knew him for years. 
I think the MAP board—Minnesota AIDS Project board—I kind of think they thought I was black, you know. And that's my theory. Anyways, I did make the first cut. I never thought I'd get the job because I thought they would only want to hire a gay man, or someone who had a direct connection to HIV, and I had no one in my family, and really immediate friends other than my neighbor who I knew was living with HIV. I was kind of shocked that they interviewed me. It was very formal; very different back in those days because HIV was so new. To cut to the chase I got the job. I was stunned. 
I mean, how different it was back then. When I got the job they immediately dragged me over to the Health Department to have me meet with the Commissioner of Health. I mean, now, I don't know if Linda, who is the new ED could even get a meeting with the Commissioner of Health, but I was like on day one. I mean articles in the paper about me, interviews about me, which is where I developed my favorite line, which was—you mentioned you have a daughter? When a reporter said to me from the St. Paul Pioneer Press ""You mentioned you have a daughter, and I'm just wondering could you describe your family structure?"" Which was an indirect way of everyone trying to find out whether or not I was a lesbian. My standard comeback to that question, which I have freely given to anyone else to use was, ""Never have so many people been interested in who I sleep with since my mother in 1968."" I constantly, everyone always asked. The response—people were for years—the inside joke was, ""Well have you ever seen her 'husband'? Did you know his 'name' is Pat?"" Which was back and forth from the Saturday Night Live thing. And my husband is very antisocial, and so the last thing he would ever do would be go to a MAP thing. And, at the time he had left Eden, and he started a gun store. So, I don't think firearms and MAP were—
So, it was an odd sort of time, but it was wonderful. It was a real bonding time. I think the people that were at MAP in the early days have stayed very close. I mean for a long time I felt a bit like an outsider. I started in 1990, and MAP had started—had been founded in '83, really got going in '87—‘83. 
[pause]
I was talking about how the people at MAP in the early days really bonded, although I did feel a bit like an outsider starting a few years after others, but quickly got to be kind of accepted. Part of the inside crowd, if you will. But they remained for a long time, and probably still does, an element of people who—it's the same in any field of the public professions—people who feel like they are doing God's work, and they kind of look down their noses at so-called bureaucrats who sit in the office and push paper. And I was kind of a cool executive director because I knew the streets, and I knew kind of both sides. I think I had a little more cache with the staff. 
But when I started MAP was doing—at the time it was called the IVDA: Intravenous Drug Abuse. Then that got changed to IVDU because you didn't want to make a judgment that people that were using drugs were abusers, so then it got changed to IVDU: Intravenous Drug Users outreach. Then it got shortened to IDU: Injecting drug use because not everyone was injecting intravenously, especially in the gay/bi community you had a lot of transgenders that were using hormones intramuscularly. Personally, I found the distinctions to be absolutely beyond distracting, so inside the walls of my office I referred to it as the IUD program. It just was irritating me. And you couldn't use words like I was used to at Eden House like junkie, or dope fiend, or anything because those were too judgmental. Early on that whole harm reduction meet people where they're at began to permeate the world, which I always thought was another stupid thing. 
AS: Why did you think that was stupid?
LT: Because it's like where are they at? They're over on Hennepin Avenue or Nicollet [Avenue]. I took it literally as people where they're at. 
AS: But in terms of the language? 
LT: I understand, I understand that. But as we talk about the needle exchange, I think there was a real difference between my approach and the approach of solely harm reduction because I felt that at the time, and I'm not in the field now, so I can't speak to today. 
AS: Sure, you're talking about in the nineties. 
LT: Right, but at the time there were people that were self-described harm reduction folks offered little other than clean needles to people. I wanted to offer people clean needles, and an opportunity to talk about a future. I mean it wasn't a pray before you eat Salvation Army approach, but I wanted people to know there was a way out of this lifestyle, and the choices that they were making. So, I wanted a more comprehensive approach than solely, ""Hey, ain't I cool because I talk your language, and I know what it means to fix,"" you know. I can say all the cool things that you can say. 
I also frankly felt that some of the people that were doing the work were putting themselves at risk. Sue [Purchase], who at the time was with Women With a Point, I don't know that Sue was doing it, but her partner whose name I can't remember, I don't know if she mentioned that when you met, but her partner thought it was really cool because people would call her to exchange needles. She would drive over to somebody's house and leave her kids in the car and go upstairs and exchange needles. And I'm thinking, ""Well that's great. So there's a bad drug deal that's going on upstairs, and you ain't never coming out?"" I just thought this was really not good. 
But, at the time we hadn't started needle exchange. It was just starting. The first one, which I'm sure you know, out in the Seattle area, Tacoma, that Dave Purchase started, was getting some traction. There was no Internet, so we didn't read about things on the Internet. I was active in Washington. I was on the Public Policy Committee for a national advocacy group, AIDS Action Counsel. I don't know what it's called now. It's still there, but it's not AIDS action counsel anymore. They had a policy committee, and I was the only non-coastal person that was active, and that was part of this. It was hearing from people from other parts of the country how their AIDS organizations were wanting to start needle exchange. 
At the time I had hired a guy at MAP, Bob Tracy, to do our public policy work. I had reached far into my past, and hired the person who worked with me at Pharm House back in 1970, and he had been a chem dep instructor here in Minnesota, but he had moved to San Francisco, and gotten a degree. It's a doctorate degree in human sexuality with a specialty in HIV and gay me. He was himself a former injecting drug user. He had the perfect background. His name was Dan Ford. Dan had been the director of education for the Cascade AIDS Project. He had worked for a street program in San Francisco with homeless, gay youth. He had all the perfect qualities. I called him up, and brought him back to Minnesota, which was a wonderful thing. Sadly, he passed away this past October, but he would have been a wonderful person to talk to. 
So, my policy person and Dan and I started talking about doing a needle exchange, but I wanted to do a legitimate needle exchange. I was brash enough to think I was going to get the county, or somebody in the government, to fund this. At the time the only publicly funded program was in Connecticut, and it was supported primarily because it had a very complex research component that Yale was doing. I think it was Yale. It might have been Harvard. Where they would actually barcode the needles. When they would come back into the exchange they could trace, ""Well this one was distributed at location twenty-two and it came back to location five."" And then they would analyze the residue blood in the needles to see whether there was mixed blood. To see whether or not the needle had been shared. It was a very costly kind of research program. I wasn't interested in doing something that complex because frankly Minneapolis/St. Paul did not have heavily concentrated injection areas as other communities did, and I felt we needed a mobile program. 
So, I began working with the county and talking to them about needle exchange—with the Hennepin County Public Health Department, City of Minneapolis Public Health Department, State Health Department, and I talked to the governor, attorney general because I didn't want to have it be illegal, or that the workers would be arrested. Eventually we carved out kind of an interesting piece. This was going on for a couple of years. It took about two years' planning. The piece it carved out was that there was language prohibiting the distribution of syringes except for under certain circumstances, one of which was research. It was an archaic law, and I don't know why they put research in there, but thank goodness they did. At the time the mayor of Minneapolis and the city attorney carved this out and said it would be okay. 
In the meantime behind the scenes we had Women With a Point going on kind of underground, and then there was this other guy who came to town. I don't know if they talked about him, but some character names Mike Scavuza who was from out east, and he wanted to do needle exchange because we were a bunch of straight—not in sexuality, but straight in terms of drug use—and we didn't understand what it really meant. I just thought he was a punk, and he was going to disrupt this whole, very carefully constructed house of cards I was putting together to get funding for needle exchange. The county commissioners at the time—one of whom is still on the board, Peter McLaughlin—were supportive. So, I had the support of them, and amazingly right when I needed it most into town arrived Dr. Alan Lifson. Alan is a physician, and a master's in public health, HIV specialist, came out of San Francisco, and knew all about injecting drug use. I needed that person with the right alphabet of letters, and Alan quickly supported what we were doing. He's at the U. He's continued to work a lot in HIV, particularly internationally. He was very helpful in the beginning. 
Eventually the county gave us money. I went over to Eden House, and talked to some of the clients I had known because some of these substance abuse programs kind of recycle in and out, in and out. So people I knew as clients in the seventies came back in the eighties came back in the nineties, and their kids were there or they worked there. I had them tell me—find out from them—where good places would be to have a mobile van. We needed lots of stuff. We had to get a van. Someone from the health department helped us obtain a used ambulance, and we had it retrofitted to include space to bring people into the van, do some basic education, exchange needles, have a save sharps away. Then there was a whole issue of insurance. Nobody had ever insured a syringe exchange program. The insurance agent at MAP, Vicky Freyer, God bless her soul, managed to talk an insurance company into insuring us. Because I'm thinking all the OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] issues, and you know liability issues of someone giving a needle to OD's, and whatever happens. 
So we talked through all of this. My board at MAP was a challenge because there were many people that felt like there was, if you will, the innocent people that got HIV. In the mainstream the innocent people were, you know, the people that got it because they were dentists, the hemophiliacs, or whatever. But there also were a subset of gay men who felt that, well, back in the seventies and eighties we had no idea what this was. But now, you know, we've got these junkies everybody knows. So we don't care about them, you know. So there were people on the board and supporters of MAP that left over the issue of doing syringe exchange. There were some of the staff that were afraid that we were going to have dangerous people come around. There were other staff that were thrilled. Very excited about this because up until then basically our outreach was setting up a card table on the corner of Franklin [Avenue] and Nicollet [Avenue], or going to one of the Catholic charity's branch programs. 
AS: The van gave you an opportunity beside needle exchange? It gave people condoms, or safe sex—was HIV testing ever anything you could do in the van?
LT: Yes, yes. With rapid testing later it became part of the activity. But in the early days, no, we would refer people to the red door. But, yes, absolutely. All of the syringe exchange packets that we would put together included alcohol wipes, a cotton, a cooker, a tie off, and condoms, and mint, or some kind of candy. Yes, safer sex was a really big part of it.
So everything seemed to be moving along quite well. And then we hit the road block. The road block was that a couple of the commissioners wanted to treat getting the support for needle exchange like running a political campaign. And that if we were going to go into a neighborhood with this mobile van we had to get the approval of the neighbors. And we should do that by going on a door knocking campaign. As in knock, knock, knock, ""Hi, I'm just here to tell you we want to park this out here. There will be a lot of kind of nefarious looking characters, perhaps. Don't worry. It's fine. We've got you covered."" I thought, ""This is the stupidest thing."" So, finally the door knocking campaign morphed into, ""Well, you have to get the neighborhood association approval."" 
At the time there was quite a concentration of IV use in the Whittier neighborhood. The Whittier Business Association took off with a vengeance against me. To this day my gas station guy calls me, ""Hey, it's the needle lady."" Talk radio just tore us apart. 
AS: What year is this?
LT: This was about '94 I want to say. '93, '94. I had started taking the money from the county and had hired staff, bought needles, and all this kind of stuff. And one of the Whittier guys took a van and painted all over it, ""This is your needle exchange van. Come in here. We'll kill you."" I mean stupid—it was quite ugly. We had neighbors that were in Whittier that really didn't want anything to do with us. I was fighting some of the folks up on the north side that didn't want anything up on the north side because just you white people coming up here to enable and prolong. You want us addicted to drugs. That whole line. So, I really was getting it from all sides on needle exchange. 
Finally, I just said, ""Fuck you."" And gave the money back to the county. I said, ""We'll do it on our own."" I mean at the time there was a federal prohibition on using any federal money, but there was no prohibition on using local money. So this was county dollars. And it was good money. It was one hundred thousand dollars a year, which even today it's good money. Back then it was a fortune. I said, ""Okay, never mind."" I gave it back, and said we'll do it on our own and fundraise. I don't know if MAP now gets any money for needle exchange or not, I don't really know. But when I was there, and I was at MAP from June of '90 through April of 2010 or '11, I never remember which. I always have to look at when I got my dog. I think it was '10. Twenty-one years almost. Yeah. Anyways, it was a long time I was there. It was a wonderful experience. 
So we hired folks to come and be in the van and drive around. We had certain set spots that we would go to. They new the other people like Sue, and others that did syringe exchange. And I think they got along pretty well. I think at that time Sue might have already started Access Works, I don't remember when that started, which was a storefront exchange program. Our mobile van I think was really effective because we could move as the population moved. For example, up on the north side for a while we were parked outside Lee's Liquor Bar up on Glenwood [Avenue], and then we moved over to Mervin's Drug Store up on Broadway [Street]. So we could move the van around. We had a good relationship with the police because I was worried. 
AS: How many hours a week was the van out? Do you remember?
LT: It was out Monday through Friday. I don't remember how many actual hours. 
AS: At night?
LT: It would usually not be late at night because of the safety concerns. And obviously not too early in the daytime because nobody's up. So I would say probably, gosh, I really don't remember so I don't want to make a mistake. But I want to digress to one fascinating story was that in 1993, Dan Ford and I from MAP, Dan and I went to the International AIDS Conference in Berlin. We stopped in Amsterdam because they had a very robust needle exchange program. We met with the drug czar, or I don't know what his official title was, but a government person in Amsterdam. And back in those days everybody and their mother was going to Amsterdam to find out how to do a needle exchange program. And he said something to me that stuck with me to this day. That was, ""I can't believe how stupid you Americans are."" He said, ""You are treating this problem of addiction like you're ordering off a Chinese menu. I'll have one from column A, and nothing else."" He said, ""You can't just have a needle exchange program absent a comprehensive approach to addiction. You can't just come here and copy this, and think it's going to make a difference because it won't."" Of course we didn't really care. 
I mean in America everything is so siloed. I mean addiction people hated needle exchange. Harm reduction. Because it was enabling, and it caused all kind of bad stuff. So, I didn't know how we could integrate the two, even though I came out of substance abuse, and people knew what I was doing. I mean I was getting a lot of calls from friends of mine in substance abuse that were chem dep back in those days like, ""What the hell are you doing?""
AS: What would you say to them?
LT: I would give them the shtick about, look, it's a journey. Addiction is a journey. People are going to stop at some point. They are going to stop because they are in the joint, or they die, or they just suddenly wake up and say, ""I don't want to do it again,"" or, in very rare cases, treatment works. So in all those cases where people stop using I don't want them to be HIV positive. I would say, ""It's that simple,"" you know. I don't want them to end their addiction and then die because there were no long-term survivors from the HIV. And that seemed to resonate with people, that there was a way out of addiction, and that maybe this would keep them from having that terrible plague. 
And so that seemed to alleviate some of the concerns that people had. That was how we managed to kind of get it going. It morphed a lot over the years. We had a lot of different staff. It's hard work. It's really hard work in the needle exchange. There's a lot of turnover because you tended to have either people who were in recovery themselves. Because it's not good work for people not in recovery. And it takes a certain type of person in recovery to not all of a sudden to be running into all their old friends, or to suddenly want to go back to that life. So it really was kind of dicey. We lost some people who did return to that life. And then we had other people who were like do-gooders, you know. We called them the 'cupcakes' who wanted to help other people, you know, and had no idea what they were getting into. I was always struck—there was a story, I think, I can't if it was New York, West Coast, East Coast—but there was some male researcher who was doing research on needle exchange, PhD, and he got hooked and died of an overdose. I was always struck by ""I don't want that on my watch."" You know, somebody that I brought in that had never seen this life before suddenly became part of the hair club for men, you know, they're going to try it themselves. It's such a good product. 
AS: So that started to weigh on you?
LT: Yeah, yes. 
AS: How many years in?
LT: I would say pretty much from the beginning. I was always concerned about the staff. Much more than the outreach staff that worked gay bars, you know. The issues I dealt with outreach staff—usually young, gay men—who went and did education at that bars, or a public sex spot. What's the worst thing that's going to happen? They're going to engage in sex? You know. And whether they use a condom or not that's their choice, but they understand. But addiction was something that was much more seductive. 
But there was always a split I think in the local needle exchange world between MAP and the Access Works type programs that felt they were much closer to the street, if you will, than MAP was. I think at some point when Sue left Access Works, I don't remember what year that was, and a staff person from MAP went and was hired as the ED, and eventually the place was in turmoil. I don't know enough about what happened internally, but it was going to fold. So, there was the question of could it merge with MAP, and eventually we did take over. We didn't change the name. We didn't call it the Access Works MAP program. The MAP program was called Mainline, and is still called Mainline, which is kind of a play on words because obviously people mainline the heroin, or opiates, or other drugs, but there was a local individual who I think died around '96 or so, a real advocate for needle exchange, named Bill Main. Bill had contracted HIV by getting a needle from a sharp supply container in a hospital or clinic or somewhere. Even though he didn't like MAP, he didn't like me, he thought I was too distant from the real life, I wasn't a junkie like he was, I was just a straight woman, you know, I wanted to name the program—I'm very big on history. It's my big—I'm a total history nut. So, I wanted to call it Mainline, and it still is called Mainline. Most people have no idea, unfortunately, that it's named after Bill Main. 
So that was part of the story, but the other part of the story that I want to share with you was how we legalized needles in Minnesota because prior to 1998, I believe, possession of syringes was illegal in Minnesota, and purchasing syringes was illegal in Minnesota. So you had all kinds of junkies who wanted to buy needles who had great stories they could tell. Go in the drug store, ""My aunt is here, she's diabetic, she just arrived in town."" My favorite was, ""I'm doing some repair on the coffee table and the veneer came off. I want to shoot some glue under the veneer."" The one I heard from my husband that nobody else has ever confirmed, but I love it so I always told it, was at—because he liked to fish—they could use the syringe to inject the worm, so it would get air so it would float off the bottom. Right! What a tip! You heard it here first. People loved that kind of thing. I thought, ""Let's find out how to make purchasing needles legal in Minnesota. We can do it."" And we did. 
By that time Bob Tracy, who did all the policy work for MAP, was very well known at the Capitol. He more than most other people had a way of endearing himself to even his worst enemies. Very smart. He works with Minnesota Council on Foundations now. Bob Tracy. And Bob knew how to get an idea into a law, and that ain't easy because besides all the sponsors, and getting it through the whole eighty-five thousand committees, and doing the financial note on it, and all the mark-ups, et cetera, et cetera. Bob shepherded through this idea that we would get legal syringes, and it was quite an exciting time. It had gone through a number of hearings. We had one more committee that we had to get through. There was just total opposition. The committee was very divided; especially the rural DFLers were not in support. 
We had created through MAP a very robust network of advocates throughout the states. One of the advocates that we had was an individual living with HIV from northern Minnesota who had contracted HIV when he worked on an oil rig, and apparently injecting dope is kind of a past time on oil rigs, I didn't know this. So you can't go to the drug store, so there's a lot of needles sharing, so that's how he had become HIV positive, come back. He's got a wife and kids, and you know, and the house with the picket fence. He met with his representative from northern Minnesota, and she changed her vote. And we won by one vote. I always like to tell that story because it is the power of one. It really was the power of this one guy. So following that, and to this day it is legal in Minnesota to purchase and possess up to ten sterile, clean syringes. And as I told people if they are dirty, I mean if you have used them and there's dope in them then it's paraphernalia. All bets are off and I'm not coming to your defense. 
Then the world started to change a lot. This legislation was in '98. We ran into problems with the Health Department because I think the legislation had something about disposal of the syringes. Well then every diabetic in the state of Minnesota had up until then was having to pay, and now they're mad because if you're a dope fiend you get to throw away your needles for free and I've got to pay to have sterile sanitation. So we are just going to bring them to MAP. And it was like, I'm not going to pay for every syringe. So we got into big arguments with the Health Department. I don't remember how it got resolved, but basically it's resolved. So, yeah, that was '98.
I think from that point forward, once it became where you could legally purchase syringes—I didn't change my opinion that needle exchange where you get free needles—I still think that's a good idea, but for god's sakes if you can walk into a drug store, Walgreens, and buy needles I don't need to have my van out there twenty-four hours a day. I mean come on now. I know you want to save all your money for dope, but you could do like three bucks for a ten pack of syringes. I had some strong judgments about that. I mean every—
AS: Is that kind of when you ended the needle exchange?
LT: Well, no, I never wanted to end it. And what happened with the van, I don't really know. The van was still going when I left MAP. It is not going now, and they're needle exchange now is out of a church. Yosemite church? And it's, I think, open three days a week a couple hours a day. So, that's one place people can go. I think Pillsbury has some transgender clinic, shock clinic. And I don't know, I think there are some free lancers here in town. [unclear] And, I think because they're legal there's less pressure to have eighty-five thousand needle exchanges. 
And Minneapolis never was, as I stated earlier, never had a huge concentration like New York, or New Haven, or Seattle, or San Francisco. We don't have the tenderloin district. And it's a pretty mobile population. In fact, we found that a lot of the exchangers we had were secondary exchangers that were coming in from Waseca, Waconia, Coloquet. And one guy would get all the dirty needles and bring in liter bottles, or two liter bottles of Diet Coke, filled with needles because he collected them from the last month from wherever, whatever period of time. Not necessarily a month. He'd pull up over at MAP. And I had a corner office that had windows by the parking lot, which the smokers used to hate because I'd tap my watch while they were out there smoking. Anyways, I would see people pull up because one of the sites we used was the MAP parking lot. I would see these pick up trucks pull up, quite rural looking, and some obviously non-metro looking kind of person (she said very judgmentally) [narrator says this about herself] would get out of the car, or the truck, and they would have bottles full of needles. 
AS: And then you disposed of them?
LT: Yes, we would pay to dispose of them. I know that one of the workers told me that when he was parked up by Louie's Liquor Bar it was very common to get businessmen from downtown that would come with a briefcase full of needles. And many of them would, I mean the way I told the story which was I'm sure embellished—well I know it was embellished—was that these were businessmen and it was lunchtime and they told their secretary, ""I just have to go drop off some dry cleaning,"" and went over to Louie's Liquor Bar driving in their beamer and open their briefcase and they'd have a baggie full of needles. And I know they are down there and going home at night and there's nobody in their family who has a clue what they're doing. 
I think all of us that worked in HIV—if you had half a brain—and there were a lot of people who worked in HIV that did not have half a brain, but if you did have half a brain, I think you felt some compassion, some even guilt at times that you were enabling. That here was this guy that was shooting up. When you're not open is he risking sharing needles with others, and then sexually exposing his partner? So there was a lot of, at times, angst about the whole game of addiction. 
And then I think some of my hesitancy around the harm reduction piece because I get the 'meet people where you're at,' but I want to show people that there's also another way. And treatment by any shot is not a miracle. And treatment doesn't work very often. I mean I'm the first person to acknowledge that, but it shows you that there is another way, and you never know when you're going to wake up. I always remember there was a client in Eden House one time. It was when Eden House started. It was a really tough program along the Synanon model where you'd shave people's heads, and there were costumes, and you'd put people on so-called trips, and different things. It was pretty harsh. And we were getting guys out of the joint right and left. I mean very serious offenders. I remember one guy came to Eden House, and he said in his intake group, ""I don't care what you do to me. You can shave my head, make me wash dishes, make me peel potatoes, you can make me edge the lawn with a spoon, and I'll scrub the bathroom floor with my tongue if you want. I'm never using drugs again."" And he never did. And he was really only sort of half-heartedly in groups, but he went out, he was done with Eden House, and he got a job with the City of Minneapolis. Retired. And to my knowledge, I mean I don't know if he drank, but he never became a junkie again. But that's a very rare case. 
Treatment is kind of like a wash, rinse, repeat sort of episode, but it does work. Whether it's a hundred percent sobriety, or eighty-five percent sobriety, or if it's even, and I get that now we're going down the harm reduction road, but there's some point at which at least let people know there's an option. And hopefully the only option that they're option is not methadone or Suboxone. Those to me are temporary kinds of options. I'm not a big proponent. I mean I know I have some friends who have been on methadone for thirty years on a very low dose, but I wish they weren't. That's where I sort of parted ways with the whole—plus there was this whole attitude of the folks that worked street outreach that, ""We're so cool. We're the cool kids."" After a while that just sort of wears on you. You know? Only because I've been around the block for so long, and I've seen this movie. I lived through the returning Vietnam vets, opiate addiction, the crack problem. This sudden, ""Oh my God, people are using opiates. Wow. How'd that happen?""
AS: Then it goes mainstream. What do we do? Yeah. 
LT: That's kind of my story with that. When I left MAP, I mean honestly the reason that I left MAP was I had never taken a vacation at home. My husband and I always went somewhere on a cruise—a blue's music cruise. Only blue's. The whole ship! It was fabulous. We had a policy at MAP with vacation the use it or lose it. It didn't roll over year to year. So everybody in December was gone. And I was never gone in December because somebody had to hold the ship down. And December—that's why I think I left in '11. It doesn't matter. Whatever. One year I said, ""I'm taking the last two weeks of December off. And there's no cruise so I'm staying home."" I stayed home, and I was stunned by how disabled my husband was. He had had a number of strokes, and in 2009 he had a major stroke in April. I had stayed home for a couple of weeks. I had obviously seen these changes in him, but then I didn't really ever take the time to observe it. And during those two weeks that I was home it suddenly occurred to me that my tombstone was going to read, ""She cared more about MAP than she did her husband."" And so I thought, ""This is not good. This man really needs a lot of help."" And to this day he does. And so I left whenever it was that I left. 
But I was only home for a short time before I thought, ""This sucks."" And I had been a consultant, a 1099 person before, and so I talked to Dan over at Eden House, and I said, ""Let me do the AIDS education with the clients because you guys are doing needles. They're bad stay away. Let me teach people, because you know they're going to fuck up when they leave here. You don't want them to come back."" So I started doing AIDS education with the clients. I was referred to as the butt-fucking lady with the clients. Yes. Because most addicts that come in from the streets and you talk about anal intercourse they don't know what you're talking about. 
So I started off doing AIDS education with the clients, and then slowly started doing some other grant writing for them, and now as I said, I work a set number of hours, usually fifteen, twenty hours a week. I get paid to do all their policies and stuff. They have the stupidest AIDS policy ever, but their HR department developed it because they were in a lab there are a lot of OSHA issues. But there're eighty million needle sticks or paper cuts, and all kinds of crap. I mean when I worked at MAP I referred to it as the ‘what if’ questions. ""How do you get HIV?"" You can talk all you want about sexual harassment and sharing needles, but inevitably people would always be like, ""What if? What if a guy with AIDS worked in my office? What if he touched a piece of paper and got a paper cut? What if I touched that piece of paper?"" My favorite was—this was true—was somebody asked the question, ""What if I was in a swimming pool? What if there was a guy in the pool that had the AIDS? And what if someone threw a cat in the pool, and cats hate water. What if that cat scratched that guy? And what if I tried to get the cat out of the water and the cat scratched me?"" I said, ""Well, probably what if a truck right now driving down Park Avenue filled with cattle fell over and a cow fell through the roof and hit you in the head?"" It would be the same level of risk! You know.
AS: That was a crazy time. 
LT: It still is a crazy time. I think it really is. I think people are a little bit better because I think where it got screwed up was with the Surgeon General's thing in '88 when Everett Koop sent out that thing about bodily fluids, and it was trying to get passed the 'bodily fluids.' And here in Minnesota in the early nineties, and I don't know if you are aware, we had a couple of doctors who were HIV positive, and one of them, he's dead now, Dr. [unclear] Benson, he and his partner, business partner who also had HIV, but let's not draw any conclusions, had a small family practice clinic. Dr. Benson delivered one of his patient's babies, and his dad used a brand new technique of video taping the birth of his child. He and his wife had been quite concerned because he and his wife had noticed that Dr. Benson had been losing a lot of weight, but Dr. Benson had told them whatever he told them. But when they took the videotape, Dr. Benson was not wearing gloves, and his arms and hands were covered with open sores. Yes. That video tape blocking the child birth portion of these hands was shown endlessly, and it resulted in a tremendous move to test physicians, nurses, and it was like where are you going to stop? Daycare workers? Teachers? I was the only voice, honest to God, the only voice on this statewide committee that opposed it. I remember saying to them—one of the reasons you had to know if your doctor had HIV even if they were using universal precautions that was offered was, well you know one of the ways HIV manifests itself is dementia. AIDS related dementia. So you could have a doctor with HIV; you could have AIDS related dementia. You can have any freaking doctor with dementia. Are you going to start testing every doctor over the age of fifty for early onset? To which there was no answer. 
We still have now pretty strict laws in Minnesota about physicians and nurses in particular. If you are HIV positive you have to self-report to the licensing board. There has to be someone in your practice that monitors you. There are certain—I don't know if there are certain things anymore, again I'm not current with it, but there were certain procedures that you could not be involved in. 
Now when Dr. Benson did that universal precautions were not universal. They were voluntary. But between his case, which went national, and the case of the dentist in Florida, who infected Kimberly Bergalis, and a bunch of other people—because of those high profile cases universal precautions became universal. I remember even back in those days when I went to the dentist and they said, ""Where do you work?"" And I told them, ""Oh my God."" Out came the masks, the gloves with the assumption being that if you work with them you've got to have it. I mean we couldn't even get pizzas delivered. I'll never forget that. The pizza guy would leave pizzas—the UPS man wouldn't come in. So, it really was quite stunning the early days of HIV. I don't think people really realize.
AS: It's easy for people to forget, especially people who didn't live during it. Like people twenty years younger. 
LT: But for me it was nothing different than the early days of trying to work with junkies because like why would you want to do that? Who cares about them? Let them die. And to some extent I think that still is true. I think there is more support and empathy now for people living with HIV than there is even for people who have addiction problems. Although people in recovery have been lionized. That's the other part I hate about addiction is you get all of these clowns that get out of treatment and they're out of treatment like one second and they're an expert. And that irritates me more than almost anything else. I've spent my lifetime understanding the dynamics of addiction.
I personally don't buy into the disease model of addiction. I think it's a learned behavior. There may be a genetic component. I certainly believe that. But, I think it's a learned behavior to cope with mental health challenges, or environmental challenges you have be they abuse, neglect, violence, trauma of growing up in a dangerous environment. But people use as a means of escape. And they start using as young people, and when they suddenly get to be twenty, twenty-one they are like a ten-year-old. And now they're forty and they are still like a ten-year-old. And I think they need to learn how to grow up. 
I think within treatment these days the approach is that we've got to change your feelings, make you more empathetic. I think that's bullshit. Most of these addicts are pretty hardcore, and the best way to change is you change your behavior. Act as if you care about somebody. We know you really don't care about your roommate, and you think he's a loser. Just pretend like you do. And if you practice long enough it will become internalized, and you will slowly notice your attitude's changing. So, first your behavior, and then you attitudes, and eventually you really get emotional feelings out of that. That was the essence of Eden House. It no longer is, which is sad. I feel—
AS: What is the essence of it now?
LT: It's much more of an AA model, and they have to abide by all the ASAM standards. What is it? American Society of Addiction Medicine. It has to be in effective behavioral intervention as approved by ASAM. It has to be trauma informed. I mean it's all these buzz words, and it's like, ""Jeez Louise. You've got a bunch of emotional babies here that they don't know how to be an adult. They've never been an adult. They've never been raised responsible. Let's just start getting them—"" We had an early client at Eden House and he was a Hispanic guy. He always used to say—the saying in Eden House was, ""It's not you man, it's your behavior."" And used to say, ""It's not Jew, man. It's your behavior."" And I always loved that being Jewish. 
That really is a [unclear] behavior. I'm not attacking you, I care about you. But the behavior that you're exhibiting of stealing money, of hurting other people, whatever it is to keep your addiction alive. I don't like that, and I think that sucks. And I want you to change that. And I want you to do it because I care about you. And, you know, ""Well, nobody's ever cared about me."" So, I think there's a different approach, and they try to blend it still somewhat at Eden, but it's very hard. 
AS: To keep the older model you mean?
LT: Right, well everybody who works there has to be an LADC, a licensed alcohol and drug abuse counselor. And most people in recovery don't have the ability or the background to go to school and become an LADC. So, you have a lot of particularly young women, young men, who want to be a social worker, and then become an LADC. I actually feel a little bit bad that during my brief stint between the Eden House and MAP when I was a consultant that I was the one who drew up the guidelines that became the licensing of alcohol and drug abuse counselors. At the time it was credential through the Health Department and I created that. I created it for the state. I brought together—
AS: Why do you feel bad about that?
LT: Because I think this whole ""you need an education"" is not the only way. I mean there are lots of people who come out of Eden House who would be wonderful counselors, but they can't go to school and get a bachelor's degree. I mean there was a time at Eden House where the only people we hired were graduates. And there were a lot of problems with that, but now they rarely if ever can hire a graduate of the program—they have one guy right now. One. Out of like twenty staff. Well, there's more with the CD tax, but in terms of being a counselor, I think there are like twenty counselors, and only one of them is a graduate of Eden House. 
I look at someone like Dan Cain who pulled himself out of this addiction. I mean he was a hardcore heroin addict, and he had been in Lexington [Kentucky, Narcotics Farm] through their program. He's done wonderful. Well, that's my story. Is there anything I missed?
AS: I don't think so. 
LT: I appreciate the opportunity."

AS: We are in Baden?
AT: We’re in Wettingen.
AS: Wettingen.
AT: Next to Baden.
AS: Today is February 16, 2017. This is Amy Sullivan. I’m with Dr. Andrew Tuttle. Would you just say your name?
AT: My name is Andrew Tuttle. I explicitly give Ms. Amy Sullivan permission to record what I’m saying. 
AS: Thank you. I wonder if this is picking you up. I might put it on top of this, is that okay?
AT: Sure. 
AS: What I was telling you earlier is I like to start with your childhood, where you grew up, your family, some of your childhood experiences. How you ended up here, where you were born, stuff like that. 
AT: Do you want me to just go? Okay. I was born in Minneapolis in 1952. I was the only child of my parents then. We lived on Oliver Avenue in Kenwood in Minneapolis. It was a nice, modest house there. My father worked in the M.A. Gedney pickle packaging company. He later becomes the CEO. My mother then was not employed. She was a mother and a housewife as much as I remember. She had been to college and was a very well educated person. She’d gone to college. She majored in English literature. She was very well read and well spoken. 
AS: Where did your folks meet?
AT: I don’t know. I think it was a family thing. The parents on my mother side belonged to a certain social circle that knew each other. As well as my grandparents went to places like Minikahda Club. Somehow a connection occurred there. My knowledge of exactly how that occurred is kind of sketchy. Now my father has died. Anyways, the way I remember those first years is rather difficult. I have nice memories. My father and my mother and being tickled and stuff like that. But I also remember them fighting viciously, verbally. 
AS: Even as a young kid?
AT: As a very young kid. I think this was at a stage where I hadn’t completely stopped wearing diapers, two or three or something like that. Definitely before kindergarten. I have scenes in my head of standing at the top of the stairs just watching my parents just rip each other’s throat out.
AS: Were they physically abusive?
AT: No. It was verbally. I was a difficult child. Retrospectively I most certainly had ADHD. I was unmanageable. My parents constantly got calls from kindergarten. Later on I spent most of the time in the principal’s office in grade school. I was disruptive. Give me a hammer I’ll attack the front walkway of our house and see how easy it is to break concrete apart. Bicycles, or a car I can let the air out of the tires. I was a troublemaker. I got into fights and was just hyperactive. I was all over the place. 
AS: Were you still watching your parents fight at this point?
AT: That’s not that central. More central is the way that I met disapproval with adults. Actually kids of my own age who knew that they could get me to do stuff. Then they’d go tell on me. 
AS: You were that kid. 
AT: It was kind of a formative experience because I felt myself being that troublemaker and that guy who could never do something right. I think fortunately I was intelligent and could pick things up quickly. I remember my dad once, this must have been before I was six and half or seven years old because that’s when we moved to California, he was just absolutely beside himself because I’d taken some tools and taken his bicycle apart. That’s kind of a memory I can chuckle about now but at the time it was, “I’m just trying out these tools. Why are you mad at me?” We moved to California before I was seven or after seven. I had just started first grade in Minneapolis and we moved to California and I continued first grade there. We lived in Berkeley where my mother worked. This was after my parents got divorced.
AS: When did they get divorced?
AT: They got divorced in Minneapolis. Just after they got divorced my mother moved with me to California where her parents had moved to previously.
AS: Your father didn’t move to California?
AT: No, this was just my mother. I moved with her to California. First we stayed with my grandparents there, my aunt and uncle who were still adolescents at that time. A very big age difference between my mother and her sister and her much, much younger brother who was four years older than me. He wasn’t even in his teens when we moved there. He was still a kid. 
We quickly moved to Berkeley where we had an apartment. My mother worked in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory up on the hills of Berkeley as a librarian. That’s where she met my later step-father who was working there as a nuclear physicist. They had a relationship, got married, and in 1962 we moved to Switzerland which was an adventure in itself. We came by boat from San Francisco. A steamer that went through the Panama Canal and across the Atlantic Ocean and across France with a steam engine. 
AS: Was he Swiss?
AT: No he was German, from Munich. 
AS: Is your mom American?
AT: Yes. So is my dad. My mom had her roots in Ireland and Scotland. My dad’s ancestors come from Southern England. 
Anyway, we got to Switzerland and I was nine years old. I have a late birthday in December. I’m actually a year younger than the year I’m living in. I became ten in that year but we moved here in Spring. We very quickly moved to a very small farm village in Switzerland where I was in school with the only Swiss students, pupils. It was still an adventure because here I’d come from urban Berkeley to this tiny Swiss village where most of the kids who came to school were farm kids. After school we could wander over to the farm. We could watch their parents milking the cows and help them gather cut grass from the fields to feed the cows with. I just thought it was really cool. Within a three minute walk you could be in the woods and the forest. If you walked you would come to a little lake and you could go swimming there and jump off the limbs of trees into the water. It was cool. 
My stepfather was a passionate mountaineer. I have to credit him with introducing me to the Alps. We did a lot of Alpine tours and not actual climbing but long, long several day tours up high over glaciers and staying in Alpine cabins. That’s where I gained my own passion. Later on I became a rock climber and did a lot of rock climbing and mountain climbing and stuff like that. I still love going up in the mountains and taking long hikes. He was also a difficult guy and my mother was a difficult person. She was the central person for me throughout my childhood, right up to my early twenties, I was very focused on her and very emotionally. She was the person I’d lived with all my life. Only now with a certain temporal distance and knowing what I know about psychology and dealing with life myself, I know that she was a very, very emotionally difficult person. One that could get somebody to fight with her. They did. With my stepfather it became physically violent. I witnessed her being beat up a lot. He was a brilliant scientist, well liked.
AS: Did he work at the technical place?
AT: He worked in conjunction with the Swiss Institute of Technology. He was building what today is known as the Pau Scherrer Institute. Then it was the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research. A short way from here they constructed a cyclotron and now they have a bevatron and a synchrotron. It’s a big nuclear research facility that he oversaw the development and construction of. He was a prominent physicist in his field then. He also drank pretty heavily. They fought viciously almost every night. Occasionally it would escalate to physical. 
AS: By this time, you’re ten? Eleven? Was this happening when you had moved here or was it before?
AT: They were verbally fighting before. Right from the outset they were verbally fighting. I did not enjoy all of the stress. In my mid-teens I started detaching myself from them. 
AS: They stayed together?
AT: Yes, she had three more children by him. Three half-sisters of mine. The middle one, the second one suffers from Downs Syndrome. She lives in a supervised living situation here in Wettingen. My oldest sister, Christa, she lives not far from here. She’s very much like my mother. She’s a difficult person. She’s one who’s kind of emotionally unstable and will very quickly take offense at something you say that she interprets in a certain way. She’ll start attacking you back. Most of her boyfriend relationships have been characterized by a lot of fighting. 
That’s kind of how I see my mother now from this point in life. She was a difficult person. If my stepfather beat her she sure knew how to get him to beat her. Nothing justifies each other but it’s kind of something that you can’t just see unidirectionally. I don’t think he really was that kind of person. He never touched me. He was always very correct, very fair. That made it difficult for me to relate with him. I saw him beating up my mother but my relationship was sort of okay. What am I supposed to feel or think? It was very confusing. He was actually a good guy but he really destroyed a lot of stuff. 
My attention deficit disorder sort of abated. I was able to adapt to the Swiss school system. My antics were a bit, for a while, kind of legitimized because I was a foreigner who didn’t know how to behave. I very quickly learned the language and thought living here was just so much great fun. School was kind of cool too. It was this Little House on the Prairie type school with three grades in one room. The teacher was really good. He was the kind of person who had a very firm authority but in a way that was gentle. Everybody just sort of naturally did what he wanted.
AS: Even you?
AT: Yes. 
AS: Interesting.
AT: In those times corporal punishment by teachers was not forbidden here. I got him once to the point where he took me out of the classroom, not in front of the other pupils, and slapped me. That’s really not the kind of teacher that he was. The teacher upstairs, it was known that he kept a hazel switch in the corner which he liberally used on students. That was the 60s. That was when we lived in the Zurich region. A few years after I had completed grade school we moved into Wettingen, here, which is a different canton and has a different school system. I was able to from the so-called second fahrschule, the sort of midlevel middle school in Zurich which actually is a little bit higher than the secondary school here, at that time was at least, and moved into the mittelschule which was the upper tier.
AS: When you were talking about how kids could move up earlier that’s what you meant.
AT: I was a whiz in things like, I picked up things easily.  I never had an easy time doing homework. I was horrible. I would always find excuses not to have done my homework. In classroom I could pick up things really easy. Languages and math. I was really good at math. The teacher was impressed. I was able to move along without much effort which isn’t the best attitude academically because even if you can learn things easily you should do some work and apply yourself and study stuff. I didn’t. I was able to weasel my way through. I made it into the canton schule, the one that ends with an equivalent of a baccalaureate. They have three divisions, a natural science division, and a modern language division and one of the classic languages. We had to do Latin or Greek or stuff like that. I did the natural sciences division because that’s something that I found easy. I was able to complete that school. 
During the first year of that school I actually went to America and visited my biological father there. I was sixteen. I complained, “Oh God it’s so awful.” I hated living with my parents here. He offered that I could stay with him. I did, which backfired completely because from the Swiss school that I had been in, which was kind of easy going, students were allowed to smoke in recesses and stuff like that. He put me into this college preparatory school, Blake. I was supposed to wear a tie in the morning. I was just so alienated by that. I just sort of mentally left the whole scene. I went to school every day but I was just sort of sitting there. After eight months…
AS: You didn’t fit in socially?
AT: I didn’t fit in socially. None of the students lived nearby where I was living anyways. Everyone was driven there or drove there themselves from various parts. Most of them were from Edina or something like that. We were living in Kenwood. I barely had any social contacts.
AS: And you got plopped down when those kids had been together for years.
AT: Yes. I was able to speak English as a local. Nobody realized that I had a reason to have a hard time adjusting or anything like that. It was expected that I was able to do all this stuff which I was confused by and alienated by. After eight months I should have talked with my father about it but was somehow unable to at that age and stage. I ran away. I was able to scrounge up the money to get a Greyhound bus to Chicago. In Chicago I hitchhiked out to Deerport and presented a sob story to the Swiss people there. That I’d been stranded in America. They put me on a plane. They could confirm that I actually had parents there. They put me on a plane back to Switzerland.
AS: Who paid for the ticket?
AT: My mother and stepfather eventually.
AS: You didn’t even say goodbye to your father? 
AT: I did later.
AS: Were you getting along with him?
AT: Yes, I was but I just felt so lost and misunderstood. 
AS: He had other children?
AT: I actually felt that this was my personal failure. I had asked to stay with him and now I was failing him and not fulfilling his expectations or anything like that. It felt awful. 
AS: Had he remarried?
AT: Yes, and already had Karl, my brother, and Jeff. John I’m not sure. No I don’t think he was born yet. Back in Switzerland I dived into the 1970s psychedelic hippie stuff. I dove. I consumed a lot of cannabis and LSD and stuff like that. The whole psychedelic thing. I don’t think I ever overdid it. 
AS: Were you living at home then?
AT: I was living at home which I did for another year and a half. When I was nineteen a buddy and I were able to rent an old dilapidated farm house a short way from here that had cold water and an outhouse out back for like a hundred buck a month. That was affordable. I said, “Bye Mom” and just moved out. I moved together with him and completed my school from there. I took a year off and worked on construction. I travelled some, rode my motorcycle a lot. I had a big old beautiful 1951 BMW. I rode all over Europe. Around Italy and Sardinia and places like that. 
AS: By yourself?
AT: By myself or with someone. I always have had kind of a tendency to travel on my own. I grew up as a single kid essentially even though I have a lot of half-brothers and half-sisters. I never felt like I was really brothers and sisters with them. They were age wise so far apart. I was the only link between my biological father and my biological mother. I almost kind of saw myself as a single kid. I knew how to be alone. Travelling alone, I have travelled with other people before. If nobody is available wanting to do the same thing I just go by myself. You always meet people along the way. 
AS: Is that when you went to Bangkok?
AT: When did I go to Bangkok? No, I’d already started medical school. I did a lot of travelling. A year after I completed the local high school, the gymnasium, I went to medical school together with the guy I was living with, Chris. He later became an anesthesiologist. It was a great time. Medical school was fun. I extended it by a year because I didn’t want to get stressed out in having to complete it in just six years. I took a lot of time off in between to travel. That is the time I went to Southeast Asia. 
Once I spent three months hitchhiking through the United States. I did that twice and then went down to Central America and to Mexico and stuff like that. I really enjoyed travelling. It was so cool to meet all these different people along the way. People would be interested in where you’re from and I’d get invited to stuff. It was really, really cool. In a nutshell that’s kind of how things went. I graduated from medical school in 1980. The year that I became twenty-eight. My mother died when I was twenty-three. She had breast cancer. Just after I graduated from medical school my stepfather died from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker. 
AS: You had younger sisters. Were they on their own already?
AT: No. After the death of my mother my stepfather remarried with the nanny that had looked after my half-sister while my mother was still in the hospital before she died. A weird thing. She had two further children by him, a boy and a girl. She was stuck with five children after he died. I wasn’t part of that though. 
AS: That was not your circus. Can you talk about how you got into addiction medicine? Not addiction medicine, psychiatry.
AT: I stumbled into it. I’ve always been interested, even in medical school I’d pick up some kind of weird book on psychology or some kind of life view approach thing or something. Primal scream therapy or whatever. I didn’t really get in touch with psychiatry. I never saw myself as a psychiatrist. I thought it was interesting but I never saw myself as such because I thought I was too deranged and disturbed myself. These guys who were into psychiatry, we had all of these fantastic ways of speaking and explaining stuff. I’d never be able to do that. 
AS: Your classmates?
AT: Classmates or older people. People would say something analytical and I’d be like, “Wow, I never would have thought of that. How do they know that?” After graduating from medical school I was kind of disenchanted with medicine all together. It’d been seven years. The final exams were a very lengthy thing. These were eighteen or twenty individual exams drawn out over a half a year. Specialty, oral, written, stuff like that. I was kind of fed up with it. After graduating I decided I’d do something else for a while. I worked at the post office. I worked at a refrigerator repair place, which was fun. I had my own little van with refrigerator repair parts. I’d go to people’s house.
AS: Someone trained you to do that?
AT: They did at the factory. They showed me how all the refrigerators worked and how to diagnose what’s wrong with them. 
AS: You do pick things up quickly.
AT: For a couple months I also worked at a truck mechanics place. It was a way to earn money. That was the year I got enough money together not only to pay for my motorcycle but I wanted to do an extensive backpacking trip to the Caribbean. I was kind of looking for somebody to take of my apartment and my cats while I was gone. That was when I met Susan. 
AS: Did she take care of the cats or did she go on the trip?
AT: We very quickly became enamored. She has just come over here and was glad to have a place to stay. I was going to be gone for a couple months. She took care of my apartment and fed my cats. I went to the Caribbean where I started missing her a lot. Two and a half weeks into the trip in Antigua I met a veterinarian from the United States who was there for some government project to look at the cows or something. We got drunk together and he had a motorcycle and wasn’t able to start it. I could see that it was flooded. I kicked the carburetor and adjusted it and started it for him. “Okay. I’m going over to the other bar there. You want to come along?” Along the way we wiped out and spilled. He had some lacerations, I just had some contusions. Nothing serious happened. It kind of was a jolt. Here I was in what they call the hospital in Antigua and he was getting sewed up and I was kind of sitting there really drunk. Shortly thereafter I decided this is not the way I envisioned this trip. So I booked a flight to Minneapolis, spent a week with my parents and almost every day on the phone with Susan. Then a flight back to Switzerland. Six months later we got married. 
After I returned to Switzerland, that was 1981, I was able to secure a job at the medical examiner’s in Zurich where I had worked as a student previously for a couple of months and where I first got into contact with death by intravenous drug abuse. I started writing my doctoral dissertation on that which I completed after I started working there in 1982. In 1980, 1981 was the year I took off and 1982 we got married. That’s where I got really involved in addiction. I started getting really interested especially in opiate dependency. After a year and a half of that I went and I was kind of looking for jobs that had a manageable workload where I didn’t have to stay up a lot at night. I just couldn’t handle that very well. I went to work for about a year and a half at an orthopedic rehabilitation clinic. I had people who came there sort of electively. You had to manage their rehabilitation and stuff. You’d go home at night even if you had on-call duty you could just sleep there. It was kind of a cushy job, well paid. Residents generally got well paid here in Switzerland. A common starting salary after graduating as a resident would be sixty or seventy thousand dollars a year. 
My original wish was I wanted to be a general practitioner. I applied for a residency and got one in Hennepin County Medical Center. We moved over there thinking I was going to do a complete residency in family medicine, family practice. That first year I was there was just horrible. I had to work one hundred and ten, one hundred and twenty hours a week, seven days a week. Every third or fourth night was just working through and continue working the next day. I got really depressed. It was almost a reenactment of when I was sixteen and had gone to visit my father. It was like after about eight or nine months I just threw in the towel and said, “Screw it.” We packed up our stuff and moved back to Switzerland. I felt horrible again because I felt like I’d disappointed my father. He was so glad that I’d come there. It was kind of hard to overcome. 
I immediately got a position back at the rehab clinic where I had worked. I just was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I decided to get into psychiatry. I got a residency job at the state mental institution. I immediately liked it. I was immediately liked by patients and personnel alike. I remember that I always wondering, “Why don’t the other doctors get involved more with the patients?” I was spending time in the wards, talking with people.
AS: You were?
AT: Yes, and the other doctors would come by once or twice a week and make their rounds and otherwise just ask the nurses what was going on. I kind of got stuck there. I thrived and was doing well, was being paid well. I had manageable hours. Sometimes I’d have to be on call but it was exceptional. That was actually at a time when a law was passed in Switzerland that even medical residents were not allowed to work more than sixty-five hours a week. 
AS: That was in the 80s. 
AT: After America a sixty-hour week seemed like nothing. I did that and I worked in various university clinics. I spent a year in Basel and a couple years in the outpatient services here nearby. Then I opened my own practice in 1993. That’s how I got into psychiatry.
AS: What happened with the addiction medicine interest?
AT: It was always kind of a special interest area of mine. I had lots of methadone patients when I opened my practice.
AS: In ‘93?
AT: Yes. That was when methadone was still the substitution medicine.
AS: When was the Needle Park? Is that ‘90?
AT: That started at the very end of the 80s and blossomed in the beginning of the 90s and was there for a few years. After I opened my practice it was still a thing. I think in ‘94 or ‘95 it had already been cleaned. It moved first from one place to the other.
AS: From the park to the station.
AT: It moved from Platzspitz to the Letten which was even more horrific than at the first place. Then they clamped down on it and wiped it out. Police all over the place in areas where it could reoccur, preventing scenes like that from re-sprouting. 
AS: Were they arresting people at that point? What they doing with people?
AT: No. How can you arrest a thousand people in one day because they’re using heroin?
AS: There was never the criminal, the immediate…
AT: Of course there was a criminal element.
AS: To arrest people, was that mostly for dealers?
AT: Of course, but how do you make the distinction? Everybody who gets involved in heroin at some point becomes a dealer because they have to deal their own stuff. Of course there are people who are more focused on distributing. The Albanians had a reputation for doing that. It was often somebody connected with some group or criminal organization. Somebody would buy it in a great quantity from somebody and then they’d distribute it in smaller quantities to somebody else and they’d distribute it to the individual people on the scene. Then they would redistribute it and so on. Where do you make the line? 
AS: Who to arrest?
AT: Where is the victim and where is the perpetrator? Where’s the difference? It’s almost a continuum. Some people were arrested just because they were carrying something with them. They were seldom persecuted. Some people were persecuted. Some people I’m not sure whether it was sensible to be persecuted. A friend of mine who was a dentist, he spent two years in a regional penitentiary because he was caught with cocaine and he was selling it. He was a dentist. He was making good money off of his profession. It’s not like he needed to become rich by selling cocaine. It was more something he was just involved in because he was consuming heavily himself. They put him away. Other people I know died. 
AS: During that time?
AT: Yes.
AS: Friends?
AT: People I knew. Fortunately, none of my closer friends. Maybe the dentist has died since. I don’t think it’s drug related. As Thilo Beck says, his lifestyle. Last time I saw him he was obese and looked pasty and unhealthy. 
AS: Do you remember what your dissertation was about? What made it unique in the time that you wrote it?
AT: The time that I started writing it heroin addiction was just starting to bloom. The title of the dissertation was, “The Exceptional Deaths.” A term for a medical examiner, somebody who doesn’t die of natural causes. A death that is unexplainable, unnatural, or extraordinary death. Literal translation is extraordinary death. Of intravenous drug abusers, a canonistic study of one hundred cases. Most of those hundred cases occurred in 1979 and 1980. It was like a flat curve and then it went up like that.
AS: Just like we’re starting to see.
AT: During the 80s the heroin abuse climbed and climbed and climbed. Where previously a couple of people had died per year from it, it was dozens in small Switzerland. Or over one hundred per year. Then at the end of the 80s like Beck said, the most intense drug scenes in the world happened in the middle of Zurich. People pouring in from Germany, from France just to come there to get drugs. 
AS: Do you know where the heroin was coming from?
AT: Mostly from Afghanistan I believe. 
AS: Were they able to curb the…
AT: Some from Morocco probably also. 
AS: When the introduction of the methadone therapy happened, was there also a simultaneous bust of the heroin market? Do you know how that kind of worked out? Was there a police effort towards getting rid of it?
AT: Yes, there was. 
AS: Did those things happen simultaneously?
AT: Yes. It very quickly became evident that it’s useless to pursue the users. You have to find out who the distributors are, the dealers. The police efforts were concentrated on that. A lot of people got caught up in the net but the focus was where is it coming from and how do we cut this off? 
AS: Were they or weren’t they working in conjunction with each other? Was the impulse towards the care for the addicts, getting people off the street, did that happen separately or were they cooperating at all? 
AT: As I remember it, it was separately but there were attempts with communication and cooperation. Politically at that time, it was so open and so visible and so in everybody’s faces. It could not be ignored. It could not be denied. It was there. It was part of our society. Almost everybody knew a family whose kid had got caught up in that. It was just devastating. Society had to deal with it. They came to this understanding; we can’t just deal with it by repressing it. We have to also do prevention. We have to do treatment. The four pillars that we say, I can’t think of what they are exactly. It’s a more differentiated approach and not just forbidding it. You can’t forbid something, prohibit something that so many people are doing anyways regardless of it being prohibited. It’s not going to go away just by outlawing it. A more permissive attitude sort of came forth then. They started leaving this expectation that people who were on drugs were just going to stop using them and become abstinence and be detoxed and then be okay. It hardly ever works that way. Occasionally somebody does and that’s good. Mostly not. 
AS: You opened your own practice, how did patients who had opiate issues find you? Are all psychiatrists prepared to deal with opiate addicts? I’m just trying to understand your medical system. We would say you’re an addiction medicine doctor or you’re just a psychiatrist. Those two in the U.S. don’t often overlap in private practice. 
AT: I’d say generally psychiatrists don’t want to or need to treat people with this kind of addiction. Oftentimes because it’s viewed as something very strenuous you’re going to wind up with your bills not getting paid, stuff like that. The patients are going to be lying to you all the time. This also stems from the attitude, “I’m the doctor. I’m going to counsel you on what you need to do to overcome your problems.” Especially in addiction you can’t do that. You have to find out where that person is at that moment and take it from there. You can’t superimpose this expectation of yours which doesn’t fit the frame of reference of the patient. You have to very carefully feel out the frame of reference of this person. Including his substance abuse or her substance abuse and where they’re standing and why they have come to you. What they actually want from you. Without saying, “This is what I want from you. This is what you have to do.” They’re coming to you with an expectation that you’re going to help them in a certain way. You have to find out what that is. It might not be realistic but it usually is not realistic in a way that they are expecting me to do much more for them. Ultimately them achieving much more than they are actually able to do at that moment. 
Oftentimes my first job is to just find out where they are, give them the feeling that they’re being listened to and understood, and then start toning down their expectations. “Listen. You can’t just stop taking that. You can’t just detox and everything will be okay. Let’s try methadone or Dolophine or oral morphine, the slow release type. You have to be open to various options and approaches.” Oftentimes you need to accept the fact that in the background they’re using other substances. Each case is its own individual case. Of course there are certain patterns that the addict does this and that. It’s very personal. 
AS: Has your practice always been that way? Do you think that the time you spent working at the hospital, the state hospital where you spent more time with patients, do you feel like that influenced your attitude towards addiction and towards people who were struggling with addiction? 
AT: I started to. It’s been a long road. I’ve been in this business now for almost thirty years. 
AS: Maybe you could talk about how it’s changed?
AT: It has a lot to do with my own personal experience too. A lot of personal stuff and realizing how vulnerable I am. This is not something that is just a bad life choice. This is something that can happen to you. I mentioned in one of the letters that I had my own brush with morphine. This is something that took me completely by surprise. This was shortly before I opened my practice. My friend, the anesthesiologist, had just gotten some practice permit. He said, “Let’s see what this whole thing is about this flash.”
AS: Flash?
AT: The flash, the rush, when you inject an opiate. He had morphine ampules and we shot intravenously ten milligrams. It was at first, “This is kind of relaxing and nice.” But actually a little bit too much because I kind of was woozy and drowsy. I tried it again but with only five milligrams, a very small amount comparatively. That was, “Oh my God.” All my troubles with attention deficit disorder, my problems with concentration, my problems with the strenuous—with keeping up a conversation with anybody and staying focused on the subject and not drifting away mentally and my ability to read and retain stuff was just better. I went to twice a week. It was helpful. 
It was that point where I started feeling discouraged and craving. I got addicted. I detoxed three or four times. If you’re taking something you’ve just really got to stay away from it because then my disdain for being dependent on something like that and my willingness to compromise. I’m clean but I’d still call myself an addict. I have vast amounts of oral morphine in my practice because I have to distribute it. I never ever, ever keep injectable morphine in my practice. I know that it’s too tempting. I could go buy it any time from the pharmacy.
AS: Because you’re a doctor.
AT: But I don’t do that. It’s just I know I cannot fool myself into thinking, once it will be okay. They come in packs of ten and I won’t be able to not use up the entire pack of ten. You can also buy them in boxes of one hundred ampules. They have ten milligram and twenty milligram ampules. It’s a really easy split. I just keep it at a distance. 
AS: If someone needs that they can go somewhere else.
AT: This was a very, very profoundly humiliating experience. 
AS: How so?
AT: I never thought that could happen to me. It never did with any other substance. I can smoke a joint tomorrow and then not think about it for a year. I like a glass of wine but I don’t crave it. I could easily go days or weeks without it. I had cocaine, I didn’t like the effect because it made me all tight and nervous and crabby. I talked a mile a minute but I didn’t like the way I was physically feeling when I was on it. I avoid it. 
AS: How long did that last for you? Did you take it like three or four times?
AT: Altogether like ten years. 
AS: Ten years? How did that go over in your family life?
AT: Not well. Susan started to notice. She could tell that I was using. Sometimes she thought I was using and wasn’t. She was never sure. I lied about it or denied it or denied it when I actually wasn’t doing but she didn’t believe me. Stuff like that. It was a difficult thing. Like Thilo Beck said, I’m a doctor. I can buy the clean stuff and inject it cleanly. I might have injected two or three thousand times but you can’t see anything on my veins.
AS: Because you’re a doctor?
AT: I’m a doctor. I know how to do it. I know I need to stay away from that. 
AS: Did you use methadone?
AT: No, I never wanted that stuff. I just stopped.
AS: But it took you a few times?
AT: Yes. I’d be using it for two weeks and working and performing just fine. Once or twice one of my addict patients suspected me because they just knew. 
AS: And said that to you?
AT: I talked my way out of it. “I’m so kaput today because I didn’t sleep last night.” Or something like that. Then I was off of it and clean. They weren’t sure anymore. 
AS: What was the humiliating part? 
AT: I was not in control. I was actually being controlled by the substance. 
AS: You have a deeper understanding now? 
AT: I know how powerful that can be.
AS: When you talk about a personal connection.
AT: I know how you can be thinking rationally and you’ll be doing something completely contrary. Knowing as I’m doing it that I don’t want to do it but I’m doing it anyways. Here it is. “Oh my God that feels good. Why did I do that? What an asshole now I did it again.” 
AS: That consciousness is always there.
AT: The other part is like somebody else is holding the steering wheel and driving you. It’s a profound thing and I think it’s kind of unique for the opiates. They have such an intricate way of interacting with the receptors in your brain and so specific in the way they interact with your brain. They quickly are after a relatively short time can change the way that your brain is functioning and the way of steering your thoughts and your behavior. 
AS: Do you feel like you got that back?
AT: Yes, but I am very respectful of it. I will never have that in my practice or close to me because I couldn’t resist. 
AS: What about your friend the anesthesiologist?
AT: He didn’t get into that. Maybe he was less vulnerable than me. Maybe he never had attention deficit disorder or something like that. I never identified with my patients. I started to understand them better but I never felt, “You’re the same as me.” It’s not like I chummed up to them. 
AS: You understood more about what they were going through. You had not previously had an experience where you couldn’t control—
AT: I was pretty understanding before but you can’t really know what it is. It’s not something that you should have to know. You shouldn’t have to have that experience. The price is just way too high. In that sense it’s very humiliating. I never feel ever even this much superiority over my patients. I know why they lie. I know that works. I know how much they hate themselves for lying. The whole shame thing and everything is just mind blowing. 
AS: That’s powerful. What I wanted to ask is what’s changed in your practice besides you? What changes have you seen? Beck was talking about the substantial decrease of the numbers and the increase in age because heroin’s not in. How has your practice changed? What have you noticed around opioids?
AT: Hard to say what has changed around me or what I have changed myself. I used to work a lot more, see patients five or five and a half days a week. I was insane. A few years back really started to realize how morphine was helping me to work more. 
AS: How long ago did you stop?
AT: A couple years was the last time I used it. There were gaps. 
AS: But it was over a period of ten. 
AT: I was very worried about myself. 
AS: What made you not take methadone?
AT: I took methadone or oral morphine just to bridge over a certain gap of time before I knew I could take two or three weeks off to detox. 
AS: You know what you’re doing. Take two or three weeks off of work to detox because that’s how long it would take?
AT: It would take me four or five days to get over the worst but then you’re shaking depending on how long you’ve used. You’re going to have post-acute withdrawal symptoms for up to a year or two. 
AS: Those are serious. Back to your patients. How did it change?
AT: I reduced the number of addict patients I treat. Most of the patients that are being treated by me I’ve been treating for years. I haven’t taken on many new ones. 
AS: Just addict patients?
AT: Beck mentioned, I can confirm that. Most people I see are…
AS: In their forties or fifties.
AT: I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a teenaged user.
AS: But when you started your practice?
AT: I had sixteen, seventeen year olds. My youngest patients were sixteen and already heavy heroin users. It was a long battle on methadone and this and that. There’s still cocaine there. What are we going to do? We’ll prescribe methylphenidate, Ritalin.
AS: Does that help with cocaine addiction?
AT: Sort of. It’s a stimulant. It’s not like they’d totally not crave it. In some way or another it helps them maintain a certain stability. I’ll go along with it. As long as it works it works. The pragmatic approach. It’s a difficult thing when you treat addicts. It’s not a quick thing. You’re in for a long haul always. 
AS: Your medical model is set up to accommodate that?
AT: To a degree. I work together with pharmacies. I work with federal practitioners. I actually am one of the very, very few, I don’t know another psychiatrist except for Arud in Zurich which is a huge practice there, I take blood and there’s a central lab in Baden that I bring it over to and do lab work there. I do maintain a very, very small amount of physical contact with my patients. I measure their blood pressure or listen to their heart. Where was I going? 
AS: We were talking about your patients, the age of your patients and how its changed.
AT: It’s rare that I get somebody below twenty for anything anymore which is okay. I’m older myself. I think it might have to do with the fact that when I started my practice I was much younger and probably projected a much more dynamic, youngish me which younger patients could identify with more. 
AS: How are people referred to you in private practice?
AT: I’d say about a fifth of them just hear about me and call me up. The rest, half of the rest get referred by practitioners and the other half by the psychiatric institute. Most of my patients are not addicts. 
AS: It seemed like you said this earlier, did you purposely reduce the number of addict patients or have they naturally declined?
AT: It’s hard to say. I purposely sort of withdrew a little bit from that because it’s really taxing. In private practice if you don’t have an infrastructure and a lot of personnel and social workers and stuff like that to help additionally it’s a lot of work.
AS: Because of the lifestyle that Beck was talking about.
AT: The different aspects.
AS: All the stigma and the problems.
AT: Their whole living situation, who they’re living with, their economic situation, their job. All this stuff. How are they buying food? Who’s paying for it? Where’s it coming from? Do they have social services of the municipality there to help them?
AS: When you take on an addict patient you’re taking on all that.
AT: The whole thing. All that. Which I don’t do myself but I have to be in phone contact with the social services of the municipality or their primary care physician or with their employer or with their landlord or whatever. 
AS: That stuff typically doesn’t happen with your other patients.
AT: Not as much. It’s a lot of work and a lot of work that I can’t charge for. 
AS: Because it’s not the one on one time.
AT: I have a petition for work in absence of the patient but you can’t overdo it. The insurance will just refuse to pay it. 
AS: I have a question here about best practices for the future of addiction treatment. If you could predict something that would happen regarding addiction treatment what would it be? If you could change something for the better in the current system here? Best practices, something that will happen or that you see coming up ahead or something that you could change. 
AT: I think education of health professionals needs to start early and with a bigger emphasis on it. It’s a huge part of our society, of the health system, of what we have to deal with, it’s underrepresented. 
AS: And underfunded.
AT: Yes. The whole understanding of addiction, like tobacco addiction is completely under dealt with. It’s addiction that’s about as bad as heroin addiction. People who are hooked on cigarettes have a hard time stopping.
AS: There’s not much here for that.
AT: They talk about the amount of deaths from heroin, there’s ten times as much death from tobacco.
AS: Still today. That’s a good point. 
AT: It’s legal. You can buy it every place. You go outside and smoke. Alcohol is more noticed but still that’s very accepted. It takes a long time for acquaintances or relatives of an addict to admit that the one close to them is having a problem with alcohol. It will be overlooked and denied and sort of rationalized. Then for the person who is consuming it themselves, they accept that themselves because it’s part of society. Almost everybody drinks. Ninety-five percent of the drinkers can handle that and five percent consume seventy-five percent of what’s consumed. 
AS: Here?
AT: I think that’s probably universal.
AS: Five percent consume seventy-five percent. More education.
AT: More education, more knowledge about it, more understanding, and you need a lot of experience. 
AS: Would you say even by education it’s just with health professionals? How is your school system? Does your school system here offer drugs education?
AT: More than they used to but I’m not sure how useful that is because the educational system is dealing with kids. There’s a degree you can educate them about addiction and substances and stuff like that. It’s something that, “Okay I see my parents drinking wine. I’m not exactly sure what you’re talking about.” 
AS: More medical professionals.
AT: I think in higher levels of public education you could probably introduce this topic. For teenagers, make them aware that this is something that you have to be aware of and careful of. They need to know some facts about drugs that can easily become available at a party or on the street, heroin or cocaine, before they try it. So that they have an idea of what they might be risking and getting into just by touching the stuff. 
AS: Would you talk a little bit about, you were talking the other day about why you’re not in favor of legalization of everything. 
AT: I’m just not sure. 
AS: Is marijuana legal here?
AT: No. It should be more legal. When I talk about legalization often people think about it as this black and white thing. Tobacco is regulated legally, so is alcohol. There’re rules and you can get in trouble.
AS: They have different rules.
AT: It’s a question of how we regulate it legally not whether it’s just illegal or legal. I think you have to take into account the different risks of these different substances. Opiates is kind of in a way different from the other things. Cocaine is different but it also has similarities with other stimulants and stuff. Opiates are very distinct idiosyncratic effect. Alcohol is just a cell poison. You bathe yourself in it and they sort go “Ugh” and release their dopamine. Opiate, that docks onto a very specific point and tricks the nerves into thinking something else. 
AS: It’s very quickly lethal if you use too much of it.
AT: If you use too much of it you’ll stop breathing. 
AS: Anything else?
AT: Not that I can think of at the moment. I’ve been babbling away. 
AS: What about the future? Is there something if you could offer some idea for public policy or something for the future? Maybe it’s education as you already said but is there any other care or treatment for people?
AT: Make it available I think. Public acceptance that this is an aspect that should not be so stigmatized that needs to be accepted as something that you can become addicted just the same way as you can suffer from high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure you always have to take a medication that keeps it in the low range. Countless other, like diabetes. Okay there might be some different ways of looking at it and understanding it but in certain aspects why should you think of it differently? It’s a health problem. 
AS: It’s what Beck was talking about earlier today. It’s the way that it’s stigmatized that marginalizes the people that do have a problem. Their life becomes complex and difficult because of their marginalization, because of the stigma. Right?
AT: The only thing that makes heroin so dangerous is it enters your brain about ten times more easily than morphine. If you inject it this huge wall of heroin is immediately entering your brain. The sharp rise in the concentration might be a temporal overdose. Your brain doesn’t have enough time to adjust to this amount of effect. Your breathing just shuts down, your heart stops. That’s an overdose. Apart from that it’s not particularly dangerous. If you take an amount of heroin that you can tolerate your health isn’t going to be impaired. You’re just going to be dependent on it.
AS: That can turn out to be a problem.
AT: It can be a problem. I like being able to move freely. I want to go to the states for a few weeks and not have to worry about having something with me that maintains me. These are the motivational factors that Beck was talking about. I have lots of reasons that I don’t want to.
AS: With the motivational thinking or interviewing. Those are powerful. I think my son-in-law had a counselor who used that. I remember he was talking about that he really liked it. He liked a therapist using that model. 
AT: The whole politics towards this needs to change. It’s just so tiresome because there are experts who have a lot of knowledge and experience about it but their hands are tied by the greater way that it’s being seen by society and by the health department and by the politics. 
AS: And the different administrations that come in and the ruling parties and how quickly you can backtrack and lose ground on something. 
AT: How flexible are you as a therapist? How flexible can you use substitution agents or other treatment modalities that you can offer? Talk therapy, group therapy, institutionalization, whatever works or is desired or is acceptable or makes sense. This whole thing about, “You have to not take it and you’re only a wonderful person if you’re not addicted or dependent on anything at all.” It doesn’t work that way, it can’t. You can argue, “You made a bad decision.” It’s not like that. You have peer pressure; you have all sorts of things coming into play. You have a teenager who’s heard all this stuff and they think, “Yeah, yeah that’s what all the adults are saying. Here my friend is offering me something and he’s taking it. He looks okay. I’m going to see what it’s like myself.” You can’t just say this is a bad decision. It’s the way things go. 
AS: We need to create supports for someone to pull back from it that are consistent and non-judgmental.
AT: Yes. This needs to be very readily available.
AS: To catch it.
AT: And easily available. Somebody at ten o’clock in the morning could be like, “God I can’t continue this way.” And at one in the afternoon walks into a place like Arud it’s good that something happens right then. 
AS: Thank you. 
AT: Sure. 
AS: [Speaking to cat]. Thanks kitty.

Verne Wagner       -VW
Amy Sullivan        -AS
AS: This is Amy Sullivan it is May 18. I got it right gals. May 18, 2017 I’m in Duluth, Minnesota with Verne Wagner. Verne do you give me permission to record this interview?
VW: Yes, you have my permission to record this interview. 
AS: Let’s start with your story. Where you grew up, when you became a parent, some of your childhood, a little background on who you are. 
VW: I grew up in the town of Proctor, just a little bit outside of Duluth. It’s a railroad town. My father was a railroader; my grandfather was a railroader. I grew up there. Railroad men are known for drinking. My dad and my grandfather were no exception. My grandfather was a terrible alcoholic that got into recovery. He left my dad and his mom at a very young age. They separated and he was gone for eight years until he finally got into AA and got very involved in AA. My grandfather was also an international union president which took him to Washington. While he was in Washington, I have some pictures of him and John Kennedy together, fell off the wagon and started drinking again. He ended up retiring. My grandfather, one of the local railroads asked him to be a drug and alcohol counselor for them. He started a program that is used now throughout the United States. Rather than firing people if you agreed to go into treatment they would put you in treatment and keep you working. When I was a little boy growing up I used to see these men that looked like the roughest meanest looking men sitting in my grandfather’s living room. I’d say, “Grandma who are these men?” “Oh, they’re just men that need to talk to Grandpa.” Those were sponsors. He sponsored those men. When Grandpa died, all these people at his funeral came up and said, “Your grandfather saved my life, that’s how I know him.” That was my introduction to the AA.
AS: But you didn’t know about AA until much later?
VW: No, Grandpa gave me his big book and I knew a little bit about it. My father also was a terrible alcoholic. My mother came down with breast cancer in about 1965. On July 4, 1967 she passed away. I was twelve years old at the time and my older brothers and sisters were four, five, and six years older than I am. My father remarried six months later and moved us into a stepfamily. My brothers and sisters all revolted and pretty much left. 
AS: You were twelve?
VW: I was twelve.
AS: So they were all teenagers. 
VW: Yes. I was left in a stepfamily. My dad was gone drinking. My stepmother was very upset that he was gone and was very, very verbally and emotionally abusive to me. I was a teenager. I was twelve. You can imagine as a teenager what that’s like with a stepmother especially. I was born very strict Catholic. Not only did I go to Catholic grade school but I sang in the choir at eight o’clock mass, at ten o’clock mass I served mass, and at eleven thirty mass I usually read the epistle to the church. I had a priest that taught me public speaking skills. This priest abused me, sexually when I was twelve. He basically raped me. I quit the church shortly after. What’d I’d do when I was supposed to go to church…
AS: You were still supposed to go so you didn’t tell anyone. 
VW: I went to the Proctor golf course and I’d hide up there. I worked there as a summer job so I could hide up there. I’d come home after church was done and I never told anyone about this. Finally, my father said to me, “You’re not going to church.” I said, “How do you know?” “I know. Why not?” “I don’t know, Dad. Church does not appeal to me anymore. I’ve learned everything I can learn. I don’t like church. I don’t want to go.” “You don’t have to go.” That was my way out of church. I started discovering girls. Girls started discovering me. I was a chunky little fellow. I lost all this weight and the girls started knocking on my door which was very strange for me. As a young boy it was extremely exciting. As a Catholic I was never sexual with girls. My father always said, “Verne you don’t have sex with a girl unless you’re either married to her or you plan to marry her. You never, never have sex with a girl.” That’s how I was raised. I had girlfriends who used to say, “How come you aren’t like the other boys? How come you never try anything?” I don’t know but I just knew that was not what I was supposed to do. I had a secret life. Going through puberty I learned about masturbation. It was extremely shaming to me. It was a secret. I used to think, if my mother is watching me how shaming this was.
AS: Your deceased mother.
VW: Yes.
AS: That’s so intense.
VW: I started doing that compulsively. I hurt myself. Then I started exposing myself to young girls when I masturbated, girls my age, in Proctor. I’m thirteen, fourteen years old. At fifteen I get caught. Somebody turns me in. My dad sends me to a psychiatrist. One of my older brothers is gay and my dad could not stand the thought of a son that was gay. This was a World War II, John Wayne, butch haircut, six foot two man’s man. To have a son that was gay was the worst thing in the world for him. Now he’s afraid that his youngest son is gay too. He sent me to a psychiatrist. It was so shaming. Only nuts crazy people saw, back then.
AS: When’s this?
VW: ‘69. Only crazy people saw psychiatrists. I was a crazy person.
AS: What year were you born?
VW: ‘55. I saw this psychiatrist, he kept me from committing suicide. At fourteen I actually attempted suicide. US Highway 2 runs through Proctor. There used to be grain trucks from North Dakota that would come down to the grain elevators and it was a steady stream of big grain trucks. At fourteen I closed my eyes and walked out in front of one. That man, poor guy, slammed on his breaks and went around me. When I realized he didn’t hit me he jumps out of his truck and I took off running. That was my suicide attempt. At fifteen I started drinking. I started using marijuana and LSD. I was a very out of control kid. The psychiatrist I went to see, I saw him for about a year and then he got arrested for molesting his patients. 
AS: Where did you see him?
VW: In Duluth. I’d see this where he had women laying on different cots in different rooms. He’d give them a tranquilizer and then he’d molest them when they were out. One time he came in and he had his pants down and he had thigh high stockings on and a garter belt. What the hell is that?
AS: What did you think of the world at this point?
VW: He’s a professional and I’m the one who’s crazy. I was scared of anybody as an adult. I played sports in Proctor. I was scared to death of the coaches. I was scared of people in…
AS: Positions of authority. 
VW: Positions of authority. With my father’s drinking I got very involved in lots of things trying to become a leader in something to get his attention. Children of alcoholic type stuff. I struggled to do that. I always thought once I had sex with a woman my compulsive behavior would finish. I met my wife when she was fifteen and I was sixteen. It was a dance that the Catholic Church in the western part of Duluth would put on for teenagers in the summer. I met her, she had white blue jeans on. 
AS: Those were the days. 
VW: I memorized her phone numbers. We dated off and on. She was an extremely strict Catholic. She has two nuns in the family. I’m thinking she’s from the west part of Duluth. If you’re from Proctor you’re thinking west-end girl these women are rowdy. I have to marry one who’s thinking about becoming a nun. We dated off and on. We finally got engaged. After four years at nineteen years of age we lost our virginity together. It was very intense. I felt like I was doing something wrong. “You took her virginity, you asshole. You selfish bastard.” She was like, “No, it’s okay. I wanted to do this.” We ended up marrying. We’re going on forty years now of being married. I always thought that would stop my behaviors and it didn’t. I got in some trouble with the police.
AS: After you were married?
VW: After I was married. I met a psychologist in town. I said, “My grandfather was very big into AA. This feels like a very compulsive addiction, what I’m doing. I’ve tried stopping this my whole life. I can’t stop it.” I made promises to myself, I made promises to God, I made promises to my wife and I can’t stop this behavior. I said, “I’d like to start this twelve step group based on the steps of AA.” He said, “That’s an interesting thought.” I put it together. He was part of this community group of therapists. He said, “Would you put a presentation on to these folks?” I did. This one therapist said, “You’re talking about sexual addiction.” I said, “What? I’ve never heard that term.” “There’s a doctor in the Twin Cities named Patrick Carnes. He’s written a book called Out of the Shadows. It’s now called Out of the Shadows. You should read that book.” I went and got it. Oh my God. It was like this guy wrote this book about me. I contacted him and tracked him down to the Twin Cities. He said, “I just started a program in Golden Valley. Would you like to come down?” “Yeah.” I was patient number ninety-seven of his. Pat Carnes is now a world famous therapist. My second son is named after him. I went through his program. I learned about addiction. I learned about core values that addicts have about themselves, low self-esteem. If people knew what I was really like they wouldn’t like me. For me sex was my most important aid. I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs. You have very little self-worth, self-esteem, you don’t trust people so therefore you have a very secret life. I learned that. While I was there I started going to Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings in the cities. But when I came up here we didn’t have anything. I started a group in Duluth, still going strong. I don’t go to it anymore but I went to it a year ago. I walked into the meeting and folks were like, “Hi how are you?” “Good.” “Do you know what meeting you’re at?” “Isn’t this Sex Addicts Anonymous?” “Yes. How do you know about us?” “I started this meeting in my living room in 1985.” It’s still going strong. 
After about two years in therapy I started the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction which was an educational organization. What that did for me though was it got me very involved in the twelve steps. I understood the twelve steps. Starting that group in Duluth I can’t tell you how many hundreds of people who I had coffee with that told me their story that needed help. The county jail would call me up, “Verne we have someone up here who needs to talk to you.” I’d go down to the sex offenders program in Moose Lake and they asked me not to come back because they said, “These folks are going to be here the rest of their lives. We’re not going to let them go. You’re telling them that their behaviors are insane. The second step of the program is belief in a higher power will restore us to sanity. By doing that they’re going to claim that they’re insane and they’re going to try to get out of here. We’ll never let these people out of here. We don’t want you to come back here.” “I don’t think this is the right thing to do.” They wouldn’t let me come back. We started SAA meetings here. I got a call and went up to Canada and did it up in Canada. Long story short, that’s what got me involved in the twelve steps. I worked the twelve steps, I know the life of an addict, I know how powerful an addiction is. The insanity of that addiction. I’ve been married going on forty years, we have two children. My wife is a medical social worker. She’s soon to retire. She started a group called COSA. COSA was the AlAnon version for co-dependence of sex addicts. Both of us have this background. When our oldest boy called us up and said, “Mom, Dad I’ve got a problem. I’ve gotten myself addicted to meth.” We were like, “Oh my God. We’ve been down this road.”
AS: Did your sons know about your addiction?
VW: I told both my boys my story. 
AS: When did you do that?
VW: Probably when they were seventeen, eighteen years old. I started to be on the news media more and more. I got involved with my work with the church. I filed a lawsuit against the church in 1992. What I did is I went to the bishop of Duluth who I knew very well. I had dinner with him several times at my mother-in-law’s house. I called him up and said, “Look, I had a priest in Proctor, Father John Nicholson. He molested me. He raped me. He did that to a bunch of the kids I went to school with. I’m not interested in suing you. All of this is starting to come out in the media about what’s going on. Let’s do something proactive. Let’s reach out to my classmates and say we heard this happened. What can we do as a church to help you heal?” “Come into see me.” He wouldn’t see me. He’s an attorney basically, the second in command to the bishop.
AS: So the bishop invited you to talk to him but then the bishop didn’t take the meeting.
VW: So then this guy meets me. He tells me who he is. “The bishop won’t be joining us.” I told him this guy molested me. I said, “I’d like to do something positive with this. I would like to do an outreach to my schoolmates. I think we could heal together. I think this could be something very positive that we do together.” He said, “I think that’s a great idea. Let me get back to you.” He never did. A couple months later I called him back. “We’re still thinking about it.” He never did. 
I’m watching Sally Jessy Rafael. She’s got Father Tom Doyle and another priest on the show. Tom Doyle was a lawyer and he was with the embassy, the Vatican Embassy in Washington D.C. He and the priest were charged by the American Association of Bishops to look into this. This was all starting to happen. “Is it really that bad or is it just a few bad priests?” He came back and said, “No, this is huge. We need to do to reach out to these people. We need to do something about it.” They buried his report and said, “If you two want to have a future as priests you’ll forget this ever happened and bury it.” Here these guys on Sally Jessy and they said, “The only way we’re going to get the church to do something right about this is to sue them. Go after their pocketbook.” So I did. I contacted Jeff Anderson from the Twin Cities. They took me on. I settled the case. The laws got changed in one of the courts. Jeff Anderson calls me up and says, “Verne your lawsuit is dead. Until this gets appealed to a higher court, your lawsuit’s dead.” 
AS: Because of the reporting?
VW: No it was just the way the law had gotten interpreted. There’s a lot of Catholic judges. He said, “Verne the church will give me enough money to get my money out of this. I can get you a couple thousand bucks.” I said, “Jeff I told you when I first started this, this has nothing to do with money. This is about keeping the church accountable. You get your money out of this. I will settle this thing so you can get your money but I will not sign a clause that will keep me quiet. I want to publicly speak about this.” That’s what we did. That allowed me then to continue my work as a volunteer. I think Nicholson had thirty some people that he ended up molesting.
AS: That’s the priest?
VW: That’s the priest. Since I started that I think the diocese has about thirty or forty priests that have been identified. 
AS: What’s the name of the organization?
VW: SNAP, the Survivor Network of those Abused by Priests. 
AS: That’s a powerful story. That interests me being raised Catholic. We were at the point where you said you told your boys when they were seventeen and eighteen. This is in the 90s?
VW: Matthew was born in ‘86. Patrick was born in 1990. 
AS: This isn’t until the 2000s. But you brought this up in ‘92? This was a long process.
VW: Yes. It was settled in about ‘95. 
AS: You started speaking out more because it blew up nationally. Your boys were teenagers and they were going to hear you.
VW: They were going to hear me on the news. I told my father, “Dad you’re going to hear in the news.” He felt terrible. He absolutely felt terrible. The reason I’m throwing this at you was this was the framework that I’ve had to be there to help my son. Sometimes you kind of look about why things happen in your life, talking about higher power stuff. My son Matthew is a professional dancer, he does dance and theater. He was out in New York. He had a partner out there, they would go in New York City, it’s all about who you see and being seen. Somebody said, “You ought to try meth.” “Okay.” He tried it and it was like “Oh my God, this is incredible.” As a dancer, “I’m losing weight because I’m on this stuff. I don’t have to eat as much.” It ended up consuming him. He lost his job, he lost his relationship. He lost pretty much everything. 
AS: At what point did he call you?
VW: He’d been using for about six months when he called me. He called me in the fall.
AS: What year is this?
VW: He’s been clean for five years. That was seven years ago, 2010. No, it was 2011. It was 2012 during our flood that I came down. I had to go down to the cities and pick him up, he’d been using. Probably 2010 when he first...I got him involved in a treatment center in New York. This was a revolving door place. “Come on in. Thirty days. Goodbye.” It did nothing. He started using again. His partner was very upset. They were hurting for money. His partner finally said, “I’m done.” Matt started sleeping with all kinds of people so he put his partner at risk too. Matt’s gay and it’s all part of that gay lifestyle of New York. His partner said, “I’m done.” He called me up, “Verne, Matt owes me money for rent. Can you help me out?” “Yes.” I ended up paying his debts. 
He’d been gone for two weeks on the streets of New York. Nobody knew where he was, none of his friends. I called the St. Louis County attorney who I know. I said, “Mark do you have any contacts in New York City? I’ve got a son that’s using out there. He’s using meth. Could I get somebody to look for him?” “If they find him they’re going to arrest him and he’ll get a felony. I don’t know if you want that. Although they might put him in drug court.” Finally, he made contact with one of his friends. He said, “Matt I’ve got food and stuff in my apartment come on in when you can.” He put a motion detector hooked up to a computer with a camera. When Matt entered his apartment he had him on motion detection. Matt is so gaunt and so out of it. This guy finally runs home and gets him and has him. I talk to him on the phone. I say, “Matt do you want help or not?” “I don’t know Dad.” “Here’s the deal son. If you want to stay using, then I’m going to put your mom on the phone and I want you to say goodbye to her. Then you’re going to say goodbye to me. If you want to be an addict, then you choose that and you be an addict. If you don’t think you have a problem that’s your choice. You’re going to lose your family. You can’t have both. You have a choice here. You can either have your family and I’ll be there to support you or you can have your meth. That’s your choice. What do you want to do?” My wife is going, “What are you doing? Are you crazy? Are you fucking crazy? What if he says?” “He has a choice to make: do you have a problem or don’t you? If you’re going to choose your drugs over your family, it’s pretty tough to say you don’t have a problem.” He said, “Dad I don’t want to lose you guys.” I said, “Good. That’s the right answer. I want you to come home. I can get you into treatment in Minnesota. We have the best treatment centers in the country.” I flew him and his friend home. I was afraid he might take off. I flew them both in. This was retirement money that I had. 
AS: Verne you never told me what it is that you do.
VW: I railroaded for twenty-nine years. I blew two disks out in my back. I was retired at age forty-seven. I was a union guy. I represented railroads in Minnesota down at the state legislature. I had success down there and they shipped me to Washington D.C. I was a lobbyist in Washington for a number of years. 
AS: A lot like your grandfather. 
VW: My kids were little and I said, “I can’t be a father who comes home on weekends.” I went from assistant national director to a Cub Scout leader here in Duluth. Talk about a little ego change. That’s my background. We got him home. I called the Pride Institute in the Twin Cities. The former director, Joe Meeko, was on my board for the Minnesota Council on Sexual Addiction. I said, “Is Joe Meeko there?” “Joe’s gone. We know Joe.” “I’m an old friend of his. I have this gay son who is coming home who is hooked on meth. Can I get him in?” “Yes you can.” I picked him up from the cities and he was home for a while. He stole our car and went to the cities and used. The cops pinged his phone and said, “Verne he’s in the Twin Cities. Why don’t you put a health and welfare check on him? If we do find him we can say, ‘Call your parents they’re worried about you.’ If you file a stolen car report, then he’s going to get in trouble and you don’t want that do you?” “I don’t want that. I just want the boy home.” 
We got up here the night it started raining, what a hellacious night. We got back to Duluth at eleven thirty at night when it started pouring. I was a Red Cross volunteer at the time. When I get home there’s a call at one in the morning saying, “The city’s flooding out, can you opening up a shelter?” “Yes.” We have a big church up on the hill and I called that minister and we opened up a shelter for Duluth. It’s only because I remember how crazy this whole shit was. We did a rule twenty-five. The day of the storm we were scheduled to do a rule twenty-five. The social worker from St. Louis County said, “I’ll try to get to my office.” Mary said, “Great, I will be there.” Mary took a whole bunch of detours and got there and met with the social worker. She did a rule twenty-five. Then a couple days later I got him down to Pride Institute. He was there for ninety days. He got out, they put him in a sober house. They should have put him in a halfway house. Bought all his clothing, food, linens, all this shit. He was there for two days and he’s gone. We’ve both been down this road. Finally, we talk and he’s living at some guy’s house that’s providing a free place to stay. 
AS: He’s going to work the program on his own?
VW: “You’re on your own. Good luck.” After three weeks he calls me up and says, “Can I come home?” I said, “I don’t know. Here’s when you can come home. You go to ninety meetings in ninety days and you get an NA sponsor.” 
AS: And then you can come home?
VW: Then you can come home. “You have to agree to those terms.” He went to the Center for Drug and Alcohol and they had an outpatient day meeting. He went there and he started going to NA at night. He got a sponsor, a woman from Superior, Robin. Robin is incredible. She’s been clean from heroin for about twenty-five years now. 
AS: Is it Robin E?
VW: Yes, Robin E. 
AS: Robin’s being interviewed right now by my students. 
VW: I was going to suggest to you that you interview Robin. 
AS: I found her on NA.
VW: Robin’s incredible. Robin became Matt’s sponsor. Matt did ninety days. He said, “I’m going to do another ninety.” 
AS: Is he living here at this point?
VW: He’s at home. For two years he was going to NA every day. Then he got on the area board. Then he became the assistant regional. He’s very involved in NA. He sponsors a number of people. I got a call from Douglas County, their jail. I criticized them, their county attorney and their jailers. “You’re talking about locking people up longer. You don’t have a treatment program in Northwestern Wisconsin. You just got done saying if you lock people up longer it’s a better idea. I’m not from here, I’m from Duluth, I’m not here to tell you your business. You don’t provide any type of programming while they’re in jail. If you believe it’s better to keep them in jail, then why the hell aren’t you offering NA in your jail? Why not?” “I don’t know why not.” “I’ll tell you why not. You have a policy that you have to be clean for at least two years and you also cannot have a felony on your record to be in a jail. How many heroin addicts and meth addicts do you know that don’t have some sort of record?” I got a call the next day from the county jailer. “We’ve changed our policy. Can you come over and start an NA group?” “No I’m not an addict.” I said to my son, “Son this might be great service work for you.” Nothing was more sobering for me than to hear that big steel door shut behind me and know I was not locked in. I said, “I would really recommend you consider that.” He did. He runs an NA group up at that county jail. 
AS: So Matt still lives here.
VW: Yes. Matt lived with us for two years. Two years of my life I was taking care of my dad who was quite elderly. I was his caretaker up here and I was taking care of Matt at the same time. My life was extremely full. After two years I said, “Son it’s time for you to go.” “You think I’m ready?” “You are. You’re working your program. You have a higher power you’ve connected with. It’s time for you to go.” He started, because he’s a professional dance, one of the dance schools called him up. He did that. Then he got a call from a theatrical director, “We have a small company in Duluth to not only do choreography for us but we have a couple of lead roles we’d like you to do.” He’s like, “God, Dad I can’t believe this.” “And you thought coming back to Duluth your whole theatrical life was over.” We talked about higher power action. How this was so much higher power that he needed to recognize. “Son when this happens you need to bank this. When you’re feeling very scared if you can recognize that your higher power has been there for you it’s a very comforting thought. You can recognize you might not have the answers about what’s going to happen in life but you can trust that a higher power does.” He got a call from University of Minnesota Duluth campus saying, “We’d like you to teach a class for us.” This last year they called and said, “One of our teachers is going to be gone. We’d like you to be full time on our staff.” He just finished with that. Matt’s been clean for a little over five years. Now he’s headed down to Milwaukee to get his master’s degree. The college folks have said, “Matt we’d love to have you come back.” He says, “I love teaching college level.” But he needs to have his MFA. So that’s what he’s doing. 
AS: When did you start the NarAnon group?
VW: Three years ago this June. 
AS: That’s it. During those first two years you said were hard, you started the NarAnon group after Matt moved out?
VW: Pretty much. He’d been here for a little while when we started the NarAnon group.
AS: Tell me why you started the NarAnon group.
VW: I wanted to start NarAnon because what we went through and what every parent goes through is the darkest shit. You just can’t get over how dark this is. It felt like I had something to give to people. It’s the old thing about turning lemons into lemonade. Trying to do something positive. Three years ago I contacted the mayor of Duluth, Don Ness, and I said, “Mayor we’ve got this opiate problem going on. We can’t rely on the police to do this. This is bigger than the police. We need to start some sort of community organization. Some sort of community task force. I would like to offer you my services to do that.” I started the NarAnon by contacting the police chief and saying, “We’re going to do this NarAnon group. Would you put that on your Facebook page that we’re going to do that at Miller-Dwan Meeting Room at this date?” I did that with the Superior police chief too. We had ten people at our very first meeting. The police, I’m getting calls all the time with them. The mayor said, “I think we need to do more than what we’re doing.” He put me in touch with the police chief and he said, “There’s a group called the Opiate Advisory Response Strategy group, OARS group. You should be on that. I will make it happen that you can be on that group.” I joined them. I do not have a formal education. I’m a high school graduate. In Proctor High School I was the valedictorian of my class with a 2.7 grade point average. Just kidding. I always joke in Proctor it’s all about trains. I got on that. It’s a lot of doctors, very professional people. 
We were meeting just to meet. It was becoming a clearinghouse of information but nobody was doing anything. I got ahold of Maggie Kazel and a couple other people. We have all this talent, all this expertise in this room and we’re not doing anything with it. We need to do more. I started speaking more. I started letting these people know that we have too many kids who are dying of overdoses. We’re doing a lot of talking but now it’s time to take this talk and go into action. We did. We started holding public meetings. I got everybody to break off into small groups. We have committees on harm reduction, on support, treatment programs. Biggest thing we found in treatment is lack of access to treatment. Five to seven-week window to try to get into treatment. I got on all those committees. I started pushing like hell to say this is not enough. People listened. We just put in a one point four million dollar grant to the Department of Human Services. We’re supposed to hear something by the end of May. 
I’ve been meeting with the mayor. The mayor put the opioid epidemic as her first priority for the state of the city address this year. She’s going to hold a summit. I went down to the legislature and met with some people. We’re all going to get together in one room with county commissioners, legislatures, the mayor, the police, treatment centers. I’ve been pushing for these rapid response groups where if somebody overdoses we go in there with a rule twenty-five, we have a place for them to go, we have people from the recovery community to meet with them and say this is my story. We get them into a program where they stay overnight for a week or two weeks, get them on Suboxone or medically assisted treatment as soon as we can. It’s a continuous thing. The police chief just told me, “We’ve decided to adopt the Gloucester community model.” That’s in Massachusetts. “If people come to our precinct and say ‘We no longer want to do this. Here’s our stuff, here’s our drugs.’ We will not arrest them. We will bring them right into treatment and walk them through the steps so they are not alone.” Now they have Narcan being distributed everywhere. I’m with the rescue squad. 
AS: What do you with that?
VW: If there’s a car accident, if there’s a drowning, people are lost in the woods, if there’s an overdose, all that kind of stuff. A lot of the overdoses I get are people who are lost or committed suicide. 
AS: Do you have Narcan in there?
VW: We do not but we are getting it. I have Narcan in the house. I keep it here. I let all my neighbors know I have Narcan in the house. That’s how I’ve gotten involved in this. This is more involved than I wanted to get. 
AS: You’re still on the committee.
VW: The committee gave me this award not long ago. It’s from the Public Health Department. It’s an achievement award. The county gave me this about two weeks ago. “This is for the work that you’ve done.” I’m a volunteer. That’s the nice part about being a volunteer. I can speak my mind and say what I want to say.
AS: You’re not at risk. You’re not beholden to anyone. You’re like the voice of the community. 
VW: That’s what they’re calling me. 
AS: That’s really powerful, especially in this current crisis that we’re in. They stay siloed, this task force idea is great. You can sit around and talk but if you don’t do anything there’s no point in meeting. 
VW: The folks on the range called me up and they want to do the same thing, “Will you come up and meet with us?” I don’t have any magic bullets on this thing. I’m just trying to get people…
AS: You’re saying you don’t have the answers.
VW: I don’t. 
AS: You’re coming to it from a place of humility. 
VW: If I had an answer I’d throw it out there. All I’m saying is I believe in the twelve step programs. I think medically assisted treatment has to have a finite end to it. We need to work addicts to a point where they go, “I’ve tapered off of it. Let’s stay involved in the twelve step community and let’s live a twelve step life.” 
Everybody kinds of cringes when I say this but I want to start a two year or a three-year treatment program where people can come to it and live there for two or three years and get stabilized. It was two years for my son to really get back to his old mental self. He doesn’t remember half of the stuff that went on when we talk about it. As parents you just don’t get it. All you can think of is, “How in the world don’t you realize how bad this is for you?” We talk about at our twelve step meetings about expectations and fears. Don’t have expectations, recognize that the addict can’t do that. If you have expectations you’re setting the addict up to fail, yourself up to fail. All you’re doing honestly is putting more shame on the addict. Then you’re mad, “Why are you doing this to me? If you love me, you wouldn’t do this to me.” I think that’s part of the important message that in NarAnon we get to talk about. I try to share that when I do public speaking. As a NarAnon person I say, “I’m a part of NarAnon but I’m not speaking tonight representing NarAnon.” Same with this OARS group I’m a part of. I say, “I’m a member of NarAnon but I do not represent NarAnon at this meeting. Please know that. I’m a volunteer.”
AS: The anonymity thing worked in the time period that it was developed. There was a need for privacy and anonymity. For some people there is a need for privacy but the anonymous part hasn’t really helped us understand addiction as a society. It’s only kept shame alive. I think we are about to move into a new time. My experience as a mother of a teenager who was going off the rails that other parents didn’t want to talk to me. I felt ashamed. I wanted to talk but parents of other troublemaker kids didn’t want to talk. They didn’t want to admit they weren’t in control or their kids were struggling too. It was the most alienating thing. I remember thinking “Why when they’re little babies we’ll talk about the color of their poop and when they’re teenagers we can’t talk about the social problems they’re having.” How can I as another parent help you? I’ve been through this. I’m talking about long before addiction came into my life. Just normal teenage acting out. We don’t support each other in things we feel shame around. 
VW: I look at how that reflects on the child. When the child knows the family is shamed of them what does that do for the child’s self-esteem and self-worth? “I’m the black sheep of the family. I’m the bad one. They don’t even want to talk about me.” I explained that to my son. We talked about shame, we talked about the core beliefs of the addict. “Drugs are my most important aid. If people knew what I was like they wouldn’t like me. I can’t depend on other people to meet my needs.” Those are some of the core beliefs that addicts have to go through. The major one is “I am basically a bad person. No matter how many times I have tried to stop my addiction I have not stopped. I have to be a bad person. I have prayed about it. I have gone to treatment about it. I have made promises to my mother, my father, my wife, my kids. I’ve responsibilities to my children, to my family. I have thrown them all away to take care of my addiction. What an asshole of a person I am.” That’s a terrible thing to live a life of that. That’s why it’s important that we have this public education and stop that stigma. Do you mind if I read this letter of this kid? It kind of ties into this.
AS: You can tell a little bit about it. 
VW: A NarAnon mom just lost her son. He took his own life because he was addicted to heroin and he couldn’t stop it. He was ashamed of his behavior. He felt like a failure. This is an apology letter that he left his mother.
“Mom,
Words can’t come into place for the way I’ve been feeling for a while now and I know you’re going to want to blame part of this on yourself because you gave me more money. This is the most peaceful way I could have done it.”
He put a hose from his exhaust pipe into his truck. That’s how he died.
“It would have happened no matter what but this was the cleanest least sufferable. You and Dad did an amazing job with what life threw at you and not a lot of people would have been able to handle it. I love you Mom and thank you for being the best you could possibly be. Ok suicide by heroin didn’t work. I know you’re wondering why I did this and I will tell you. Monday I went in to do one of my weekly eye scanners and ninety-nine percent of the time it says I’m clean and I most certainly am not clean. Obviously I started using again. I’m pretty sure probation was going to work for me anymore. I also needed to learn how to get clean off heroin on my own. Probation isn’t going to hold my hand for the rest of my life. I found a way to stay off heroin though. I’ve been smoking weed. To probation weed isn’t legal so there’s no possible way to overlook that. If you need to substitute drugs it needs to be Suboxone or methadone or destruxin which are no different than heroin. They all get you high. They all make you totally dependent on them and they all make you sick when you don’t use them every single day. That’s why most addicts are in court systems in the first place. We get sick and we do anything to use again. Weed isn’t like that. I can stop using weed for however long I want and I’m sure as shit I don’t get the least bit sick. I don’t even nod off in public. If for some reason I do need to increase my dosage the same thing happens if increased, nothing. I’ve tried just about everything besides this. I know you’re thinking prison would change me but not in the way anyone would want. Most importantly how I wouldn’t want. I’ve met enough of Duluth’s finest in county and I’d rather not meet anymore. Please don’t leave my body in the ground either. I don’t mind if you have an open casket funeral but please cremate me. I’ve always had the belief that if your body stays in the ground then so do you but if you’re cremated then you get free.” 
AS: That is tragic. Thanks for sharing that.
VW: This epidemic is extremely powerful. Those of us that it affects, it affects all of us. It doesn’t matter if you’re a parent, it affects all of us. 
AS: You can’t be in a room with more than fifteen people with someone who knows someone.
VW: I think of all the children that are in foster care because their parents are in addiction. I think of all the problems those kids are going to have. This is not something we can sit on and allow people to die. That’s it. That’s pretty much why I’m here. This is what got me involved with all this. 
AS: Thank you. It’s a really powerful story.
VW: You’re welcome. I didn’t say it but with my sexual addiction I had been clean and gotten into SAA and did all the stuff I did and was able to put all that behind me. Thank God for that.
AS: You know it can happen for addiction. 
VW: I know people who have eating disorders, who have so many other kinds of addictions. I have been handing a gift, going through all this crap that I’ve gone through. I have a lot of insights. There you go. 
AS: Thank you.

St. Paul, Minnesota
Mark Willenbring        -MW
Amy Sullivan               -AS
MW: Channel nine did a piece on all of this last year. The reporter was totally on board with what I was talking about.
AS: He knew what you were talking about?
MW: He was on board with it. The station required somebody else to give a different opinion. The only guy he could find was this guy who works for Teen Challenge, completely uneducated, knows nothing. He’s an ignoramus, an opinionated bullshiter. That’s who I was compared with, my opinion against his. That’s like Comey versus Trump. That’s how it is. 
AS: We’re in a huge moment for that right now.
MW: Post-truth, right? Truth is what you want it to be. The best thing I’ve ever seen was a poster at the March for Science. The poster said, “If ninety seven percent of engineers said a bridge was unsafe and three percent said it was safe would you go over that bridge?” I really like that. The other poster that made me laugh, it’s completely off the topic, a woman holding up a sign that said, “I can’t believe I’m still holding up this fucking sign.” 
AS: A couple things I wanted to ask. First, the last I heard about your family was with your…
[Knock on the door and brief interruption] 
AS: I’m wondering if you’re willing to talk about your family life. You said your wife was pregnant and then I never heard. Can you talk a little bit about your marriage, your children?
MW: It was really tough to leave San Francisco. I ended up going to Madison, Wisconsin where I did an interdisciplinary social science research fellowship. I was very lucky in having two interdisciplinary experiences. One as a first year resident in psychiatry in Sacramento and certainly this one. It always served me very, very well. I really got a sense of the different perspectives and histories and traditions of different professions. In the first one I really got to understand the difference in nursing, social work, and psychiatry in terms of what the traditions are, what the worldviews are, how they approach things. Of course being a physician I think it’s all medicine. Everyone bristled at that. That has served me very, very well ever since. 
AS: What was the one in Madison again?
MW: Madison was the research fellowship. It included an anthropologist, a lawyer, a psychologist, me. I got a chance to really understand the more academic disciplines than the helping professions. That was very helpful to me. Katie was eight months pregnant when we moved to Madison. We had a waterbed at the time. She knew she was ready to get rid of this baby when she couldn’t get out of the waterbed in the morning. You can just imagine. It was just ridiculous. The balance was all off. This was back in natural birth times. We had the panting. 
AS: Was she having the baby at home?
MW: Oh God no, I would never do that. No babies at home. I kept examining her. I thought I could feel that the cervix was pretty dilated. We were rushing in because we both thought it was eminent. It’s like 3:00 a.m. There’s this big thunderstorm coming on. There’s thunder and lightning. It was very dramatic. Finally we get to the hospital and somebody who knows what they’re doing examined her. It turned out her uterus was really tipped so her cervix was way back. You really couldn’t get to it really easily. It turns out she was like two centimeters. Then she had to learn how to push which was really interesting and very frustrating for her. The normal Del Salvo maneuver to take a bowel movement, that doesn’t work. It was interesting. A week before that I had spilt hot water all over myself and I had second degree burns all over twenty percent of my body. The hospital was way overcrowded. She was in a hallway with a curtain around her. She called and said, “I got to get out of here.” I said, “You can’t come home yet.” I went and got her. We had our first child there. 
AS: You went and got her before she had the baby?
MW: No. 
AS: She wanted to come home after. She was still in the hallway?
MW: Yes, there weren’t any rooms. 
AS: I thought you meant during her labor.
MW: No, she was in a labor room then. I went and got her and everything turned out fine. 
AS: Did you have a baby boy or baby girl?
MW: Baby boy, wonderful baby. Both our children had really severe asthma and ear infections when they were like zero. Really sick all the time. That started down there. 
I mentioned to you that the plan had been to stay at Madison. The recession was still active and nobody was hiring which is how I ended up at the VA up here. We moved up here. Jesse was two. We bought a house. The interest rents were sixteen percent at the time. We had motivated the sellers so they bought us down two points to fourteen percent. On the other hand we paid seventy three thousand dollars for the house. That was an interesting time. When we were in Sacramento it was the oil shock, the first Arab oil embargo. 
I started at the VA. I mentioned before that I was the first person hired under this new initiative to make it an academic department. I was really on my own. The only mentors I had did neuroendocrinology research so I did that for a few years. They took me under their wing. I had this lithium grant which I mentioned. That got me started. It’s amazing after I learn more about what happens in real academic institutions, I was in the boonies. I could have been in a state hospital in Alaska. I was totally on my own, bootstrapping myself as a researcher. Nowadays it’s so organized. You join somebody’s lab, you’re doing a post doc at somebody’s lab for four years. You’ve got ten, fifteen publications by the time you’re up for a faculty position. On the good side you could still get grants then. The standard wasn’t as high. These days MDs can’t get grants, an MD, PhD maybe. Meanwhile I was developing my ideas about chronic care management. I had several lines out trolling around and I got two big lunkers at once. Either was too big. It just about killed me, literally it almost killed me. When I was an intern there was blood all over the place, we didn’t pay any attention to it back in those days. 
AS: In the 70s?
MW: It was pre-AIDS. I got Hepatitis C. At that time it was not known what it was. It was non-A, non-B hepatitis. Then it became chronic. I had chronic Hepatitis C. In retrospect I realize it had been more symptomatic than I realized. The symptoms I had was when I had a virus it would hit me hard. Meanwhile we’re getting up every night at two or three in the morning doing nebulizers for Jesse and wondering when to bring him into the ER, just awful.
AS: Did he recover from that?
MW: He did. Our second one took much longer and had much more in the way of complications.
AS: A boy or a girl?
MW: Another boy. That was four and a half years after Jesse. So about two and a half years after we moved here we had another boy. Jesse was the golden boy, still is. Socially he’s gifted. From the very beginning he could charm the birds out of trees, he’s still that way. He walks into a room and somebody will think, “Did somebody turn a light on?” He’s just got this posse around him all the time. 
AS: What does he do?
MW: He is an abstract painter, an artist. He’s multi-talented. He’s a designer, he can do branding; he’s multi-faceted. He did our logo. He invented a font for it. He’s extremely talented. This last spring he had a solo show in France, in Paris by one of the best known gallerists in Europe.
AS: Where does he live?
MW: LA. His wife is an artist, she’s a filmmaker. She’s a computer graphics expert. She ran NBC’s graphics divisions for a number of years while they were in New York. Jesse finished his degree at Hunter College. Hunter and Yale have traditionally competed for number one in painting. He ended up with a wonderful mentor who took him under her wing and really launched him. It’s still a struggle as you might expect. Both my children are artists. I’ve told them both to marry well. 
AS: Your youngest is an artist too?
MW: I don’t know what he’s going to end up doing. He’s musically gifted and has been working very, very hard to make it in hip hop.
AS: What’s his name?
MW: Morgan, as a producer and hip hop DJ. It’s such a difficult thing to do. Morgan had extremely severe ear infections, sinusitis. He had two sinus surgeries before the age of five. By that time that had just invented the pediatric sinoscope. He had a massive steroid exposure. Severe ADD, I always knew he had it but it wasn’t clearly diagnosed until college or after high school. Then developed depression and by the age of eighteen was suicidal. 
AS: Do you think that was the steroids?
MW: I don’t think there’s any question. It turns out that any kind of major surgery before the age of five has major long term consequences. At any rate his development has been quite delayed. Not intellectually but emotionally. He’s been very gradually working his way out of it. Morgan’s the kind of guy where if you say, “Do X” he won’t do it for the life of him. He’ll do it when he goddamn well pleases. Developmentally it looks like there’s nothing happening for the longest time and all of the sudden he’ll come out with a big leap. He started going to St. Paul College about three years ago and that’s really changed his life. 
AS: Does he live around here?
MW: He lives right downtown. He started out in music business. The business part was not a good idea; it should have just been music. What he really got turned on about was philosophy. He took a feminist philosophy course and got really into that. He took a philosophy of science course this year. His teacher really took him on as a mentor. What’s he thinking about doing? Majoring in philosophy with a minor in religion. What? If you want to do anything besides drive an Uber.
AS: What about your wife Katie? What does she do?
MW: Katie’s an interesting person, very bright. She was a math major when she first went to college. She was bright enough but it wasn’t really her thing. A lot of family issues, very deep family issues. After we’d been here a number of years maybe seven or eight years I started getting seriously ill with my Hepatitis to the point where I was almost having to give up work.
AS: Was there any medicine for that?
MW: At that point they didn’t even know what it was. I had chronic fatigue syndrome. It’s basically symptoms we can’t explain. It’s turning out to be real. Back then it was just considered a Yuppie disease. It’s very real. It’s just then that they characterized the virus. The first treatment for it was Interferon. Just around that time. Now we know that I obviously had the good genotype of Hep C. Most people in the United States have type one which is much more difficult to treat, two and three are much easier to treat. Obviously I had two or three. I started Interferon treatment and bang my liver test went to normal and it’s been there ever since. I’m really lucky. Also at that time Katie’s sister became suicidal and moved in with us for a year. Then there was another woman who was being physically abused and she moved in with us with her two kids. It’s life right? 
Katie had to stop working with Morgan. Somebody had to be available to pick him up from school when he started...Very, very challenging number of years. Then we had some really nice time. Katie had a ski accident at Afton Alps and smashed her tibia. She ran into snowmaking pipes. Smashed her tibia, what the knee sits on, a very serious fracture. It was knit together surprisingly well with the surgeon. It was a lengthy time to get better. That really changed our lives in so many ways. We were all active as a family with skiing, waterskiing, hiking. All of a sudden Katie couldn’t do those things. It really created a huge strain in our lives especially because I was still so into those things. I would go skiing with the boys. Jesse after he finished high school did a year of being a snowboard bum in Colorado. I would take Morgan out there. Katie really couldn’t ski. She felt left behind a lot. I got into bicycling. She wasn’t comfortable with that. Life happens. 
AS: Are your kids in their thirties?
MW: They’re about to be thirty-five and thirty-one. 
AS: Thanks that helps. There were a few things that I thought that it seemed like you wanted to touch on at the end. The importance of language around addiction, these seem to be things that are important to how you’ve come to see chemical use disorder. Language, the chronic illness model, and then evidence based model. I don’t know if there is more about those things?
MW: My model is health care. I’m not that different than a cardiologist. I treat a different organ.
AS: To rephrase that would it be normalizing the way we treat this particular chronic illness. Do you think we can do that?
MW: My ultimate goal is to mainstream addiction treatment into health care. Firstly it’s the only way that makes sense; it’s the only way we’ll get integrated treatment. It’s the only way we’ll get treatment to the vast number of people who need it, if you’ve got twenty million people with alcohol use disorder. The future for substance use treatment for opiate and alcohol use disorders and smoking we already have the tools and the knowledge for the people who get treatment in primary care. 
AS: They can’t get it in primary care can they? Because of the DEA and the restrictions.
MW: That’s got nothing to do with it. It has to do primarily with the fact that rehab in this country was developed very self-consciously to keep doctors at a distance. 
AS: When I was thinking about mainstreaming it and getting it in primary care doctors don’t have the tools that they need or they haven’t been trained. 
MW: They don’t know anything. They’re not expected to know anything. 
AS: Would you say that’s because of the way the treatment model has developed in the U.S.? 
MW: Referred to rehab. 
AS: So they’ve been siloed from each other.
MW: Totally.
AS: Doctors haven’t really wanted to deal with addiction medicine.
MW: To say the least. They’re not looking for anything else to do.
AS: But if a new disease came about?
MW: They’d resist that too. Specialists would have to do it for a long time before you’d get it in primary care. That’s the other thing, specialists. There’s no out-patient specialty care. That’s what Alltyr provides. Primary care doctors are on their own. If there’s one thing a primary care doctor is not, it’s a risk taker. They provide very well-established standards of care. They don’t experiments. They’re not on the forefront of anything except for coordinating care of family based care. That’s all done with specialists. One of the biggest problems is even for somebody who wants to do this they’re not going to become addiction specialist doctors. If they’re not going to become a specialist then who do they call if something with a patient goes south? A counselor with a GED preaching at AA for a month? No. Without the back up of specialists…
AS: Without the primary care doctor having an addiction specialist to call on they’re not going to want those patients.
MW: Just like we do with cardiology or endocrinology or psychiatry. They treat depression and anxiety and diabetes. They treat heart disease. They’ll only treat it to a certain depth of complexity. It used to be in rural areas where you only had the hometown doc they were on their own so much they said there’s no one else around. This guy needs this type of surgery. They’d look it up in the textbooks and try to figure out how to do this. Those days are long gone. These days most doctors practice in big cities or large multispecialty clinics or they’re part of a big network. Allina has a clinic out in Buffalo but it’s tied in with the Allina network. They could send you in here for surgery or if you have multiple sclerosis and need a neurologist or whatever. Primary care doctors are now all practicing in areas where there’s a low bar for referring to a specialist. 
AS: You said last time that Alltyr is a demonstration clinic. Do you want to talk about how you came up with this idea and went to all this trouble to create this beautiful space? 
MW: The programs I’ve developed in other places, the VA in particular but also my own practice with Allina, it’s health care. It’s what I do. The model is health care. That includes psychiatry. I don’t separate out mental health care form general medicine. It’s all connected. It’s very interesting as we find out more and more about how important the gut is and the microbiome is to psychiatric illnesses. That’s going to just be explosive so to speak. When I was at NIH I finally got it about the mind body issue.
AS: Remind me when you were at NIH.
MW: 2004 to 2009. I finally got that there’s only one thing happening. When something happens with a living organism there’s only one thing that happens but it happens at multiple levels all at once. It’s not linear. 
AS: Give me an example.
MW: An example is somebody will say, “It’s really genetic.” Or they’ll say, “It’s a brain disease. It’s a derangement of the brain.” That’s called reductionism. You can be any kind of a reductionist. Have you watched the Nobel stuff?
AS: What Nobel stuff?
MW: There was a Nobel Conference two years ago. Every year at Gustavus Adolphus has a Nobel Conference at the same time the Nobel Awards are being announced, maybe the same time as the awards ceremony in Sweden. There was one on addiction. If you just go to the Gustavus site they record everything in it, very high quality video. I was invited to be a part of that. The three primary speakers were a biological reductionist, a sociological reductionist, and a psychological reductionist. Myself and the other clinician who were involved, he’s a psychologist, were the only ones trying to integrate that stuff. Each of them was arguing, “It’s only this level of analysis that’s important not these other levels.” Well that’s bullshit. There’s only one thing. Something happens, right now I’m talking and you’re nodding your head. What’s happening within each of and between us and around us is happening at a genetic, genomic, sub cellular, inter cellular, intra cellular, subsystem, organ, inter organ, individual, psychological, social level. It’s all happening at once. Complex systems aren’t linear. They don’t happen as this happens and then that happens. It’s constant, extremely rapid conversation between layers. 
One of the biggest challenges across health care is modelling across scale. When I was at NIH I changed the direction of research in treatment. I said, “Fact is we don’t know anything about drinking. Nobody measures anything about drinking.” 
AS: How so?
MW: They don’t measure it. Only a couple of people measure it. How much people drink? At what time? What they drink?
AS: You mean in a scientific study. 
MW: How do you model the different patterns of drinking in people who drink a little, drink a lot? Only a couple people. It’s all been focused on alcoholism. It’s all been distorted by rehab and AA. 
AS: And this disease model.
MW: I would call that the pneumonia disease model. The pneumonia disease model is you get a highly specific disease, it’s acute, you go to the hospital, you treat it, you’re cured, you’re discharged.
AS: That’s what we’re doing in the treatment world.
MW: It’s not chronic. We don’t just call addiction ‘disease’; we treat it as one. It’s important to understand the meaning of chronic. Chronic often means three months. It doesn’t mean decades. It doesn’t have to mean that. Chronic pain is after three months. When people hear chronic they think decades or year. Most people have an episode of alcohol use disorder, a single episode typically lasting a few years and then it goes away and never comes back. That’s like eighty plus percent. We’re only focused on the sickest ten percent. 
AS: And to say that it’s forever.
MW: Those who have that kind of thing typically have five or more episodes. They have recurrences but not everybody does. Three years is considered chronic in the health care world even if you get complete remission and it never comes back. Even though the typically episode last three or four years it’s still considered chronic. I like asthma as an analogous disease, not diabetes or hypertension. Substance use isn’t like that. Most people get well. Diabetics don’t get well typically. People with heart disease don’t get well. All we’re doing is slowing the rate of deterioration. 
AS: But asthmatics can and do. 
MW: Exactly. There’s this wide range of severity. The same thing with substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder. Not all chronic addiction, there’s a lot more people than you might think who use heroin for a few weeks and then stop. Or they use it once a month for years and never get addicted. Nobody ever wants to talk about that. It’s this horrible thing where you inject it once and you’re a slave for life. Same with meth, cocaine, ecstasy. It’s a small minority of cannabis users, even daily cannabis users who you would consider to have a disorder like nine percent lifetime will develop a disorder. 
AS: Remind me what the percentage is of other things?
MW: With smoking it’s like sixty five percent become addicted. With alcohol it’s more like thirty percent or forty percent. Opiates it depends what you mean by everyday users, using recreationally or not. It’s actually quite low in terms of somebody who uses it once and then never uses it again. There’s a lot of people like that. 
AS: I do remember seeing it’s less.
MW: Less than alcohol.
AS: Back to you’re at the NIH.
MW: Up to that time we mostly had horserace studies, my treatment’s better than yours. Basically the initial thing is my treatment’s better than usual, TAU, treatment as usual. In substance abuse that’s really no treatment. Well-trained people with advanced degrees who really strongly believe in what they’re doing are they going to do better than a counselor with a GED telling his own story? Yeah. What a shocker. The end result was what’s called a dodo bird effect. The dodo bird in Alice in Wonderland declared a race. 
[Knock on door and brief interruption]
MW: She’s on state insurance and it changed and she didn’t know there was going to be the need. She’s frantically calling us. Friday afternoon I’m submitting the prior authorization to her old insurance because that’s what the pharmacy said she had. Then I find out she wasn’t covered by them anymore. I called them. This is hours I’m spending uncompensated. Then I called the patient and said, “They said you’re not covered by this.” I call her back on Monday. Meanwhile she runs out of medicine on Sunday. Now she’s in withdrawal. She’s at serious risk of recurrence. She’s on Minnesota state insurance. They’re putting us through these hoops. We submit a prior authorization and it’s denied. 
AS: Has she been on the state insurance this whole time?
MW: It was a different administrator of Medicaid. That’s all. She’d been on Medicaid this whole time. 
AS: Nothing has really changed for her medical needs.
MW: Or even her insurance. It’s just who’s administering it. We get a denial back late yesterday. I call them to find out and I find out. There’s nothing on their box to check. “You didn’t say these things.” I faxed over a letter, late afternoon yesterday from home, with that information which was really stupid. They come back now and they say, “You didn’t submit the right forms.”
AS: Meanwhile she is in crisis. 
MW: I’ve had people relapse to heroin use because of prior authorization shit. It’s an atrocity. 
AS: Is that particular to Suboxone?
MW: No, with Suboxone it’s so dire. Then they’re in this double bind. They can’t pay cash by law because they’re covered under state insurance. They can’t even buy it. 
AS: Or they’re forced to go look for it on the street. 
MW: They can’t legally buy it. 
I wanted to get to some things. The dodo bird effect. The dodo bird declares a race, everybody rushes around. Then they’re waiting for a result and he says, “All have won and all must have prizes.” With psychotherapy research all have won and all must have prizes. Basically speaking whenever you compare different therapy approaches, there are some notable exceptions, but for the most part we know therapy has a powerful effect, but we don’t know how it works. All the stuff we think about how it works isn’t how it works. You can have people with completely different theoretical backgrounds, different techniques, same result for all different types of conditions. I said, “We don’t need any more horserace studies. We don’t need anyone taking a manual off the shelf, tweaking it a bit and saying ‘I’m going to see if it works for one legged Puerto Rican woman sex workers.’” We don’t need any more studies like that. 
We don’t understand how people change. It turns out when you look at it more carefully, in fact, change happens before people enter a treatment or a study. Entering treatment or a study is a result of change. That was a revelation, all these extremely bright people that was a revelation. What’s causing change? We don’t have a goddamn clue because nobody’s been looking at it. Everybody’s looking at what we’re doing not what’s happening. 
It’s still happening. I started this whole thing about the basic science of behavior change because we don’t know anything about it. We decided to look at three levels neurobiological, psychological or experiential, phenomenological and immediate social. It’s the thirty people who really influence us. It turns out to be astonishingly difficult. We started working with mathematicians because there’s been this big revolution in mathematical modeling. One of the mathematicians that I got to know the best had been working most of his career on modelling the beginning of the universe. After being involved on this other project for a while he said, “This is way more complicated.” 
AS: What was his name?
MW: I don’t remember but I can find out. 
AS: Do you have some work from that time at the NIH that I can look at?
MW: No, I don’t really. It’s one of those papers I haven’t written. I’ve never written enough. I get too involved in doing...I wish I did. It ended up becoming an NIH wide initiative on mechanisms of behavioral change, from the little tiny NIAAA.
AS: What’s NIAAA?
MW: The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. 
AS: We’re talking about Alltyr and how you came to start this.
MW: Basically, I didn’t want to do this. It was a calling. I didn’t want to do addiction. That was fate. To quote the Romans, “For those who are willing the fates will lead. The rest will drag along.” I chose to be led. Although sometimes it felt like I was being dragged.
AS: But you’ve kept your passion about it and your thinking about it is very different from the doing you were just talking about.
MW: I have always been an academic. 
AS: But it’s the doing that is challenging and questioning the model for the benefit of the patient?
MW: Nobody else had done this and somebody had to try to change the system. When I came back here I decided…
AS: This is 2009?
MW: Essentially 2010. At that time we started to develop ideas about how we’re going to do this. It took us two years to put the corporate structure together. Essentially my strategy was the first thing that needs to happen is you need a demonstration model that answers the question: if not rehab, then what? It needs to be in the flesh, something people can experience. It needs to be a place where you can provide proof of concept. Where you can show that it’s much more effective, much more cost effective. It costs much less; it provides far superior outcomes at a fraction of the cost. Not only that but people with milder forms of the disorder will find it acceptable or attractive to come to this. They’re not going to go to rehab. Nobody goes if they’re not forced to. They can’t sell their product; nobody’s going to buy it. The whole system is dependent on people being coerced to buy it. 
AS: Just off topic a little bit. I understand you don’t deal with insurance but you were just talking about dealing with state. Can you explain your philosophy around insurance? 
MW: What’s not covered for people who come here are the professional fees. What they pay us. All their medications, procedures that’s all covered. 
AS: Therapy, talk therapy…
MW: If it’s here it’s not covered. That’s a professional service. 
AS: How competitive are your rates? Have you had any problems with people?
MW: People on Medicaid, except for Suboxone patients, most people on Medicaid can’t do it. Then again no one can treat someone on Medicaid with insurance on an out-patient basis unless you’re part of a greater health care system. With every visit you lose money and not a small amount. That’s why in rehabs they have groups of twelve people. That’s the only way you can make it. They’re only paying their counselors eighteen thousand dollars a year anyways. The turnover rate is fifty percent a year. 
AS: But you’re using a group model to keep your costs down…
MW: I’m talking about patient groups. They call it group therapy but it’s not. Almost all of treatment here is done individually. We have an option of a suboxone medication group. This is a med check in a group. It keeps our costs down, it keeps their costs down. 
Let me say this in terms of affordability, I am the cheapest act in town for Suboxone by a factor of three. I’m not in to gouging heroin addicts. For an individual appointment with a UA to see me is two hundred and five dollars. I charge much less than Allina. But you can’t get Suboxone there. Most Suboxone doctors are three hundred to five hundred dollars a month. Just for a prescription and it’s a monthly visit. Here if you’re stable for a year you can go to every other month. If you’re stable for two years you can go to every three months. For the group it’s one hundred and forty five dollars. I have people who are on minimum wage who are counting out their pennies. It’s cheaper than using heroin. In terms of overall treatment, on average the first year of treatment here completely integrated mental health and substance use treatment for a year is about three grand. Other place people are shelling out sixty grand for a month of bullshit. Half the people pay less than that. At their last treatment progress note people with alcohol use disorder, eighty percent were at their goal or had made substantial progress toward it. 
AS: After how long?
MW: After their treatment. 
AS: What are your plans with this demonstration clinic?
MW: We’re talking right now to two different potential partners. The goal has always been to grow. It’s never been to have a clinic locally or regionally. I’m involved in a different company that is going to be providing treatment for mild to moderate alcohol use disorder among employed people, completely remotely and directly to the patient mainly using smartphones and tablets. There is some face to face interaction. We’ll be prescribing medication. We’re talking about a company that has already raised five million bucks. It has the potential to completely revolutionize how everybody thinks about alcohol use disorder. We just enrolled our first pilot patient. We’re only six months in. It’s amazing to see. 
AS: People would check in on their phone?
MW: There’s a coach, there’s a therapist, and then there’s a physician for prescribing medication. It’s only for mild to moderate, relatively stable employed people. This is being sold directly to companies or health care companies. We’ll see what happens but the goal is a billion dollar company. Big investors don’t invest in anything less than a billion dollar company. I’ve learned that. One problem for us is you can’t scale it like a tech based company. A billion dollars or times ten in five is the way venture capitalists think. That’s pretty hard to achieve with something like this model. It’s clinical care. It’s not just an app. You’ve got to have a place. Alltyr treats across the board. We’re kind of complimentary. There’s a lot of stuff happening online in terms of medical care and therapy. You can get a nurse consultation online about a sore throat, or a UTI, whatever it is and get prescribed medicine and never see anybody. There’s Teladoc, there’s all this stuff. That doesn’t mean when you’ve got appendicitis that you don’t need a surgeon in a hospital. That’s what I’m talking about. Alltyr is already to a limited degree using telephone and internet visits. We want to capitalize more on that. 
AS: Have you thought about training other addiction medicine physicians?
MW: There’s two companies. There’s Alltyr Incorporated which is a C-Corp that could function in all fifty states. Then Alltyr Clinic is a specific professional organization that operates under Minnesota law, the medical practice act. Every state regulates medical practices differently. Alltyr Clinic Minnesota is a Minnesota specific organization. It functions in a specific way regulated by that act. Alltyr Inc. will be the vehicle for spread. Spread includes many different possible ways. One is simply making Alltyr more available, that would be more sites. Right now my thought is to start with regional hubs in large cities but then use Telehealth a lot to get a pretty big region from each hub. People can come to the hub if they need to face to face care but you can leverage that with a lot of Telehealth. There should be a lot of people who don’t even need to come to the hub. It depends on the state if it has to be in person or not. It also depends on the situation. If someone is pretty complicated and unstable I’m not going to do that via Telehealth. 
We also would like to market directly to other physicians. We can do consultations with physicians. We can consult with existing health care organizations to help them figure out what their needs are according to their population. These are the numbers of people we would expect to have x substance use disorder. This is where we think they’re located according to your geographic area. This is what we think it would cost. These are the kind of staff you need. Let’s say we do that with Health Partners. If they say we want to do this they have to make the decision if they want to build it or buy it. We could either help them build it by providing training or supervision or they could buy it. We could become a vendor either that they just refer people to or much better would be we hire and train staff that would be placed in their facility. They would operate staff for that organization but we would be hiring them and supervising them. They would pay us x amount per year or per patient or whatever. Those are all possibilities. 
There’s other approaches, approaching large self-insured companies who provide substance abuse treatment to all their employees. This other company, it’s called Annum, I’ve already talked to them about Alltyr being a kind of complement. Annum you need local resources for complicated patients. There aren’t any. We need Alltyr there. That’s kind of the idea. I’m talking to a very large organization that invests in Alltyr. They want to move it into behavioral health. They’re based on the East Coast, a very interesting model. It’s called buy out and hold. The strategy of the company has been to buy relatively new startups that are doing well, buy a majority stake but not completely liquidate the ownership because they want to keep on the current management because that’s what they’re buying. They can infuse all kinds of growth capital. 
AS: What’s the hold part?
MW: Just staying with it. Not a flip. The owner is a single shareholder, hasn’t sold a company in forty years. His approach is if I get ten percent profit from each of my sixty some companies every year, okay. The other one is a completely different thing. It’s a Hollywood producer who has a personal interest in this. He came here just because he wanted to talk about it and then decided he wants one of these. “We’ve got to have one in LA. My friends and I talk about this. Where would we refer a loved one? There is no place.” We’ve had discussions with other investors through the years.
AS: When did you start this? 2010?
MW: I think we were incorporated in 2012. I think I started seeing patients in 2013. 
AS: I have a little question. How did you meet Paula DeSanto? I interviewed her. She kept saying, “Call Mark.”
MW: She was at a meeting that I was asked to speak to when I was still with NIAAA. I think I had come back from NIAAA then. I gave an all day workshop. One of the things she’ll talk about is she kept saying, “He said what? He really said that?” She sent me an email and I said, “Let’s get together for breakfast.” 
AS: Anything else? Can I call you again if I need to?
MW: You can call me again. Did I get you that blurb about neurobiology? About why we use methadone. What’s today? Tuesday. We’ve got to get out of here. 
[Break in Recording]
MW: Addiction develops as a result of exposure of the brain to a drug. People are not born addictive; they are born vulnerable to it. What makes them vulnerable? Well in the case of alcohol and opioids we know there are four specific risk factors. First of all you have to like how you feel on that drug. Not everybody does. That’s genetically determined. When I take an opioid I feel nauseous, itchy, constipated, bloated. I don’t like it. I would never take it for fun. When you talk to somebody who’s addicted to heroin I always ask them, “Tell me the first time you ever took an opioid. How did it feel?” They say, “I loved it. I felt normal. I felt great.” Same with alcohol. Some people like it, some people have half a glass of wine and have a headache. You have to like. You have to be able to develop tolerance fairly rapidly. People with mild and moderate alcohol use disorder typically peak out between five and ten drinks a day. If they try to drink above that they will fall asleep. They have a medium vulnerability. The people with the really severe multi-generational early onset really severe AUD they could drink a liter a day, a one point seven five liter in a day. I couldn’t develop that kind of tolerance no matter how hard I tried. That’s genetic. The third thing is, especially in the beginning, a relative absence of adverse effects while taking it. Again, people become addicted to opioids when they don’t get itchy, they don’t get constipated, they don’t get nauseous. Same with alcohol. First of all because of the tolerance when everybody else is throwing up or passed out they’re going, “Hey, where’s the party? Where’d you guys all go?” The next day when everybody is worshipping the porcelain throne they’re just up with no hangover. “Let’s do it again.” That’s genetic. The fourth thing is a very interesting thing. It’s feeling stimulated rather than sleepy when you start taking the drug. People who develop alcohol use disorder when they first start drinking it clears their head. It clears their head. They get more energy, they feel refreshed. They get things done. They clean their house. They do all sorts of things. Same with opioids. They feel stimulated. They’re no longer depressed. 
With opioids in particular since we have an endogenous opioid system, which is why these drugs work on us. We don’t have opioid receptors because we were going to invent Percocet someday. That’s our pleasure system. It’s essential for well-being and function. It’s very likely to assume that with any genetic trait there’s some distribution across the population at birth with endogenous opiate function. They’re people who are always on the high end of the spectrum. They’re always in a good mood. Nothing phases them. They have a high pain tolerance. Most people are in the middle. Then there are people who are on the low tail of the spectrum. This is speculative but it makes sense. They never feel good since childhood. They’ve never felt good. They’ve never been a high energy person. They’ve always felt a little irritable. It typically gets misdiagnosed as depression but anti-depressants don’t work of course. Although we’ve known for a very long time that opioids sometimes have anti-depressant efficacy. Buprenorphine is being examined now as a treatment for treatment resistant depression. Methadone we’ve known for a very long time.
AS: That methadone helps with depression?
MW: Yes, in some people. But which people? It’s reasonable to speculate that there’s going to be these people whose internal opiate system is not functioning all that well since birth. They take an opioid, bang they’re normal. Another way to think about it is it could happen secondarily. Especially to a genetically vulnerable person, after using endogenous opioids for so long their internal system gets repressed. 
AS: That’s what’s written about more. 
MW: I’m going to be writing about this more. A lot of people may have started that way. It may not be secondary to use, it may be primary and it may be why they got addicted. The best to think of it is biological systems operate on set points around which there’s an optimal range. There’s all these feedback mechanisms. Temperature, a tiny range. Blood pressure, blood sugar, blood calcium, thyroid level, mood not too high not too low. Thinking, creative but not psychotic. Fear, appropriate but not too much or too little. Weight, body weight is a good example. It’s reasonable to believe that the opioidergic system operates around a set point. In the case of opioids whether it happens secondarily or starts that way when it’s suppressed for long enough you end up with a lower set point, a suboptimal set point. 
Set point, here is the analogy I use to explain to my patients. It’s like a thermostat. Temperature goes up you get air conditioning if it goes down you get heat. Let’s say it’s set at seventy and you’re doing fine. Because of global warming in Minnesota you have freak weather and you have seventy five degrees every day for five years. Then you get an ice age. While it’s seventy five you never need to use the heat so the thermostat gets reset to fifty. Then you get the ice age. You go and you try to get the thermostat but it’s stuck at fifty and it won’t change anymore. It’s reset. It’s a new set point. Fifty won’t kill you but it’s really miserable. You burn up all your firewood trying to get the heat up in the house. Then you’ve got some extra lumber you burn. You chop down all the trees in your yard. Then you go out and you’re buying everything because you don’t have any money. You’re buying up wood and coal and whatever the hell you can buy to burn in your fireplace. Then you’re stealing it. You’re going out at night and stealing firewood and chopping down trees. It occupies all of your time. All you can think about it getting warm. That’s active opiate addiction. What buprenorphine and methadone are are replacement therapies. They normalize the system. It’s installing another furnace so you can get the temperature up to seventy again. Once you’re at seventy you never think of it. It never occurs to you. That’s what happens. With set points that’s permanent. That doesn’t recover. 
AS: In the brain?
MW: Anywhere. Dieting causes obesity. It does that because every time you diet, aka starve, your body has all these mechanisms to prevent weight loss but one of the effects is the body weight set point goes up. You not only gain all the weight back but more. Every time you diet your weight goes up. It doesn’t change. That’s the thing about set points. Once you’re diabetic it doesn’t usually come back to normal. The thing about the brain is it’s just a different organ.
AS: Thank you so much.

AS: What I have to start with first is you giving me permission.
MW: My name is Mark Willenbring and I give permission to Dr. Amy Sullivan to use this material in her book and her project.
AS: We are in the Alltyr Clinic in downtown St. Paul conducting this interview. You were saying you’ve been in this field since the 1980s. I want to back up and find out where you were born. Tell me a little bit about your family.
MW: I was actually born on the Iron Range in Virginia. 
AS: Virginia, Minnesota.
MW: Virginia, Minnesota: the queen city in the Iron Range. 
AS: Is that what they call it?
MW: Yes. 
AS: When were you born?
MW: 1949. At that time in particular it was a very unique place. It was very ethnically diverse. In Minnesota diversity means a Swede and a Norwegian.
AS: And religions, a Catholic and a Lutheran.
MW: Maybe Jewish. The way Northern Minnesota developed was it started with the logging industry. When they’d gone through all the original timber they found high quality iron ore on the Iron Range. Mining became the big new industry. Starting with the logging industry the companies would bring in men from primarily Sweden and Finland to work there. They had a similar climate. A lot of Scandinavians, Germans, Italians. At that time that was ethnically diverse. It was a radical place because with the mining industry there were epic labor battles in the 1930s. The steel companies brought in the Pinkertons, the union formed and was very strong. There were bombings, killings, beatings. The whole thing. The place up there became very radicalized. There was actually a neighborhood in Little Virginia which at that time had a population of about 12,000. There was a neighborhood called Finntown. It was probably four square blocks. The president of the American Communist Party, Gus Hall, was born in Finntown. There were a lot of communists up there in the 30s and a lot of wobblies. 
AS: You are a history buff, aren’t you?
MW: A little bit. I’m very political so that’s part of it. That was really the core of the DFL Party. It was very heavily Democratic. The unions prevailed eventually. Because they did they were paid well. These were high paying jobs. That was all across the Mesabi Range ranging from Virginia through Grand Rapids and Hibbing. There was another vein called the Vermillion, there was a smaller one as well. Then in the late 40s the high-grade ore ran out just like the lumber had. Because it was so focused on natural resources it’s always been a boom and bust economy up there. When I was born it went into a deep recession. It was Depression Era; it was twenty five percent unemployment. The place was devastated. Mines were shutting down. That was before I could remember.
AS: Did your family work in the mines?
MW: No. I was a very atypical ranger. If I was a typical ranger my dad would have worked in the mine or for a mining company. I probably would have too. My father’s family emigrated from Germany. Most of them settled in the St. Cloud, Stearns County area. That’s one of the only places I know where everybody knows how to spell Willenbring. It sounds just like it’s place but it gets murdered in many ways. The best one is Willburding or Will M. Bring. 
His father moved from the St. Cloud area to homestead a farm outside of Minot, North Dakota. He grew up in North Dakota in a tiny town on the prairie. His mother died when he was nine. It was a big family. His father married a nineteen or twenty-year-old. His eldest daughters were sixteen and seventeen. The priest in Foxhome, which was the little town nearby, wouldn’t marry them, it was too scandalous. They had to go to Minot and the bishop married them. It was really difficult. Her name was Loretta. It was very difficult for the children. There was a lot of conflict and she wasn’t liked. The two oldest sisters entered the convent.
AS: They were Catholic?
MW: Very Catholic. I visited the place. It’s still in the family, a dairy farm. A very small house. I can’t imagine nine children in it out in the middle of nothing. They’d take the sleigh in the winter, pulled by horses. For example, my father had to wait after he finished eighth grade he had to wait two years. His oldest brother was going to high school in the town of Foxhome. These days we just drive there but not then. He had a job at the local hotel. Every morning he’d bring around hot water to the rooms.
AS: This was your father?
MW: No, his oldest brother. He got room and board when he was staying at the hotel so he could go to high school. My father had to wait for him to graduate before he could get that job and go to high school. He did and then he got hired on by the local banker as a teller. That started his career. My mother grew up in Maple Plain which is a western suburb. At that time it was a little farm town. She grew up on a farm outside of Maple Plain. I’ve been there too, still in the family too. Then both of them were just obsessed with getting off the farm. I grew up hearing all the tales of being on the farm.
AS: How did they meet?
MW: My dad got drafted. He was older by that time. He was well into his thirties. My mother was eight years younger. She went to a business school and learned stenography. She became a secretary for several years in the Twin Cities. She was living in the Twin Cities and one of my father’s sisters lived here. Two sisters and a brother lived here. One of the sisters had some people over and my dad was back here on furlough. He was stationed in Clovis, New Mexico at an airbase. He was in the Army Air Corps. He was on furlough here. I don’t know if he was staying with his sister. Gilly, her name was, invited my mother, Maggie, over. That’s how they met. While he was on furlough his entire unit was shipped to North Africa. Every one of them died in North Africa. He stayed back and his assignment was to stay at the base and keep the records of the company. He was a banker. 
AS: So he was sent back.
MW: He stayed in Clovis, New Mexico for the remainder of the war.
AS: It just happened when he was on furlough and then he went back.
MW: Then he went back to Clovis and my older brother was born there. Then they moved back to the Twin Cities. I think Dad tried selling insurance for a while and it didn’t work out. There was a job opening at a bank in Virginia and they moved up there. They weren’t rangers. My mother had real big city sensibilities. To her dying day she hated being in Virginia. She always wanted to be in the city. She had wanted to be a nurse. Her father in many ways was a bastard and was abusive to her mother. He just cut her off financially for some punishment or something. She was already accepted to go to nursing school and she couldn’t go. That haunted her all her life. She was very bright. Extremely neurotic, but very bright. He started out as a teller at the State Bank of Virginia which was eventually acquired by Stanley West (pre-Wells Fargo). 
I don’t know what happened after that. When I was growing up he was at the bank. He stayed on and ended up being president. There were some very tough times in the middle. He had an early heart attack. The men in his family had early heart attacks. He survived it but I think because of that he was already vice president and he was passed over for the presidency. That was a very bitter pill for both him and my mother. They brought in somebody else to be president. 
My mother hated his wife. It was a very difficult time for them. They stuck it through. When this guy left he became president. He presided over a new building there. In my father’s late fifties, early sixties he was the talk of the town. He was very beloved because he really cared about people and really helped people with their businesses. 
AS: Their farms probably.
MW: Not so much farms there. That’s where I grew up. In the early 50s it was like the Depression up there. Then at the University of Minnesota they developed the technology for taconite. I remember going to a taconite plant when they first started. They use magnetic extraction to make taconite pellets, which then could be used in furnaces. 
That led to the next boom. The mines reopened, great jobs. The mining companies were such a great tax base. The utilities money in Virginia was very good. They had the first heated indoor pool in the state of Minnesota at Virginia High School. They built this steam plant that heated every house in town with steam. They piped steam to every house in time. When I grew up there it was really good times and thriving. Main Street was just alive and vibrant and thriving. It was a good time to be there. The quality of education was good. 
We lived on the edge of town where I could walk into this huge field. I could walk over to the train tracks that the mining companies used. There were big trains around and machinery parts. It was beautiful for a boy. There was a creek there. We would just play there for days and days. Then you could go up into the mining areas. I could actually walk into the woods right from home.
AS: How many siblings did you have?
MW: Just one, an older brother. Looking back now I’m almost certain I could have gotten into Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale. Berkeley was where I really wanted to go. Neither of my parents had a college education. The high school counselor wasn’t very broad. I had no guidance.
AS: Where did you go?
MW: I went to the University of Minnesota. I was accepted at Northwestern in Chicago. It was the only other place I applied. My life could have been very different. I took college chemistry at the junior college across the street from the high school. The chemistry teacher encouraged me to apply to Harvard, but he was the only one. I just didn’t know anything about that stuff. My brother was at the University here. I knew the Twin Cities.
AS: Are you guys just a couple years apart?
MW: Five years. He was already in graduate school in electrical engineering. I came down here. I also knew the Cities. I could drive home. I got a good education. 
AS: What did you major in in undergrad?
MW: I had a double major in sociology and biochemistry. I was in the honors program. My advisor was H. Mead Cavert who for decades was the assistant dean of the medical school. He died recently. 
AS: Is it Cavert?
MW: Cavert, C-A-V-E-R-T. Mead. This will become important. I participated in all the protests. I was a parade marshal in a parade that went from the University to the capitol. 
AS: The student protests?
MW: Everybody was protesting. It went right down Summit Avenue.
AS: This is in what year?
MW: This was ‘70. Things blew up after the Cambodian Invasion and Kent State. Things really blew up. Students shut down Washington Avenue, barricaded it. I was in medical school at that time. There was a former police sergeant named Charles Stendrick who was really an authoritarian guy. The cops rioted on the protestors, they just went nuts. It was really bad. The University shut down for the rest of the quarter. I was an undergraduate then when that happened. I was a junior. The whole university shut down and they shut down for the rest of spring quarter. What was interesting was that at that time, when I was an undergraduate when I was a junior they did away with student deferments and went to the lottery system.
AS: For Vietnam?
MW: I pulled a bad number. I was seriously considering Sweden, Canada, CO status. I wasn’t about to go to Vietnam. They retained deferment for medical students. I’m a junior now. At that time there were a few medical schools around the country that accepted some students after three years. University of Minnesota was one of them. 
AS: So you didn’t have to get an undergraduate degree.
MW: Right. I applied to all of these and I got waitlisted at Minnesota. I’m sure the only reason that I got accepted was H. Meade Cavert was my advisor. There was a shortage of primary care physicians. That year the legislature voted to expand the medical programs by twenty-five students. That got me in. I got in there and I was deferred. When I graduated it was over. Otherwise the deferment was granted on the condition that you would serve afterwards as a physician. That happened in 1970, I was accepted. I graduated ‘74 just when Vietnam was winding down. 
AS: What was your specialization?
MW: I went in intending to be a psychiatrist.
AS: Did that have anything to do with your mother? What made you interested in psychiatry?
MW: I had this image in my mind of sitting in a room with a patient doing psychotherapy. I don’t know where they came from. I wanted to be a doctor from a very early age. Right after I was done wanting to be a priest. 
AS: A priest or a doctor. I’ve heard this from somebody else I’ve interviewed.
MW: My mother had been a Methodist but she converted to Catholicism for my father. It was a requirement but she wasn’t a real Catholic. I didn’t go to Catholic school. My dad was quite pious but he was very quiet about it. My mother wasn’t really a Catholic. We went to the Polish Catholic Church. I went through communion and all of that stuff.
AS: You thought you were going to be a psychiatrist and then what happened?
MW: I enjoyed all aspects of medicine. By the time I was going to graduate I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. I did a GP internship. It was the last year they were offered. They were called RO internships. Before everybody became a specialist most doctors would have an internship. It was well rounded; you do everything. You do surgery, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, ER, whatever.
I did that at what’s now Regions. It was Ramsey Hospital back then. I applied there and at Hennepin. I decided to go to Ramsey. It was a good experience. I still didn’t know what I wanted to do. I started working in the ER there after I graduated. I did that for two years. I also did little stunts in Farmington at a clinic and practiced some family medicine there. I also did some practice at community clinics, the Seward Community Clinic and the Southside Community Clinic. 
What I found out about myself was that I was good at all that but even family practice is pretty technical. You do a lot of procedures; you don’t spend a lot of time talking to people. I kept wanting to have more time to talk to people. I really like the Emergency Room. It was a MASH mentality. You related to the staff. You had the repeaters, old Joe who got drunk and fell on his head. You didn’t have lasting relationships with patients. I liked the variety and the excitement. I wanted to stay on there. 
This was the time when family practice residencies and emergency medicine residencies were just forming. It was a brand-new thing. I could have gotten grandfathered in in emergency medicine or family practice. My chief at the time there said, “I’m not going to do that because in ten years you’d regret it. You’d be at a disadvantage compared to people with a residency.” It’s not the same. I had to choose between emergency medicine and psychiatry so I decided to do psychiatry. Now that I know a number of people who were emergency medicine docs I’m glad I’m not one. They all burn out at like forty-five and start doing family practice. It’s the shift work. It just kills you. 
I wanted to go to the West Coast. I applied to a bunch of programs out there. I ended up at the University of California, Davis in Sacramento. It was at that time a very new medical school. It was the first medical school formed in like fifty years. It was like eight years old. They had just taken over the county hospital. The academic programs were miniscule. The main campus was at Davis. The medical students had their training in Davis, which was just outside of Sacramento. A very precious community. The medical center was in Sacramento proper. 
One of the things I like about the program there was in the first year they had this interdisciplinary program where you went through this experience with a psychologist, social workers, advanced practice nurses. You got to know other professions perspectives. It was really, really interesting. I really liked that. 
I did my residency. I became very interested in research. I started doing a bunch of it when I was a senior resident. I decided I wanted to try an academic career. At that time it was the Reagan Recession. I went out there in ‘77 and graduated in ‘80. That’s when the recession really formed, ‘84, ‘83. The worst recession until this most recent one. Everybody was laying off assistant professors, no one was hiring them. One of my advisors there said, “Are you interested in alcohol and drug abuse?” I said, “Oh sure. I’m very interested.” 
AS: Did you participate in the…?
MW: No comment. I was never a hard-core druggie. We all smoked pot.
AS: More experimental? More social?
MW: I liked pot. We drank and partied a lot. 
AS: But it wasn’t a problem for you?
MW: No.
AS: Did you have friends who it was a problem?
MW: A couple of people whose drug use got heavy but they never ended up in trouble for it. I think they got over it when they grew up. This was 1980 California. It was on the cusp of the cocaine epidemic. 
AS: So he asks you…
MW: If I was interested and I said, “Sure. Why?” I hadn’t ever thought about doing anything in that field. I wanted to do therapy research. At that time the National Institutes on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse were offering what was called a Career Teacher Grant. They would pay your salary for three years as a faculty teacher in medical school if you agreed to develop curriculum on alcohol and drug abuse. They were trying to get more education to medical schools. 
AS: What was it called?
MW: Career Teacher Award. I applied to that from Davis. First of all, by virtue of my applying for it the resident expert on alcohol and drug abuse. The first thing I learned was it’s really easy to be an expert because no one knows anything. 
AS: This is a moment where they’re creating a program on alcohol and drug abuse within a medical school, is that right?
MW: Curriculum.
AS: Was it based on twelve step thinking or was it based in science and research?
MW: This was funded by the research institutes. Things were very different there but it was based on the current scientific research. It was just emerging. 
AS: I guess that’s what I’m getting at. 
MW: It was academically based. The process went well and I would have gotten the award. However, the previous chair who was chair when I went there had built the program on something of a house of cards counting money with an agreement for the department to provide care at all these community mental health centers. The county rescinded that contract and the department was almost entirely dependent on it. He left and there was somebody put in place. All of my mentors were getting canned. All the people I didn’t respect were taking power. The department was undergoing a terrible shrinkage. I could see dark times ahead. I left and they were very unhappy with me for leaving after they supported me with a grant. It turns out they went through ten years really dark. They’re doing well now but it was really bad. 
In the meantime, I was looking at other things. I was accepted for a fellowship in therapy research, one of the preeminent psychotherapy researchers in the country, at UCSF. I can’t tell you how badly I wanted to do that. I always wanted to live in San Francisco. That’s what I wanted to do. It paid sixteen thousand dollars a year. Even in 1980 in San Francisco that wasn’t very much money. My wife Katie was pregnant. I have to say leaving San Francisco and turning that down was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. 
I’d applied at various other places. There was an interdisciplinary fellowship at UW Madison. Another interdisciplinary thing. This was even more interesting, an anthropologist, a lawyer, an advanced practice nurse, psychologist, social work. Very diverse. Katie wanted to be closer to her mom as most young mothers want to be. They were in St. Paul. Madison was kind of the perfect distance. 
The funny thing that happened is when they asked me what I’d been doing I told them I’d written this grant proposal. One of the main guys in the program there said, “Would you be willing to do that here?” What he wanted to do was support me with the fellowship for two years and in the meantime cultivate a faculty position for me. Part of it was because he was really interested in alcohol and drug abuse too. He wanted to see more of that taught. That only paid about the same amount of money but he supplemented my income by making me medical director of the county detox. The mental health center there, which was very closely tied in with the department, had just taken over the contract to provide county detox services. All these kind of serendipitous things. We moved to Madison. When I got there everybody said, “Oh you’re the alcohol guy.” I said, “That’s an interest but I’m also really interested in psychotherapy research.” After about four months I said, “Oh yeah. I am.” I developed curriculum on alcohol and drug abuse but my best education was at the county detox center. 
AS: Because you could see it and you talked to people. Is that where you got to talk to people?
MW: Yes, but you saw the same people everyday, day after day after day. It really shaped the rest of my career. I really got to understand these guys, some women but mostly men. When they were turning forty they’d be, “I’m reviewing my life and wondering what I want to do with the rest of it. What have I accomplished so far?” They all had very conventional dreams, a house, two cars in the driveway, two kids and a dog. The whole catastrophe. I learned so much from them. This is important from the standpoint of how I ended up doing what I’m doing. I was fresh out of residency. I had all the new stuff. Naturally I concluded the trouble with these guys is they just haven’t been exposed to the right treatment. I’m here now. They’d been through this countless times with fresh young professionals. They were gentle on me. They let me down easily. Some of them even got better for a while so I wouldn’t feel so bad. But after six months they couldn’t hold it. I remember the day I was walking to a bus from the detox center. It was winter with a couple of inches of snow on the ground. I thought, “I’m not doing anything for these guys. I can get a different job or I can figure out how to approach this.” 
What do doctors treat in general? Chronic illness. That’s what we treat. We treat degenerative back disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer. That’s the bread and butter. Multiple sclerosis, all of these incurable diseases. Right? That’s what doctors do. We treat incurable diseases by and large. Even surgeons do. Maybe the surgery is a specific thing but it’s almost always for some sort of chronic illness. Acute appendicitis is different. 
AS: There’s the emergency things.
MW: Other than that we’re not curing very many people. Well what do they do? They slow the rate the deterioration. They try to achieve remission if possible or get the best response possible if they can’t achieve remission. They try to keep people in remission. They try to minimize the frequency, severity, and length of recurrences. They treat complications. They support the family and the patient. Can I do that?
AS: With this population?
MW: With drug and alcohol abuse. Yes. Sure. I can do that. That was an absolutely crucial point, the rest of my career has been based on that. 
AS: Do you remember when this was? In the 80s in Madison?
MW: This would have been late ‘80 or early ‘81. I’ve adopted this chronic illness management approach for my entire career. That has really formed the basis of everything I’ve done. They were really into case management so I really became an expert on case management. What that is and what it’s not. It’s really coordination of care. Another way to conceptualize that is even if you can’t treat the disease you can always treat the patient. I finished the fellowship in ‘82. Still looking for a faculty job, still a recession. Madison didn’t have a spot for me. There really wasn’t anything acceptable in the Madison area. I naturally looked up here. 
There was a brand-new chair at the U whose charge was to really bring it up to date. To make a much more modern, scientifically based department. Her name was Paula Clayton. She didn’t have a position but she had just hired a new chief of psychiatry at the VA, which had never been an academic place to turn that department into an academic department. The Minneapolis VA is probably the best VA in the country. It operates more like a small medical school itself. It looks, feels, and acts like a university hospital. The faculty are virtually all full time which is not typical. They have kept their identity from the University separate for that reason. Usually what universities will do is they’ll put people on five eighths VA, four eighths university. The VA doesn’t get five eighths. They just basically suck from the VA. That’s not true here. When they built the new hospital here they could have built it on campus but they didn’t. That was the reason. They had a job for me at the VA. In guess what?
AS: Alcohol and drug abuse.
MW: That’s right. There I was. I was the first faculty member hired under this new mandate to become an academic department. When I got there, there was nothing. There was no psychiatry research. My mentors were people in neuro-endocrinology. 
AS: Here you are again the only guy and the expert. By now you’ve had some experience.
MW: By now I was an expert. I’d been teaching at Madison. I’d read a lot and learned a lot. I got a job. Here’s another serendipitous thing. While I’m negotiating with the people up here and looking at taking the job at the Minneapolis VA one of the guys at Madison who was an expert in psychopharmacology was reviewing a VA grant application. It was to see if treating alcohol dependence with lithium is effective with or without depression. VA does a co-op space with many, many sites across the country. The big studies, very well done, there’s a co-op center to make sure the methodologies are coordinated. Lots and lots of important research is from the VA. He came to me and he said, “Do you know anything about lithium and alcohol?” I said, “Why do you ask?” He said, “I’m reviewing this VA cooperative grant thing.” “Well there’s a couple of small studies that support it but it’s never really been known for sure.” I found out who the PI was, he was in Chicago by the name of Walter Doris. I called the chief of alcohol and drug abuse over at the VA and said, “Are you interested in participating in this study?” He said, “Sure.” I called Walter Doris and said, “Are you interested in another site?” He said, “We don’t have anybody up in Minneapolis.” “I’m going there and I’d love to be a site investigator.” He said, “We need this kind of information from the program.” They provided that. Lo and behold I arrive at the Minneapolis VA with a VA grant. The chief of research there at that time said, “How did this happen? This doesn’t happen.” 
That gave me support for four years. That totally launched my career. I published some papers out of that. Then the other thing was it was a yearlong study. We followed people for a year, which was very unusual. Most studies are three or four months. We studied people for a year. I got to track along with these alcohol dependent volunteers in the research study for a full year. I learned about the natural history of alcohol dependence and how recovery went and didn’t go. Most people at that time only saw what they saw in rehab. We can’t learn anything about natural history in rehab. 
AS: Because it’s a closed environment?
MW: And it’s only thirty days long. They had a methadone program there.
AS: Is that the first time you worked with opioid addiction?
MW: Yes. I clawed my way up. At that time the VA was a wonderful place to work. You got lots of autonomy and different ways to get money that weren’t available at the university. I rose through the ranks. I became the first psychiatrist to become an assistant professor and go to full professor while at that VA. I was the pioneer. Now they’ve got a robust program mostly with psychologists but with some psychiatrists. I was the pioneer that got the whole thing started. I eventually ended up at the national level. I was the co-editor of the first clinical practice guideline for the alcohol and drug and substance disorders for the VA. Towards the end of my time there I was the clinical coordinator for a huge effort to implement evidence-based practices. I really became sort of the most prominent addiction psychiatrists for the VA. I ran the methadone program for fifteen years. 
While I was there there was a very, very important thing that occurred about learning about opioid addiction. Almost all of the guys at this time were Vietnam vets who got addicted in Vietnam. There was this one guy in particular, just a sweetheart. Just a really sweet, nice guy. The practice when I got there was they maintained people for two years. If they were doing well they’d taper them off. That was practiced a lot of places at that time. This guy was doing very well. He got married, he was employed, he was doing well. They said, “It’s been two years, let’s taper you off and see how you do.” He didn’t make it through the full detox before he had a recurrence. He lost everything he’d gained in six months. He came back and started the program again. He restabilized nicely, rebuilt everything. Two years later, “It’s been two years. Let’s give this a try.” Same thing happened. Didn’t make through the withdrawal, went through the entire detox period, had a recurrence, lost everything in six months. He came back and by that time I was the director of the program. When he came back that time I said, “Let’s stop doing this.” That’s when I learned. At that time there was more evidence starting to accrue that for most people maintenance had to be lifelong or what I would say is indefinite. 
I also at that time really got into pain. I didn’t want to do that. The internal medicine folks, orthopedic folks, physical medicine folks had patients who were opioids for chronic pain that were problematic and didn’t know what to do. Most of them were giving out Percocet. They didn’t know what to do.
AS: Most doctors?
MW: Yes. Nobody’s taught anything about how to do pain management. Maybe they are now. 
AS: What year was the pain stuff?
MW: That was probably in the early 90s. 
AS: When prescription pain pills became…
MW: Before that. 
AS: So early 90s. 
MW: The prescription pain pills started in about ‘98.
AS: When doctors are noticing problems.
MW: There was conflict with the patients often. They would be frequently running out. 
AS: People hadn’t put their finger on that yet necessarily. 
MW: It was problematic. They didn’t know how to deal with it. They refer him to me for a number of reasons. I’m much more of a physical medicine doctor for a psychiatrist. I was an ER doctor. Then in the VA psychiatrists do a lot of physical hands on medicine much more than the private sector. We did our own physicals. I kept up to date. Also, because I knew about opioids because of working with opioid addicted people and the methadone people and things like that. I just really like complex chronic disorders. That’s always been my focus until now. Although it’s still partly a focus. I was like, “Well I’ll give it a try.” I knew more than anybody else I guess. 
Turns out a lot of these folks have poorly treated or undiagnosed mental illnesses. A lot of them have personality disorders. They also had really severe chronic pain disorders. Sometimes they had brain injuries. They were an extremely complicated group of people. We developed a very successful program for managing them. They’d come in once a month; I’d work with a nurse. They’d come in as a group. It was a group appointment. Before they came we would write the prescriptions and she’d collect them from the pharmacy. She’d have them there. They didn’t have to go wait in line at the pharmacy. Like the Salvation Army we would bring in people to talk about exercise or nutrition or self-care or whatever. Naturally what happens is they start to talk to each other and they find out they’re not the only one. That’s one of the most difficult things for people with chronic pain. They don’t know anyone else who has that disorder. It’s really isolating. They benefited from it. I was able to stabilize a lot of people who otherwise weren’t. Their function improved and so forth.
AS: They were still able to keep their pain prescription?
MW: Yes. As one patient puts it, I’m strict but fair. I make my expectations explicit. 
AS: About how to stay in this program?
MW: About what my rules are and what happens if you don’t follow those rules. I follow through. I never make threats. People like that. They like that structure. They like the predictability. All they need is to feel like they’re treated fairly and they’re understood. That’s the most important thing with chronic pain patients. I learned a lot about chronic pain and opioids. I served on a national taskforce that involved clinical practice guidelines for treating chronic pain with opioids. I interacted with a lot of pain experts. 
Differentiating addiction from physiological dependence in the context of chronic pain is very tricky. Unfortunately, people with chronic pain who are appropriately taking opiates as prescribed who are benefitting are often labelled as being opioid dependent. There’s a pathological diagnosis of using opioids inappropriately. I devise ways of really teaching that to others. Addiction is drug use that causes clinically significant impairment or distress. That’s the threshold criteria. Another way to think of it short hand is addiction is compulsive, out of control, destructive drug use. If you’re wondering if someone who is being treated with opiates for chronic pain is addicted all you have to do is ask yourself are they better with the pain medication or are they worse with it? If it’s better they’re not addicted. People continue to confuse the fact that you have a physical withdrawal when you stop suddenly with addiction. 
AS: There’s so many drugs that cause symptoms.
MW: Try stopping Effexor suddenly or Zoloft or Celexa. It’s really miserable. That’s why I don’t call it withdrawal anymore. I call it discontinuation symptoms. I never use the word detox ever. It’s withdrawal.
AS: And withdrawal is a discontinuation symptom. 
MW: If I treat it I call it withdrawal management. I don’t call it detox. They’re not toxic. 
AS: The words we use, let’s talk about stigma for a minute. 
MW: Let me give you the list of words I never use.
AS: You never use addict. 
MW: Alcoholic, alcoholism, enabling, co-dependency, relapse, of all things recidivist. People will call relapse or recurrences in addiction recidivists.
AS: That’s a criminal name. 
MW: What I ask people is do you call someone who keeps getting hospitalized for diabetes a recidivist? No. Let’s see. Denial, unmotivated.
AS: Shame?
MW: We’ll talk about feeling shame. They all feel ashamed. Selfish.
AS: Self-centered.
MW: Right. Irresponsible, immoral. There’re other things that I don’t use that are concepts that are thrown around that are completely wrong. Addictive personality. There’s no such thing as an addictive personality. That’s total fiction. The thing you have to understand about the twelve-step approach to alcohol use disorder is they define everything about you in terms of your addiction to alcohol even twenty years after you stop using alcohol. That’s addict thinking. Everything is attributed. You become your disease. The alcoholic. The person with an alcoholic use disorder. A recurrence of illness.
AS: Instead of a relapse.
MW: A use episode instead of a slip. Language is extraordinarily important. 
AS: Did you find in Minnesota being this center of twelve-step treatment programs…
MW: We have the Vatican here. 
AS: You call it the Vatican. 
MW: It’s a little Vatican.
AS: I’ve had people call it the holy land. 
MW: Twelve-step is the state religion. 
AS: I’m glad I can quote you on all this. Earlier you talked about gathering people with chronic pain and then realizing that they weren’t alone. Some of the power in the twelve-step environment that it creates is people can get together and start to understand themselves. Do you see value in that aspect of it? Do you have thoughts about the community that it creates for people?
MW: Some people do find that helpful. For some people it’s harmful. One of the things we do with our Suboxone patients here is we offer them a choice between seeing a doctor privately for their appointments or we have a group medication appointment. 
AS: So you’re doing the same thing that you started. You’re treating them as people with a medical condition who could benefit from getting to know other people with that same condition.
MW: That is an effect of it. That’s not actually the reason for doing it. One is time. It saves me or another doctor a lot of time. 
AS: You don’t have to keep repeating yourself.
MW: It’s not so much that as fewer appointments. If you have five or six people that would take care of an hour. They appreciate it too and then we charge less. The main reason for doing it was it makes it more affordable. I’m ridiculously cheap. We’re ridiculously cheap here. 
AS: I think I heard you don’t accept insurance.
MW: We don’t.
AS: Why is that?
MW: There’s several reasons. First of all, Alltyr Clinic is a demonstration clinic. The broader mission of Alltyr is transforming addiction treatment. The business strategy was that whenever you brought this up people would say what’s the alternative to rehab? 
AS: You made one.
MW: Someone had to make one or nobody would believe it. This is a demonstration clinic. This demonstrates how to do twenty first century, scientifically based, professional outpatient addiction treatment. What’s the rehab alternative? Alltyr is the rehab alternative. 
AS: It’s different than outpatient?
MW: Completely.
AS: Or intensive IOP?
MW: Yes. There’s no such thing as residential treatment. 
AS: Where?
MW: Anywhere. It’s not a thing. 
AS: What is it?
MW: It’s an IOP in a house. Spending twenty-four seven together for all the mythology about it, stuff occurs and the conversations at night is all bullshit. Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago it was proven in a randomized control trial that keeping them all together in a house had no outcome effect. In 1977 the first randomized control trial done in England proved that intensive multimodal treatment has no benefit over less intensive things one year later. There’s no evidence that an IOP whether it’s in a house or freestanding is an effective treatment. There’s a mountain of evidence that it’s not. Just think about it. A burst of intensive counseling in psychoeducation. I hate the term psychoeducation.
AS: What does that mean?
MW: It’s just education. They call it psychoeducation to make it sound like it’s a treatment. 
AS: I’ve never heard of that in all my reading. Who calls it that? The treatment centers?
MW: Everyone. Not just in addiction treatment, also in mental health treatment. 
AS: I can think of some other ways to say that. 
MW: How is that different from education? 
AS: It’s all going into our brain.
MW: It helps you understand how rehab started and what the intention was. The original idea was there’s a week of stabilization and withdrawal management. Getting your head about you and a couple good meals in you. There’s two weeks of education about, in this case, alcoholism as it is. An introduction to the twelve steps. You incorporate the first five steps of AA. The fourth week is discharge. It was always conceptualized as an introduction to AA. 
AS: To get you into the program. 
MW: That’s where the action was. It was in AA. The idea that rehab itself would actually do something was never actually the intention, other than get you engaged in AA. 
AS: From your perspective, how has this worked with people addicted to heroin and opioids?
MW: It doesn’t. We know it doesn’t. There’s no evidence. There’s not one single high quality study that proves effectiveness of an abstinence-based approach to heroin addiction worldwide. Not one. There’s like truckloads, there’s boxcars full of research that have proven that the only effective treatment is indefinite maintenance with morphine or methadone. That is a settled matter. We don’t need any more evidence on it. It’s not scientifically controversial. They’re about equally effective. We don’t need any more studies about that either. You don’t need more than minimal counselling, once a month, on top of the medication. Adding more counseling doesn’t improve outcomes. That’s a settled fact.
AS: Unless the person wants it for other aspects of their life, right?
MW: If they’re treating anxiety disorder or depression or post-traumatic stress of course. 
AS: That’s separate. 
MW: You’re not treating drug addiction. Think of the idea that it’s called medication assisted treatment. Why do you think that is?
AS: Because it’s medication based.
MW: Why is it called medication assisted treatment? Do we call diabetes medication assisted treatment?
AS: No. So this is where you get back to we call it treatment. 
MW: I’ll get to harm reduction. There’s an assumption if the real meat of it is counseling.
AS: Right, because it’s assisted. 
MW: If anything it should be called counseling assisted medication. Why call it that? Why not call it treatment? Most treatment now is multi-disciplinary.
AS: It’s like cancer treatment. 
MW: Cancer, heart failure. It requires a team.
AS: It’s back to the chronic illness model that you’re talking about. 
MW: Absolutely. Why don’t we call diabetes treatment harm reduction? All you’re doing with diabetes treatment is slowing the rate of deterioration. If that ain’t harm reduction I don’t know what is. Harm reduction is a great term for a national drug control policy. That’s where it was first used. It’s still only appropriate for that as a policy. It’s in contrast to the drug war. Harm reduction is a pragmatic policy that seeks to balance the harms of drug use against the harms of policy and minimize the overall harm to society. The drug war is an idealistic approach where the intention is viewed as more important than the result. It’s like preaching sexual abstinence to teenagers. That you should do that because it’s the right thing to do even though it increases teen pregnancies. It’s very much the same approach. Cost be damned, damage to lives be damned. It doesn’t matter. What’s really important to understanding the drug war is that it’s never been about drugs. People keep saying it doesn’t work so why do we keep doing it? It works politically. The job of the legislature is to keep their jobs to get reelected. It’s worked wonderfully for that. It’s also served as a very nice bridge between the Cold War and the War on Terror. 
AS: And it incarcerated millions…
MW: Of disenfranchised blacks. The drug war has always been intensely focused on blacks right from the start. It’s explicitly racist. You find it interesting that heroin was primarily a problem with middle aged black people the response was prison. 
AS: Now it’s young white men.
MW: It’s treatment. 
AS: The contrast of the trial that’s happening as we speak is five young, suburban, white males and the black female drug dealer from North Minneapolis is being charged with murder. If you switched it, if they had been selling her the drugs nobody would be on trial. Or if it was five young black men I don’t think the state would bring it against her. We’re at a really interesting moment in how the focus has shifted on heroin. 
MW: Harm reduction has no place when you’re talking about clinical care. I hope most of us are not doing harm reduction clinically. We do a lot more of that than anybody realizes. That’s not the goal. We primarily provide palliative care simply meaning non-curative care. It’s unfortunate that that term has come to mean end of life care. It’s not. It’s just chronic illness management. The use of the term harm reduction when it applies to clinical care plays into the twelve-step approach. They see harm reduction as giving up on the person. The twelve-step approach is idealistic. They explicitly teach and believe in AA. If you do the program it will work. Period. It’s one hundred percent effective if you do what you’re told. Rehabs do a double dirty because ninety percent or more of their graduates are going to have recurrences. Can you think of any other industry except maybe the military industrial that has been so successful at blaming their customers when their stinking product fails? It’s astonishing. Every hospital has all these quality measures. Primary care doctors are being rated on their treatment of diabetes and depression and asthma and heart failure. Rehabs have no accountability for outcomes at all, none. 
AS: We blame it on the addict.
MW: Guess who’s really at fault here and really complicit? The state regulatory agencies. These are licensed facilities that are allowed to lie to people. They deprive them of informed consent.
AS: How so? When they walk in the door? There’s a seventy percent chance you’re going to…
MW: A heroin addict walks into a twelve-step rehab. “Suboxone, methadone that’s just substituting one addiction for another. It means you’re not really sober or in recovery. We not only don’t do that here; we will take you off of it if you’re taking it. If you do a twelve-step program it will work.” That’s a lie. 
AS: That’s the informed consent you’re talking about? 
MW: What informed consent would be...Here we do something called Minnesota Model or twelve-step rehab. This is what we believe in and we believe it works. However, the evidence shows it doesn’t. There’s no evidence it works. There’s this other treatment that has a seventy percent chance of having you in recovery. We don’t believe in it. That’s informed consent. If you go to an oncologist, when I’m teaching doctors about this, the oncologist knows of a chemotherapy that has a seventy percent chance of putting you in remission but doesn’t tell you about it because she doesn’t believe in it. She prescribes a macrobiotic diet and yoga and your cancer progresses. What would you call that? Malpractice. How long would that doctor be in practice before her license was pulled? About two days. That’s what they do in rehabs. That’s what they’re allowed to do in rehabs. Lie to people. Not only by omission but outright lie to people about what the facts are. The state licensing agencies are totally silent.
AS: Why is that?
MW: It’s all the same crowd. The licensing agencies are filled with people in recovery typically. 
AS: Who served on those…
MW: Here at the Alcohol and Drug Agency there are licensed professionals every one of them. The state is basically sanctioning deprivation of informed consent. If anybody wants to do twelve-step rehab after being told what the steps are that’s their decision. I’m not talking about imposing anything on the individual. Informed consent means you provide the information a reasonable person would want to know to make an informed decision. I have people come here and they’ve been through six rehabs. This is more with alcohol. 
AS: I’ve heard of many more even with opioids. 
MW: With opioids, people who are addicted to opioids know about Suboxone and methadone. 
AS: They do but they also feel a lot of pressure from people to not be on them. Especially if they are working a twelve-step program and they are on medication. They’re not allowed to talk about it. 
MW: Tom Price the new head of HHS just came out and said...did you see that? 
AS: Unbelievable.
MW: I’m waiting for, I don’t know who it would be, the Earth is actually flat. Not only is there no climate change caused by humans but it’s also flat. Not only that but the sun revolves around the Earth. 
AS: We should wrap up, it’s 11:50. 
MW: I know that. We haven’t gotten to a lot of my most important stuff yet. Can we do this again?
AS: I would love that. 
MW: In terms of the treatment, we haven’t gotten to the treatment. My view of the evolution.
AS: Let’s do that. I’ll make an appointment.
MW: Actually, email Amanda. 
AS: Thank you. I’ll stop the recording now.
MW: Harm reduction when it’s applied to clinical care is an inappropriate treatment. It plays into the twelve-step idea that you’re giving up on people. You’re setting a goal less than full remission. 
AS: What kind of things do you consider harm reduction?
MW: I wouldn’t even call them harm reduction. I would say at the national level you might describe a drug policy that way. We’re talking about ordinary public health policies. 
AS: Needle exchange and Narcan are under the umbrella of harm reduction.
MW: I wouldn’t call that harm reduction.
AS: You think that’s a public health measure.
MW: Those are public health measures. That’s like putting people with TB in sanitariums so they wouldn’t spread it. 
AS: Needle exchange should be seen as just a public health issue. 
MW: Right.
AS: Like giving out condoms for HIV.
MW: You’re playing into it. You’re facilitating the addiction. That’s why you don’t want to call it harm reduction. It’s a public health measure. It’s how we reduce the spread of AIDS. Don’t you want to do that? That’s why I don’t use the term. I hate the term. What they really mean by harm reduction is continuing to stay engaged and treat someone who’s not perfectly well. Treating it like a chronic condition. They call it derisively harm reduction. They believe that if you really tried and they really tried you’d be in remission, which is absurd on its face. 
It took me thirty years to figure it out. This I learned at NIH when I had to talk about a study of treatment with medication. For a variety of reasons researchers use quantitative rather than qualitative outcomes because they have higher statistical power. They use things like percentage of days abstinent or percentage of heavy drinking days or how many drinking days out of thirty. They can use parametric statistics rather than the way I think about outcomes is no response, response. Interestingly enough that’s where the field of depression studies has come to. They don’t look at if the score on something goes up or down. It’s non-response, response without remission, and remission. The goal is remission. 
That’s how I think about outcomes with substance use disorders. The finding on this using this continuous measure was the average on that measure was ten percent less in the drug group compared to the placebo group. The reporters kept asking is ten percent drinking is that meaningful? I’d have to explain it to them, “Your interpretation is incorrect. You’re attributing the mean to every person in that group.” I don’t know if there was even one person there who reduced it ten percent. If you had a whole bunch of people quit it might result in moving the mean ten percent.
AS: It’s also how we look at the data.
MW: How we interpret the outcomes. This is an extremely common mistake people make of attributing the mean value to every member of the group. Basically, if you have group one and two there’s a distribution along the variables and its mean is here. There’s another distribution line here and its mean is here. There’s a lot of overlap but there’s a lot of up here who aren’t here and a lot of people here who aren’t here. It pulls the mean down ten percent. That’s not what typically happened to people in that group.
AS: What would typically happen? That was just the mean.
MW: It could be like this. It could be a bunch of zeros here; it pulls the mean down. This person may have gone up. This person went down like that. A bunch of these people went to zero. Some of them didn’t. That’s what you actually get. 
AS: My humanities brain would say then we should be treating people as individuals.
MW: We are. I would point to a graph on that paper. Figure Two, if you look at Figure Two what you will actually see what happened is more and more people in the drug group achieved recovery than in the placebo group. It wasn’t that the average person reduced it ten percent. It was a bunch of people went to zero, reduced it one hundred percent. There were others that reduced it some and others that didn’t. What I finally figured out what to say about this in terms of what is harm reduction is, “My goal for every patient of mine is full remission. What else would it be?” Sometimes we don’t get there. Sometimes we don’t get there right away and sometimes we don’t get there at all. Maybe they’re better in significant ways. Maybe rather than twenty-five heavy drinking days a month they have eight. Is that any better? Yeah! That’s a lot better! That’s how we track outcomes. We track outcomes by continuous variables, drinking days per month, using days per month. You can see incremental progress on a regression. Right? 
It would be like saying, in diabetes the primary measure is called the A1C level. You want to keep it below seven. That would be like saying, if you’re keeping your A1C below seven ninety percent of the time but ten percent of the time it’s above the treatment’s a total failure and it’s your fault. Let’s say you came to me and you were wheezing and coughing and I diagnosed you with asthma. You were having twenty bad asthma attacks per month and I prescribed some inhalers. In six months, you were only having three asthma attacks a month. Would you consider that progress? Would consider the treatment a total failure and it was your fault? I’m just pointing out these absurdities. People go, “Yeah, what the hell?” 
Here’s another thing that people don’t understand that with all addictions for all but a very few exceptions recovery is achieved through multiple attempts and multiple recurrences. It takes persistent effort over a sustained period of time, sometimes years. The good news being that almost everybody achieves full recovery but not everybody does. When I first started that clinic back in the day this was my first research project. We were able to cut the two-year mortality rate from thirty percent to twenty percent. That’s how sick these people were. One of our mottos here is we don’t just call addiction a disease we treat it like one. Rehab is like sending a diabetic person to a spa for a month then discharging them for support groups and saying whatever you do don’t take medication. God should be enough. Who would have ever thought that very poor quality counseling, pseudo counseling and education for twenty-eight or thirty days would cure a chronic illness. 
AS: Apparently a lot of people. I’ve got to stop.
MW: A couple of other things. We used to treat breast cancer with prayer too. We don’t do that anymore. We shouldn’t be treating addiction with prayer anymore. AA isn’t treatment. It’s a support group. People ask me if AA works. It works for the people it works for. 
AS: Who want to be there. 
MW: Who want to voluntarily affiliate. It’s sort of like asking if Catholicism works. It works for Catholics. People come to me with alcohol dependence and have been to so many rehabs. I start them on medication and they get better right away. They say, “Why did nobody tell me about this?” Tragically I just got a new Suboxone patient. She’d been to multiple rehabs and ended up getting a felony charge and doing time in jail. Nobody had ever recommended Suboxone. I started her on it for the first time. When you see it it’s a miracle. After three days they never think about opioids. They feel normal for the first time they can ever remember. They have energy again, they have motivation, they’re happy. She started crying and said, “Why didn’t somebody tell me about this earlier? I could have avoided a felony charge and jail. How many years did I waste because nobody told me about this?”
AS: It’s criminal.
MW: It is criminal. I’m going to be on NBC Dateline sometime in June. That focuses on alcohol but you’ll hear some of the same things. Look for that.
